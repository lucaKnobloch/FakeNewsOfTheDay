That gives wine lovers plenty of time to develop an appreciation for a certain style of serving that has \u003ca href=\"https://qz.com/quartzy/1348382/chilled-red-wines-how-to-choose-them-cool-them-and-drink-them/\"\u003egained ground\u003c/a\u003e over the past few summers: chilled reds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“At the right temperature, serious red wines, such as a good Bordeaux, can be enjoyable and refreshing,\u0026#8221; says Mary Ewing-Mulligan, a certified \u003ca href=\"https://www.mastersofwine.org/\"\u003eMaster of Wine\u003c/a\u003e and president of the \u003ca href=\"https://internationalwinecenter.com/\"\u003eInternational Wine Center\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIce-cold white, \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/05/25/national-wine-day-how-to-pick-rose/\"\u003erosé\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/longform/english-sparkling-wine/\"\u003esparkling wines\u003c/a\u003e are often regarded as the default wine options during the summer months.

But many casual (and intermediate) wine drinkers might not realize that red wines can be just as refreshing when served at the proper temperature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“The general tendency in our country is to serve red wines at too warm a temperature, and frankly the situation is worsening,\u0026#8221; Ewing-Mulligan says. \u0026#8220;At too warm a temperature, red wines taste clumsy, blousy, and heavy. This is a year-round situation that’s particularly evident in wines purchased by the glass, and it’s all the more an issue in the summertime.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eYear-round, Ewing-Mulligan advises serving a structured red wine—such as red Bordeaux—at 62 to 63 degrees Fahrenheit.  But in the summer, she suggests dropping the temperature down to 60 degrees for a more pleasant experience. This means that the bottle should feel cool to your touch, but not actually cold. At that temperature, Ewing-Mulligan says, the wine will \u0026#8220;show its proper structure and its aromas and flavors should be fresh rather than heavy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you really want your red wine chilled, you can place it in a refrigerator up to 30 minutes before serving, bringing it down closer to a cellar temperature around 55 degrees Fahrenheit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eSuggested Reds for Summer\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Modus.png?w=277\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2679959\" srcset=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Modus.png 541w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Modus.png?resize=81,300 81w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Modus.png?resize=277,1024 277w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Modus.png?resize=57,212 57w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Modus.png?resize=136,503 136w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Modus.png?resize=27,100 27w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Modus.png?resize=16,60 16w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Modus.png?resize=42,156 42w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Modus.png?resize=292,1080 292w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Modus.png?resize=159,588 159w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Modus.png?resize=126,465 126w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Modus.png?resize=90,333 90w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Modus.png?resize=104,385 104w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Modus.png?resize=216,800 216w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Modus.png?resize=33,123 33w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Modus.png?resize=115,425 115w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Modus.png?resize=133,492 133w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Modus.png?resize=140,518 140w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 541px) 100vw, 541px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eRuffino Modus IGT Toscana\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"image-credit\"\u003eRuffino Wine \u0026#038; Vineyards\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2016 Ruffino Modus IGT Toscana:\u003c/strong\u003e A blend of three noble grape varieties from the Poggio Casciano estate: Sangiovese (provides refined texture and red fruit aromas), Merlot (expresses smoothness with delicate notes of berries and mint), and Cabernet Sauvignon (lends structure and unites all three varieties with its elegance).

Developed individually by micro-cru in Vérité\u0026#8217;s Sonoma County vineyards, the wine should mature gracefully. \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.wine.com/product/verite-la-joie-2015/514074\"\u003eSRP\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.wine.com/product/verite-la-joie-2015/514074\"\u003e: $410\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eMore must-read stories from \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—Wine drinkers should pay more attention to this \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/10/macon-burgundy-wines/\"\u003elesser-known spot in Burgundy\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—How the bar industry plans to deal with \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/10/bartenders-workplace-harassment/\"\u003eharassment and unruly guests in the workplace\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—Forget wine or tequila: \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/03/sake-celebrity-label-spirits/\"\u003eCelebrities are launching sake brands\u003c/a\u003e now\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—What I learned in \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/10/restaurants-bars-inclusion-training/\"\u003einclusion training at the world\u0026#8217;s top cocktail festival\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—\u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/04/mezcal-industry-cocktails/\"\u003eHas mezcal become too big\u003c/a\u003e for its own good? \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://flipboard.com/@fortune\"\u003eFollow \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e on Flipboard\u003c/a\u003e to stay up-to-date on the latest news and analysis.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://fortune.com/2019/08/10/chilled-red-wine-summer/","published":"2019-08-10T12:00:43Z","guid":"https://fortune.com/?p=2679013"},{"title":"Wine Drinkers Should Pay More Attention to This Lesser-Known Spot in Burgundy","content":"\n\u003cp\u003eAsk a sommelier about Burgundy, and you’ll get an excited response.

For a long time, the region’s winegrowers sold very little wine themselves. Small boutique wineries like Guffens-Heynen, a 1970s pioneer, were rare. Instead growers sold grapes to the local co-operative, which would vinify them and sell them on to large brands. All in all, it’s an approach that favors quantity over quality. “I even know producers who prefer not to put Mâcon on the label because they feel the name has gotten a bad rap for being a bit mass-produced,” Garcia says. That’s changed, and the region today is awash in small, quality-driven producers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sure right now I could name you 50 very good estates in the Mâcon, which was impossible 20 years ago,” says Jean-Philippe Bret. Bret, together with his brother Jean-Guillaume, started making and selling their own estate wines under the La Soufrandière name in 2000. The following year, they began a separate brand, Bret Brothers, using purchased grapes. All of their estate vineyards are in the village of Vinzelles, so the separate brand allows them to explore more widely. Today, Bret Brothers makes about twenty different wines in the Mâcon, most of them grown organically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s not unusual. Mâconnais wines can be exasperating in their variety, with almost 40 different potential sub-regional designations. While some are simply labeled “Mâcon,” wines labeled “Mâcon-Villages” only include grapes from a subset of specific areas. At the next higher tier, a specific village name might be appended; for example, Mâcon-Pierreclos or Mâcon-Vergisson. Finally, some of the region’s most famous wines don’t mention the Mâcon on the label at all; winedrinkers may never realize that St. Véran, Viré-Clessé, and most notably, Pouilly-Fuissé are Mâconnais wines. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“Even in France you can have some confusion between Pouilly-Fuissé and Pouilly-Fumé, so I assume it’s the same in the U.S.,” Bret says. Pouilly-Fumé is in the Loire Valley; not only is it outside the Mâcon, they grow a different grape entirely: Sauvignon Blanc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe understanding behind that diversity is that each village’s vineyards have their own character. The Mâcon is small, spanning about 10 kilometers across and 35 kilometers north-to-south, but the terrain is quite varied. The northern half is rolling hills, with vineyards scattered among patches of forest. In the south, two giant limestone outcroppings, the Roche de Solutré and the Roche de Vergisson, jut almost 500 meters into the air. Vineyards adorn the mountains and hills on every side, unlike in the Côtes d’Or, where only the east side of the hills bears vineyards. Each village’s vineyards, therefore, enjoy different sun exposures and temperatures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWith so many village names and lots of small wineries, it can be hard to know where to start. “In Burgundy, you want to spend time on the producers, otherwise it’s a bit of a crapshoot,” Ganzer says. While the wines of each village should have their own character, some producers might not show it off as well. “It’s better to learn who the best producers are if you want to get a more consistent return on your dollar,” Ganzer says. “That said, I will say that Viré-Clessé from various producers has been over-delivering across the board recently.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Bret-Brothers-Biodynmaic-Chardonay-grapes.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Bret-Brothers-Biodynmaic-Chardonay-grapes\" class=\"wp-image-2678565\" srcset=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Bret-Brothers-Biodynmaic-Chardonay-grapes.jpg 2880w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Bret-Brothers-Biodynmaic-Chardonay-grapes.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Bret-Brothers-Biodynmaic-Chardonay-grapes.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Bret-Brothers-Biodynmaic-Chardonay-grapes.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Bret-Brothers-Biodynmaic-Chardonay-grapes.jpg?resize=1024,683 1024w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Bret-Brothers-Biodynmaic-Chardonay-grapes.jpg?resize=281,187 281w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Bret-Brothers-Biodynmaic-Chardonay-grapes.jpg?resize=755,503 755w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Bret-Brothers-Biodynmaic-Chardonay-grapes.jpg?resize=100,67 100w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Bret-Brothers-Biodynmaic-Chardonay-grapes.jpg?resize=60,40 60w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Bret-Brothers-Biodynmaic-Chardonay-grapes.jpg?resize=154,103 154w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Bret-Brothers-Biodynmaic-Chardonay-grapes.jpg?resize=591,394 591w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Bret-Brothers-Biodynmaic-Chardonay-grapes.jpg?resize=392,261 392w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Bret-Brothers-Biodynmaic-Chardonay-grapes.jpg?resize=252,168 252w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Bret-Brothers-Biodynmaic-Chardonay-grapes.jpg?resize=697,465 697w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Bret-Brothers-Biodynmaic-Chardonay-grapes.jpg?resize=234,156 234w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Bret-Brothers-Biodynmaic-Chardonay-grapes.jpg?resize=500,333 500w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Bret-Brothers-Biodynmaic-Chardonay-grapes.jpg?resize=578,385 578w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Bret-Brothers-Biodynmaic-Chardonay-grapes.jpg?resize=600,400 600w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Bret-Brothers-Biodynmaic-Chardonay-grapes.jpg?resize=90,60 90w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Bret-Brothers-Biodynmaic-Chardonay-grapes.jpg?resize=185,123 185w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Bret-Brothers-Biodynmaic-Chardonay-grapes.jpg?resize=115,77 115w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Bret-Brothers-Biodynmaic-Chardonay-grapes.jpg?resize=738,492 738w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Bret-Brothers-Biodynmaic-Chardonay-grapes.jpg?resize=777,518 777w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2880px) 100vw, 2880px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eChardonnay grapes inside Bret Brother\u0026#8217;s facilities.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"image-credit\"\u003eCourtesy of Bret Brothers\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSkurnik Wines \u0026amp; Spirits, a New York-based wine distributor, imports and distributes several notable Mâcon producers, including Daniel \u0026amp; Julien Barraud, Domaine Frantz Chagnoleau, and Les Héritiers du Comte Lafon. “I think the Mâcon and Chablis are probably the two appellations that produce the greatest Chardonnay anywhere in the world for the money,” says Chief French Officer David Hinkle. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHinkle says that improvements in farming are bringing the wines to a new level of quality, and cooperation between producers is accelerating that process. For example, Frantz Chagnoleau has created a nursery of vines sourced from his own vineyards as well as those of Comte Lafon, Barraud, Olivier Merlin, and others to evaluate which grow best in the region. Participating wineries can then take cuttings for new plantings in the future. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“I think all of these growers together are pooling their brilliance and upgrading their farming and everything they’re doing,” Hinkle says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe rest of Burgundy—and even France—is beginning to notice, too. The Institut National de l’Origine et de la Qualité (INAO), which oversees regional designations for French wine, cheese, and other foodstuffs, is in the process of approving up to 1,000 acres of vineyards as “Premier Cru,” something producers have been pushing for since 2010. Such a designation would acknowledge that Mâcon wines are comparable to top wines from other parts of Burgundy and elsewhere in France. “It will be a classification of the very best parts of Pouilly-Fuissé, Pouilly-Loché, Pouilly-Vinzelles, and St. Véran,” Bret says. “That’s great, because the Mâconnais was the only part of Burgundy where there was no Premier Cru.” Bret expects the designations to be announced in the next two or three years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHere’s hoping it doesn’t go to their heads. For now, “it feels more entrepreneurial down there,” Ganzer says, “The same way it does in Beaujolais. The stakes aren’t as high, they can take more risks, and they can have more fun.

Already licensed in London, Alipay received an electronic money license in Luxembourg in January. Though the company didn’t directly cite Brexit as a reason for the move, many analysts at the time noted that it was likely driven by the U.K.’s expected exit from the bloc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u0026#8220;ManCos\u0026#8221; and taxes\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat\u0026#8217;s lured business to Luxembourg in the Brexit era? The country has its advantages: extensive existing finance infrastructure and tax conditions that are favorable compared to some peers, along with good connections to other transit hubs, a cosmopolitan feel, and English-language schools.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA major draw for asset managers has been the prevalence of Luxembourg’s third-party management companies or “ManCos,” which are regulated special purpose vehicles that enable businesses outside the EU to easily launch Europe-domiciled mirrors of funds managed in other parts of the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to a study by professional services firm PwC, Luxembourg is today home to over 300 ManCos, a number that has increased 4.5% over the last year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough the country has historically been plagued with a reputation for being a tax haven, its standard rate today is broadly in line with—or even higher than—many other European hubs. For example, the combined Luxembourg City corporate tax rate is about 25%—lower than France\u0026#8217;s roughly 33%, but far higher than Ireland\u0026#8217;s standard 12.5% rate. Nonetheless, the Tax Justice Network, a group campaigning for tax transparency, in May published a report putting Luxembourg sixth in a ranking of 64 countries based on the ease of cutting corporate tax bills. Luxembourg\u0026#8217;s No. 6 spot doesn\u0026#8217;t mean its tax rate is the sixth-lowest in the world, but it does suggest that Luxembourg offers more loopholes than other countries for multinational firms trying to keep their tax bills to a minimum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u0026#8216;Bursting at the seams\u0026#8217;\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the country looks to establish itself as a post-Brexit hub, it does face come constraints. One is the end of banking secrecy laws that underpinned much of its finance industry in the wake of the LuxLeaks revelations. New laws that went into effect in 2017 have made it easier for authorities to identify illicit cash flows and tax evasion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCritics have said those changes might dent Luxembourg\u0026#8217;s appeal, but government officials argue that tightening regulations and conforming to international standards will only bolster the country\u0026#8217;s place in the global financial landscape in the long run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNicolas Mackel, head of Luxembourg for Finance, the country’s agency for the development of the industry, argues that the shift has increased Luxembourg’s credibility as a finance center for major companies and made its finance industry more stable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As a financial institution looking to relocate, you simply go where it makes sense to go,” says Mackel. “Luxembourg is a real hub for stability and that\u0026#8217;s what businesses value.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuxembourg City\u0026#8217;s size is another barrier to consider.

If the trouble was complicated, and especially if George sounded panicky, he probably reached a real person, like knowledgeable longtime Butterball employee Marge Klindera. On the other hand, with a quick and easy problem, a complex system of algorithms might have connected him instead to a recording of Marge\u0026#8217;s voice, programmed to recognize and respond to hundreds of common turkey-related phrases. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eChances are, George didn\u0026#8217;t know (or care) which was speaking to him, as long as he got exactly what he was after, fast and hassle-free. That\u0026#8217;s what customers want, too. \u0026#8220;There\u0026#8217;s no part of business where virtual agents and humans can work together better than in helping customers,\u0026#8221; writes P.V. Kamman in a fascinating new book, \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.amplifypublishing.com/product/the-age-of-intent-using-a-i-to-deliver-a-superior-customer-experience/\"\u003eThe Age of Intent: Using Artificial Intelligence to Deliver a Superior Customer Experience\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e (with Josh Bernoff). \u0026#8220;Bots are fast and accurate. People are empathetic and have judgment. Together they\u0026#8217;ve got what it takes to deliver the best customer service possible,\u0026#8221; he writes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn these pages, Kamman, who is CEO of San Jose-based consulting and software firm [24]7.ai, delves into how dozens of companies, from \u003ca href=\"http://content.fortune.com/fortune500/avis-budget-group-330/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAvis\u003c/a\u003e to Xantera, are using artificial intelligence to delight   new customers and keep old ones coming back. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eLetting bots or other virtual customer service representatives (CSRs) handle routine queries, while directing trickier challenges to humans, can cut costs. Dish Network says that for every minute, on average, it can shave off customer phone calls with humans, the company can save $2 million per year. Customers initiate about 6 million chats per year, and the virtual CSRs slash \u0026#8220;tens of millions of dollars\u0026#8221; annually from Dish\u0026#8217;s CRM budget. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut the far larger point is that companies that deploy A.I. to make sales and service quicker, more accurate, and more fun will soon lay claim to the same kind of huge competitive advantage that early adopters of the Internet enjoyed 20-odd years ago, according to Kamman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, smart machines will \u0026#8220;change the work of non-machines—also known as \u0026#8216;human beings,'\u0026#8221; writes \u003cem\u003eThe World Is\u003c/em\u003e \u003cem\u003eFlat\u003c/em\u003e author Thomas Friedman in this book\u0026#8217;s foreword. \u0026#8220;They will need more empathy and more granular knowledge\u0026#8230; [and] their job will be to tweak the virtual agents to make them smarter.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Age of Intent\u003c/em\u003e is fun to read, sprinkled with cautionary tales of A.I. experiments gone awry. A hilarious verbatim transcript of a long, fruitless online dialogue between co-author Josh Bernoff and a chatbot on \u003ca href=\"http://content.fortune.com/fortune500/expedia-385/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eExpedia\u003c/a\u003e ends with an exasperated Bernoff typing, \u0026#8220;You\u0026#8217;re pretty stupid.\u0026#8221; The bot responds by repeating the same inane question it had already asked twice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMost of the \u003cem\u003eThe Age of Intent\u003c/em\u003e, though, focuses on what\u0026#8217;s working well so far,  and why. To go back to Dish Network for a moment, consider how the company\u0026#8217;s DiVA system, which culls routine queries from thornier ones, helps human customer service agents do their jobs better and faster. \u0026#8220;Even after DiVA kicks a chat out to an agent, it continues running in the background,\u0026#8221; Kamman writes, \u0026#8220;where it shares with the agent what already happened, what it believes the customer\u0026#8217;s problem is, and what might be the best way to help her.\u0026#8221; The collaboration makes the human reps happier, he adds, because it takes the drudgery out of the job and lets them put their skills to work on the tasks that \u0026#8220;require a bit more care and empathy.\u0026#8221; \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eDiVA is similar to systems at other companies around the world where A.I. is collaborating with human CSRs. At KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, for instance, algorithms have been programmed to recognize words and phrases from about 60,000 customer chats. Constantly learning from those interactions in real time, while also sifting through oceans of internal data, the system then offers suggestions to the human agent, who can quickly apply the relevant knowledge to the customer\u0026#8217;s question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat kind of teamwork \u0026#8220;demands a system smart enough to connect to all the company\u0026#8217;s databases, one that answers questions on weekends and holidays, scales up to meet demand, and supports human agents,\u0026#8221; Kamman notes. As you\u0026#8217;d expect, building that capability is no day at the beach. \u003cem\u003eThe Age of Intent\u003c/em\u003e takes a thoughtful look at the complexities involved — not only the technical nuts and bolts, like putting the right digital infrastructure in place, but doing what it takes to get the human side humming along too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHow, for example, do you persuade your human CSRs to start taking, and even welcoming, advice from machines? Thanks to all the recent hype about automation taking people\u0026#8217;s jobs (mostly exaggerated, but that\u0026#8217;s another story), it\u0026#8217;s essential to stress from the outset that smart systems are intended to assist human agents, not replace them. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, Kamman suggests, \u0026#8220;Navigate politics carefully.\u0026#8221; It\u0026#8217;s pretty obvious that a company\u0026#8217;s CIO and customer-service (and sometimes sales) leaders will have to be on board. But don\u0026#8217;t overlook the head of product development, the CMO, the COO, and the chief of human resources, all of whose turfs will be trod upon in one way or another. With so many cooks in the kitchen, \u0026#8220;there are many potential people who can say no,\u0026#8221; Kamman writes. But \u0026#8220;unless they\u0026#8217;re all allied behind the decision, it\u0026#8217;s unlikely to get off the ground.\u0026#8221;  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBusinesses ready to forge ahead might bear in mind three insights from restaurant chain TGI Fridays\u0026#8217; experience.

Now, before anyone goes over-thinking this, it doesn\u0026#8217;t necessarily mean our Game of the Week pick is the highest scoring game in a review, the game with the best graphics, or really any other quantifiable \u0026#8220;best\" thing. Instead, it\u0026#8217;s more just us picking out the single game out of the week\u0026#8217;s releases that we think is the most noteworthy, surprising, interesting, or really any other hard to describe quality that makes it worth having if you were just going to pick up \u003cem\u003eone\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese picks might be controversial, and that\u0026#8217;s OK.

But I just don\u0026#8217;t really play PC games, and even when it was ported to consoles I very rarely play there anymore either. Heck, the game has been on the Nintendo Switch for almost a year, a platform I DO play almost daily, but I have such a massive backlog poor \u003cem\u003eRogue Legacy\u003c/em\u003e has been sitting on my eShop Wish List for that entire time. Once again, as has been the case with many other games, it took \u003cem\u003eRogue Legacy\u003c/em\u003e coming to mobile for me to finally give it the time it deserves. And just as it was with \u003cem\u003eHyper Light Drifter\u003c/em\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2019/07/26/toucharcade-game-of-the-week-hyper-light-drifter/\"\u003ea couple of weeks ago\u003c/a\u003e, I\u0026#8217;m asking myself \u0026#8220;Why the HECK didn’t I play this game sooner!?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/626x0w-12.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"462\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-256760\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/626x0w-12.jpg 1000w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/626x0w-12-300x139.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/626x0w-12-768x355.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeing as how \u003cem\u003eRogue Legacy\u003c/em\u003e launched on desktop way back in 2013 you might be familiar with it already, but just in case, here\u0026#8217;s a refresher. In the game you\u0026#8217;ll be exploring a randomly generated castle room by room, taking out enemies and collecting coins and loot as you go. Your ultimate goal is to battle the mid-bosses and then a final boss, thus conquering the castle and beating the game. But you don\u0026#8217;t really \u0026#8220;beat\" \u003cem\u003eRogue Legacy\u003c/em\u003e, as even if you\u0026#8217;re able to accomplish that task, the game begins again as a New Game+, and if you beat that a New Game+2, and then New Game+3, New Game+4, and on and on she goes. But like… you\u0026#8217;re not going to beat it, not on your first try anyway. Probably not on your tenth either, or on your fiftieth. You are going to die in \u003cem\u003eRogue Legacy\u003c/em\u003e over and over and over and over again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that\u0026#8217;s ok! That is pretty much the point of the game. When your character dies, you\u0026#8217;ll start again with an \u0026#8220;heir\" of your choosing, each with unique traits and characteristics. That heir also inherits the gold you earned in your previous run, and that can go towards upgrading an extensive skill tree that\u0026#8217;s represented by a castle you build. You can also unlock a Blacksmith that can forge you awesome new gear, an Enchantress that can utilize runes to give you enhanced abilities, and an Architect who can lock a particular castle\u0026#8217;s layout (for a price) so that on your next playthrough you\u0026#8217;ll be able to play the same castle you just died in. These permanent progressions are the real brilliance in \u003cem\u003eRogue Legacy\u003c/em\u003e as even on the lamest run you\u0026#8217;re probably making SOME type of progress, and it\u0026#8217;s impossible not to want to immediately hop right back in and take another stab at things. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"clear:both;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"video-responsive\"\u003e\n\t\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XkK07at3ojI\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAltogether that makes \u003cem\u003eRogue Legacy\u003c/em\u003e a very hard game to put down. Its touchscreen controls aren\u0026#8217;t perfect but they do work surprisingly well, and there\u0026#8217;s MFi controller support for those who need the physical touch of a controller. This is also technically the \u0026#8220;Wanderer Edition\" of the game, which means it includes all previous content that was ever released in other versions on other platforms, PLUS a bunch of new stuff exclusive to the mobile game like new traits, new mini-bosses, new room types, and more. It\u0026#8217;s just a complete and total package that\u0026#8217;s infinitely replayable and can be played in the shortest of bursts or in the longest of marathon sessions. Astoundingly, this definitive version of the game is being sold for just 99¢ until August 11th, which I believe is legally considered stealing. After that the price jumps up to $3.99, which is still criminally low for a game of this caliber. What the heck are you waiting for?

If a specific title catches your eye, make sure to check in with your favorite local or online game store in the near future for info on when they'll be getting it in.

He worships me. He does exactly what I tell him. He thinks I’m the greatest.” “Job?” says Satan. “The rich, happy, healthy guy? The guy with 3,000 camels? Of course he does. You’ve given him everything. Take it all away from him, and I bet you he’ll curse you to your face.” And God says, “You’re on.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat—give or take a couple of verses—is how it starts, the Book of Job. What a setup. The Trumplike deity; the shrewd and loitering adversary; the cruelly flippant wager; and the stooge, the cosmic straight man, Job, upon whose oblivious head the sky is about to fall. A classic Old Testament skit, pungent as a piece of absurdist theater or a story by Kafka. Job is going to be \u003ci\u003eimmiserated\u003c/i\u003e, sealed into sorrow—for a bet. What is life? It’s a bleeping and blooping Manichaean casino: You’re up or you’re down, in God’s hands or the devil’s. Piped-in oxygen, controlled light, keep the drinks coming. We, the readers and inheritors of his book, know this. Job, poor bastard, doesn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter his herds have been finished off by marauders and gushes of heavenly fire, and his children have been flattened by falling masonry, and he himself has been covered in running sores from head to toe—after all this happens to the blameless man, he cracks. He sits on an ash heap, seeping and scratching, and reviles the day he was born. “Let that day be darkness,” as the King James Version has it. “Let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it. Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowls of despair are a biblical staple, but Job’s self-curse—the special physics of it, the suicidal pulse that he sends backwards, like a black rainbow, toward the hour of his own conception—is singular. Dispossessed of everything, he is choosing nothing. That first prickle of my existence, the point of light with my name on it? Turn around, All-Fathering One, and eclipse it. \u003ci\u003eDelete\u003c/i\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"left\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Cover of Job, a new translation.\" height=\"274\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/07/CULT_Omniovre_BookCover/f19c6995d.png\" width=\"180\"\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"credit\"\u003eYale University Press\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eEdward L. Greenstein’s new translation of the Book of Job is a work of erudition with—as we shall see—a revolutionary twist. A professor emeritus of Bible studies at Israel’s Bar-Ilan University, Greenstein is not going for the deep-time sonorities of the Authorized Version. His language is lumpy with scholarly fidelity to the text. But the shock of repudiation is undiminished. “Why couldn’t I die after leaving the womb—Just go out the loins and stop breathing?” his Job demands. “For what did knees have to receive me? For what were the breasts that I sucked?” And later: “Why have you made me your target?” This is where we moderns, we dopes marooned in the universe, love Job and find brotherhood with him. Because he’s been in us since the beginning, since the first germ of our separateness from everything else—a man confronting the mystery, as if there was a strand of our DNA in the shape of a question mark: \u003ci\u003eWhy?\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow some friends of Job appear and offer, one after another, the conventional pieties: God is great, Job must have done something wrong, how dare he question the ways of the Lord, etc. They’re hard to take, these friends—Bildad, Eliphaz, and Zophar, droning away. Job rejects their arguments, and it’s here, as the debate goes windily back and forth, that a 21st-century reader reaches for his phone. The stark, existential lines of the drama have gotten spoiled; the Kafka-voltage has dropped.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut then: enter God. “Up speaks YHWH,” as Greenstein puts it, momentarily folksy—a voice “from the windstorm.” “Bind up your loins like a man,” God warns Job, before stamping on the effects pedal and delivering perhaps the most shattering speech ever recorded. Question after question, power chord after power chord: “Where were you when I laid earth’s foundations? … Can you tie the bands of the Pleiades, Or loosen the cords of Orion? … Do you give the horse its bravery?” No explanation; no answer for Job; no moral or theoretical content whatsoever. It’s the interrogation of consciousness by pure Being, by the Logos, by the unstopping, unmediated act of creation itself. Do not try this at home. “Does the falcon take flight through your wisdom, As it spreads its wings toward the south?” The human intellect shrinks before the onslaught. The language is incomparable. God, it turns out, is the greatest poet; no one can touch him.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/01/the-new-testament-a-translation-david-bentley-hart/546551/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: A mind-bending translation of the New Testament\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd it’s at this point, with Job reduced to a pair of smoking sandals and the divine mega-monologue still ringing in the vaults of the firmament, that Greenstein and centuries of tradition diverge. He has produced his new translation of Job, he tells us in the introduction, to “set the record straight.” Every version of the Bible that you have read puts Job, in the wake of God’s speech, in an attitude of awestruck contrition or reconversion. “Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes,” he says in the King James. “I’m sorry—forgive me,” he says in Eugene H. Peterson’s million-selling plain-language adaptation, \u003ci\u003eThe Message\u003c/i\u003e. “I’ll never do that again, I promise!” Greenstein’s Job, however, stays vinegary to the end. “I have heard you,” he tells God, “and now my eye has seen you. That is why I am fed up.” The Hebrew phrase commonly rendered as some form of \u003ci\u003eI repent\u003c/i\u003e, Greenstein translates as\u003ci\u003e I take pity on\u003c/i\u003e. \u003ci\u003eDust and ashes\u003c/i\u003e, meanwhile, is for Greenstein a biblical epithet meaning humanity in general. So the line becomes “I take pity on ‘dust and ashes.’ ” Job’s last word: What a world you’ve made, God. I feel sorry for \u003ci\u003eeveryone\u003c/i\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat does it mean? This newly revealed Job, writes Greenstein, “is expressing defiance, not capitulation … If God is all about power and not morality and justice, Job will not condone it through acceptance.” Upon the scholarly merits of this approach, I am unable to pronounce; as an idea, I’ll consider it. We don’t read the Bible, it’s been said; the Bible reads us. It searches us. And here for us in 2019, right on time, with tyranny back in style and riding its behemoth through the streets, is a middle-finger Job, a Job unreconciled to the despotism of experience. He’s been shattered by life-shocks; then God, like a wall of terrible noise, fills and overfills his mind. His response: \u003ci\u003eThank you, but no\u003c/i\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003caside class=\"callout-placeholder\" data-source=\"curated\"\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eGloria Dei est vivens homo\u003c/i\u003e, wrote Saint Irenaeus: The glory of God is a living man. Might not the Author of Life look with favor upon this brilliantly resistant creature, this unappeasable critical thinker, this supremely lonely and dissenting figure, this Bartleby with boils—unswayed by the sublime, scratching his scabs in the land of Uz? That might be the rankest heresy: Let me know, bishops. But consider what Greenstein’s nonpenitent, polarity-reversed Job has done to the ending of the book. As before, with the experiment over, Job is blandly restored to a state of health and wealth; as before, God upbraids the sententious friends, the Bildads and the Eliphazes and the Zophars, and sends them off to make some burnt offerings, “for you did not speak about me in honesty as did my servant Job.” The quality or valence of this honesty, however, has turned upside down. It has become a kind of white-knuckle existential tenacity, a refusal to disown oneself even in the teeth of the windstorm. Maybe that’s what this God, faced with this Job, is telling us: Bring it all before him, the full grievance of your humanity. Bring him your condition, loudly. Let him have it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003csmall\u003eThis article appears in the September 2019 print edition with the headline “Sorry, Not Sorry.”\u003c/small\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/8sKfiwL7PSM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/8sKfiwL7PSM/","published":"2019-08-10T12:05:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:39-594769"},{"title":"How Using Social Media Makes People Better Writers","content":"\u003cp\u003eThese are tough times for grammar snobs, those would-be avatars of flawless spelling and proper syntax who need look no further than a high-school friend’s Facebook posts or a family member’s text messages to find their treasured language being misused and neglected. Of course, split infinitives, dangling modifiers, and subject-verb disagreements have always appeared wherever words are uttered or keys are stroked. But on the internet, and particularly on social media, defenders of formal writing and the rules of language may feel as if they’ve become stuck in some linguistic hellscape littered with discarded stylebooks, the ashes of dictionaries, and a new species of abbreviations that’s tougher to crack than \u003ca href=\"https://www.ancient.eu/Linear_B_Script/\"\u003eLinear B\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo these “grumbling” grammarians, the Montreal-based linguist Gretchen McCulloch says: Lighten up lol. In her new book, \u003ci\u003eBecause Internet: Understanding the New Rules of Language\u003c/i\u003e, McCulloch challenges the idea that the rise of informal writing signals a trend toward global idiocy. Instead, she marks it as an inevitable and necessary “disruption” in the way human beings communicate. “We no longer accept that writing must be lifeless, that it can only convey our tone of voice roughly and imprecisely, or that nuanced writing is the exclusive domain of professionals,” McCulloch argues. “We’re creating new rules for typographical tone of voice. Not the kind of rules that are imposed from on high, but the kind of rules that emerge from the collective practice of a couple billion social monkeys — rules that enliven our social interactions.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf course, the old rules of language were broken long before people went online, and McCulloch offers that the internet concludes a process “that had begun with medieval scribes and modernist poets.” She also notes how “well-documented features” of regional and cultural dialects—such as southern American English and African American English—have influenced the language of the internet, most obviously on Twitter. But in contrast to the pre-internet age, she argues, now we are all “writers as well as readers” of informal English.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDrawing from her research and that of other linguists,\u003cb\u003e \u003c/b\u003eMcCulloch shows how creative respellings, expressive punctuation, emoji, memes, and other hallmarks of informal communication online demonstrate a\u003cb\u003e \u003c/b\u003esophistication\u003cb\u003e \u003c/b\u003ethat can rival even the most elegant writing. Understanding the difference between ending a sentence with one exclamation point or two, recognizing what a person is conveying when they write “dumbbb” or “sameee,” and knowing when or when not to be upset after receiving an all-caps text, McCulloch writes, “requires subtly tuned awareness of the full spectrum of the language.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe prevalence of \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/01/whats-the-plural-of-emoji-emojis/422763/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eemoji\u003c/a\u003e, meanwhile, does not indicate verbal indolence or a pandemic of cuteness (though adorability is certainly part of it). Instead, McCulloch writes, emoji represent a “demand that our writing … be capable of fully expressing what we want to say and, most crucially, how we’re saying it.” She even implies that William Shakespeare, whose work in part depends on the gesticulating of actors, would have been fine with the “digital embodiment” of mental states and intentions in emoji.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll this informality may also be making people smarter, McCulloch suggests. In any case, it doesn’t appear to be making anyone dumber. “Several studies show that people who use a lot of internet abbreviations perform, at worst, just as well on spelling tests, formal essays, and other measures of literacy as people who never use abbreviations — and sometimes even better,” the author writes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTwitter has been especially good at sharpening its users’ communication skills, McCulloch finds. Because Twitter users are more likely to interact with people they don’t know outside the internet (versus Facebook, where exchanges take place largely among friends and family), linguistic innovations—hashtags, @mentions, new words, and abbreviations — are more abundant on the site. McCulloch credits improvements in her own writing style to Twitter’s 280-character limit and the way it forces users “to structure their thoughts into concise, pithy statements.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMcCulloch doesn’t spend much time on how these innovations have been used to sow division and to spread hate speech, though she does acknowledge how memes were employed to make “abhorrent beliefs look appealingly ironic” during the 2016 election campaign. Given her profession, McCulloch is much more interested in the positives that have come from the popularization of informal writing. “As a linguist,” she writes, “what compels me are the parts of language that we don’t even know we’re so good at, the patterns that emerge spontaneously, when we aren’t really thinking about them.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs for those dug-in, intransigent standard-bearers of formal writing who still flinch every time they encounter a face-palm emoji or the sarcasm tilde (~), McCulloch extends sympathy and an olive branch. She also suggests that those fluent in internet English should go easy on themselves and try to exorcise “the ghosts of misguided grammarians” who left “us with a vague sense of unease at the whole prospect of the written word.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith \u003ci\u003eBecause Internet\u003c/i\u003e, McCulloch is offering “a snapshot of a particular moment in time and how we got that way, not a claim to correctness or immortality.” And she calls for humility from those who are fluent in internet language and culture. “We don’t create truly successful communication by ‘winning’ at conversational norms,” she writes, “whether that’s by convincing someone to omit all periods in text messages for fear of being taken as angry, or to answer all landline telephones after precisely two rings. We create successful communication when all parties help each other win.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter all, as McCulloch points out, “the only languages that stay unchanging are the dead ones.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/1pxMMt8pkYQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/1pxMMt8pkYQ/","published":"2019-08-10T11:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-595858"},{"title":"When Children at the Border Got Compassion","content":"\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIn the spring of 2014, a sudden surge of unaccompanied children began crossing the southern border from Mexico into the United States.

Many were horrified by what they found. In the critics’ view: an ableist, anti-science fat-shamer who has achieved celebrity peddling a coldhearted individualism cloaked in a disingenuous celebration of love and spirituality.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThis assessment, circulated widely on the internet alongside incriminating old tweets and highlighted passages from her many books, shines a light on the whole self-help industry, as well as the woo-woo West Coast variety that Williamson has helped make mainstream. Since the 18th century, boosters of self-improvement strategies have posited that sheer personal will—or, in religious variants, prayer—are the solutions to problems better understood as structural and complex. The fact that Williamson’s teachings ground these dubious principles in the esoteric religious text \u003cem\u003eA Course in Miracles\u003c/em\u003e, said to be dictated directly by Jesus Christ to the New York City doctor Helen Schucman in the 1970s, hardly gives her more gravitas.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eBut the attacks on Williamson miss an important aspect of her appeal as a candidate. Like other self-help figures, she overemphasizes the power of individuals to solve intractable issues. Yet she is rare in applying this ideology to the political sphere, particularly to promote progressive policy. In Williamson’s view, self-help can heal the whole body politic; what benefits one can and should be directed to benefit all.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eCompare her with the previous century’s most famous promoter of spiritual self-help, pastor Norman Vincent Peale. Known as “God’s salesman,” Peale suggested that business success was the most obvious way to prove mastery over one’s mind and destiny, and he became known for cozying up to conservative politicians who shared his embrace of pluck and positive thinking as the way to overcome life’s obstacles. But he wasn’t especially committed to social change beyond lending his support to administrations that implicitly advocated his can-do, Christian individualism.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/06/jazzercise-50-years-women-fitness-culture-judi-sheppard-missett/591349/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eNatalia Mehlman Petrzela: The fitness craze that changed the way women exercise\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003ePeale became close to the Republican Richard Nixon, attacking the Democrat John F. Kennedy for his Catholicism. His commandments to eradicate “fear thoughts” and self-doubt so motivated one Queens, New York, builder that these mantras became core principles of his professional work and his parenting: Beginning in 1960, Fred Trump regularly brought his family into Manhattan to attend Peale’s Sunday sermons at Marble Collegiate Church. These weekly teachings also inspired his son Donald, who decades later asked Peale to officiate his first wedding at the Fifth Avenue church. (Peale accepted the offer.) In a 2009 \u003ca href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/brainstorm/200905/donald-trump-failure\"\u003e\u003cem\u003ePsychology Today\u003c/em\u003e interview\u003c/a\u003e, Trump credited Peale with teaching him never to get “sucked into negative thinking.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWilliamson, until recently, also gave \u003ca href=\"http://marianne.com/marianne-at-marble-collegiate/?fbclid=IwAR2CyC-R7XFkVYh4W2CwcSAOpkgjvbT_l-cWU2tnoFBumJ2NCGKFjSxV37Q\"\u003eregular talks at Marble Collegiate\u003c/a\u003e, but first found her calling to spiritual instruction in a starkly different milieu: the 1970s Southwest, in the late days of the counterculture. After she dropped out of Pomona College, Williamson drifted around the country searching for her purpose, working as a cocktail waitress, an office temp, and a cabaret singer. When a boyfriend gave her a copy of \u003cem\u003eA Course in Miracles\u003c/em\u003e, it spoke to her.

Inward-focused endeavors such as meditation, yoga, and psychedelic and spiritual experimentation—perhaps more so than the public marches or legislative activism that loomed so large in the 1960s but that had done nothing, after all, to stop the Vietnam War—were the key to unlocking human potential, and by extension shifting the collective consciousness.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThroughout the ’90s, far-out forms of self-actualization spread from secluded retreats like Big Sur’s Esalen Institute, where Williamson taught, to converge with the more conventional goal-setting promoted on daytime television, in the supermarket checkout aisle, and, much later, via #inspo on Instagram. In 1994, when Williamson, already a best-selling author with Oprah Winfrey’s endorsement, \u003ca href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=sFXndEyaZJEC\u0026amp;focus=searchwithinvolume\u0026amp;q=politics\"\u003ewarned readers of the dangers\u003c/a\u003e of being “swayed by false politics” and to “listen instead to the spirit of truth,” her words found a willing public.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWilliamson has long been more comfortable connecting self-improvement with social reform than many of her peers in the self-actualization space. She became a celebrity spiritual guru, after all, in large measure through her work with gay men at the height of the AIDS crisis. As much as her approach emphasized emotional-health strategies—she would declare “Your soul is not sick!” in support groups at the Los Angeles Center for Living, which she founded in 1987—she was in her way trying to use self-help techniques to address what she understood as a social problem.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eA decade later, her book-length treatise \u003cem\u003eThe Healing of America\u003c/em\u003e cited Thomas Jefferson and the historian Arthur Schlesinger in service of a “holistic politics” to rescue a nation she perceived as morally adrift. As Williamson’s frustration with American politics grew, her audiences didn’t always appreciate her strident commentary. (After all, they showed up at her speeches seeking personal enlightenment.) “I hope she gets back to the inspirational stuff,” \u003ca href=\"https://www.metrotimes.com/detroit/radical-spirit/Content?oid=2171071\"\u003esome grumbled\u003c/a\u003e when Williamson openly expressed anger at Al Gore’s loss to George W.

Love. Participate.” and “Join the Evolution!” Williamson invites voters, suffusing these specific calls for civic participation— Marianne2020!—with her more familiar idiom of spiritual and emotional transformation. A clinical, emotionally detached “wonkishness,” she warned at the Democratic debate in July, will not save the nation from the “dark psychic forces” that under the Trump administration have us in their thrall. While Williamson’s loopy language can be distracting, she invokes it to press for reparations and climate-change policy, and to redress economic inequality as forcefully as her most radical opponents, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWilliamson’s political orientation is not just a knee-jerk reaction to the Trump era. On the \u003ca href=\"http://www.ctznwell.org/ctznpodcast/001-marianne-williamson\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eCTZNWELL\u003c/em\u003e podcast\u003c/a\u003e, Williamson explained that listening to Martin Luther King Jr. in the 1960s first inspired her to understand spirituality and social justice as intertwined. Back in 2011, one confidant told me that Williamson pulled him into her office to ask what he thought of her idea to run for president. (He laughed.) President Barack Obama just wasn’t moving fast enough to close Guantánamo, she explained. (I granted interview subjects anonymity for candor.) Three years later, she ran for Congress in California’s 33rd District.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e“Self-help and social change have often been seen as polar opposites,” Christine Whelan, a clinical professor at the University of Wisconsin at Madison’s School of Human Ecology, told me, confirming a historical and contemporary dynamic that makes a perverse sort of sense. For celebrity contemporaries of Williamson such as Tony Robbins, placing politics at a distance is strategic, allowing him to cultivate elite clients on both sides of the aisle: He has coached both Bill Clinton and Donald Trump. Among everyday consumers of self-help, prioritizing dieting or decluttering offers a reassuring, if wrongheaded, message that can only be muddled by diving into messy politics: Changing your own actions and ideas—which are in your control alone—is all it takes to transform your experience.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe false dichotomy between politics and personal growth, however, is falling apart, and this rupture is what has made Williamson’s candidacy possible; the world it seems, is catching up to her. Trump has made the difference. After the 2016 election, the buttoned-up pundit Douglas Brinkley suggested that Americans process the stunning results by meditating, and scores of usually apolitical wellness merchants \u003ca href=\"https://www.wellandgood.com/good-advice/wellness-and-politics-post-election-trump/slide/2/\"\u003estepped in to sell salves\u003c/a\u003e to a polity hungry for healing.  When the president boasts of grabbing women’s bodies and victimizes his opponents as unstable and animalistic, self-actualization starts to feel more like a survival strategy than narcissistic indulgence. An old quote that is newly viral suggests as much: “Caring for myself is not self-indulgence, it is self-preservation, and that is an act of political warfare,” the black lesbian intellectual Audre Lorde wrote in 1988. Today, Lorde’s words are invoked so frequently in both the social-justice and self-care circles that they have become almost trite, revealing a mounting curiosity to consider what bringing these pursuits together might make possible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWilliamson’s progressivism has long been minimized as limousine liberalism; \u003ca href=\"https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1992-02-16-ca-4649-story.html\"\u003ea 1992 \u003cem\u003eLos Angeles Times \u003c/em\u003eprofile\u003c/a\u003e of her AIDS activism highlighted her “spoiled” childhood and ease navigating “the combined worlds of glitz and good causes.” The list of her celebrity followers and friends is long. Yet her ease navigating what a media executive, who asked to remain anonymous, called the “Malibu philanthropist set” provides too pat a reason to dismiss her. When Williamson goes on television, a \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/BuzzFeedBen/status/1156371083194335232\"\u003estaffer recently shared\u003c/a\u003e, she apparently gets snickers from producers and journalists, while the working-class makeup artists familiar with her are brought to tears by her presence. Perhaps Williamson can inspire Americans to turn their energies, and genuine aspiration for improvement, to political rather than purely personal ends.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMarianne Williamson is not qualified to be president. But her ideas deserve to be taken seriously, even if she doesn’t collect the roughly 12,500 additional donations she needs to participate in the third debate.

/\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Miles to go before I sleep.” Yes, you can take that quote literally. In the world of air travel, there is a category of people that is all about the miles it earns. In 1999, an engineer in the US bought over 12,000 cups of pudding at 0.25 cents each, to amass over a million miles under a promotion. Since then, there have been many attempts to score as many miles as possible by the people who believe in their power. Why go crazy after them, you ask? Airmiles have been known to make possible trips at a fraction of the cost it takes to buy a ticket after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have travelled back from the US, along with my wife, on Etihad Airways A380 in its First Apartments class for 90,000 airmiles and just $5 per head. Those who know the potential of these airmiles would never want to pay the $15,000 it would have cost for this trip, which involves a full bed, a deep sinking chair with adjustable levels of firmness, a 32-inch flat TV (with live television), a shower at 40,000 feet, and customised meals by a chef on board. Rinse, repeat. I took the same Etihad Apartments to Australia and back for just 60,000 miles per head the following year to bring in the New Year in Sydney.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiles have also taken me on board Singapore Airlines’ first class, Jet Airways’ first and business class, Etihad’s business class, British Airways’ first Class and business class, and Cathay Pacific’s first class, amongst others. Most recently, I was on board the Lufthansa first class for a fraction of the cost it takes to buy the tickets on retail prices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLoyalty is rewarding\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=\"pull-quote\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"quote-line\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAirmiles were part of loyalty programmes that US airlines established in 1980.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"quote-line\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003eAirmiles, or frequent flyer miles as they are more commonly known, are part of the marketing machinery called loyalty programmes that US-based airlines first established in 1980. Airlines wanted to ensure that the customer would keep coming back to them for repeat business, rather than fly a different airline every time. American Airlines launched AAdvantage, and other airlines quickly followed suit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe basic premise of the loyalty programmes at that time was simple. You were awarded the number of miles that you flew. So, a Los Angeles to New York JFK direct flight got you 2,464 miles. But flying Los Angeles-Seattle-Chicago-Florida-New York got you 4,925 \u003cem\u003eaward \u003c/em\u003emiles in your account for flying to the same place. So, for those who understood the system, it quickly became a thing to find the most convoluted route to fly so that they could amass the greatest number of award miles for the same destination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hunt for frequent flyer status also made sure people flew more. Airline status traditionally is counted on the number of flights you flew with the airline in a year, or the number of miles you flew with them. As you fly more, you would progress to milestones such as silver, gold, platinum, diamond, or other precious materials.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe higher you go, the greater number of miles you get for the same trip (for instance, an airline may offer you a 100% award miles bonus as a platinum member flying with them). Also, you would get privileges such as expedited check-in, boarding, lounge access, upgrades, and other similar perks. The airline would count the number of status miles you flew, a phantom counter that would reset every year, to decide which status to grant you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou could use the award miles amassed by you to get free seats on the plane. Airlines would keep seats aside for their frequent flyer members to redeem tickets. These seats would usually be the unsold seats on a flight, and typically be dead inventory when the it flew empty. So airlines used them to offer members an opportunity to use miles from their mileage balance and then travel on these instead. Not surprisingly, loyalty programmes have been one of the biggest hits in the past decades for all sorts of travel companies to gain repeat customers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy collect airmiles?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is my personal advice to everyone that every time they fly, they should earn airmiles if the airline given them that opportunity. Airmiles are a sort of pass back that airlines give you for flying them. But the ability to earn airmiles has now moved beyond just flying. Credit cards are a way to earn airmiles on daily spends. Banks tie-up with mileage programmes to buy airmiles and reward their customers for spends. Other ways include, but are not limited to, magazine subscriptions, shopping, renting a car, and countless other such things. For instance, signing up for \u003cem\u003eThe Economist\u003c/em\u003e magazine’s subscription could earn you a boatload of miles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=\"pull-quote\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"quote-line\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe more airmiles you have, the more you can travel at a fraction of the cost.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"quote-line\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003eFirst and foremost, the more airmiles you have, the more ability for you to travel for a fraction of the cost. For instance, you could defray the cost of your vacation or work tickets. So, you get more money in your hands to spend on your stay and experiences rather than spend that money on air tickets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can also choose to travel more comfortably, for less. For instance, you might want to travel from India to the United States. A 16-hour flight would be crazy in economy, so how about a flat bed in business class with better food and drinks as well?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen you want to buy a business class ticket in cash, the prices tend to move four to five times higher than economy class. But when flying on a redemption ticket, you would usually just pay double the number of miles of economy for a business class flight. Hence, you would be able to get a more comfortable experience for a fraction of the price.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes, you need to fly last minute and ticket prices may have gone through the roof. How about redeeming some miles? Take, for instance, a last-minute Mumbai-Goa flight on a long weekend. While the cash price may go up to over Rs10,000 one way per person on Vistara, they are available for 4,000 miles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat airmiles to collect in India and why?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are many options when it comes to collecting air miles in India, but not all are born equal. A question I receive a lot is which one to go for. It largely is a lot about how easy they make it to earn and redeem miles, and if they offer a good value. For instance, for an economy class ticket between New York and Washington DC, for the same flight, British Airways offers it to you for 7,500 miles and American Airlines offers it to you for 12,500 miles. So, you need to study the programmes and check out which one works for you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you are largely a domestic flyer around India, the most sensible options are be the home carriers. The biggest airline loyalty programme in India was JetPrivilege, but with the closure of Jet Airways, it is seeking to reinvent itself. Currently Air India has the Flying Returns frequent flyer programme, and Vistara offers the Club Vistara frequent flyer programme.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAir India’s Flying Returns: So much potential\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAir India’s Flying Returns programme is a mixed bag, so join at your own risk. Air India joined the Star Alliance in 2014, which means you can now fly Air India or any other of the 27 airlines of Star Alliance across the world, deposit your miles on Flying Returns, and then redeem them for Star Alliance or Air India flights. Star Alliance has some of the biggest and best airlines in the world as members, such as United, Singapore Airlines, Lufthansa, Thai, ANA, Air Canada, and others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Air India has structural flaws in their loyalty programme, which do not allow you to benefit from it if you do not fly a lot of international business class. Air India offers as low as 25% of the flown miles on their cheapest tickets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo become an Air India Golden Edge Club member, which would allow you to get benefits such as lounge access and business class check-in on Air India and other Star Alliance airlines, you need to accumulate at least 50,000 Air India status miles. If you are a frequent Delhi-Mumbai flyer then, you need to do 300+ flights on the cheapest tickets to be able to make it to that status. Air India is also not very generous when it comes to redemptions. It has progressively become harder to find any redemption seats on their international flights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=\"pull-quote\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"quote-line\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAir India is not very generous when it comes to redemptions.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"quote-line\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003eLet’s say you want to fly from India to the United States on United, or Singapore Airlines. You can still use your Air India miles, but be ready to pay 100,000 Air India miles for an economy class ticket (one way). This is 25% more expensive than Air India’s own flights, which cost just 80,000 miles one-way. This trend reflects across the board when you want to make a Star Alliance redemption with Air India.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo earn more Air India miles, you can sign up for the Air India SBI Signature Credit Card, which earns you 4 miles per Rs100 spent on the card. You even get 30 miles per Rs100 spent if you book Air India tickets for yourself on their website. Not just that, you get up to 90,000 miles bonus for your spending on the card.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eClub Vistara: Young and restless\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClub Vistara took a different approach to loyalty than the others. They don’t award you miles for the number of miles you fly, but rather they award you Club Vistara points for the fare you pay them for the ticket. You can earn 8 Club Vistara miles per Rs100 spent on the ticket (apart from the taxes and airport fees). You need at least 2,000 Club Vistara points to get a redemption ticket in Economy class.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn terms of status, Vistara’s is far easier to get than Air India. Vistara requires you to only fly 30 flights or earn 25,000 tier points to get Club Vistara Gold status, which earns you lounge access, business class check-in, and boarding and baggage handling priority, among other facilities.

Some of the best loyalty programmes are abroad, and you could sign up for them as well. Here are some that you should definitely look at from the perspective of each airline alliance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStar Alliance\u003c/strong\u003e: Avianca LifeMiles and Asiana Diamond Club. LifeMiles is a South American Star Alliance programme, which requires a low number of miles to get redemption flights. For instance, India-Europe business class flights just cost 35,000 miles across Star Alliance airlines when using LifeMiles instead of Air India’s Flying Returns. However, if you are a frequent international traveller in economy and want to quickly unlock the Star Alliance privileges, look at Asiana’s Diamond Club. You need to accumulate 40,000 status miles over a 24-month period, and once you get your Star Alliance Gold status, it lasts for 24 months.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOneworld: \u003c/strong\u003eOneworld is a small but important alliance for Indians because half the alliance member airlines fly to India, such as British Airways, Cathay Pacific, Japan Airlines, Malaysia Airlines, Qatar Airways, Sri Lankan. Out of all of these, British Airways makes the most sense for Indians, given you can generate miles by flying, but also by transferring them from various credit cards. But if you are flying to the US even a few times a year, then the best choice is American Airlines AAdvantage to accrue miles. That is because you can use those miles to redeem on Oneworld airlines as well as Etihad, among other carriers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, if you like flying Emirates, you should look at crediting your Emirates flights to Alaska Airlines’ Mileage Plan. Just 82,500 Alaska Miles get you a business class ticket between India and the USA on Emirates, while on Emirates’ own programme, it takes at least 1,10,000 miles to redeem the same ticket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=\"pull-quote\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"quote-line\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThere is a short cut to becoming Star Alliance Gold in just three flights.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"quote-line\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003eThere also exists a short cut to becoming Star Alliance Gold in just three flights. Shangri-La Hotels have a tie-up with Singapore Airlines called Infinite Journeys. When you become a Jade Member with Shangri-La Hotels, for just three flights on Singapore Airlines in any class, you would become a Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer Gold. This would usually require 50,000 miles of flying. The best part is, Shangri-La Jade status comes free for members of American Express Platinum Card in India.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCredit card points make your choices more widespread\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCo-branded credit cards make you captive to an airline, which is both good and bad. For instance, the Vistara co-branded cards give you benefits when you are flying Vistara only. In such a case, it also helps to get some credit cards, which are, in flying parlance, airline-agnostic. These credit cards have points that can be used for good value on many airlines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere are some of the popular credit card programmes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCiti PremierMiles\u003c/strong\u003e: Citi’s entry-level travel credit card gets you 10,000 PremierMiles when you pay the fee of Rs3,000 in the first year. You earn four PremierMiles per Rs100 spent. But when you spend on airfare using the airline website or PremierMiles.co.in, a portal owned by Citibank, you get 10 PremierMiles per 100 spent. Each PremierMile is worth Rs0.45 and can be redeemed for air tickets or hotel bookings. Alternatively, you can transfer to 12 airline loyalty programmes in the ratio of 2 PremierMiles = 1 airmile. These include major airlines such as Qantas, Cathay Pacific, British Airways, Singapore Airlines, and others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHDFC Bank Diners ClubMiles: \u003c/strong\u003eHDFC Bank offers this as a middle-tier card. You can earn four points per Rs150 spent on this card. A long-running promotion of HDFC Bank called Smartbuy allows you to earn 10 times the usual points when you buy air tickets from a captive website, each point being equal to one mile of Vistara, British Airways or Singapore Airlines. Otherwise you can spend it for Rs0.50 in cash value for buying tickets on any airline using the same Smartbuy portal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCiti Prestige: \u003c/strong\u003eOne of the top-end cards from Citibank, it costs Rs20,000 per annum in fees. But you get Rs10,000 worth of hotel vouchers at Taj/ITC Hotels and 10,000 airmiles in return for your fee every year. Plus, you earn one point per Rs100 for domestic spends and two points per Rs100 on international spends, golf benefits, airport transfers in Asia Pacific twice a year, and unlimited lounge access for you and the family. One point equals four airmiles on 12 major loyalty programmes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAmerican Express Platinum Charge card: \u003c/strong\u003eThe top-end card from American Express, Amex Platinum is a metal \u003cspan class=\"pull-quote\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"quote-line\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eCredit cards will essentially cover you a lot of ground in getting access to miles.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"quote-line\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003ecard, that earns you two and a half membership rewards points per Rs100 spent domestically, and three times that equation if you spend in foreign currency. Two membership rewards points convert to one air mile in nine airline loyalty programmes, such as Emirates, British Airways, and Singapore Airlines. You can also transfer to some hotel programmes such as Hilton and Marriott. Besides, you get unlimited access to lounges across the world, including American Express’ proprietary lounges in Mumbai and Delhi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHDFC Bank Infinia/Diners Club Black: \u003c/strong\u003eThe top-end cards from HDFC Bank offer you a frequent 10X promotion, where you can shop via the Smartbuy website to get 10 times the usual number of points for your purchases on Flipkart, Amazon, and air tickets. Each point is worth Re1 when spending on airfare using the same portal, or you can also transfer them to some airlines. They come with unlimited airport lounge access.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGetting one or many of the above credit cards will essentially cover you a lot of ground in terms of getting access to miles that can be used across many airlines. Additionally, when you redeem the miles from portals such as that of Citi and HDFC, you also earn miles on the airline itself, so that is a sweet double dipping right there. Some of them are expensive, but all the cards make it a point to give you welcome gifts that make good for most of the fee you pay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, the next time you hear “miles are useless,” do not believe the naysayers. Once you start using them, they save you money like nothing else does.

But what\u0026#8217;s happening to bonds reflects something bigger than the latest news.  Rates are low in other countries too—extremely low. In Europe the entire German bond curve is \u003ca href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/eurozone-bonds-germany/entire-german-govt-bond-yield-curve-turns-negative-for-first-time-ever-idUSL8N24Y2ZW\"\u003ein negative territory\u003c/a\u003e and more than $13 trillion worth of bonds are offering negative rates—that is, bond holders pay to own the security. Nor is this a new development: Bond yields in developed markets have been trending down for the last 20 years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"atlas-chart\" data-id=\"4pdFv3JuG\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"449\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/qz-production-atlas-assets/charts/atlas_4pdFv3JuG.png\" style=\"max-width: 100%; min-width:100%;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYears ago such low rates were unthinkable. Who would pay to lend someone money? In the late 1990s the US government ran a surplus and rates were nearly 6%, now the deficit is expected to \u003ca href=\"https://bipartisanpolicy.org/report/deficit-tracker/\"\u003etop $1 trillion\u003c/a\u003e and the 10-year yield is 1.5%. Fortunes have been lost betting rates will go back up, and yet they keep going down. Will it last and how did we get here?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhy are rates so low?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInterest rates are market prices, which means they are a function of the supply and demand of bonds. There is plenty of supply—the US is running a many-trillion dollar debt and needs to sell bonds to pay for it—but not enough to satisfy all the demand for its debt at higher interest rates. The demand is driven by an insatiable desire for low-risk assets. Bonds are generally seen as a less risky asset than stocks. Unlike most other assets, they offer certain payments for a fixed amount of time. Even if the company or country that issued the bond goes bust, bond holders are often still paid something. Of course, some countries and companies are risker than others. The riskier a bond is, the more it normally pays, since investors are compensated for taking risk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd bonds have never been less risky. Traditionally, even bonds from countries with a low chance of default contained some amount of risk because there was a risk of inflation or that bond prices would change. Since rates and inflation have been low and steady, neither of these factors are seen as likely, which means investors will buy bonds with lower yields. A low-risk asset is especially attractive when markets feel uncertain, like now when investors fear either a recession or a trade war that will crash the stock market. Even negative rates that are locked in can be more compelling than the alternative.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFurther, certain institutions, like pension funds or banks, often are required by statute or their charter to buy bonds, no matter the rate. For example German pension funds can only invest \u003ca href=\"https://www.ipe.com/pensions/country-reports/germany/pensions-in-germany-the-joys-of-negative-rates/10012506.article\"\u003e35% of their assets in risky securities\u003c/a\u003e, and have traditionally held mostly bonds. Regulation also encourages banks to hold bonds on their balance sheet because it is considered a safe asset.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWho is buying all these bonds?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA closer look at who makes up this demand can tell us where bonds are headed and how we got here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the US the biggest buyer of US government bonds is the US government. For example, when Social Security takes in more in taxes than it pays in benefits, all that excess revenue is invested in special US bonds not available to the public but sold based on market prices. Nearly all government bond buyers are agencies associated with retirement: Social Security, the Medicare trust fund, military pensions, and federal retirement programs, \u003ca href=\"https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/files/reports-statements/mts/mts1218.pdf\"\u003erepresent almost 90% of bonds\u003c/a\u003e bought by the US government.  In 2018, almost 26% of the America\u0026#8217;s $21 trillion debt was intra-government lending. Some \u003ca href=\"https://www.heritage.org/social-security/report/misleading-the-public-how-the-social-security-trust-fund-really-works\"\u003epundits argue\u003c/a\u003e the government lending money to itself does not count as debt, but is merely an accounting maneuver. Technically that may be correct, but these bonds do represent real debt, the payments promised to future retirees in exchange for taxes or pension contributions today.  The Social Security and Medicare trust fund assets don\u0026#8217;t even cover what\u0026#8217;s been promised to future retirees, so in fact the debt owed to Social Security and Medicare understates what the government truly owes to retirees. In all, obligations to American retirees makes up that largest share of government loans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe figure below summarizes who buys what, by showing the percentage of debt each type of buyer owns:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"atlas-chart\" data-id=\"yM-w3Tn8n\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"449\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/qz-production-atlas-assets/charts/atlas_yM-w3Tn8n.png\" style=\"max-width: 100%; min-width:100%;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIndividual savers (who own mutual funds and saving bonds) and the Fed (who expanded their balance sheets during the financial crisis) remain a fairly small buyers of bonds. The biggest buyers are the government\u0026#8217;s retirement obligations and foreign buyers which includes foreign governments and corporations. One reason bonds yields have been trending down is almost all bond buyers have been buying more over the years, especially foreign investors. The figure below plots bond holdings over the last 25 years by type of buyer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"atlas-chart\" data-id=\"L4U16T1d4\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"449\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/qz-production-atlas-assets/charts/atlas_L4U16T1d4.png\" style=\"max-width: 100%; min-width:100%;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat does it mean for you?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhether you benefit from low rates depends if you are a saver or borrower. Low rates tend to be bad for retirees who usually own more bonds and face higher annuity prices. Financing retirement spending while avoiding risk has become \u003ca href=\"https://qz.com/1403462/the-real-retirement-crisis-is-the-high-cost-of-low-risk/\"\u003eincredibly expensive\u003c/a\u003e. Baby boomers may have benefited from years of economic growth and a rising stock market, but low rates makes their retirement much more expensive. Meanwhile borrowers, holders of student debt, and mortgages face lower borrowing costs. Regardless if they are retiring or just starting out, all savers will get a lower return on their investments, or be compelled to take on more risk to produce a higher return. How households will respond to more risk is uncertain, and if stock prices fall it could mean more economic instability. Alternatively, a lower cost of capital can increase investment and spur more growth, which benefits everyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWill it last?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHistorically, financial economists assumed \u003ca href=\"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-15500-1_4\"\u003ebond yields revert to the mean\u003c/a\u003e, or, in other words, that they hover around a long-term average and what goes down (or up) must eventually return to normal. But there are reasons to think rates may be lower for the foreseeable future. In a more global world there will be more demand among foreign buyers of US debt, buying debt stabilizes (or lowers) their currency and buying foreign bonds can hedge risk. Bond yields will also be lower because an aging population means more savers and bond buyers. If low, stable inflation persists, rates will also be lower than their historical averages when rates had to compensate investors for higher inflation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut things could change. Asian investors are looking \u003ca href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/16/china-has-cut-its-holdings-of-us-debt-to-the-lowest-level-in-two-years.html\"\u003ecloser to home for investment\u003c/a\u003e. If there\u0026#8217;s less trade with western countries, they\u0026#8217;ll have less need to buy our debt. The US government will also be buying less debt in the future—starting next year Social Security benefits will exceed tax revenue, meaning  the government will not buy so much  of its own debt as the \u003ca href=\"https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/2019/\"\u003etrust fund is expected to start shrink to zero by 2035.\u003c/a\u003e This all mean the two biggest buyers of US debt will probably be buying less in the future. Meanwhile, if the government does not reform entitlements or starts offering new ones like Medicare For All, it will be issuing even more debt in the future. More supply and less demand could mean rates just might rise again.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://qz.com/1683976/why-are-interest-rates-low-and-how-long-will-it-last/","published":"2019-08-10T12:00:58Z","guid":"https://qz.com/1683976/auto-draft/"}]},{"url":"https://www.vice.com/en_us/rss","items":[]},{"url":"https://feeds.gothamistllc.com/gothamist05","items":[]},{"url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/rssfeedsdefault.cms","items":[{"title":"FM

The lawsuit filed on behalf of three African American residents of one of the state\u0026#8217;s racially drawn senate districts, and a former state senator who was unseated in 2015 after the new maps moved him into the gerrymandered district.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lawsuit argues that the state legislature diluted the voting strength of lower-income African Americans in the district by mixing in wealthy, white sections of a neighboring county, according to \u003ca href=\"https://www.theskanner.com/news/usa/28913-appeals-court-mississippi-redistricting-plan-violates-voting-rights-act\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003ethe Skanner News\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut arguably the most consequential legal challenges are to Mississippi\u0026#8217;s racist 1890 Jim Crow-era constitution, which explicitly intended to block the African American vote and give whites permanent power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome aspects of the constitution were struck down by the Supreme Court and the Voting Rights Act, including poll taxes and literacy tests \u0026#8212; along with a clause that exempted most white people from being subjected to either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLawmakers at the time created \u0026#8220;a constitution that would consolidate political power with white people in Mississippi by systematically disenfranchising black people in Mississippi,\u0026#8221; said Paloma Wu, senior staff attorney at the Southern Poverty Law Center. \u0026#8220;It was extremely effective at what it was headlined to do, which was to achieve white political power on the basis of white supremacy.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe constitution created election rules that attempts to give a decided advantage to white candidates vying for statewide office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWinners of statewide office in Mississippi have to clear two hurdles.

No race-hate attacker does. These mass murders are the direct byproduct of a practice of obfuscation and disinformation the white supremacist movement has spent decades perfecting. It\u0026#8217;s a messaging campaign designed to encourage in-group believers to take violent action, while tricking outside observers into believing the actor was self-inspired and isolated. It is an intentional, robust, and well-developed system with a clear history.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElements of this “lone-actor strategy” can be traced back to the early days of the Ku Klux Klan, Pete Simi, an author and expert on extremist groups told ThinkProgress.

He added that white supremacists view it as “one of the most important strategies” to their success.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The key here is this is not just a person who for whatever reason feels like violence is the solution to their problems. This is somebody that identifies a larger set of problems that are connected to an existing social movement, and sees their violence as acting on the larger interests of the movement,” Simi said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the talk of the El Paso shooter and others \u0026#8220;acting alone\u0026#8221; is therefore playing right into the white-hate strategy, and making it even harder to come to grips with the rapidly evolving internet-enabled form of an age-old violent ideology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;We need more focus on that [and] to understand that there’s a whole movement culture behind what happened in El Paso,\u0026#8221; Simi said. “Because that keeps it from being looked at as just a generic shooting rampage.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe key to the strategy is community.

It’s not our fault if somebody goes out and does something like this.” Sometimes it\u0026#8217;s single individuals. Other times, it\u0026#8217;s a \u0026#8220;small cell\u0026#8221; of three or four who ultimately commit violence on behalf of the movement.

The records and books they sold are still touchstones in the modern movement too. McAleer said the same white supremacist tome recently recommended by the \u0026#8220;lone actor\u0026#8221; who killed three and injured 12 at the Gilroy, California, garlic festival was among his best sellers 30 years ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pop-culture aspects of the hate movement are so durable, Simi said, because books and music are crucial to the ideology’s survival in a world where message boards have replaced in-person meetings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Anything that lends to some portability of that community strengthens a person’s resolve, right? It gives them something to continue to help feel a part of that like-minded community when they’re not in those shared spaces,” Simi said. A skinhead once told him “about how he could take a CD and pop it in any time he was feeling down or angry, and it would remind him that he has this larger community he’s part of.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcAleer in the mid-\u0026#8217;90s correctly anticipated that the internet\u0026#8217;s evolution would allow violent white supremacists to shift away from organizing in gangs that law enforcement could effectively target, track, and crack.

Smith had been a stand-out member of the white supremacist World Church of the Creator, so prolific in recruiting that WCC head Matt Hale had named Smith his “Creator of the Year” in 1998.

Demirkapi said six databases could be tricked into disclosing data by injecting SQL commands, including grades, school attendance data, punishment history, library balances, and other sensitive and private data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of the SQL injection flaws were blind attacks, meaning dumping the entire database would have been more difficult but not impossible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn all, over 5,000 schools and over five million students and teachers were impacted by the SQL injection vulnerabilities alone, he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDemirkapi said he was mindful to not access any student records other than his own. But he warned that any low-skilled attacker could have done considerable damage by accessing and obtaining student records, not least thanks to the simplicity of the database\u0026#8217;s password. He wouldn\u0026#8217;t say what it was, only that it was \u0026#8220;worse than \u0026#8216;1234\u0026#8217;.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut finding the vulnerabilities was only one part of the challenge. Disclosing them to the companies turned out to be just as tricky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDemirkapi admitted that his disclosure with Follett could have been better. He found that one of the bugs gave him improper access to create his own \u0026#8220;group resource,\u0026#8221; such as a snippet of text, which was viewable to every user on the system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;What does an immature 11th grader do when you hand him a very, very, loud megaphone?\u0026#8221; he said. \u0026#8220;Yell into it.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that\u0026#8217;s exactly what he did.

He wanted to show his proof-of-concept but was unable to contact Follett with details of the vulnerability. He later went through his school, which set up a meeting, and disclosed the bugs to the company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlackboard, however, ignored Demirkapi\u0026#8217;s responses for several months, he said. He knows because after the first month of being ignored, he included an email tracker, allowing him to see how often the email was opened — which turned out to be several times in the first few hours after sending. And yet the company still did not respond to the researcher\u0026#8217;s bug report.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlackboard eventually fixed the vulnerabilities, but Demirkapi said he found that the companies \u0026#8220;weren\u0026#8217;t really prepared to handle vulnerability reports,\u0026#8221; despite Blackboard ostensibly having \u003ca href=\"https://help.blackboard.com/Learn/Administrator/Hosting/Security/Security_Assurance/Vulnerability_Management_Commitment_and_Disclosure_Policy\"\u003ea published vulnerability disclosure process\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;It surprised me how insecure student data is,\u0026#8221; he said. \u0026#8220;School data or student data should be taken as seriously as health data,\u0026#8221; he said. \u0026#8220;The next generation should be one of our number one priorities, who looks out for those who can’t defend themselves.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said if a teenager had discovered serious security flaws, it was likely that more advanced attackers could do far more damage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeather Phillips, a spokesperson for Blackboard, said the company appreciated Demirkapi\u0026#8217;s disclosure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;We have addressed several issues that were brought to our attention by Mr. Demirkapi and have no indication that these vulnerabilities were exploited or that any clients’ personal information was accessed by Mr. Demirkapi or any other unauthorized party,\u0026#8221; the statement said. \u0026#8220;One of the lessons learned from this particular exchange is that we could improve how we communicate with security researchers who bring these issues to our attention.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFollet spokesperson Tom Kline said the company \u0026#8220;developed and deployed a patch to address the web vulnerability\u0026#8221; in July 2018.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe student researcher said he was not deterred by the issues he faced with disclosure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;I\u0026#8217;m 100% set already on doing computer security as a career,\u0026#8221; he said. \u0026#8220;Just because some vendors aren\u0026#8217;t the best examples of good responsible disclosure or have a good security program doesn\u0026#8217;t mean they\u0026#8217;re representative of the entire security field.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://techcrunch.com/tag/def-con-2019\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/def-con-2019-banner.png\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"feedflare\"\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=lxgShkqaI5g:nKDqyFrftwI:2mJPEYqXBVI\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=lxgShkqaI5g:nKDqyFrftwI:7Q72WNTAKBA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=lxgShkqaI5g:nKDqyFrftwI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=lxgShkqaI5g:nKDqyFrftwI:-BTjWOF_DHI\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=lxgShkqaI5g:nKDqyFrftwI:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=lxgShkqaI5g:nKDqyFrftwI:qj6IDK7rITs\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/lxgShkqaI5g\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/lxgShkqaI5g/","published":"2019-08-10T00:00:01Z","guid":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=1866379"}]},{"url":"https://www.theverge.com/rss/full.xml","items":[{"title":"Sonos is working on its first-ever Bluetooth speaker","content":"\u003cimg alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WQZmnH5NcLRE5j6vvV4V74QDP-g=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/64987246/FB79FCEC_F9E9_42C8_B871_BDDD4179A20A.0.jpeg\" /\u003e\n\n  \u003csmall\u003ePhoto by Chris Welch / The Verge\u003c/small\u003e\n\n  \u003cp id=\"5PoXPF\"\u003eOne of two devices recently \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/9/20799127/sonos-connect-refresh-fcc-filing-speakers\"\u003efiled by Sonos with the FCC\u003c/a\u003e is a Bluetooth speaker, \u003cem\u003eThe Verge\u003c/em\u003e can confirm.

Look at Roman Roy, the youngest son, played with sleazy excellence by Kieran Culkin, who in the first season jauntily walked into his glass office, closed the interior blinds so co-workers could not see him, and proceeded to pleasure himself against an exalted view of the New York City skyline. In the second season, Roman finds yet another way, even more surprising, to satisfy his carnal inclinations and make us laugh or recoil in repulsion. He is a court jester with executive responsibilities, and the result is what you would expect. At the end of the last season, overseeing the development of a rocket that he had hurried to the launch pad, he watched a livestream on his phone as it exploded on takeoff — and then, in a bathroom, he literally washed his hands and returned to his sister\u0026#8217;s wedding party as though nothing bad had happened. He seems too ridiculous for real life: How could anyone as inept as this third-rate scion be allowed near the C-suite?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[3](%7B%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22left%22%7D) --\u003e\u003cblockquote class=\"stylized pull-left\" data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"left\"\u003e\u003c!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[3] --\u003eThe show lays out on a cold examining table the foibles and faults of each would-be successor.\u003c!-- END-CONTENT(pullquote)[3] --\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c!-- END-BLOCK(pullquote)[3] --\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Murdoch correlation is relevant here. Just as the fictional Logan Roy has two sons and one daughter in the running to succeed him, Rupert Murdoch has two sons and one daughter who worked in his empire at various points and jockeyed to take over. In the real world, Murdoch’s eldest son, \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/03/30/lachlan-murdoch-fox-news/\"\u003eLachlan\u003c/a\u003e, has won that competition, recently becoming the chief executive of Fox Corporation, largely because his politics are a carbon copy of the old man’s white supremacy. Lachlan is, in this way, a version of the eldest son in “Succession”: Kendall Roy, portrayed brilliantly by Jeremy Strong, spends the first episodes of the new season as a windup zombie, executing whatever orders his despotic father gives him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"s1\"\u003e\u003c!-- BLOCK(promote-related-post)[4](%7B%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22relatedPostNumber%22%3A1%7D) --\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"promote-embed\" data-related-post-number=\"1\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c!-- END-BLOCK(promote-related-post)[4] --\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMurdoch\u0026#8217;s second son (his Roman, as it were) is \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/06/29/james-rupert-murdoch-philanthropy-fox-news/\"\u003eJames\u003c/a\u003e, a Harvard dropout who keenly wanted to succeed his father but missed his chance earlier this decade by botching a phone-hacking scandal at the family newspapers he oversaw in London.

Urges World Bodies to Stand against US Ban on Zarif","content":"\u003cp\u003eIn a letter to the chief of the United Nations and other international organisations, the Iranian diplomat has slammed the US administration’s move as an unlawful and undiplomatic motion against the Islamic Republic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe objected that Minister Zarif has been sanctioned for representing the Iranian nation to the best of his ability and for being a sincere advocate for dialogue, diplomacy, peace and multilateralism.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGharibabadi went on to say that this is the latest case of numerous unlawful actions taken by the US administration in line with the so-called “maximum pressure” policy against Tehran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“[The strategy] instigates economic terrorism against the Iranian nation which has been exacerbated in past 15 months after Washington’s unlawful unilateral withdrawal from the nuclear deal and bold insolence of UNSC Resolution 2231.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Iranian diplomat has further stated in his letter that the US arbitrary decision to sanction foreign minister of another state for no reason other than representing his nation and the State divulges the invertible duplicity of Washington’s officials in their conflicting remarks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It also contradicts the established principles and rules of diplomatic law and inter-state ties, especially the principle of inviolability and immunity of high-ranking foreign officials including the immunity of incumbent ministers of foreign affairs, as a universally accepted norm and rule of international law,” stressed Gharibabadi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe also noted that the American resort to unilateral coercive measures against a UN member country and its foreign minister shows a serious setback to diplomacy. It also undermined the profession of diplomacy and puts in danger the diplomatic interaction as the recognised medium for State-to-State communication and engagement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe noted that the restrictions levied on minister Zarif during his recent visit to New York to attend the UN meetings were against Article 105(2) of the UN Charter regarding the privileges of representatives of member states.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It is also infringement of the 1946 Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations and the firm principles of international customary law enshrined in 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGharibabadi has further warned of the consequences of Washington’s unabated infringement of the foundation of inter-State dialogue, international cooperation and multilateralism. Addressing the UN, he underlined that by sanctioning Zarif, a globally commended diplomat who has greatly contributed to world peace through his engagement, the US administration has displayed its deep contempt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The UN, its subsidiary bodies and specialsed agencies as well as all its member states must stand together in defending the principles of international law which would have negative impacts for the institution of diplomacy and its vital functioning,” concludes Gharibabadi’s letter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Trump administration imposed sanctions on Iran’s foreign minister, striking the main diplomatic channel between Iran and the West.

Quran’s call of “And proclaim Hajj among men” [Quran 22:27] is a call to everyone throughout history to come to this distribution of mercy, so that their God-seeking hearts and souls, and their thoughts and views benefit from its advantages; and every year, the lessons and teachings of Hajj propagate throughout Muslim world by congregations of people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hajj presents a miniature scale of a set of fundamental pillars of the Islamic society by placing the elixir of Dhikr and servitude—which is the main element for the cultivation, progress, and growth of individuals and the society— next to congregation and unity, which are the symbols of the unified Ummah; the movement around a unique center, and on the path towards a common goal—which are the keys to the endeavor and livelihood of the Ummah based on monotheism—;and through harmony among every Hajj pilgrim, where there is no distinction—which is the sign of removing discrimination and providing everyone with the same opportunity. Every one of the rituals of Hajj including Ihram, Tawaf, Sa’i, wuquf, ramy, movement and repose, is a symbolic reminder of a part of the picture presented by Islam of its ideal society.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExchange of knowledge and assets between people of different countries and places far apart, and spreading awareness and experience, asking for the news of one another, removing barriers of misunderstanding, bringing the hearts closer, and storing strength to confront common enemies are the vital and magnificent outcomes of Hajj, which otherwise would not be achieved through hundreds of the usual and typical gatherings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ritual of Bara’ah which means refusing every instance of mercilessness, cruelty, wrongdoing and corruption of the tyrants of any time, and rising against intimidation and unjust levy by the arrogant throughout history, is one of the great advantages of Hajj, and an opportunity for oppressed Muslim nations. Today, repudiating the front of shirk [polytheism] and kufr [disbelief] made up of the arrogant powers—the foremost of them being the US—equals refusing the killing of the oppressed, and waging wars. It equals condemning the sources of terrorism, including ISIS and the American Black Water. It is the Islamic Ummah’s shout at the child killers of the Zionist regime, and their backers and cohorts. It is a condemnation of The United States and their associates’ warmongering, in the sensitive regions of West Asia and North Africa, who have pushed the nations’ pain and suffering beyond limits and who bring them new catastrophes every day. It means refusing racism, and discrimination based on geography, race, and color of skin. It means refusing the arrogant and vicious behaviour of aggressive and seditious powers against dignified, noble and just behaviour recommended to everyone by Islam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese are some of the benedictions of the Abrahamic Hajj that the pure Islam calls us to. And this is the incarnation of an important part of the ideals of the Islamic society that every year, through every one of the participating Muslims, and directed by Hajj, puts on a grand and rich spectacle, calling everyone through a clear language, to try to create such a society.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe elite of the Muslim world, some of whom are now present at Hajj from different countries, have a crucial and important duty.

The greatest injustice in recent history has happened in Palestine. In this painful affair, all that a nation had—their land, homes, farms, belongings, dignity, and identity—was confiscated. With God’s assistance, this nation has not surrendered to defeat, and has not given up, and today, they are on the battlefields more enthusiastic, and braver than yesterday. But the ultimate outcome requires assistance from all Muslims. The ploy of Deal of the Century prepared by the oppressive US, and its treasonous cohorts, is a crime against human society, and not just the Palestinian nation.
