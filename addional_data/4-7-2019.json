Convinced that \u0026#8220;no amount of science\u0026#8221; would win over opponents, she decided that an \u0026#8220;emotional statement\u0026#8221; was needed, one drawing upon words as rooted as any in American history.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;We hold these truths to be self-evident,\u0026#8221; O\u0026#8217;Toole wrote, \u0026#8220;that all people, regardless of race, gender, religion, immigration or economic status, sexual orientation or gender identity, are created equal, that they are endowed by their government with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.'\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eO\u0026#8217;Toole, who lives in the Rochester area, received hundreds of responses after she posted her Declaration of Transgender Independence online, from expressions of support to suggestions that Thomas Jefferson would have thought she was crazy. But for O\u0026#8217;Toole, the original Declaration of Independence is more than an old document for students to memorize. It\u0026#8217;s a starting point for seekers of social justice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;I think for many activists like myself, it symbolizes what we are willing to do to secure Liberty for ourselves and our posterity,\u0026#8221; she told The Associated Press in an email.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHistorians debate what the slave-holding Jefferson and his fellow drafters meant by writing \u0026#8220;all men are created equal,\u0026#8221; but the Declaration has inspired those not mentioned or even imagined in the text. For more than two centuries, it has informed some of the country\u0026#8217;s defining rhetoric, from Abraham Lincoln\u0026#8217;s Gettysburg Address to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.\u0026#8217;s \u0026#8220;I Have a Dream\u0026#8221; speech, while serving as a template for feminists and labor unions, LGBTQ rights and civil rights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Americans seek to appeal to the country\u0026#8217;s presumed ideals, its fundamental promises, they often turn to the Declaration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;When Jefferson made his famous statement about equality, he did not really mean that we were created equal individually; the real point was that Americans, collectively, as a people, had the same right to self-government as all other peoples,\u0026#8221; says Jack Rakove, whose books include \u0026#8220;Revolutionaries: A New History of the Invention of America\u0026#8221; and \u0026#8220;Original Meanings: Politics and Ideas in the Making of the Constitution,\u0026#8221; which won the Pulitzer Prize in 1997.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;But over time \u0026#8230; the equality statement acquired the aspirational purpose it has held ever since: that each of us is equal in legal status or moral weight or civic ability to everyone else,\u0026#8221; Rakove says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eDanielle Allen, author of \u0026#8220;Our Declaration: A Reading of the Declaration of Independence in Defense of Equality,\u0026#8221; says that soon after 1776 abolitionists were mentioning the Declaration in their fight against slavery. But its canonization was gradual. Allen and Christopher Warren, a curator of American history at the Library of Congress, both cite the War of 1812 as heightening national pride and anxiety and reviving emotions about the country\u0026#8217;s past. The Declaration took greater hold in the 1820s as Jefferson, John Adams and other founders died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThrough much of the 19th century, \u0026#8220;declarations\u0026#8221; were issued. The Working Men\u0026#8217;s Declaration of Independence, issued in 1829, begins, \u0026#8220;When in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one class of a community to assert their natural and unalienable rights in opposition to other classes of their fellow men. \u0026#8230;\u0026#8221; The Socialist Labor Party stated in 1895, \u0026#8220;When, in the course of human progression, the despoiled class of wealth producers becomes fully conscious of its rights and determined to take them, a decent respect to the judgment of posterity requires that it should declare the causes which impel it to change the social order.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBefore and during the Civil War, North and South invoked the Declaration, but for very different reasons. Historian Ted Widmer, currently working on a book about Lincoln, notes that Lincoln often mentioned the Declaration n speeches even before he was president. When he journeyed from Springfield, Illinois, to Washington for his 1861 inauguration, Lincoln made a point of stopping at Independence Hall in Philadelphia, where he told those gathered that he \u0026#8220;never had a feeling politically that did not spring\u0026#8221; from the Declaration of Independence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;The Declaration is the cudgel he uses to beat his political opponents,\u0026#8221; Widmer says. \u0026#8220;We can be the kind of country that builds upon the Declaration of Independence and grants equality and rights or we can be a slave society.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, the Confederates cited the Declaration in asserting their right to secede, but scorned the language of equality. Georgia\u0026#8217;s leaders borrowed from the Declaration in announcing that they had \u0026#8220;dissolved their political connection with the Government of the United States of America.\u0026#8221; In 1861, Confederate Vice President Alexander H. Stephens gave what was called the \u0026#8220;Cornerstone\u0026#8221; speech, insisting his new government\u0026#8217;s \u0026#8220;cornerstone rests upon the great truth, that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery — subordination to the superior race — is his natural and normal condition.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAbolitionists and civil rights speakers again and again drew upon the Declaration. \u0026#8220;Are the great principles of political freedom and of natural justice, embodied in that Declaration of Independence, extended to us?\u0026#8221; Frederick Douglass asked in his famous 1852 address \u0026#8220;What to the Slave Is the Fourth of July?\u0026#8221; In his \u0026#8220;I Have a Dream\u0026#8221; speech, King insisted the document meant \u0026#8220;all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\u0026#8221; King read directly from the Declaration two years later, in a July 4, 1965 speech at the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, and praised its \u0026#8220;profound, eloquent and unequivocal language.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAuthor and journalist Ta-Nehisi Coates, in his recent Congressional testimony on whether the country should offer reparations for slavery and racial discrimination, cited the Declaration as a reminder of a path untaken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;Enslavement reigned for 250 years on these shores. When it ended, this country could\u0026#8217;ve extended its hallowed principles — life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness — to all, regardless of color,\u0026#8221; Coates said. \u0026#8220;But America had other principles in mind.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the earliest gatherings for women\u0026#8217;s rights in the U.S., the 1848 Seneca Falls Convention, concluded with a Declaration of Sentiments: \u0026#8220;We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men and women are created equal.\u0026#8221; One of the country\u0026#8217;s first gay rights organizations, the Chicago-based Society for Human Rights, was founded in the 1920s \u0026#8220;to promote and protect the interests of people who by reasons of mental and physical abnormalities are abused and hindered in the legal pursuit of happiness which is guaranteed them by the Declaration of Independence.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAllen found the Declaration a useful framing for one of her own causes. In July 2016, she wrote a column for The Washington Post about the criminal justice system. She began with the familiar summoning of unalienable rights, \u0026#8220;Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness,\u0026#8221; before asking that \u0026#8220;all legislation erecting the War on Drugs, and turning the American people against one another, ought to be totally dissolved; that the free and independent states and territories have full power to pursue narcotics control through the tools of public health policy.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;The history of the present War on Drugs is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations,\u0026#8221; she

Back in the day the App Store would showcase the same games for a week, and then refresh those features each Thursday. Because of that developers got into the habit of releasing their games throughout Wednesday or very early Thursday in order to hopefully get one of those coveted features spots. Nowadays the App Store refreshes constantly, so the need for everyone to release all on the same day has diminished. Still, we’ve kept our weekly Wednesday night format as for years that’s the time people knew to check TouchArcade for the list of new games. And so without further ado please check out the full list of this week’s new games below, and let us know in the comments section which games you’ll be picking up!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr /\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003cfont size=\"+2\"\u003eCar Quest \u003ca href=\"http://toucharcade.com/link/http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1082960013?mt=8\"\u003e(\u0026#36;4.99)\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/font\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ccenter\u003e\u003ca href=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/626x0w-10.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/626x0w-10.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-255137\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/626x0w-10.jpg 626w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/626x0w-10-300x138.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 626px) 100vw, 626px\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/center\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eiTunes Description\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eBuckle-up for an epic road trip through a colorful world of puzzles and adventure.

The game\u0026#8217;s Expansion Pass can now be pre-ordered from the eShop, either alone or in a bundle with the core game. On its own, it costs $24.99. The bundle sells for $84.98, which means it\u0026#8217;s really more of a convenience purchase than any sort of deal. The Expansion Pass covers four waves of DLC that will arrive every few months or so after the game\u0026#8217;s launch. The first of the lot will be available day one, granting you an alternate outfit for your main character.

There was a 3DS game that\u0026#8217;s best forgotten, a mobile game that was so thirsty for the audience of \u003cem\u003eFire Emblem Heroes\u003c/em\u003e you could taste it, and the recent announcement that one of the games would be included in the Japanese Mega Drive Mini. But \u003cem\u003eLangrisser\u003c/em\u003e has been out of the public eye for a long time, and it\u0026#8217;s likely today\u0026#8217;s gamers don\u0026#8217;t know why it\u0026#8217;s something worth bringing back in the first place.

These remakes of the original 16-bit games hope to bring players up to speed, and although the set received a mixed response when it came out in Japan, it has been picked up for a Western release anyway.

The remake will include the content of both \u003cem\u003eFriends of Mineral Town\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eMore Friends of Mineral Town\u003c/em\u003e, meaning you can play as either a boy or a girl. Some new animals have been added to the game, along with a few new activities by the looks of things. We also have the first official trailer for the game, albeit in Japanese.

An award-winning narrative adventure, \u003cem\u003eWhat Remains of Edith Finch\u003c/em\u003e sees you playing as Edith, the last member of the Finch family, exploring the family home to figure out what happened to everyone else on the day each of them died. This vehicle serves as a great way to show some very different styles and perspectives, and makes for a compelling story hook. Keep in mind that this is more of a game about going through a story rather than solving puzzles or anything like that. But it is quite the story, so if that kind of experience is something you\u0026#8217;re okay with, you\u0026#8217;ll probably like this game.

After having to navigate the tricky waters of removing sexual content from its first couple of releases when the time came to bring them to consoles, Key decided to just make an all-ages game right from the start for its next one. That game turned out to be \u003cem\u003eClannad\u003c/em\u003e, and it was extremely successful in Japan. It follows the story of a troubled young man named Tomoya who carries a lot of pain and trauma from his past. He meets a kindred spirit in the form of a girl named Nagisa, and the two become fast friends. I won\u0026#8217;t tell you much more, but there are multiple routes and endings, so you\u0026#8217;ll have a lot of reasons to replay parts of the game.

It comes from Japanese developer Tom Create, who have previously worked with some fairly high-profile partners and brands. Anyway, this is a side-scrolling action-adventure game where you play as a young hero who is summoned by the gods to the Temple of Farasis. The main gameplay twist involves breaking and repairing walls in order to move forward. The visuals looks nice and this developer has done some fun things in the past, so this may be one worth keeping an eye on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePure Mahjong ($9.99)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-255158\" src=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/puremahjong.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/puremahjong.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/puremahjong-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/puremahjong-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/puremahjong-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMahjong solitaire.

The presentation has had a lot of work put into it, and it has things like unlockable fortune cookies, a screen saver, and other such niceties. Basically, it\u0026#8217;s a full-effort game in a sub-genre where most entries don\u0026#8217;t usually bother doing all that much.

In fact, since hitting Xbox Game Pass we’ve added six new tracks, a new arena, team modes, new cars, and skin packs.

In the spiderverse, Pete acquires his powers from the bite of a radioactive (or, after more recent retcons, genetically engineered) spider, and then sews himself a costume and invents web-shooting bracelets.

The question was simple, but the answer turned out not to be. (\u003ca href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1M3Y6vj3QlQpSdlYcCdq3BkbnnWIrEPlf/view\"\u003eThe transcript is short, and worth reading in full\u003c/a\u003e.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGardner, feeling the heat, immediately adopted the storied attorney’s technique known as \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_your_ass\"\u003eCYA\u003c/a\u003e. “I want to back up just a step and say that I’ve been with the United States Department of Justice for 16 years, through\u003cbr\u003e\r\nmultiple administrations, and I’ve always endeavored to be as\u003cbr\u003e\r\ncandid as possible with the court,” he said, adding that what he had said on Tuesday was his “best understanding” of the state of affairs, and noted that Ross had said the same. He said Trump’s tweet was his first intimation of any change: “I do not have a deeper understanding of what that means at this juncture other than what the president has tweeted.” Gardner said he had confirmed that the Census Bureau was in fact still printing the questionnaire without the citizenship question.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut then Joseph Hunt, the assistant attorney general for DOJ’s civil division, jumped in with a contradictory message: “We at the Department of Justice have been instructed to examine whether there is a path forward, consistent with the Supreme Court’s decision, that would allow us to include the citizenship question on the census. We think there may be a legally available path under the Supreme Court’s decision. We’re examining that, looking at near-term options to see whether that’s viable and possible.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere was Trump’s tweet, vividly illustrated. Any litigation involving the federal government is based on the notion that the executive branch represents the presidency. But Trump refuses to coordinate his messages with anyone else, meaning the system breaks down. Only Trump speaks for Trump; neither his Cabinet officials nor his attorneys can reliably say what he intends to do.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHazel basically told the government lawyers that while he might not doubt their personal honesty, he didn’t have any reason to trust their statements, either:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eIf you were Facebook and an attorney for Facebook told me one thing, and then I read a press release from Mark Zuckerberg telling me something else, I would be demanding that Mark Zuckerberg appear in court with you the next time, because I would be saying I don’t think you speak for your client anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf Ross were still capable of shame—\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/05/watchdog-ben-carsons-table-spending-broke-law/589804/?utm_source=feed\"\u003ewhich he doesn’t appear to be\u003c/a\u003e—all of this would be humiliating for him, though Trump has repeatedly undercut Cabinet officials and other appointees by publicly contradicting them before. It must be even more horrifying for career officials like Gardner, who have to work with federal judges regularly and value their reputations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAngering federal judges is not an especially clever way to argue cases, as any of those attorneys might tell Trump, were he willing to listen. Hazel was courteous toward Gardner, apparently sensing his dilemma, but he was not taking any guff. He moved up a deadline for written notification to Friday, and when Gardner asked for an extension to Monday, citing the Fourth of July holiday, Hazel immediately rejected that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Timing is an issue, and we’ve lost a week at this point. And this isn’t anything against anybody on this call. I’ve been told different things, and it’s becoming increasingly frustrating,” he said. “So Friday, 2 p.m., we’re going forward or we’re resolving it. That’s where we are.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIncredibly, Trump might yet get away with using a citizenship question on the census to suppress participation. For one thing, the plaintiffs’ lawyers complained on the call that the president’s tweets achieved the same effect that they allege the citizenship question would: “It leaves the immigrant communities to believe that the government is still after information that could endanger them,” one said. (Hazel wryly noted that he couldn’t very well enjoin Trump from tweeting.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/07/citizenship-questions-are-not-historically-normal/593014/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eThomas Wolf and Brianna Cea: How the Supreme Court messed up the census case\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor another, the Supreme Court rejected the method\u003cem\u003e \u003c/em\u003eby which the Trump administration tried to instate the citizenship question, but not the idea itself.

That widely posed question is built on a faulty premise. From the very beginning, Independence Day celebrations have been deeply political—in fact, the early celebrations were far more overtly political than today’s festivities. The right question isn’t whether July Fourth is being politicized, but rather, which vision of American citizenship it’s being used to advance.   \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn July 1776, American rebels staged celebrations of independence that were at once spontaneous and also—in a strikingly modern sense—media events. Independence had already been in the air for at least a year; the Continental Congress had already created public holidays, declared two national days of fasting, on July 20, 1775, and May 17, 1776. Yet when it forwarded the printed Declaration of Independence to the states, Congress did not recommend fasting, prayer, bell ringing, or any other observance. Congress would not order the nation to celebrate its own birth. Instead, many colonists devised their own celebrations to mark the event.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Declaration had thrust all blame onto the king, and its public proclamation set off public, symbolic murders and funerals for the king—inversions of the King’s Birthday celebrations. People in New York City tore down the equestrian statue of George III and hacked it to pieces. (It is said that metal bits of it were later used to make bullets.) In other places the monarch’s picture and royal arms were ceremoniously burned. In Savannah, George III was \"interred before the Court House.\" The press descriptions made sure to mention the ringing of bells and the bonfires—the two most important aspects of traditional King’s Birthday celebrations. These printed descriptions inspired new celebrations and stressed the loud and visible support of the people for the end of monarchy and the beginning of American independence under new forms of government. The celebrations and descriptions they inspired made it seem possible that the 13 North American colonies, which until that time had had more connections with England than with one another, might unite to form a new nation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn Huntington, Long Island, people took down the old liberty pole and used the material to fashion an effigy. This mock king sported a wooden broadsword and was described in a newspaper as having a blackened face \"like Dunmore’s Virginia regiment\" (the enslaved people who had been invited by the governor of Virginia to help put down the rebellion) and feathers, \"like Carleton and Johnson’s savages\" (the king’s Iroquois allies in New York). Fully identified with his African and Indian allies, wrapped in the Union Jack, the king was hanged, exploded, and burnt. Nation-building festivities in 1776 targeted a revealing array of enemies, a process that a seemingly depoliticized Fourth of July has helped us to forget.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDuring the difficult years of the Revolutionary War, patriots began to celebrate the anniversary of American independence on July 4th. They also marked battle victories, and their anniversaries. These patriots focused on what unified them and on the glorious national future they expected would follow from their victories, rather than on the British past that they had once actively remembered on such occasions. The revolutionary movement’s need to simultaneously practice politics and create national unity only raised the stakes of celebrating national holidays.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe trend in the early republic would be for July Fourth, and other celebrations modeled on the Fourth, to spread nationalism and at the same time, to provide venues for divisive political expression. In this way, Americans learned both to be American and to practice partisanship without any sense of contradiction. Just as they blamed the British and their Native and African allies while drawing on British traditions, they used the Fourth of July to praise and criticize their governments and each other, in the process struggling over who, and what, was truly American.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 1787 and 1788, proponents of the new federal Constitution staged supposedly spontaneous celebrations of ratification in the various states, not only to express their relief, but also to attack their opponents and to try to convince doubters that the new national charter would inevitably be accepted by all the states. During the 1790s, when disputes over foreign affairs and the role of public opinion between elections led Federalists and Democratic Republicans to begin to coalesce into informal national political parties, these partisans began to hold separate Fourth of July celebrations in larger towns. They also used the Fourth and its now more fully developed repertoire of parades, sermons, toasts, and newspaper reportage, as a model for new celebrations with explicit political meanings.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFederalists began to celebrate Washington’s Birthday in order to support Washington’s policies and to confirm their claims to embody the nation. For a time, Democratic Republicans marked anniversaries of the French Revolution, which they felt expressed the more democratic version of politics they sought to turn into American tradition. After 1800, they also celebrated March 4, the anniversary of Thomas Jefferson’s election to the presidency, as an alternative to what they called the \"monarchical\" tradition of Washington’s Birthday. Such celebrations helped Americans put into practice a two-party system, which few justified on its own terms but which, along with the newspapers that were increasingly subsidized by parties, provided an orderly meeting ground between an unwieldy federal electoral politics and a tradition of popular rituals.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJuly Fourth and its alternatives enabled Americans to preserve the paradox of revolutionary tradition. While these nationalistic political celebrations often came to have a conservative bent after the Revolutionary era, some, like the abolitionists, used the occasion to criticize American policy. Shut out of the two-party system by politicians who refused to address the issue of slavery on a national level, antislavery activists invented alternative festivals, like celebrations of the end of the slave trade. When Frederick Douglass asked, \"What to the Slave is the Fourth of July?\" and answered, \"The Fourth of July is yours, not mine. You may rejoice, I must mourn,\" he did so at an alternative Fifth of July celebration held in Rochester, New York, in 1852. Douglass continued the American penchant for not only celebrating but also inventing new holidays when the political possibilities of the old ones seemed insufficient.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn this Fourth of July, we may be asking whether the president’s celebration, in which flyovers and tanks tell us that military service is the epitome of public service, is the right one. Or we may be asking, with Nike and Colin Kaepernick, whether we can see more in Betsy Ross’s flag than a proslavery emblem. But on any Fourth of July, the real question is what version of the republic we care to advance by celebrating.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/J4ga3KHNjmI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/J4ga3KHNjmI/","published":"2019-07-04T10:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-593332"},{"title":"Go Read the Declaration of Independence","content":"\u003cp\u003eThere are July 4 traditions that are welcome and seemingly indestructible: barbecues and fireworks, most notably. There are some that are fortunately defunct: hours-long orations by stuffed-shirt politicians. There are some innovations that one hopes do not become traditions: 60-ton tanks rolling through Washington, D.C., most notably. And there is one that has faded with time yet is worth preserving: reading the entire Declaration of Independence, from the ringing opening through the bill of particulars to the pledge of “our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSome will say that the declaration was merely a cleverly written piece of propaganda. Others find in it the rank hypocrisy of its principal author, Thomas Jefferson, who preached liberty and who treated human beings as chattel. Still others will find it out-of-date Enlightenment twaddle that ignores the higher ends of politics or, conversely, an absurdly optimistic claim that anyone can, and everyone should, govern themselves. Its critics say those things today. They said them no less pointedly in 1776. The English sage Samuel Johnson had the most cutting put-down: “How is it that we hear the loudest yelps for liberty among the drivers of negroes?” And he had a point.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut with all that, the words of the declaration, rendered familiar by repetition, deserve to be pondered by Americans today, for they are contested as much now as they have ever been. Do Americans still believe in “the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God,” and that those laws entitle all peoples to independence? Why should we show “a decent respect to the opinions of mankind”? To paraphrase Groucho Marx: What has humanity ever done for us? Is it indeed self-evident that we are all created equal, and in what sense could that be so? How do we know that the Creator has created rights we cannot give up? Are “Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness” the real ends of government? Do those objectives aim too low? And really, who believes in “sacred Honor” these days?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNor is the bill of particulars to be ignored. Consider how many of the declaration’s accusations against King George had to do with that hardy perennial—civil-military relations: “He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil Power.” Or with the issue of immigration: The king had deliberately (Jefferson insisted) obstructed “Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither.” Or with judicial independence: “He has made Judges on his Will alone for the tenure of their offices.” Those issues live, in the United States and elsewhere.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe issues in the declaration are not merely American, but rather universal, and that is precisely what makes the United States exceptional. Not its reality at any given time, which may be worse or better than that of other states; a country stained by its bloody and often cruel treatment of Native Americans, or by its tolerance of slavery and its aftermath, cannot claim to be a utopia. Nor even its prosperity, for in that regard, tiny Switzerland can claim to have surpassed today’s America. The United States, rather, is exceptional in the universality of its argument, the ideals that inspire and shame succeeding generations, and that offer the characteristically American promise of improvement, change, growth, and hope for the future.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJefferson knew that the declaration he wrote had planted a bomb and lit a fuse under the institution that made his life comfortable. “I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just,” he wrote, as the Revolution came to an end. But though he may have lacked consistency and courage, he wrote the declaration anyway. Those who conjured up American independence were, like any group of politicians, frail and flawed human beings. They could not have foreseen all the consequences. But they nonetheless put forward, and fought to defend, claims that have set off many subsequent detonations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen Abraham Lincoln began the Gettysburg Address by pointing to the founding of the United States, he looked not to the passage of the Constitution, but rather to the Declaration of Independence, issued four score and seven years before. If his rhetoric on that occasion summoned forth a new birth of freedom, it was in self-conscious echo of the first.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen Martin Luther King Jr. stood on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in 1963 he said, “I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: ‘We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.’” For King, the glory of the declaration was the ideal, no matter the reality under which his people had suffered. Like none other, he saw the declaration as a mirror that Americans must hold up to themselves. And if they did not like what they saw, they could change things.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere have always been Americans who chafe at the universalism of the declaration, and foreigners who disdain or repudiate it. There will never be a shortage of critics who note the ways in which the United States fails to live up to this, its founding promise. But the heart of the American creed has never been more important.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eToday liberal democracy is under threat from multiple quarters. New technologies make surveillance and repression easier than ever before, while some authoritarian governments have figured out ways to ensure both prosperity and political docility. Science may undermine the premise of human equality in many ways. It is not uncommon to read sneers from foreign observers of the United States (and even from quite a few Americans) who charge that the United States is saddled with 18th-century dogmas and 18th-century ways of doing business. Americans’ confidence in their political institutions is at an all-time low, and partisan bitterness gives no sign of abating its rancor.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhich is all the more reason to go back to the beginnings, and back to the document that started it all. Americans are often blamed for their naive patriotism. Perhaps so. One cure for sophisticated cringing about naive patriotism can be going to a naturalization ceremony.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt one such event that I witnessed in the early 2000s, in a shabby government office building, there were immigrants from more than two dozen countries, ranging from Albania to Vietnam. After the formalities, the presiding official shoved a video cassette into a player, and President George W. Bush made an appearance. He spoke only a few sentences, which ended: “And remember, you are now every bit as much a citizen as someone whose ancestors came over on the Mayflower.” There were tears in a lot of eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eImmigrants, such as my own grandparents, may be those who appreciate most how precious and how radical the promise of the declaration is. But if they read and ponder its words—after the hot dogs, but before the fireworks—later generations may see in it something at which to marvel, something that still terrifies tyrants, and something worth defending to the last.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/rvocshP3Em8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/rvocshP3Em8/","published":"2019-07-04T10:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-593236"},{"title":"Independence Day in a Divided America","content":"\u003cp\u003eJohn Adams predicted in a 1776 letter that the nation would mark the anniversary of its independence as “the most memorable Epocha in the History of America,” hosting a great anniversary festival that ought to be “solemnized” forever after with “Pomp and Parade … Shews, Games, Sports, Guns, Bells, Bonfires and Illuminations from one End of this Continent to the other.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat was prescient.

But the appeal “is that the result is there for generations.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eChina isn’t new to the global fight against malaria. Chinese scientist Tu Youyou discovered the antimalarial compound artemisinin, in 1972, and figured out how to extract it from the Asian sweet wormwood plant, eventually earning her the Nobel Prize in 2015. For at least 2,000 years, wormwood was used to treat fevers and other symptoms consistent with what we now know to be malaria.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eToday, artemisinin is the most effective and widely used antimalarial compound in the world, with millions of doses of artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs) given out each year. Some of the Chinese scientists who helped develop ACTs are now shifting their attention to using MDA in Africa. New South, the Chinese company whose CEO, Zhu Layi, says he has  personally spent $300 million on MDA research and experiments in Africa, and his company is in talks with Kenyan health officials to do an MDA test run among 10,000 people on the country’s Indian Ocean coast, near the port city of Mombasa, where malaria is endemic.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut unlike those living in Comoros, many on the Kenyan mainland regularly travel or commute around the region, which poses a problem: People who are out of town when the drugs are administered might return carrying the parasite in their blood, reintroducing malaria to the area. There is also concern that the MDA approach could result in the malarial parasite building up resistance to the drugs used in the treatment.

Among New South’s vast holdings is a pharmaceutical wing whose Chinese scientists in 2006 invented Artequick, an ACT that China's Ministry of Health approved as the \"drug of choice\" for treating malaria in the country in 2009. The next year, Beijing listed Artequick as the preferred malaria drug for export to Africa. But Chavasse says “there is a fundamental conflict of interest for why a Chinese ACT manufacturer would be carrying out a research project on mass drug administration.The thought needs to be driven by malaria academics—not by drug companies.”  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003eRead More: \u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/09/two-ways-of-making-malaria-proof-mosquitoes/541407/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eTwo ways of making malaria-proof mosquitoes\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut Ogutu dismissed the idea that Chinese endeavors must have some ulterior motive. “We live in a conspiracy—that there’s some hidden agenda,” he said. In New South’s case, those fears seem misplaced: Unlike antibiotics and more specialized drugs, there is little money to be made from malaria treatment, with artemisinin-based malaria meds selling for just pennies per pill.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRather, the company’s campaign to eradicate malaria forces us to reckon with the possibility that Chinese billionaires such as Zhu might be driven by the same altruistic intentions that drive their Western counterparts—philanthropists such as Bill and Melinda Gates, who have \u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/2018/04/18/bill-gates-foundation-malaria/\"\u003espent more than $2 billion\u003c/a\u003e fighting malaria.

Only among two groups—whites without a four-year college degree and adults younger than 45 years old—did nearly as many Democrats support eliminating private insurance as maintaining it. The idea was especially unpopular among Democrats older than 45, with just 22 percent supporting it and 52 percent opposing it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/washington-post-abc-news-poll-june-28-july-1-2019/23419a67-9e70-42e3-a96d-65d92555e29b/?utm_term=.af4284ba33b5\"\u003eAn ABC/\u003cem\u003eWashington Post\u003c/em\u003e survey released on Wednesday\u003c/a\u003e that asked the question in a different way—stressing that the current system leaves some people uninsured while the new system would provide universal coverage—found much broader support for the idea. Two-thirds of Democrats in that poll said they would still back “Medicare for all if it meant there was no private insurance option available.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe divergence in these results suggests that opinions on the issue are still fluid and somewhat undefined. And that means the next stage of debate among Democrats could be critical in framing opinions about a government-run system, not only within the Democratic coalition but also, potentially, beyond it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe CNN survey underscores that conclusion. It found Sanders, Warren, and Biden—in that order—all finished closely together among voters who would eliminate private health insurance (as the first two candidates have proposed), according to results provided to me by CNN polling director Jennifer Agiesta. Similarly, the poll found Harris leading, followed closely by Biden and more distantly by Warren and Sanders, among the plurality of Democrats who would preserve private insurance. That suggests this issue hasn’t yet shaped the race nearly as much as it could if the candidates delineate their differences more sharply.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSince his 2016 race for the nomination, Sanders has been the principal proponent of a single-payer system that would ban private insurance for all but peripheral services, such as cosmetic surgery. His camp sees his identification with single-payer as a key to victory in a crowded primary field. Sanders is worrying less about building majority support in the party than about consolidating a passionate third or so of Democratic primary voters—and no issue, his camp believes, is more important in helping him do that than single-payer. “For one-third of the primary electorate, it is going to be ‘screw the insurance companies, screw the pharmaceutical companies, I want to crush the whole system,’” says one top Sanders adviser, who similarly requested anonymity. “I am OK with having that debate. It is the debate we can win the nomination with.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/06/2020-election-voter-turnout-could-be-record-breaking/591607/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: Brace for a voter-turnout tsunami\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSanders’s challenge is that Warren and Harris, who have both endorsed a single-payer plan that eliminates private coverage, are clearly encroaching on his support with the most liberal voters.

His strongest support in the race so far has come from the voters the CNN poll shows are most resistant to a single-payer plan that eliminates private insurance: older voters, non-whites, and moderates.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYet Biden was muted and indistinct in expressing his opposition to the Sanders approach during the first debate. The closest he came was at the end of his sole answer on health care: “I’m against any Democrat who … takes down Obamacare and any Republican who wants to get rid of it.” But Biden did not connect that argument directly to the other top candidates who want to replace Obamacare with single-payer. That reticence allowed Bennet to emerge at the debate as the most vivid critic of single-payer plans, though it’s unclear whether that will be enough to lift him from his trailing status in the race.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAides say Biden will likely express his differences much more pointedly leading into the next debates. Among the critiques of single-payer he’s likely to stress, aides say, are the immense cost; the potential disruption to the existing Medicare program; the potential for providing employers, who just received a huge tax break from Trump, another windfall by relieving them of the responsibility to provide coverage; and the importance of building on Obama’s accomplishment in passing the ACA. That last argument could allow Biden to tie the health-care debate into his broader effort to frame his candidacy as an extension of Obama’s legacy. Biden is likely to stress that creating a single-payer system “is also about the destruction of the ACA,” says another adviser who asked for anonymity. “And that really hasn’t been talked about much.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSimultaneously, Biden is likely to fill in his own broad-brush plans to expand coverage without dismantling the ACA or private health insurance. At the recent \u003ca href=\"https://slate.com/business/2019/06/joe-biden-health-care-plan-he-gave-a-peek-and-we-have-questions.html\"\u003ePoor People’s Campaign forum in Washington, D.C.\u003c/a\u003e, Biden indicated that he would automatically enroll into his Medicare public option, at no cost, any low-income family eligible for Medicaid in a state that has not expanded it under the ACA. He’s likely to flesh out that idea more by the next debate, aides say.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStarr says that single-payer advocates have not fully grappled with the complexities involved. Total U.S. \u003ca href=\"https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/NationalHealthExpendData/Downloads/highlights.pdf\"\u003ehealth-care spending\u003c/a\u003e on insurance premiums and out-of-pocket expenses, he notes, \u003ca href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/budget-fy2020.pdf\"\u003eroughly equals\u003c/a\u003e the federal government’s total receipts from the personal income tax (about $1.7 trillion, according to the latest figures). Even if a single-payer system cut cumulative costs by 10 percent or 20 percent, that would leave an enormous amount of revenue to raise through new taxes if the government assumed the burden of covering all health-care spending. And reducing those costs by shifting all health-care providers and hospitals to the reimbursement rates that Medicare offers—which are considerably lower than reimbursement rates from private insurance—could cause enormous disruption in the health care-system. “It would create havoc,” Starr says.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor these practical reasons, as well as political considerations, Starr thinks it’s highly likely that in the general election any Democratic nominee will shift to a position of allowing private health insurance to coexist with an expanded public alternative. (Though even that, he cautions, may be more complicated than it now appears.) Other Democratic policy and electoral analysts agree.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“I think that there is a majority sweet-spot position for a universal health-care plan that relies heavily on public insurance but doesn’t eliminate private insurance,” says Neera Tanden, the president of the liberal think tank the Center for American Progress and a former chief domestic-policy adviser for Hillary Clinton. “In this case, in an election where people are concerned about electability, I do think lots of voters are anxious about anything, policy or otherwise, that can detract from defeating Donald Trump.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut there’s no guarantee Democrats end up in that place. And the argument that is likely to gather momentum into the next debates may determine not only whether they do—but also how many scars they acquire along the way. “The challenge for the Democratic Party … is to go through this process and ensure that health care remains a top-tier positive issue for [the general election],” Tanden says. As the party’s divide over a single-payer system widens, that may be easier said than done.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/g5L7fcFkuDA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/g5L7fcFkuDA/","published":"2019-07-04T12:28:23Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-593341"},{"title":"The Slow, Messy Evolution of LGBTQ Dating Shows","content":"\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe MTV reality dating series \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/9kxvyp/inside-mtv-are-you-the-one-wildest-reality-dating-show-season-8\"\u003eAre You the One?\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e pairs the pursuit of romance with a pretty sweet deal: If every one of the show’s contestants correctly identifies their “perfect match,” the group splits a grand prize of $1 million.

They were diverse in geographic and racial background but uniformly young, brash, attractive, and heterosexual. “Welcome to the most ambitious matchmaking experiment ever attempted,” then-host Ryan Devlin told the starry-eyed singles. “You’re here because you all have one thing in common: You suck at relationships.” Naturally, chaos always ensued.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eNow the diabolical series, which premiered in 2014, has introduced a new element to the equation. Each of the 16 cast members in its eighth season is, in the show’s preferred parlance, “sexually fluid.” There are eight pairs of perfect matches, but the contestants (and viewers) cannot assume they’ll fall along heteronormative lines.

This new installment, though, serves a multi-layered purpose. For heterosexual audiences, it’s didacticism wrapped in an alcohol-soaked reality-TV bow, while for LGBTQ viewers, it’s an opportunity to be seen—for better or worse—more intimately than many dating shows have previously allowed. The new season of \u003cem\u003eAre You the One?\u003c/em\u003e premiered right at the tail end of June—\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/photo/2019/06/pride-month-2019-photos/592744/?utm_source=feed\"\u003ePride Month\u003c/a\u003e. Like the hyper-branded festivities it coincided with, the show is a fascinating tonal mashup: The episodes that have aired thus far weave lessons about sexuality and gender (and the politics of dating while queer) into every element of the show. Cast members introduce themselves with backstories that account for upbringings spent in the closet or involve being the only publicly queer kid in middle school.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn this, \u003cem\u003eAre You the One?\u003c/em\u003e offers a refreshing divergence from many past incarnations of LBGTQ-focused dating shows.

The 2003 Bravo series \u003cem\u003eBoy Meets Boy\u003c/em\u003e, for instance, took the straightforward premise of \u003cem\u003eThe Bachelor\u003c/em\u003e and applied an ethically dubious twist: The gay leading man, James, and his heterosexual best friend, Andra, initially had no idea that the mix of suitors competing for James’s heart on national television included both gay and straight men.

The 2007 MTV show began with Tila, then a popular MySpace personality and men’s magazine model, meeting the 16 straight men and 16 lesbians who had been picked to live in a house and compete for her love. Prior to the end of the first episode, none of the contestants were informed of Tila’s bisexuality—or the presence of contestants who didn’t share their gender. That pilot, which was literally titled “Surprise! I Like Boys and Girls,” introduced Tila as a confused arbiter of her own sexual orientation. “This show’s the perfect experience because it’s really gonna help me figure out \u003cem\u003eDo I really like a guy?\u003c/em\u003e or \u003cem\u003eDo I really like a girl?\u003c/em\u003e” she mused in one of the intro sequences.

This season has gotten more complicated than the show’s prior iterations, but it’s intriguing for reasons beyond the new statistical challenge. Of course, the series still operates within the framework of reality television. There are unnecessary fights, illicit makeouts, and love triangles galore. Everyone is perilously hot (and predictably thin). But as the entertainment industry has slowly shifted to offer more nuanced portrayals of queer people, \u003cem\u003eAre You the One?\u003c/em\u003e attempts to apply that impulse to the rowdiest corner of television. As Remy, one of the participants, notes, “Some of us are not what you would want to maybe represent you, and that’s fine, but we’re real people, and we exist and deserve to be seen, and we deserve to express how we feel.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eAre You the One?\u003c/em\u003e isn’t the most respectability-driven model of representation, but for a series about 16 young people hanging out and hooking up in one giant house, it manages to be impressively earnest. In one early scene, for example, the show’s lone trans cast member, Kai, asks Jenna, the woman he’s been connecting with since the first day, if she’d be willing to join him while he\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003etakes\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003ehis routine testosterone shots. Rather than feel voyeuristic or inappropriate, the moment is tender and, for many viewers, familiar. “I lived the first 20-something years of my life as a completely different person, and now I’m in a new frame of mind, I’m in a new body, I’ve got a brand new $10,000 chest!” Kai says in the confessional booth, opening his shirt to reveal top-surgery scars. “But I also feel like I’m new to relationships.” When Jenna tells him his commitment to figuring out his relationship to gender inspires her, he blushes wildly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe fact that Kai’s later revealed to be a swaggering playboy doesn’t undo the welcome surprise of his onscreen candor about physical transition, a process he describes as nonlinear. (It is, however, worth noting that the season, like many other queer productions, manages to feature a trans man but fails to include any trans women.) The show also features a relationship expert, the famed lesbian matchmaker \u003ca href=\"https://www.littlegaybook.com/\"\u003eDr. Frankie Bashan\u003c/a\u003e, who steps in to advise the singles on how to avoid unhealthy romantic dynamics, especially those that can emerge within insulated communities.

It prevented fishers from getting into the water, and entangled their nets and propellers. It entangled sea turtles and dolphins, too, fatally preventing them from surfacing for air.

In April, sargassum\u003cem\u003e \u003c/em\u003ehad begun growing off the coast of Brazil and near the mouth of the Amazon River, in an area far south of its normal range. By July, it had spread across the entire Atlantic.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow Mengqiu Wang, from the University of South Florida, and her colleagues have shown that this ocean-spanning bloom, which they’ve dubbed the Great Atlantic Sargassum Belt, is now an annual feature. By analyzing 19 years of satellite images, they showed that the belt first appeared in 2011, and has reappeared almost every summer since (except for 2013). Last June, when the belt was at its thickest, it contained more than 22 million tons of seaweed, and stretched fully across the Atlantic’s waters, from the Gulf of Mexico to the western coast of Africa.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat figure is likely to be an underestimate: With a spatial resolution of one kilometer, the satellite data doesn’t capture small chunks of \u003cem\u003eSargassum. “\u003c/em\u003eIt\u003cem\u003e \u003c/em\u003ehighlights the most aggregated areas rather than describing the entirety of what is present,” says  Deb Goodwin, an oceanographer at the Sea Education Association.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/09/gastropod-seaweed/499760/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: Kelp is the new kale\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Great Atlantic Sargassum Belt is a loose collection of seaweed scattered over a very large area, not a continuous bridge.

They concluded that the belt likely develops from local patches of sargassum\u003cem\u003e \u003c/em\u003ethat occur naturally in the tropics. But such patches have always existed. Why have they only recently started to form sprawling blooms?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWang’s team thinks that the new growth was connected to two factors on opposite sides of the Atlantic: the water discharged by the Amazon and upwelling currents rising off West Africa. These two phenomena pump nutrients into the tropical Atlantic. When they’re unusually strong, as they apparently were in 2009, they effectively flood the ocean with fertilizer, allowing sargassum to run amok.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut why, then, did the seaweed not bloom in 2010? Wang’s team thinks that it was delayed by low salinity (due to the influx of Amazon freshwater) and abnormally high temperatures—conditions that suppress the growth of sargassum\u003cem\u003e. \u003c/em\u003eOnly in 2011, when temperatures returned to normal, could the seaweed make use of the influx of nutrients from previous years, and go wild.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd the bigger the blooms in the summer, the more likely they are to leave behind patches that survive through the winter. If the conditions are right the following year, these “seed populations” can restart another bloom. “Each successive bloom makes it difficult to imagine an end to this self-reinforcing cycle,” says \u003ca href=\"https://www.eckerd.edu/marinescience/faculty/siuda/\"\u003eAmy Siuda\u003c/a\u003e, an ecologist and oceanographer at Eckerd College. “This is likely the new normal.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003eRead: \u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/07/hurricanes-irma-maria-lizard-grip/566006/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eAfter last year's hurricanes, Caribbean lizards are better at holding on for dear life\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo, a quartet of factors—strong Amazon discharge, strong West African upwelling, moderate temperatures, and the presence of a seed population—could potentially explain the Sargassum Belt, including why it appears every summer, and why it was especially thick in 2015 and 2018. But such factors “have impacted the central Atlantic Ocean for decades, if not centuries,” says Siuda “Why are we only seeing sargassum bloom in this region now? What tipped the balance? There is clearly still more to learn.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eChuanmin Hu, who led the study, agrees. “I have to emphasize that we have no direct evidence to prove any of this,” he says. “These are our speculations, some educated and some hand-waving.” They’ve been forced into that because many of the factors they identified aren’t regularly measured. For example, they could only find data on the nutrients in the Amazon for two years: 2010 and 2018. The latter levels were much higher, which might explain why sargassum blooms were so big that year. Or it might not. The river might have more nutrients due to increased fertilizer use, and stronger runoffs due to deforestation. Or it might not. “I don’t think there’s enough data,” Hu says. “It takes a huge amount of money to go there and take measurements.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf the four factors that the team identified, only sea surface temperatures are regularly measured. And while many scientists have suggested that hot water could speed the growth of sargassum, “we found the opposite,” Hu says. That’s not to say climate change is irrelevant, he cautions: Changing patterns of rain and wind could, for example, influence the strength of the West African upwelling. Nor should the Caribbean count on rising temperatures to solve its sargassum woes, because the pace of change is likely too slow to make a difference in the near future.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHu adds that other factors could be behind the rise of the Sargassum Belt, including nutrient-rich dust blowing in from the Sahara and changes in ocean currents. And several aspects of the blooms still don’t make sense. “If I were you, I would ask: If you have so much nitrogen and phosphorus, why do other [algae] in the ocean not grow as fast?” he says. “I can’t answer that.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGoodwin adds that “scientific understanding of Sargassum growth and bloom dynamics under natural, open ocean conditions is extremely limited,” since scientists have only addressed these questions in lab experiments. And the sargassum itself is changing, too. Siuda says that the recent blooms have included “a previously rare and genetically distinct form of sargassum” that comes from the south, differs from those in the Sargasso Sea, and harbors a slightly different community of organisms.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLittle is known about this strain, or how the bloom is affecting the ecology around it, which makes it hard to predict how it will react to future conditions. And since it likely evolved in relative isolation from its northerly relatives, its northward expansion suggests that “environmental conditions and ocean circulation patterns in the central Atlantic may have been shifting, undetected, for longer than the time interval examined by [Wang and her colleagues],” says Goodwin. “A critical larger question emerges: What drove such an ecological transformation at unprecedented scale?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the absence of such knowledge, it is very hard to predict when and where future blooms will occur. “Like hurricanes or nor’easters, we will likely be able to predict the severity of the upcoming season, but we won’t be able to predict exactly where the inundations will come ashore,” Siuda adds.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs Molwyn Joseph, Antigua’s environment minister, \u003ca href=\"https://antiguaobserver.com/government-to-identify-new-equipment-for-sargassum-fight/\"\u003esaid last summer\u003c/a\u003e, “We have made the assumption that this is going to be an annual thing, and the same way we prepare for hurricanes we have to prepare for Sargassum.”  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/stxTBYAtFhU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/stxTBYAtFhU/","published":"2019-07-04T18:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-593290"},{"title":"The Rituals of ‘Becoming America’","content":"\u003cp\u003eOur two great American holidays are, of course, Thanksgiving and the Fourth of July.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThey’re particularly American: Independence Day, for obvious reasons.

The book consists of 19 “sermons” that Liu has delivered at the institutions he calls “Civic Saturdays.” The big idea behind the sermons, and the religious-format gathering, is Liu’s call to a level of belief and commitment similar to that of a great religion—but where the underlying \u003cem\u003efaith\u003c/em\u003e is in the process of democracy itself.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA  section from his preface lays out the concept clearly:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThroughout 2016, Jená Cane and I kicked around ideas for a new civic ritual that would have the moral pull and communal feel of a faith gathering.

But in 1872, the land was practically untouched. That year, President Ulysses S. Grant signed “an Act to set apart a certain Tract of Land lying near the Head-waters of the Yellowstone River as a public Park,” which designated Yellowstone “for the benefit and enjoyment of the people” and sought to shield it from “settlement, occupancy, or sale.” The act paved the way for other lands to be protected under the same criteria, overseen by the Department of the Interior. Today, almost 150 years later, the United States has 61 national parks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eAccording to Nathaniel P. Langford, an explorer and the first appointed park superintendent for Yellowstone, the idea to protect American land germinated around a campfire at Madison Junction, where the Gibbon and Firehole Rivers meet. He and other members of an expedition that had set out to determine the value of the land, Langford claimed, were struck by its natural beauty, and decided instead to advocate for its preservation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eYet historical accounts show that Langford’s motivations may not have been as purely altruistic as he implied: Notes from his diary indicate that Langford likely saw national parkland as a potential generator of railroad traffic, and even worked with a financier who was interested in extending the Northern Pacific Railway. Questions of how much tourism in national parks is desirable—and of how the parks should be maintained and who they are meant for—are as old as the parks themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIn the first half of the 20th century, many of these debates stemmed from disagreements between lawmakers and environmental advocates on how to interpret vague and sometimes contradictory legislation. The railroad and, eventually, cars made the parks easier to access, and a steadily growing population and intensifying interest in the parks put even more stress on the land. By the 1950s, more than 20 million people were visiting the parks every year—almost three times the highest pre–World War II figure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eRecognizing that the onslaught of visitors was taking a toll on the landscape, in 1956 the National Park Service (NPS) put together a 10-year program—dubbed Mission 66—to carry out infrastructure repairs and modernize facilities, as well as build new visitor amenities. These construction efforts were met with pushback from the authors of a February 1961 series in \u003cem\u003eThe Atlantic\u003c/em\u003e. In “Our National Parks in Jeopardy,” three articles by three different writers explored the growing imbalance in the ecosystems of national parks due to human presence and development.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eDevereux Butcher, Clark C. Van Fleet, and Paul Brooks believed firmly that the NPS should stop new development and limit visitation. In the first article of the series, “Resorts or Wilderness?,” Butcher, the former executive secretary of what was then called the National Parks Association, argued that America’s national parks were “under ceaseless attack” by the public, which he called “the new menace” (commercial interests being the old menace). His piece walked readers through the impact of human interference on six protected areas: Mount McKinley, the Everglades, Yellowstone, the Grand Canyon, Grand Teton, and Yosemite. Each one, he wrote, was being destroyed by new infrastructure built to accommodate a growing number of visitors and their recreational demands. The only answer to the expanding problem, Butcher contended, was to adopt a policy that prohibited building facilities in the middle of the parks. (At the time, the Wilderness Bill, which set out to clearly define the term \u003cem\u003ewilderness\u003c/em\u003e and create a more organized system of land protection, was before the U.S. Senate, though it wouldn’t be signed into law until 1964.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIn “Nature Out of Balance,” Van Fleet—an author, a conservationist, and a “native Californian who for five decades [had] roamed the forests and fished the streams of the West Coast”—argued that human presence, sport, and needs were disrupting the equilibrium of the natural environment. Sequoia trees were showing signs of sickness due to injury by humans, meadows were facing erosion and damage from overgrazing, poaching was increasing, and fire was swallowing forests. In addition to curtailing tourism, Van Fleet wrote, the government should increase its funding of the parks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIn the third and final article of the series, “The Pressure of Numbers,” Brooks, “a rugged canoeist” and the editor in chief of the publishing company Houghton Mifflin, wrote pointedly about the growing popularity of parks, and how accommodating crowds had led to “compromise in preservation of the natural landscape”: The idea for creating parks for the people “[had] worked so well that it now [threatened] to work its own destruction.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWhile some development was necessary, Brooks explained, too much would be dangerous. If America was going to preserve the land without enforcing quotas on visitors, the country needed to introduce new parks, expand the area outside existing parks, or develop alternative recreation areas for outdoor activities so that protected land would not bear the burden. He concluded: “The parks themselves have been aptly called ‘living museums.’ Like a work of art, the natural scene is something that can be used without being used up. How we use it in America will have a very real bearing on the sort of people we become.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr class=\"c-section-divider\"\u003e\u003cp class=\"dropcap\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003eA\u003cem\u003etlantic\u003c/em\u003e readers’ letters in response to the series, published in April and May of 1961, captured charged and diverse opinions on how national parks should be managed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eGeneva L.

Murie wrote, “some places were treated like shrines, to help people in their endeavor to think on a high plane.” America’s national parks were established with “largely the same motivation,” he continued, so that “we might gain inspiration for our living.” He agreed with Butcher’s argument that people had strayed from those ideals, and hoped the public would “honestly study” the series.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eSigfurd F. Olson of Ely, Minnesota, a former president of the National Parks Association, thought the articles covered the current situation of the parks “very well,” especially the “tremendous difficulties” the NPS had in abiding by the congressional mandate to preserve the areas for future generations. He agreed that some development should be curtailed. But the series, he wrote, failed to recognize the “courageous fighting” by the NPS to keep 95 percent of the park areas in a wilderness condition; that most of the infrastructure added, such as roads, could not be “eliminated easily or without tremendous cost”; and that any change would require “congressional authorization and interagency cooperation as well as funds.” While the process would be “slow and painful,” he wrote, “some real progress has, nevertheless, been made,” and many of the problems presented could be solved if citizens’ groups and the NPS held “amicable discussions.” (Olson would go on to help edit and enact the Wilderness Act.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e“To argue that only five per cent of the park areas is developed,” Butcher replied to Olson, “ignores the principle that any intrusion shatters the whole.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe then–U.S. Senator Clinton P. Anderson of New Mexico wrote a diplomatic response. As the chairman of the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, he supported the Wilderness Bill, which was before the committee.

C. Robertson of Silver Spring, Maryland, wrote that the articles were “important and useful in stirring the American people to stop the encroachment of civilization on the wilderness.” But Robertson worried that the authors’ argument for less development was exclusionary: “There are whole generations … who have exactly the same right to see the wilderness as they do.” Robertson continued, “Are Butcher, Van Fleet, and Brooks the only men in the country who can enjoy nature? No, they will be the first to say. But, are Butcher, Van Fleet, and Brooks the only men who know how to enjoy nature? Well, almost, they will say.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e“Before your readers take Mr. Butcher’s unconstructive diatribe too seriously,” H. Oehlmann, the executive vice president of visitor services at Yosemite wrote, they should know that “sitting in my office some years ago, [Butcher] seriously told me that if he had his way, all visitors to Yosemite Valley would come by bicycle from El Portal.” The ride, Oehlmann wrote, was 14 miles from Yosemite Village, and climbed 2,000 feet in about five miles. “Anyone for a bicycle?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe wishes of the citizens for “whose welfare the national parks were established … should not be denied to comply with the selfish demands of a small group of nature worshipers,” Antoinette Friedman of Washington, D.C., wrote.

Years of congressional underfunding has not provided the parks with adequate resources to keep up with the impact their millions of visitors have on infrastructure and on the land.

In March, President Donald Trump proposed a fiscal-year-2020 budget for the Department of the Interior that was $2 billion below the department’s total budget for 2019. Of the $12.5 billion in the 2020 budget, only $2.7 billion would be allocated to the NPS, including $393.5 million for deferred maintenance projects. In 2017, Yosemite Park alone required more than $582 million worth of rehabilitation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eMeanwhile, \u003cem\u003eThe Washington Post\u003c/em\u003e reported this week, the NPS has \u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/white-house-gives-tickets-to-trumps-july-fourth-extravaganza-to-gop-donors/2019/07/02/9109a566-9ce0-11e9-b27f-ed2942f73d70_story.html?utm_term=.1cd1350cd649\"\u003ediverted\u003c/a\u003e nearly $2.5 million in entrance and recreation fees to help cover the costs of Trump’s “Salute to America” Fourth of July event in Washington. “By tapping entrance fees to cover the presidential event,” the \u003cem\u003ePost\u003c/em\u003e’s reporters wrote, the Department of the Interior “is siphoning money that is typically used to enhance the visitor experience either on the Mall or at smaller parks across the country, with projects ranging from road and bridge repair to habitat restoration.” The $2.5 million may not seem like much, but according to the \u003cem\u003ePost\u003c/em\u003e it represents “nearly 5 percent of the funds that less-profitable parks used last year for upgrades.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThis year, it seems, some of those upgrades will have to wait.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/doHjE79sek0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/doHjE79sek0/","published":"2019-07-04T15:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-593293"},{"title":"The American Paranoia of \u003cem\u003eStranger Things 3\u003c/em\u003e","content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis article contains some spoilers for Season 3 of\u003c/em\u003e Stranger Things.\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBurger King.

Sitting in the trunk of a station wagon. \u003cem\u003eStranger Things\u003c/em\u003e, Netflix’s mega-smash show about monsters in small-town Indiana, is so replete with the motifs of 1980s Americana that watching it can feel like an exercise in affective memory. The series is adept at pushing the right emotional buttons, to the point where an episode in the third season, \u003cem\u003eStranger Things 3\u003c/em\u003e, features a montage of moments from earlier episodes that precipitates nostalgia all on its own, with its Eggo waffles and its tiny, fierce, tousle-headed heroes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut the series isn’t just about the brands. This is a show about light and dark, and as deftly as it mimics the glaring neon of Reaganite consumer culture, it tweaks the conspiracy theories blooming in the shadows. Eleven (played by Millie Bobby Brown), the telekinetic girl taken in by a troupe of childhood friends in the first season, is the product of an \u003ca href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/what-we-know-about-cias-midcentury-mind-control-project-180962836/\"\u003eMKUltra-style\u003c/a\u003e government experiment that tried to give superpowers to babies in the womb. In Season 2, when Nancy (Natalia Dyer) and Jonathan (Charlie Heaton) try to offer closure to the family of a friend who was murdered by an inter-dimensional monster, they visit Murray Bauman (Brett Gelman), a journalist turned professional crackpot. Bauman believes, among other things, that the Russians have somehow infiltrated Hawkins, Indiana, and that the spate of disappearances around town is connected to the government-run Hawkins National Laboratory. As a character, Murray is genially, foil-hattishly nutty. Here’s the thing, though: He’s not wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eStranger Things\u003c/em\u003e is a series that lots of people love, and some other people sneer at, because it so consciously knows how to evoke pleasure, and it does so by poking at the simplest and most easily satisfiable desires. It’s a referential patchwork constructed from pieces of other, beloved pop-cultural works, but it cuts its cozy analgesic with doses of caustic suspicion. In one scene in \u003cem\u003eStranger Things 3\u003c/em\u003e, Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo) hides from some assailants in a screening of \u003cem\u003eBack to the Future\u003c/em\u003e with his friend Lucas’s little sister, Erica (Priah Ferguson). Dustin tells her they’re lying low, “like Oswald.” Lee Harvey Oswald, Erica reminds him, was caught in a movie theater. Only because it was a setup, Dustin counters. Oswald was just a patsy. While Marty McFly innocently time-travels on the big screen in front of them, the kids debate a conspiracy theory pegged to one of the darkest events in American history. When it comes to paranoia, no space is truly safe.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eConspiracy theories, in fact, are in the show’s DNA, a counterforce to all the cuddly Spielberg evocation and the tween-age bonding. Before \u003cem\u003eStranger Things\u003c/em\u003e bore its current title, its creators—the Duffer Brothers—reportedly \u003ca href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-original-pitch-for-stranger-things-may-hold-clues-a-1820110793\"\u003enamed it \u003cem\u003eMontauk\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, in reference to long-standing rumors about government-run psychological experiments on human test subjects conducted on military bases on Long Island, New York. The show’s story is built on the premise that various strains of delusional thinking are actually true. The government \u003cem\u003ehas\u003c/em\u003e conducted highly unethical drug tests on human subjects. Terrifying alien monsters \u003cem\u003eare\u003c/em\u003e real.

On the rare occasions when these events are exposed, the military \u003cem\u003edoes\u003c/em\u003e cover things up.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eStranger Things 3\u003c/em\u003e is more deeply informed by American paranoia than ever before, as the show starts to mine classic, Cold War–inspired works of the mid-1980s. \u003cem\u003eRed Dawn\u003c/em\u003e is an obvious overarching influence, that gung-ho story of a handful of teenagers fleeing Soviet invasion. So is \u003cem\u003eDay of the Dead\u003c/em\u003e, George A. Romero’s zombie horror about militarism and power. \u003cem\u003eThe Terminator\u003c/em\u003e, James Cameron’s dystopian hit about an unconquerable cyborg killing machine, gets the show’s most palpable allusion yet: an unbeatable enforcer with a motorbike and a single, ligneous facial expression.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Duffer Brothers’ pivot toward Russia is signaled in the first scene, a stylish, near-silent sequence set in 1984 that depicts a team of Soviet scientists using what appears to be a giant energy beam to break down the fabric between this world and the Upside Down. It’s a comically horrible idea: The Upside Down, as seen in previous seasons, is a wasteland of an alternative realm inhabited by gruesome monsters that keep surfacing in Hawkins to abduct teenagers, possess children, and test the physical impact of tentacles on man-made structures. In Season 1, Brown’s Eleven accidentally opened a portal to the Upside Down in a fit of telekinetic rage, unleashing a monster that ran amok in Hawkins and transported Will Byers (Noah Schnapp) to its ashy dimension. In Season 2, Eleven closed that same portal, after a different monster from the Upside Down possessed Will and used him as its vessel.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat could the Russians possibly want with the Upside Down? The setup for the entire eight episodes of Season 3 seems at first to be based on a simplistic premise of good and evil, one that the show’s previous seasons resisted. In Season 1, Matthew Modine’s Dr. Brenner was the obvious non-monstrous villain, an amoral scientist manipulating Eleven into doing his supernatural bidding on behalf of the U.S. government. In Season 3, though, \u003cem\u003eStranger Things\u003c/em\u003e’ outlook is more complicated. All eight episodes are being released by Netflix on July 4, and the Uncle Sam-against-the-Russkies plot configuration leans heavily on red-blooded patriotism. The series is set in 1985, a year after \u003cem\u003eRed Dawn\u003c/em\u003e was released, and the film’s attitude seems to have leached into the zeitgeist. When Dustin intercepts a secret Russian-radio broadcast in the second episode, he tells the inimitable Steve Harrington (Joe Keery) that deciphering it is their chance to “be heroes. True American heroes.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile Dustin, Steve, and the new character Robin (Maya Hawke) go to bat against a perceived Soviet threat, Joyce Byers (Winona Ryder), Will’s beleaguered mother, is indulging delusional tendencies of her own. One day early in the new season, all her magnets fall off the fridge, an arbitrary occurrence that the forgivably jumpy Joyce immediately connects to the Upside Down. Nancy, working as an intern for a group of boorish male editors at the \u003cem\u003eHawkins Post\u003c/em\u003e, sniffs out a conspiracy theory involving rats acting abnormally and some missing fertilizer. Will, neglected by his buddies after they all find girlfriends, also becomes convinced that the monster that possessed him in Season 2, the Predator-like Mind Flayer, is back.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the real world, all these characters’ suspicions could easily be written off as the products of psyches responding to pressure, or to trauma. After what Joyce has been through, of course she sees monsters everywhere, and Ryder’s performance finds a sympathetic space between brittle neuroses and maternal protectiveness that would be hard for another actor to balance. Will’s declaration that the Mind Flayer is back is a cry for help that brings his friends back to his side, reunited as a taller and more visibly pubescent team. Nancy’s awful job of fetching hamburgers and coffee for chain-smoking newspapermen who belittle her and name her “Nancy Drew” would naturally lead her to pursue a story so improbable, it would make her reputation if she could break it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eStranger Things 3\u003c/em\u003e, again and again, hints at how preposterous its characters’ theories sound. After Joyce describes Murray Bauman as not eccentric so much as “certifiable,” the grizzled police chief Jim Hopper (David Harbour) replies that it’s a case of the “pot calling the kettle black.” One of Nancy’s most compelling interview subjects is, her editors tell her, a paranoid schizophrenic who is not to be trusted. When Dustin tells a friend that he’s “so, so busy trying to save the world from Russians and monsters,” the response is laughter. How can any of these things be true, not least all at the same time? Where, apart from the fantastical realm of 1980s film and its imitators, would they be?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe \u003cem\u003eStranger Things\u003c/em\u003e malcontents might observe that the show tends to do the same thing over and over again and that the formula is getting stale. The first part is accurate enough; the second isn’t necessarily so. Season 2 more wholeheartedly used \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/10/how-stranger-things-2-explores-trauma/544199/?utm_source=feed\"\u003emonsters as a metaphor for trauma\u003c/a\u003e, and the experience of having things happen to you that feel grotesquely, inexplicably alien. Season 3, with its recurring asides about capitalism (Ferguson’s scene-stealing Erica, it turns out, is a tiny plutocrat) and its energetic exploration of the suspicious recesses of the human psyche, offers up a show for America’s birthday that’s more nuanced than it initially seems. A free-market economic system can be both impossibly damaging to small businesses (see: the new arrival of the Starcourt Mall in Hawkins) and a preferable alternative to the authoritarian communism of America’s 1980s enemies. Pop-cultural works can be ludicrously jingoistic and yet oddly innocent. Overactive imaginations can be dangerously irrational while also being the hallmark of great storytellers everywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat these ideas come down to, in the show’s thrillingly propulsive and self-consciously familiar conclusion, is the nature of a country that fully believes it’s the greatest in the world while also being well aware of its own capacity for destruction. If each decade has its cultural touchstones, the products of the 1980s sing out their ballads of good versus evil, their mythical vanquishers, and their naïveté that endures beyond all credibility. And so the paranoia and the ingenuousness of \u003cem\u003eStranger Things\u003c/em\u003e go naturally hand in hand. Looking around the Hawkins Fourth of July fair in one scene, taking in the fried foods and the rigged games and the “ugly decadence” of it all, Murray says, with cheerful pleasure, “It doesn’t get more American than this, my friend.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/_hpWim9zWJ0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/_hpWim9zWJ0/","published":"2019-07-04T14:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-593185"}]},{"url":"https://feeds.feedburner.com/time/topstories?format=xml","items":[{"title":"Justice Department Says It Was ‘Instructed’ by President Trump to Explore Ways to Put Citizenship Question on the Census","content":"\u003caside class=\"right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad\" id=\"right-rail__ad-5620274\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module\" data-src=\"https://time.com/5620274/trump-census-citizenship-question-department-of-justice/\" data-widget-id=\"SB_2\" data-ob-template=\"timemag\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePresident Donald Trump\u0026rsquo;s Wednesday morning announcement that he still aimed to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census, despide a serious Supreme Court setback, appears to coincide with the Department of Justice being \u0026#8220;instructed\u0026#8221; to find a way to include it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1146435093491277824\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003etweet\u003c/a\u003e, the President contradicted his own Department of Commerce and the Department of Justice, which \u003ca href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/02/census-wont-include-citizenship-question-on-2020-questionnaire-1395933\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003ehad confirmed on Tuesday night\u003c/a\u003e that the Census will not include a question about citizenship.

And when El was forced to use her powers to remove the piece of the Mind Flayer that had invaded her when it took a bite out of her leg, her telekinetic tank was clearly left on empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuckily, Hopper, Joyce and Murray (Brett Gelman) showed up just in time to lend the kids a much-needed assist in the battle against both the Mind Flayer and the Russians.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eGriswold Family, Scoop Troop and Bald Eagle\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter quickly sharing everything they had learned with one another, the group decided to split into three different factions: Scoop Troop \u0026mdash; Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo), Steve (Joe Keery), Robin (Maya Hawke) and Erica (Priah Ferguson) \u0026mdash; Griswold Family \u0026mdash; Eleven, Mike, Will, Lucas, Max (Sadie Sink), Jonathan and Nancy (Natalia Dyer) \u0026mdash; and Bald Eagle \u0026mdash; Murray, Joyce and Hopper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe plan was that Scoop Troop would drive to Dustin\u0026#8217;s radio tower where the walkie talkie signal was strong enough for Dustin and Erica to provide guidance to Murray, Joyce and Hopper as they infiltrated the underground Russian base. Meanwhile, Griswold Family would head to safety.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut when Griswold Family discovered that Billy \u0026mdash; who was waiting outside in his car \u0026mdash; had cut Nancy\u0026#8217;s ignition cable, they had no choice but to retreat back inside Starcourt Mall. And that\u0026#8217;s when the Mind Flayer monster showed up right after.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThe Final Battle of Starcourt\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith El unable to use her powers to defend herself or her friends against the Mind Flayer, Griswold Family was in a tight spot \u0026mdash; especially after El, Mike and Max were separated from the rest of the group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill, Lucas, Jonathan and Nancy eventually managed to make it back outside and \u0026mdash; thanks to Steve showing up just in time to ram Billy\u0026#8217;s car \u0026mdash; drive away. The Mind Flayer monster followed, giving El, Mike and Max a chance to try to make their own escape. Unfortunately, Billy spotted them trying to make a run for it, and forced back inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, after agreeing that they would finally go on an actual date, Hopper and Joyce hit a snag when the vault code that Murray had given them turned out to be incorrect. Luckily, Dustin was able to get in touch with his previously elusive Camp Know Where girlfriend Suzie, who helpfully provided the number that correlates with \u003ca href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/Plancks-constant\"  rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePlanck\u0026rsquo;s Constant\u003c/a\u003e \u0026mdash; a.k.a. the vault code \u0026mdash; following a rousing rendition of the \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://time.com/4475561/neverending-story-google-doodle/\"  rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eNeverEnding Story\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/em\u003etheme song.

He then carried her out to the food court, where the Mind Flayer monster was waiting. The monster was briefly distracted when Lucas, Will, Jonathan, Nancy, Steve and Robin began pelting it with the fireworks that Lucas stole from the grocery store. But it still seemed like all hope may be lost for El when Billy pinned her down to prevent her from escaping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a last ditch attempt to bring Billy back to himself, El began describing the memory she had seen of him surfing on the beach while his mother watched. El\u0026#8217;s recollection of Billy\u0026#8217;s happiest memory somehow broke through the Mind Flayer\u0026#8217;s hold on him and his true self reemerged long enough for him to sacrifice himself to save El.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnderground, Hopper managed to defeat the Russian assassin, but was left inside the room with the exploding key when Joyce closed the gate to the Upside Down.

Unfortunately, this meant that El and Mike, Jonathan and Nancy, and Will and all his friends had to say goodbye to one another \u0026mdash; a scene that was especially painful after El had just told Mike that she loved him. And while El\u0026#8217;s powers were still tapped out, reading the speech that Hopper had written to give to her and Mike at the beginning of the summer at least seemed to give her some closure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eEnd Credits Scene\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003cem\u003eStranger Things \u003c/em\u003eseason 3 mid-credits scene transported fans to what appeared to be a top-secret prison in Kamchatka, Russia.

But when the emergency operator picks up, flashbacks of what the Mind Flayer had just done to him keep him silent. Billy stumbles out of the phone booth as red lightning flashed across the sky \u0026mdash; a surefire sign that he had somehow become linked to the Upside Down \u0026mdash; to find a group of mysterious figures walking toward him. The group\u0026#8217;s leader then steps forward to reveal that he is a carbon copy of Billy himself. Flash-forward to later in the episode when a distressed Billy recalls the previous night\u0026#8217;s events and remembers his Upside Down self\u0026#8217;s message. \u0026#8220;I want you to build,\u0026#8221; he tells Billy. \u0026#8220;What you see.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter coming back to himself on the lifeguard chair, Billy flees to the pool\u0026#8217;s showers as the red mark on his arm begins to pulse and spread, indicating that the Mind Flayer has activated itself inside him. It is then that fellow lifeguard Heather (Francesca Reale) comes to check on him, and Billy \u0026mdash; despite managing to leave Karen unharmed earlier in the episode \u0026mdash; is no longer able to resist the Mind Flayer\u0026#8217;s hold on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlayed Billy kidnaps Heather and takes her to the old steel works, where he \u0026#8220;feeds\u0026#8221; her to the Mind Flayer to allow it to take control of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eChapter Three: \u0026#8220;The Case of the Missing Lifeguard\u0026#8221;\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt should come as no surprise that the first person in Hawkins to realize there\u0026#8217;s something wrong with Billy is Eleven, who catches a glimpse of what he was doing to Heather after she and Max decide to use her telepathic powers to spy on him. Unfortunately, the part of the Mind Flayer inside Billy also caught a glimpse of El and recognized her as the one who had closed the gate to the Upside Down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEl and Max (Sadie Sink) quickly set off on a mission to figure out what\u0026#8217;s going on. First stop: Billy\u0026#8217;s bathroom, where they discover both the remains of an ice bath \u0026mdash; a nod to the Mind Flayer\u0026#8217;s penchant for seeking out cooler temperatures \u0026mdash; and Heather\u0026#8217;s bloodied lifeguard whistle. El then tunes into Heather\u0026#8217;s headspace and sees her submerged in Billy\u0026#8217;s ice-filled bathtub begging for help before she was sucked away into its watery depths. Just like with Billy, it seems that Heather\u0026#8217;s true self had become trapped inside of her after the Mind Flayer invaded her body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis becomes clearer in the final scene of the episode, when flayed Billy and Heather violently attack Heather\u0026#8217;s parents with the intent of recruiting them to join the Mind Flayer\u0026#8217;s hive mind army.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eChapter Four: \u0026#8220;The Sauna Test\u0026#8221;\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"inline-portrait_small_2x alignnone \"\u003e\u003cimg data-attachment-id=\"5612158\" data-permalink=\"https://time.com/5614746/stranger-things-3-billy/stranger-things-season-3-03/\" data-orig-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/stranger-things-season-3-03.jpg?quality=85\" data-orig-size=\"2400,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"Netflix\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Stranger Things\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1551331235\",\"copyright\":\"Courtesy of Netflix\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"3\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"PHOTOS: Stranger Things 3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/stranger-things-season-3-03.jpg?quality=85\u0026w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/stranger-things-season-3-03.jpg?quality=85\u0026w=600\" src=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/stranger-things-season-3-03.jpg?w=560\u0026#038;quality=85\u0026#038;h=373\" alt=\"Stranger Things 3\" height=\"373\"\u003e\n\u003cfigcaption class=\"image-caption\" \u003e\u003cspan class=\"credit\" \u003eNetflix\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter flayed Billy and Heather finish feeding Heather\u0026#8217;s parents to the Mind Flayer, Billy takes some time off from terrorizing the people of Hawkins to report for duty at the pool.

So instead of seeking him out in person, El decides to use her powers to mentally connect with him \u0026mdash; just like she did with her mom in season 2 \u0026mdash; in hopes of finding the source of the Mind Flayer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter diving into Billy\u0026#8217;s mind, El finds herself inside one of Billy\u0026#8217;s best childhood memories \u0026mdash; showing off his surfing skills to his mom on a beach in California \u0026mdash; in a scene that gives off \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dalmb2bljE8\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003emajor \u003cem\u003eInception \u003c/em\u003evibes\u003c/a\u003e.

But when she tries to emerge from Billy\u0026#8217;s mind, it\u0026#8217;s clear that something has gone wrong. When El removes her blindfold, she is no longer surrounded by her friends in Hopper\u0026#8217;s cabin. Instead, Billy \u0026mdash; acting as the mouth-piece of the Mind Flayer \u0026mdash; is now there with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;You shouldn\u0026#8217;t have looked for me.

But what she hasn\u0026#8217;t seen is that, at that very moment, all of the flayed citizens of Hawkins are returning to the steel works to form one massive Mind Flayer monster. Turns out El was the Mind Flayer\u0026#8217;s main target all along.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eChapter 7: \u0026#8220;The Bite\u0026#8221;\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly doesn\u0026#8217;t appear until midway through episode 7, but his words come back to haunt Eleven when the now-massive Mind Flayer monster shows up at Hopper\u0026#8217;s cabin.

But Billy is hot on their trail. After finding El\u0026#8217;s blood \u0026mdash; which appears to be infused with essence of Mind Flayer \u0026mdash; on the supermarket floor, the Mind Flayer\u0026#8217;s influence over him seems to grow even stronger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eChapter 8: \u0026#8220;The Battle of Starcourt\u0026#8221;\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now, for the grand finale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter El drains her powers by using them to remove the piece of the Mind Flayer that was inside of her bite wound, she is left defenseless against both Billy and the Mind Flayer monster. So when Billy is waiting for the group outside of Starcourt Mall, after cutting Nancy\u0026#8217;s ignition cable, they have no choice but to retreat back inside. The kids are then left with nowhere to go when the Mind Flayer monster bursts through the mall\u0026#8217;s ceiling and traps them in the food court.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe next see Billy chasing after El, Mike and Max after Steve heroically rams his car to allow the rest of the group to escape.

El\u0026#8217;s recollection of Billy\u0026#8217;s happiest memory somehow breaks through the Mind Flayer\u0026#8217;s hold on him, and his true self reemerges long enough for him to sacrifice himself to save El and give Joyce time to close the gate to the Upside Down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProving that his final moments were his and his alone, Billy\u0026#8217;s last words to his sister Max are a simple apology for everything he has done: \u0026#8220;I\u0026#8217;m sorry.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs things stand now, it doesn\u0026#8217;t seem like there\u0026#8217;s any way that Billy could possibly return in season 4.

Their mission: to destroy the Continental Army, capture General Washington and his officers, subdue the colonial uprising, and restore order.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLed by their most storied military leaders, General William Howe and his brother Admiral Richard Howe, the British landed in New York with more than 30,000 troops and a sizeable number of Hessian mercenaries. They attacked an out-matched, out-maneuvered and inexperienced Washington in late August in Brooklyn and quickly surrounded the Continental Army on the east, west and south flanks. With 475 British ships anchored in the East River to the Americans\u0026rsquo; backs, the question for Washington was not: Do they escape? But \u003cem\u003ecould\u003c/em\u003e they escape?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCommandeering whatever would float, Washington\u0026rsquo;s only hope was to use the strong East River current and an unexpected blanket of fog to his advantage and evacuate as many men as possible from Brooklyn Heights to the safety of Manhattan before the British could mobilize and reposition their Navy. Washington was quickly running out of time to retreat and the American Revolution was on the verge of being extinguished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe First Maryland Regiment was deployed to bring up the rear and, sensing imminent disaster, it did the unthinkable. Rallying his remaining 400 men, Major Mordecai Gist turned them toward the massive British war force. Believing the British commanding general was stationed in a stone house at the army\u0026rsquo;s center, the regiment shocked the overwhelming British war force with an unexpected, targeted assault. The Marylanders attacked the British six times, losing scores of men with each surge, then regrouping and hurling themselves again and again at the dazed Brits, in what can be best described as a bloody street brawl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the end, only a handful of Marylanders managed to escape; the majority were killed. The rest were captured or mortally wounded. Washington was brought to tears as he watched the selfless bravery of his young soldiers.

The British found Brooklyn Heights abandoned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, who were these young soldiers who made the ultimate sacrifice to ensure the liberty of future generations? What motivated them? Why isn\u0026rsquo;t this pivotal moment more celebrated?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://time.com/newsletter-history\" \u003e\u003cem\u003eGet your history fix in one place: sign up for the weekly TIME History newsletter\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I began the research for my book \u003cem\u003eSaving Washington\u003c/em\u003e, I assumed that the regiment was a highly trained unit of battle-tested soldiers. The reality was almost as astonishing as the battle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young volunteers were a cross section of the colony of Maryland: wealthy merchants\u0026rsquo; sons, dockworkers, school kids and free and enslaved black youth. Of the original 1,200-man regiment, only four had formal military training. Early in the war, Washington had a difficult time keeping enlistees from running off when they heard the first shots of battle, let alone maintaining discipline as a fighting unit. To think that the devotion of these untrained and untested Maryland kids could drive them beyond their personal fears is hard to imagine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remembered being taught in school that the American Revolution was sparked by the tax burden imposed on the colonists, which particularly infuriated the merchant class. Merchants underwrote each colony\u0026rsquo;s militias and state regiments, essentially financing the revolt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut teenagers wouldn\u0026rsquo;t sacrifice themselves for taxes. Research conducted by the Maryland State Archivist \u003ca href=\"https://msamaryland400.wordpress.com/about/\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003esuggests\u003c/a\u003e that peer pressure, a sense of adventure, and growing anti-British sentiment played a role in why the young men enlisted. Mordecai Gist, who led the Maryland 400, even named his two sons Independent and States. But there\u0026rsquo;s evidence that they were also driven by an even more profound motivation. In many religious circles, the New World was code for the New Jerusalem. The concept that America was special, and that they were chosen by God to create and defend a new type of country, was incessantly preached. They were God\u0026rsquo;s children, not the King\u0026rsquo;s, and they were lectured to reject corrupt and immoral leaders. This drumbeat was heard and deeply absorbed by these young men. The boys of the Maryland 400 believed they were fighting with a divine purpose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, why has this dramatic act of heroism not been celebrated as one of America\u0026rsquo;s finest hours?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe celebrate our winners. The battles won. Our championship teams. The gold medals earned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn spite of the Battle of Brooklyn being the \u003ca href=\"https://theoldstonehouse.org/history/battle-of-brooklyn/\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003elargest\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://www.battlefields.org/learn/revolutionary-war/battles/brooklyn\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003ebloodiest\u003c/a\u003e battle of the American Revolution, the Americans were completely routed. A humiliated Washington almost lost the war that day. It was not a moment of celebration, but one of desperation. A moment the country wanted to forget.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut in a larger sense, the Maryland 400\u0026rsquo;s sacrifice at this most pivotal moment in American history now shines through the dense fog of history. Like the legendary Spartans of Thermopylae, America\u0026rsquo;s most important, yet most forgotten heroes, should serve as a beacon \u0026mdash; an illuminating reminder of the selfless devotion of true patriotism.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg class=\"alignleft\" src=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/long-view.png?w=150\u0026#038;h=150\" alt=\"The Long View\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHistorians\u0026#8217; perspectives on how the past informs the present\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eChris Formant is the author of \u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Saving-Washington/Chris-Formant/9781682618325\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003eSaving Washington: The Forgotten Story of the Maryland 400 and The Battle of Brooklyn\u003c/a\u003e, \u003cem\u003eavailable now.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/time/topstories/~4/Ue_u-97kCrg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/Ue_u-97kCrg/","published":"2019-07-04T13:00:18Z","guid":"http://time.com/?p=5617055"},{"title":"A Nuclear Reactor on Fire-Damaged Submarine Remains Safe and ‘Operational,’ Russian Authorities Say","content":"\u003caside class=\"right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad\" id=\"right-rail__ad-5620732\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module\" data-src=\"https://time.com/5620732/russia-submarine-fire-nuclear-reactor/\" data-widget-id=\"SB_2\" data-ob-template=\"timemag\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(MOSCOW) \u0026mdash; The nuclear reactor on one of the Russian navy\u0026#8217;s research submersibles hasn\u0026#8217;t been damaged in a fire that killed 14 seamen, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said Thursday, adding that the vessel would be put back into service after repairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Defense Ministry said the 14 seamen were killed by toxic fumes from Monday\u0026#8217;s blaze, the navy\u0026#8217;s worst accident in more than a decade.

A trillion of them, maybe more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there\u0026#8217;s enough room, Swiss scientists say. Even with existing cities and farmland, there\u0026#8217;s enough space for new trees to cover 3.5 million square miles (9 million square kilometers), they reported in Thursday\u0026#8217;s journal Science. That area is roughly the size of the United States.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe study calculated that over the decades, those new trees could suck up nearly 830 billion tons (750 billion metric tons) of heat-trapping carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. That\u0026#8217;s about as much carbon pollution as humans have spewed in the past 25 years. Much of that benefit will come quickly because trees remove more carbon from the air when they are younger, the study authors said. The potential for removing the most carbon is in the tropics.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;This is by far \u0026mdash; by thousands of times \u0026mdash; the cheapest climate change solution\u0026#8221; and the most effective, said study co-author Thomas Crowther, a climate change ecologist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSix nations with the most room for new trees are Russia, the United States, Canada, Australia, Brazil and China.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore his research, Crowther figured that there were other more effective ways to fight climate change besides cutting emissions, such as people switching from meat-eating to vegetarianism. But, he said, tree planting is far more effective because trees take so much carbon dioxide out of the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThomas Lovejoy, a George Mason University conservation biologist who wasn\u0026#8217;t part of the study, called it \u0026#8220;a good news story\u0026#8221; because planting trees would also help stem the loss of biodiversity. Planting trees is not a substitute for weaning the world off burning oil, coal and gas, the chief cause of global warming, Crowther emphasized. \u0026#8220;None of this works without emissions cuts,\u0026#8221; he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNor is it easy or realistic to think the world will suddenly go on a tree-planting binge, although many groups have started, Crowther said. \u0026#8220;It\u0026#8217;s certainly a monumental challenge, which is exactly the scale of the problem of climate change,\u0026#8221; he said. And as the Earth warms, and especially as the tropics dry, tree cover is being lost, he noted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe researchers used Google Earth to see what areas could support more trees, while leaving room for people and crops.

Iran\u0026rsquo;s oil production has dropped by 1.5 million barrel a day over the past year, poleaxing the Islamic Republic\u0026rsquo;s economy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Grace 1, able to ship 2 million barrels of crude oil, was intercepted by detachments of Royal Marines and Gibraltarian police, who boarded the tanker from a helicopter and speed boat in the early hours of Thursday morning. The ship is now anchored near Gibraltar, a British overseas territory on Spain\u0026rsquo;s southern tip that overlooks the strait between the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;We have detained the vessel and its cargo,\u0026rdquo; said Fabian Picardo, Gibraltar\u0026rsquo;s chief minister. \u0026ldquo;This action arose from information giving the Gibraltar government reasonable grounds to believe that the vessel, Grace 1, was acting in breach of European Union sanctions against Syria.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGibraltar didn\u0026rsquo;t say where the crude came from, but ship tracking data compiled by Bloomberg showed the vessel loaded at Iran\u0026rsquo;s Kharg Island oil terminal in mid-April. Several weeks later, the ship began a journey around the bottom of Africa, passing Cape Town in early June, rather than taking the more direct route through the Suez Canal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIran\u0026rsquo;s decision to lodge a diplomatic complaint shows Tehran isn\u0026rsquo;t attempting to disavow the cargo\u0026rsquo;s origin. Seyyed Abbas Mousavi, a spokesman for Iran\u0026rsquo;s foreign ministry, said on state TV that Britain\u0026rsquo;s move was \u0026#8220;a kind of extraterritorial sanction\u0026#8221; that could \u0026#8220;escalate tension in the region.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBritain\u0026rsquo;s Foreign Office confirmed that its ambassador had been summoned. Earlier in the day, Theresa May\u0026rsquo;s spokesman had offered London\u0026rsquo;s full support for Gibraltar\u0026rsquo;s actions. \u0026ldquo;We welcome this firm action to enforce EU sanctions against the Syrian regime,\u0026rdquo; the prime minister\u0026rsquo;s spokesman, James Slack, told reporters in London. \u0026ldquo;This sends a clear message that violation of the sanctions is unacceptable.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe row comes at a difficult time in Anglo-Iranian relations. Last month, London joined Washington in blaming Iran for attacks on two tankers in the Gulf of Oman. The U.K. is also campaigning for the release of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a British woman imprisoned in Iran after being accused of spying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Grace 1\u0026rsquo;s voyage to the Mediterranean was circuitous, providing plenty of time to plan today\u0026rsquo;s action. The distance from Iran to Syria, sailing around Africa, is about 23,300 kilometers (14,500 miles), compared with just 6,600 kilometers via the Red Sea and Suez Canal. A ship the size of the Grace 1, known as a Very Large Crude Carrier, or VLCC, can\u0026rsquo;t pass through the canal fully loaded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVLCCs have the option of transiting the canal by discharging half their cargo, sending the oil through the Sumed Pipeline, and pick it up again in the Mediterranean, but the pipeline\u0026rsquo;s owners have refused to accept Iranian crude since 2012.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIran has regularly supplied Syria with crude oil since the country descended into civil war in 2011. Iran backs the government headed by President Bashar Al-Assad, which has been sanctioned for most of this decade due to its bloody crackdown on the country\u0026rsquo;s civilians. Syria receives Iranian crude despite the embargo. It imported at least 32,000 barrels a day in 2018 and 66,000 in 2017, according to tanker tracking data compiled by Bloomberg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGibraltar said Grace 1 was destined for the Baniyas refinery, which is owned by the Syrian government and is subject to both U.S. and EU sanctions.

Absolutely. Because I want to drive sexual assault, unwanted sexual contact to zero in the Coast Guard,\u0026#8221; Schultz said. \u0026#8220;Will we do that in my lifetime?

It’s immediately clear that our adorable tweens have sprouted into full-on teens. And between the constant makeout sessions that Eleven (\u003ca href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm5611121/\"\u003eMillie Bobbie Brown\u003c/a\u003e) and Mike (\u003ca href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6016511/\"\u003eFinn Wolfhard\u003c/a\u003e) are having and the disinterest that some members of the group are feeling toward Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons, the gang is starting to grow apart. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"lYxKTb\"\u003eBut that’s not entirely a bad thing, and \u003cem\u003eStranger Things\u003c/em\u003e capitalizes on the opportunity to try out some new character pairings. Dustin (\u003ca href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm7140802/\"\u003eGaten Matarazzo\u003c/a\u003e), newly back from summer camp, winds up bonding even more with his old pal Steve (Joe Keery), whose season two role as an accidental babysitter made him a \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/10/30/16569330/dad-steve-harrington-stranger-things-2-memes\"\u003ebreakout meme star\u003c/a\u003e. Steve, in turn, is working at the new Starcourt Mall; he’s serving ice cream in the food court’s Scoops Ahoy, where he’s regularly mocked by his deadpan coworker Robin (\u003ca href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1638321/\"\u003eMaya Hawke\u003c/a\u003e) and strategically undermined by mall patron and ice cream connoisseur Erica (\u003ca href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm7394207/?ref_=tt_cl_t17\"\u003ePriah Ferguson\u003c/a\u003e).

Hopper turns to Will’s mom Joyce (\u003ca href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000213/\"\u003eWinona Ryder\u003c/a\u003e) for help, but since he isn’t ready to listen to her, his efforts only serve to drive a wedge between El and Mike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-float-right\"\u003e\u003caside id=\"CU84GM\"\u003e\u003cdiv data-anthem-component=\"ratingcard\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"rating\":3.5,\"title\":\"Stranger Things season 3\"}'\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"CI4Pzw\"\u003eMuch to the chagrin of Will (\u003ca href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6907855/\"\u003eNoah Schnapp\u003c/a\u003e), his friends all seem way more interested in having girlfriends than in embarking on new D\u0026amp;D adventures, and as the group’s only late bloomer or asexual and/or queer kid, he’s feeling pretty left out. He’s also distracted by his constant sense that the Mind Flayer — the giant spider-like monster that came from the Upside Down to threaten Hawkins in season two — is still lurking around town, despite the closing of the gate between worlds in the season two finale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ErDQAO\"\u003eMeanwhile, Mike’s older sister Nancy (\u003ca href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3034501/\"\u003eNatalia Dyer\u003c/a\u003e) has started working as an intern at the local newspaper, alongside her boyfriend (and Will’s older brother) Jonathan (\u003ca href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6390427/\"\u003eCharlie Heaton\u003c/a\u003e). But while Jonathan is seen as a star employee, Nancy is constantly belittled and mocked by the paper’s top editors, all of whom are men. She’s eager to find a story that will allow her to prove herself as a reporter, and the one she decides to pursue is grisly — it seems there’s an infestation of diseased rats who are eating fertilizer and other chemical substances all over town. Let’s be clear: Never in a zillion years would a teenage girl decide to start developing her journalistic beat around diseased rats, but sure, \u003cem\u003eStranger Things\u003c/em\u003e, you can have this one. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"wqYYpS\"\u003eThe rats, as it turns out, are indirectly\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003econnected to a major underworld conspiracy — literally. A group of evil Russians have built a covert underground lab beneath the Starcourt Mall food court (stay with me here), and they’re working to secure access to the Upside Down. Why they’re doing this is never explained. But after Dustin intercepts a strange coded message spoken in Russian and transmitted from the mall itself, he — along with Steve and Robin — can’t help but investigate, and the trio’s quest to infiltrate the lab keeps them busy for most of the season (not least because they end up trapped there for a while).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"qOX0Js\"\u003eThe Russians are presumably why Will keeps sensing that the Mind Flayer is back to wreak havoc on Hawkins; it seems they’ve already opened the gate just enough to let the monster through. Their experiments involve a huge electromagnetic “key” intended to open the gate at will — a detail we ultimately learn because Joyce becomes obsessed with why her refrigerator magnets aren’t working like they should. She ropes Hopper into investigating with her, and he plays along mainly because he wants to spend time with her, in hopes of finding romance. But her instincts that the fridge magnets are symptoms of a bigger problem are correct, and before long, she and Hopper are being pursued by an evil Arnold Schwarzenegger figure who’s attempting to keep them from learning more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"tVkHP0\"\u003eThese disparate stories begin to converge as Eleven, Mike, Lucas, Max, and Will realize that something disturbing is happening with Max’s bully of an older brother, Billy (\u003ca href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4223882/\"\u003eDacre Montgomery\u003c/a\u003e). Billy has actually become possessed by the Mind Flayer, and it’s using him as a vehicle to possess more people all over town.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"DQA159\"\u003eLike the rats Nancy is investigating, the Mind Flayer’s newly possessed victims are voraciously eating fertilizer and other chemical substances. Once they’ve consumed enough, they explode, and their bodies melt into bloody, gelatinous puddles that contain a piece of the Mind Flayer’s sentience. These puddles are capable of merging with each other to form a terrifying monster that resembles something like season one’s Demogorgon \u003cem\u003ecombined\u003c/em\u003e with the Mind Flayer: It’s got long, spider-like arms and the Demogorgon’s layered, petal-like mouth, as well as the convenient ability to collapse back into a puddle of unkillable goo. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"82X5WU\"\u003eOh, and as more people become possessed by the Mind Flayer, the new monster simply gets bigger and bigger. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"k8QJqG\"\u003eAll of this is highly silly, especially given some of the odd writing choices in play. For example, \u003cem\u003eStranger Things\u003c/em\u003e is at pains to explain how electromagnetic fields work, but it makes no attempt to clarify how eating fertilizer transforms possessed humans into a sentient, scalable goo-monster. Nor does it give a reason for why evil Russians showed up in Indiana to try to reopen the gate to the Upside Down. I guess “because they’re evil Russians” and “because it’s the Upside Down” are expected to serve as satisfying answers, but make no mistake: Season three is more or less an eight-episode romp whose sense of urgency is often undermined by its patently ridiculous plot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Yx05Qt\"\u003eAnd for the most part, that’s perfectly fine. It stands to reason that fans who are showing up for \u003cem\u003eStranger Things 3\u003c/em\u003e are doing so primarily for their favorite characters, for the charming dynamics between those characters, and for the ’80s nostalgia that \u003cem\u003eStranger Things\u003c/em\u003e delivers in spades. The season offers plenty of all those things, wrapped around a plot that never takes itself too seriously. Which makes sense, given that it’s set in (and underneath) a mall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"aynjOd\"\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eStranger Things\u003c/em\u003e has learned a lot since season two — but still hasn’t mastered its storytelling craft\u003c/h3\u003e\n  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e7kjhFoMNnT5OSPwUZ3E4qK7IbI=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16684601/st8.jpg\"\u003e\n      \u003ccite\u003eCourtesy of Netflix\u003c/cite\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003eHey, remember this relationship? Apparently it’s still kinda happening!\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"kNDMPL\"\u003eThe thing about \u003cem\u003eStranger Things\u003c/em\u003e — and I think this is especially true in season three — is that the show has an endless supply of charm and an endless supply of love for its characters, ’80s tropes, and weird monsters. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"8RjjJ8\"\u003eThe problem is that the show never really presents stories that are as sophisticated as they are well-meaning. More specifically, series creators the Duffer brothers (who share writing credit on four of season three’s eight episodes with an unknown, \u003ca href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm10115576/\"\u003eJovan Taylor\u003c/a\u003e) seem to care a lot about their characters, but not enough to give them meaningful relationships and backstories that don’t feel a bit pasted-on and rote. For instance, the choice to keep Eleven and Hopper apart for most of season three is a strange one that results in their entire relationship being narrated in an awkward voiceover during the last 20 minutes of the finale. Why doesn’t \u003cem\u003eStranger Things\u003c/em\u003e just show us the two of them bonding, instead of telling us it happened?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"cCHV5b\"\u003eThe same goes for much of the season’s other substantive character-building elements. One focal character, Billy, is a nominally queer-coded bully whose father is abusive; his little sister Max is still growing up in their father’s home. Instead of really delving into their family dynamic — something that also got short shrift in season two — season three instead tries to redeem Billy through a series of \u003cem\u003eInception\u003c/em\u003e-y childhood flashbacks during which Eleven, who’s psychically connected to him, decides that he’s still a good person. These scenes are frankly kinda boring, and given that in season two, we saw Billy brutally beat up Steve, make implied racist threats toward Lucas, and exhibit terrifying and controlling behavior over his sister, they aren’t very convincing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"RHSNWZ\"\u003eIt’s more neglect of a lot of backstory that’s been teased but never fully explored. But this is generally how \u003cem\u003eStranger Things\u003c/em\u003e operates. For instance, three seasons in, we still know barely anything about the Upside Down, including what, if anything, lives inside of it apart from evil monsters, let alone why those evil monsters are so eager to cross over to Earth and kill everyone. At this point, it’s functioning as a generic, \u003cem\u003eBuffy the Vampire Slayer\u003c/em\u003e-style Hellmouth, which is disappointing given its Lovecraftian potential to reveal a totally new, horrifying world. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"80ArUw\"\u003eIn many instances, \u003cem\u003eStranger Things\u003c/em\u003e’ writing stops just short of meaningful follow-through. For example, many critics, \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/11/8/16623300/stranger-things-2-female-characters-max-eleven\"\u003eincluding those at Vox\u003c/a\u003e, have bemoaned the lack of narrative agency given to women in previous seasons. \u003cem\u003eStranger Things\u003c/em\u003e has clearly heard those criticisms, and season three answers them by letting women drive much of its plot; indeed, they frequently lead their male counterparts by the nose, and it’s mildly wonderful to watch. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"1l5SMu\"\u003eBut in the end, a lot of these character dynamics and subplots just don’t matter. We never get to see how Nancy’s \u003cem\u003eWorking Girl\u003c/em\u003e subplot resolves because her antagonists, uh, become possessed monsters and explode. Fair enough! What journalist \u003cem\u003ehasn’t\u003c/em\u003e seen an abusive editor suddenly turn into a predatory gelatinous mass? But the show kind of forgets about her career in the home stretch. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"REuMuL\"\u003eIt also seems to forget that Max still has to return to her violent home life, now with an even more complex family dynamic. And it seems to forget about Nancy’s mom, Mrs. Wheeler, completely, after making a halfhearted effort to develop her into a three-dimensional character earlier in the season.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"VMPKfV\"\u003eAdditionally, I have a lot of feelings about season three’s odd directorial choices, particularly regarding its choppy, confusing editing and the pacing and story turns of its final episode. “The Battle of Starcourt” is so sluggish — and so sloppily, anticlimactically staged — that it’s hard to believe it was directed by the same team who helmed season two’s stellar finale. And while we’re clearly not supposed to believe that the finale’s most shocking moment is more than a giant fake-out, the scene in which it happens is so poorly executed that I \u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e my editor both almost missed what was happening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"oUcVRU\"\u003eDo any of these concerns ultimately matter? Probably not! Bring on season four!\u003c/h3\u003e\n  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5UMz_3eY3UhB7ghBGN2sOZ7KH-c=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16684589/st1.jpg\"\u003e\n      \u003ccite\u003eNetflix\u003c/cite\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003eAll for one and one for all!\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"6pgXai\"\u003eThe ultimate question is how much season three’s imperfections should matter to \u003cem\u003eStranger Things\u003c/em\u003e fans, if at all. When the show is focused on letting its characters enjoy their wacky shenanigans, there’s very little it can do wrong. I’m rooting for Nancy to be the next Lois Lane! I could watch Dustin and Steve bicker over a ham radio for eight more seasons! I will passionately follow Will Byers into every Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons campaign, and I don’t even like Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons! \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"xRuI1J\"\u003eThe show clearly knows this, and it knows exactly what people are watching for, which is why the climactic moment of the season arguably has nothing to do with the plot, and everything to do with finding out that Dustin’s girlfriend Suzie (\u003ca href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm8380650/?ref_=nv_sr_1?ref_=nv_sr_1\"\u003eGabriella Pizzolo\u003c/a\u003e) not only exists but can sing a mean rendition of that classic 1984 nerd hit “\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzE0Sq2-Yhg\"\u003eThe Neverending Story\u003c/a\u003e” — the theme to the children’s fantasy film of the same name. This scene, in which Dustin and Suzie sing the duet together, is a literal love song to everything \u003cem\u003eStranger Things\u003c/em\u003e represents to its fans: a love of the 1980s, of geek culture and fantasy, of childhood whimsy, and above all, of friendships.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"TVBPuP\"\u003eThat’s also perhaps why the final moments of the season, in which we see some of the characters depart for places unknown — and receive a huge hint that one character is now in Siberia — don’t feel as weighty as they otherwise might. We’re onto \u003cem\u003eStranger Things\u003c/em\u003e. It’s not going to split up this gang forever; it loves them all too much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"2h4FBI\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eStranger Things\u003c/em\u003e deserves all due credit for not only creating a deeply lovable ensemble of characters but continuing to write them in ways that foreground their charm, sense of humor, and love for each other.

That’s because these regions are home to huge amount of biodiversity and play a major role in the planet’s air and water cycle.

A purely monetary calculation can backfire if the value of cutting down the forest suddenly increases. And many people who live on cleared forests subsist off their farming, so they need to be compensated and given alternative livelihoods if that land is going to be repurposed.

That means restoration efforts will have more climate benefits the sooner they are implemented and yield diminishing returns over time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"cPRTCB\"\u003eDuncanson, however, said that it’s not clear what direction carbon absorption will go under climate change.

A French politician, Lagarde, 63, has run the International Monetary Fund since 2011.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf she\u0026#8217;s confirmed, both the ECB and the US Federal Reserve—the world\u0026#8217;s two most influential central banks—will be headed by lawyers, not economists. It was a good run while it lasted. Forty years ago, economists convinced the world that good monetary policy needed to be free of political influence in order to focus on long-term considerations in a more global and connected financial system. As a result,  governments installed technocrats with deep academic and market expertise to head central banks. But following the financial crisis of 2008 and a rising wave of economic populism, technical expertise and knowledge of monetary policy does not cut it anymore. Even supposedly apolitical institutions now need to be run by people with great political instincts and, often, they are not economists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThe rise of the technocrats\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eModern monetary policy aims to keep inflation and unemployment low and predictable. And by that standard, economists did a pretty good job when they were running things. Up until the 1970s politicians saw interest rates as a tool to achieve their political goals, and the result was often high and unpredictable inflation. Academics argued for independent central bankers who targeted price stability and low unemployment, long-term goals that sometimes conflict with short-term political interests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn economist ran the Fed for 40 years until Jerome Powell succeeded Janet Yellen last year. Economists have always run the ECB for its much shorter, 21-year history. And their regimes coincided with low, stable inflation and—with the notable exception of the Great Recession—low unemployment. Many of the factors that caused the recession were beyond the power of the central banks, but the Fed and ECB managed to keep their economies out of a depression, by cutting rates, buying long-dated securities, charging interest rates on reserves, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/fed_credit_programs\"\u003eoffering dollar liquidity swap arrangements\u003c/a\u003e to foreign central banks. To some extent, economists have become victims of their own success: Inflation has been low for so long many don\u0026#8217;t remember the economic harm it can cause. As the Fed expanded its scope beyond inflation management to objectives like financial stability, it subject itself to more political scrutiny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNonetheless, in an era that put a premium on expertise, international coordination, and technocratic ability, economists were the right people for the job. But we are not in those times anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eIt is now a political job\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe now live in a world where \u003ca href=\"https://qz.com/1646351/pubic-policy-is-ignoring-mainstream-economics/\"\u003epoliticians, \u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MFKR1VG/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8\u0026amp;btkr=1\u0026tag=quartz07-20\"\u003ejournalists,\u003c/a\u003e and the public are wary of expertise and economic populism threatens central bank independence.

Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdogan and India’s Narendra Modi also \u003ca href=\"https://www.economist.com/leaders/2019/04/13/the-independence-of-central-banks-is-under-threat-from-politics\"\u003equestion the value of central bank independence\u003c/a\u003e. In light of this, central bank heads are largely becoming the public face of an organization who must master the political games necessary to keep monetary policy free from government interference.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI admit I was \u003ca href=\"https://qz.com/1117460/jerome-powell-will-be-the-first-non-economist-fed-chair-in-nearly-40-years-does-that-matter/\"\u003eskeptical of Powell\u003c/a\u003e, because I thought the Fed chair role needed to be a leading thinker in monetary policy. But Powell\u0026#8217;s relationship with his vice chair, Richard Clarida, offers a good model that could be the future of central banking. Clarida, and the Fed staff bring the expertise—Clarida has an impressive research background and experience in the financial industry—and Powell can fight the political battles. The heads of central banks may need to have political skills in the future, but central banks still need to be staffed by smart, competent economists. Lagarde has proven herself to be a great political operator, and as head of the IMF, she has lots of experience working with economists. For this era, she may be the best choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, it is high-risk path. Both Powell and Lagarde have enough economic knowledge and humility, to consult with economists, and know when to put economic interests above politics. Future central bankers may not have this wisdom. To be fair, economists don\u0026#8217;t always either.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://qz.com/1657415/ecb-choice-christine-lagarde-is-a-politician-and-thats-good/","published":"2019-07-04T09:00:16Z","guid":"https://qz.com/1657415//"},{"title":"After he was doused with water, Baidu’s CEO is the butt of China’s internet jokes","content":"\u003cimg width=\"1024\" height=\"708\" src=\"https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/RTX6J0GI.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;w=1024\" class=\"attachment-medium_10 size-medium_10 wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/RTX6J0GI.jpg 2200w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/RTX6J0GI.jpg?resize=768,531 768w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/RTX6J0GI.jpg?resize=50,35 50w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/RTX6J0GI.jpg?resize=160,111 160w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/RTX6J0GI.jpg?resize=320,221 320w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/RTX6J0GI.jpg?resize=640,442 640w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/RTX6J0GI.jpg?resize=940,650 940w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/RTX6J0GI.jpg?resize=1600,1106 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn China\u0026#8217;s \u003ca href=\"https://qz.com/1639184/the-guardian-and-washington-post-blocked-by-chinas-great-firewall/\"\u003eseverely censored internet\u003c/a\u003e these days, there are few opportunities for internet users to freely express themselves and have some fun without the fear of repercussions.

In particular, the Russian attitude could be important because the country\u0026#8217;s government has a checkered history with bitcoin, allegedly using it to \u003ca href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/russian-hackers-bitcoin/\"\u003efund interference\u003c/a\u003e in the 2016 US election.

Still, unless the Libra network is geofenced, it could be accessible to Russian users. As such, it\u0026#8217;s worth considering potential misuse, especially given the Russian security apparatus\u0026#8217; past use of bitcoin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn April, the Mueller Report \u003ca href=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/mueller-report-russia-used-bitcoin-fund-dnc-hacks\"\u003econfirmed\u003c/a\u003e agents in Russia\u0026#8217;s military intelligence service \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/13/technology/bitcoin-russian-hacking.html\"\u003eused bitcoin\u003c/a\u003e to finance operations related to the 2016 email hack of the Democratic National Committee.

Technically, Facebook\u0026#8217;s proposal for the Libra network is very similar to bitcoin because both would allow anyone to send or receive digital funds, without government-issued identification or a bank account. The difference arises in that Libra would be redeemable for normal currencies, like the US dollar and euro, and because of that peg, Libra won\u0026#8217;t face bitcoin\u0026#8217;s volatility. Price certainty and a (potential) absence of ID requirements could make Libra attractive to money launderers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRussia is the main source for money laundering in Europe, explained \u003ca href=\"https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/about/experts/list/anders-aslund#fullbio\"\u003eAnders Åslund\u003c/a\u003e, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, an international affairs think tank. He noted that Russia presently lacks significant crypto regulation, and worried that Libra might serve as a boon to financial criminals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBitcoin—and perhaps Libra—should be prohibited around the world because of the threat of money laundering, Åslund said. He also indicated that Facebook\u0026#8217;s compliance with know-your-customer (KYC) requirements from US regulators would be crucial. It seems, he said, like they just want to jump over the issue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCompared to the US and Europe, Russia is less concerned about protecting its economy, observed \u003ca href=\"https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/facebook-libra-must-be-stopped-by-katharina-pistor-2019-06\"\u003eKatharina Pistor\u003c/a\u003e, director for the center on global legal transformation at Columbia University. It will be difficult for any government to exercise authority over the Libra Association, the Swiss nonprofit Facebook has established to oversee the Libra network and reserves, she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;The real concern for me is the scale,\u0026#8221; said Pistor. While Russia is of consequence—and could attempt to infiltrate the network—she expressed even greater concern about the reserves that will eventually undergird the Libra. \u0026#8220;There\u0026#8217;s a scarcity of safe assets,\u0026#8221; Pistor explained. She worried that Facebook and the Libra Association may relax standards for Libra\u0026#8217;s underlying reserves, accepting \u0026#8220;just safe enough,\u0026#8221; like bonds below investment grade. As in the subprime mortgage crisis, the Libra is only as good as the assets it represents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the risk of sounding like an alarmist, Facebook\u0026#8217;s Libra raises concerns about global financial stability and crime. Russia\u0026#8217;s pedestrian response to Libra should probably read as an additional warning.

Waldfogel uses data from market research firm Euromonitor and hotel and restaurant review site TripAdvisor to estimate cuisine trade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe research only looks at food eaten outside the home, as data on cuisines eaten inside the house are not available. It is based on the number of restaurants that serve that cuisine, according to how they are listed on TripAdvisor. Waldfogel uses this as a proxy for that cuisine\u0026#8217;s popularity, because actual sales at those restaurants are not available. Given the various limitations of the research, the study is more a thoughtful attempt to come up with an estimate than a definitive statement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe data show that in the 17 countries for which Waldfogel was able to obtain comprehensive data for 2017, Italian food was one of the three most popular cuisines in in 16 of those countries—the exception is South Korea, where it is fourth, after Korean, Chinese and Japanese. He estimates that Italy \u0026#8220;exported\u0026#8221; about $176 billion of its cuisine to the rest of the world. With $115 billion in exports, China is a distant second.

As my plane descended toward the JFK airport early in the afternoon, the glistening sun bounced on thin sheets of ice floating on the bay, \u003cem\u003eshining like a national guitar\u003c/em\u003e. I had: One new suitcase packed with Italian clothes; a thousand odd euros in the inside pocket of my purse; a sublet lined up; no job; and a large, sealed envelope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside the envelope were all the documents that, together with the immigrant visa on my passport, were going to turn into the green card I had won through \u003ca href=\"https://qz.com/1117324/green-card-lottery-what-is-the-diversity-visa-program-and-what-does-chuck-schumer-have-to-do-with-it/\"\u003ethe Diversity Visa lottery\u003c/a\u003e—a program that assigns a number of permanent residency visas at random to people who come from countries (such as mine, Italy) that are underrepresented in the immigration quotas of the previous five years. There is no scarcity of Italian Americans but, as it turns out, not a lot of Italians move to America anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had applied almost yearly since the first time I visited New York in 2005, on a work trip. In just a couple of days, the city had bewitched me. I got home with an irrational, feverish desire to go back. \u0026#8220;To do what?\u0026#8221; an old boyfriend used to ask. I didn\u0026#8217;t really know. \u0026#8220;Why?\u0026#8221; Another good question to which I didn\u0026#8217;t have an answer. It might be that I come from a \u003ca href=\"https://narratively.com/the-smell-of-america/\"\u003eline of southern Italian people\u003c/a\u003e who have seen in America a promised land. Or that the first day I woke up in New York City, I left my soulless chain hotel in Times Square and walked to Central Park. I found it covered in snow, with Christo\u0026#8217;s Gates standing in the soft morning light. Or that all around town posters pitching New York for the 2012 Olympics (which London eventually won) perfectly conveyed—with the slogan \u0026#8220;the world\u0026#8217;s second home\u0026#8221;— the feeling I had upon landing. I wanted that home to be mine, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpon my arrival at JFK, the immigration officer took my envelope and dispassionately asked me a few routine questions. He checked my documents, took my fingerprints and photo, and explained that I would receive my green card in the mail in a couple of weeks. \u0026#8220;Welcome home,\u0026#8221; he said, as he handed me back my stamped passport.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis greeting was both heartwarming and daunting. Was this really going to become my home?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#8217;s easy, especially if you are European, to be snobby and cynical about America. And I was. For those first few years I scoffed at the idea of naturalization. I loved New York, but to love America was a whole different thing. As time went by, I eventually warmed up to the practical aspects of citizenship—after all, I would get to keep my Italian citizenship, too—but I looked at it as a rational next step, not something I was emotionally invested in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThings changed in 2016 when I followed my first presidential campaign as a resident, and a journalist. I watched the unfathomable rise of Donald Trump as a candidate, and in him I saw a challenge to a set of values that I had grown to respect and love—because America had taught me about them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ways in which racism manifests itself. Feminism. The challenges to LGBTQ rights. These are lessons I learned here. In only a couple of years, this country revealed to me the extent of my privilege—it had showed me that as a white, straight, highly educated, young Christian woman, life is easier for me than for most—and how I could be unwittingly offensive and inconsiderate about it, in a way I had never been forced to consider before. It also taught me how diversity is challenging and forces you to question your beliefs, but in it lies the truest form of freedom. A society that cherishes everyone\u0026#8217;s individuality, recognizing all identities as equal, is the ultimate manifestation of liberty. It reproduces, in the social order, the true miracle of humanity: to be one not in spite of our differences, but because of them—as it is the uniqueness of each of us that is the only thing we truly have in common.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe freedom that comes from respecting and protecting each other\u0026#8217;s uniqueness, a value that I consider quintessentially American, appeared to be suddenly under threat. Like many others, I had thought America would rise above this challenge. That it didn\u0026#8217;t broke my heart in the way only this country can. It was a painful realization: This was not the place I thought it was—not yet. But I wanted it to be, I wanted to fight for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople (New Yorkers, especially) love saying that New York is not America. They think the values I learned and embraced exist in New York in a way they don\u0026#8217;t elsewhere. I was once one of them. But I no longer agree. I think New York, in its embrace of everyone for who they are, is America—it\u0026#8217;s the way this country can be. There is no place more American than a city that shows it\u0026#8217;s worth believing in a countrywide experiment with diversity and integration because it can work, if you keep at.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust weeks after the election, I started my naturalization process in an immigration office in Brooklyn, inside a building with signs in Hebrew, where an officer with a Latin American accent took my biodata, and another gave me a booklet to prepare for my citizenship test. As I went through it, I made note of the chapters of American history I never wanted to be complacent about. The massacre of Native Americans. Slavery. Jim Crow. Internment camps. By becoming American—a white American—I knew it was going to be my responsibility, too, to try and make amends for that; to make this country, my country, as fair as it can be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbout a year later, on a sunny morning at the end of 2018, I entered a courtroom in Brooklyn with a couple hundred strangers from all over the world. I did not know the woman sitting next to me on the bench, smiling in her hot pink lipstick, her hijab beautifully wrapped around her head. I had never seen the older Asian lady in a neon yellow beanie with matching pom-pom, who sat at the end of the bench beaming with joy through her eyes and missing front tooth. I had never met the people sitting behind me, who bonded over being from the Caribbean, or the man who took his hat off as he entered the room, like he was entering church.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the courtroom, the judge told us we were forever going to be ambassadors of our countries. That it was our role as Americans to protect and share our heritage and culture (\u003ca href=\"https://qz.com/493123/just-because-martha-stewart-cooks-pasta-in-one-pan-doesnt-mean-you-should/\"\u003eoh, and I will\u003c/a\u003e). That we were going to make America by carrying forward our identities. An act of rebellion, I thought, against a global tide that increasingly seems to reject the different.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe left the room Americans, having held our hands up and sworn our allegiance to the United States. All of it. After the ceremony, I posed for pictures outside the court building, smiling as I held up my naturalization certificate in New York City\u0026#8217;s best winter light. Around me, newly-minted citizens from all over the world, making their new country richer by adding to its ever-expanding culture their stories, languages, perspectives.

Abrams used for his own Spielberg-aping \u003ci\u003eSuper 8\u003c/i\u003e, but \u003ci\u003eStranger Things\u003c/i\u003e succeeded where \u003ci\u003eSuper 8\u003c/i\u003e failed: It managed to become more than the sum of its well-worn parts, thanks to its supreme binge-ability and its murder's row of gifted, then-unknown child actors. It was also just so brain-bleedingly charming. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd now, three years after \u003ci\u003eStranger Things\u003c/i\u003e first hit Netflix back in 2016, the Duffers are back with another, much-improved third season. Sure, these eight new, action-packed episodes are the usual grab-bag of 1980s nostalgia, but what makes \u003ci\u003eStranger Things 3 \u003c/i\u003esucceed isn't that the Duffers have expanded from cribbing Stephen King to cribbing John Carpenter or whatever; it's that they have finally started borrowing from themselves. It finally feels like the Duffers have figured out what \u003ci\u003eStranger Things\u003c/i\u003e is and what it wants to be—and the series is all the better for it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eStranger Things 3\u003c/i\u003e takes the campy nostalgia and sci-fi tropes that worked in season one, trashes everything that bogged down season two (meaning \u003ca href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2017/11/stranger-things-2-worst-episode-the-lost-sister.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eno more terrible trips to Pittsburgh\u003c/a\u003e), and polishes the whole package into a real summer blockbuster of a season. The action is bigger, the explosions are louder, and the horror is actually, legitimately, scary. (Everyone is also, uh, extraordinarily horny for some reason. But we'll get to that later.) \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSeason three is set in the summer of 1985, picking up half a year after the events of season two left off. \u003ci\u003eBack to the Future\u003c/i\u003e is in theaters. New Coke is tearing America apart. The kids are out of school (Dustin's off at a summer camp), the teens are working summer jobs (Nancy and Jonathan at the local paper, Steve slinging ice cream in a sailor's outfit), and Joyce and the adults in town are reckoning with the death of their downtown at the hands of the shiny, new Starcourt Mall.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf course, this is \u003ci\u003eStranger Things\u003c/i\u003e and all, so the mall's nefarious purposes extend farther than destroying local business. It's also housing a hidden, underground lab where a horde of Russian scientists are using a giant laser beam to bust back into the Upside Down. Why, you ask, are these secret Soviets trying to release the Mind Flayer again? And how can they do it in a massive bunker in Indiana without anyone noticing? These are questions that earlier seasons of \u003ci\u003eStranger Things\u003c/i\u003e might have tried to explain, but season three is confident enough with itself to realize that the answers are irrelevant. The Russians are bad, the Mind Flayer is worse, and the whole secret operation has gone undetected thanks to the town's corrupt, \u003ci\u003eJaws\u003c/i\u003e-ian mayor looking the other way. Got it? Good.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv data-iframely-id=\"l8hyKpX\" data-embedded-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcnHOQ-cHa0\" class=\"article__embed article__embed--iframely\"\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;\" data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"\u003e\u003ciframe data-img=\"\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/l8hyKpX?playerjs=1\" style=\"border:0;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;\" allowfullscreen allow=\"encrypted-media\" data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt may not make a ton of logical sense, but who cares? The episodes move at such a rapid pace that there's no time to consider the intricacies of how, exactly, a foreign government could excavate hundreds of feet beneath a suburban mall under the noses of a bunch of small-time city officials. But it doesn't matter! What does matter is that the Mind Flayer is back, and it has figured out a way to build itself a body in the Rightside-Up World using the guts of exploding rats. (Uh, yeah—there are a lot of exploding rats. So, so many exploding rats.) Netflix has seemingly poured a ton of money into this new season, and the Duffers spent a bunch of it on filling the show with ghastly, Cronenberg body horror. This isn't the first season, where the scariest stuff involved \u003ca href=\"https://strangerthings.fandom.com/wiki/The_Demogorgon\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ea person in some kind of demonic flower suit\u003c/a\u003e. This is a new, more mature \u003ci\u003eStranger Things\u003c/i\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd speaking of more mature: Maybe it's the heat, maybe it's the summer freedom, maybe it's the need for some carnal escape after a few very bad years in Hawkins, but everyone in \u003ci\u003eStranger Things 3\u003c/i\u003e is extremely ready to hook up. Cliché Hot Mom Karen Wheeler spends her time lusting after Resident Bad Boy Billy at the pool as he strolls by like a \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ho7Xkzb2uw\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emulleted Phoebe Cates\u003c/a\u003e; the long-simmering romance between Joyce and Sheriff Hopper finally comes to (sort-of) fruition; Nancy and Jonathan constantly hop either into or out of bed with each other; and Steve Harrington has the hots for his co-worker, Robin—played by season three's breakout star, Maya Hawke, who absolutely slays every scene she's in.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut the real heart of the season isn't the sexploits of Hawkins's horny population, it's the budding love lives of the show's tweens. As the season begins, Mike and Lucas are bumbling their way through awkward romances with Eleven and Max, respectively, and Dustin has supposedly picked up a Mormon girlfriend at camp, although he has trouble supplying proof that she does, in fact, exist. These subplots about young love temper the grotesque bombast of the new season, because the Duffers seem to have learned that \u003ci\u003eStranger Things\u003c/i\u003e works best in the lulls—in the low-stakes, quiet moments between Mike and Eleven, or Steve and Dustin, or Brett Gelman's character and a random Russian hostage, in scenes were the show catches its breath and we're allowed to live alongside the characters for a minute. And \u003ci\u003eStranger Things 3\u003c/i\u003e pulls off both the action and the emotions perfectly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe season's finale takes place, unsurprisingly, inside the Starcourt Mall, and it's the best ending battle of the show to date, even if the thing has more last-minute, \u003ci\u003edeus ex machina\u003c/i\u003e-style saves than a \u003ca href=\"https://www.ancient.eu/sophocles/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSophocles play\u003c/a\u003e. But it's the new season's balance between action-packed set pieces and deep, interpersonal relationships that brings the series to a surprisingly satisfying conclusion. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eStranger\u003c/i\u003e\u003ci\u003e Things\u003c/i\u003e is obviously a tentpole series for Netflix, and the streaming service is bound to continue cranking out seasons or spinoffs until Finn Wolfhard decides to quit acting and commit his life to \u003ca href=\"https://www.nme.com/news/music/stranger-things-star-finn-wolfhard-joins-mac-demarco-stage-2076002\" target=\"_blank\"\u003etouring with Mac Demarco\u003c/a\u003e or whatever. But \u003ci\u003eStranger Things 3\u003c/i\u003e leaves things on a welcome note of resolution, and if the Duffers decide that this is it for the show, then they've managed to end their trilogy of seasons flawlessly—all Pittsburgh subplots aside.\u003c/p\u003e","url":"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/597exq/review-netflix-stranger-things-3-is-scarier-than-ever","published":"2019-07-04T07:00:00Z","guid":"597exq"},{"title":"Southern California Was Just Hit With Its Biggest Earthquake In Years ","content":"\u003cp\u003eSouthern California has been hit with a 6.4 magnitude earthquake on Independence Day. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e According to the United States Geological Survey, the quake hit at 10:33 a.m. Pacific time near the Searles Valley, about 100 miles northeast of LA.

Higher sea surface temperature could slow the growth of these blooms, as happened in 2013, the only year since 2011 without a major bloom. Hu says that he thinks that ocean warming will happen too slowly to effectively control growth (and this would would devastate marine ecosystems in any case). However, climate affects precipitation patterns—which will affect the runoff from the Amazon—and natural factors like ocean upwelling patterns. Deforestation and fertilizer use, if they continue to worsen, will further pollute the oceans with excess nutrients, contributing to more algae growth.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cdiv class=\"article__embed article__embed--vice\" data-related-article=\"true\"\u003e\u003ciframe src=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/embed/article/pgg8dy/running-your-volvo-on-algae-fuel-is-as-hippie-as-it-gets?utm_source=stylizedembed_vice.com\u0026utm_campaign=evy99w\u0026site=vice\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:0px none;margin:0px;\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e Coastal communities have already begun getting creative in their adaptation to this crisis.

It's the messenger of the zodiac, the planet of communication and commerce, and all about moving things around. Ideas and conversations are some of the biggest things about Mercury that you may be familiar with. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e During a Mercury retrograde there can be miscommunications, misunderstandings, delays. It’s a period when people may show up to work late and they'll blame Mercury retrograde, or the proverbial wrench thrown into the plan—anything but business as usual.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e \u003cb\u003e Is it risky to start a relationship during Mercury retrograde?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e People often advise not to start new relationships during Mercury retrograde, but if there's one thing I know, it's that you don’t schedule love. If things are developing, let them develop. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e Just know that part of the connection you have with this person is one that's around learning, communicating with each other, and making space for different communication styles. But that doesn't mean you should put up with any bad behavior! Don't let your date use Mercury retrograde as the excuse for why they didn't call you.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e Another thing to remember: most relationships that break up during a Mercury retrograde end up getting right back together, so don't dump someone unless you want to reunite. You can learn more in my book, \u003ca href=\"https://fave.co/2xrFtf2\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Astrology of Love \u0026 Sex\u003c/a\u003e, which comes out on July 30.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e \u003cb\u003e What else should you avoid during Mercury retrograde?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e Mercury is about communication and negotiation, so it’s a good idea to avoid signing contracts unless you're okay with the possibility that the terms will be changed later. That being said, you can totally use Mercury retrograde to your benefit: Let's say you don't want a commitment to be permanent. Now's a good time to do it, because things are unlikely to remain the same. During Mercury retrograde, we reconsider a lot of the conversations and ideas that have taken place, specifically in the pre-retrograde shadow period.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e Mercury also rules commerce, so it’s ideal to avoid expensive or important purchases at this time. This might not be the best time to splurge if you've been saving up for a new cell phone. Buy it after retrograde because some snafus can take place. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e Mercury's also about getting from one place to another, so during retrograde, watch out for traffic, mixups, and other delays. If you're traveling, double check your itinerary and confirm that you have all the facts straight—make sure that you're boarding the correct flight!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e It can also be a fun time to reconnect with friends from the past. Mercury retrograde can find us running into people we haven't seen in a long time, which isn't always ideal. That said, sometimes you may want conducive astrological weather to, say, text an ex. If you've been meaning to reconnect with someone, Mercury retrograde is actually a good time to do it.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e \u003cb\u003e You mentioned the “pre-retrograde shadow period,” what is that?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e There are two retrograde shadow periods. Mercury entered its pre-retrograde shadow on June 20. Conversations, ideas, and plans you’ve had between June 20 and July 7 are going to be up for review during the retrograde. There’s also the post-retrograde shadow period, which begins when Mercury retrograde ends on July 31, and is complete on August 15. The post-retrograde period is when you move forward around all the things you processed during the retrograde period. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e Things can be confusing when, during retrograde, Mercury retraces the steps that it took before the retrograde, and you feel you’re going back through motions you experienced in the pre-retrograde shadow. It won’t be until after the post retrograde shadow clears that you have all the information. Don’t look at a retrograde as an inconvenience or a waiting game, though—if you do, you’ll be miserable, working against the energy. Try to slow down, relax, turn your mind off a bit instead. It’s a period to pause, to work on projects that were put on the back burner, or to redo what’s already been done.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e Through Mercury retrograde, you’ll have a lot of that \"here we go again\" feeling. You've gone over the idea first in pre shadow, then during the retrograde, and then again during the post shadow. But seen a different way, Mercury retrograde brings us as the ability to stop, pause, reflect, review, and then really make sure that we want to stick with something before going further. It’s amazing for slowing down, for catching your breath, taking a break, and saying, \"I am going to go into work a little bit later than usual because I need time to regroup.\" \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e \u003cb\u003e My birthday falls during Mercury retrograde this year. How should I and other Cancers handle it?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e Have a fun party with all of your friends—especially the ones that you haven't seen in a while. Reach out to people from your past; it's a productive way to work with this energy. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e Pick a spot where none of your friends could get confused about the location, and make sure it's somewhere easy to get to. This birthday may not be the birthday for a dinner reservation at a place where you have to wait for all the guests to arrive before you're seated, because somebody is going to be running late. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e Astrologers call birthdays “solar returns,” or the time when the sun returns to the position it was at the time of your birth. In general, having Mercury retrograde take place during yours tells us that the coming year has a lot to do with reflection, introspective work, and finding a new perspective on life.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e \u003cb\u003e What does it mean when Mercury retrograde is \"in\" a sign? Which sign is this retrograde in?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e In astrology, the planets move through the zodiac (which is comprised of twelve astrological signs) in a “forward” motion. Occasionally, from our perspective on earth, the movement of the planets give the illusion that they’ve reversed their course, though they’re not literally moving backwards. This is called a retrograde. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e Mercury begins its retrograde this time in Leo, a sign that's not afraid of expressing itself. When Mercury retrograde is in Leo, the energy is much more about quiet introspection. It’s a time where we could express ourselves, but we’d rather take a moment of introspection of silence, stillness.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e Leo is a fixed sign, which means it falls in the middle of the season. It symbolizes strength and loyalty. Mercury retrograde in Leo asks us to meditate like a big cat basking in the sun, rather than roaring.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e Leo is also the sign of royalty, and loves to be cool and popular. This means we should be patient about speaking, or we may find ourselves going, \"Did I really just say that?\" Think twice before you send a text message, especially if realize you’re sounding a little snobby or conceited. Leo can think it’s too cool for school on a bad day! On that note, double check who you're even sending those texts to, because retrograde can be a tricky time: you may mean to text your boyfriend, might end up texting your boss instead. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e On July 19, Mercury retrograde will reenter Cancer. Cancer is a totally different energy from Leo, and Mercury in Cancer doesn’t always have the easiest time expressing itself verbally because it’s such an intuitive, nonverbal energy. When this happens, we're working very deeply with our intuition and really thinking about things on a very sensitive level. We're thinking a lot about safety and protection, which are Cancerian themes. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e When Mercury entered Cancer in June, we might have had some things on our mind that we didn't know how to express, because Mercury can have a hard time finding the words when in such an intuitive, watery emotional space. Its dip into fiery Leo for a while, gives us the ability to see it in a new light, and then its retrograde reentering Cancer has us reexamining all of those things that we couldn't put our finger on initially. Now that a second pass gives us a fresh perspective, we're able to reorganize the whole thing within ourselves. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e An important time during this retrograde will be on July 21 when the Sun and Mercury meet. As it's Mercury's retrograde, you might not know how to word it, but an important turning point or a new perspective will arrive. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e On the last day of the month, July 31, we have a new Moon in Leo, which brings an exciting new beginning. This is the same day that Mercury retrograde ends. Conversations will finally begin moving forward, and the pace returns to what we think of as being normal.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e \u003cb\u003e Are there other cosmic events occurring during this retrograde we should care about?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e There are outer planets that are also retrograde, including Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune and Pluto, that find us reconsidering issues in our lives. But what is really big, is that we actually are in eclipse season. There was just a solar eclipse in Cancer, and during the retrograde, there will be a lunar eclipse in Capricorn. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e These \u003ca href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/gy49yw/how-to-survive-this-months-chaotic-eclipses-that-will-shake-up-everything?utm_source=astroguideoonhc\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eeclipses are asking us to get real\u003c/a\u003e. Power structures and how we look at our authority figures are going to be shifting. Secrets will be coming to light, information will be revealed. If we aren't on the right path, these eclipses will put us on the correct one. And the harder you cling to the past, the harder it's going to be.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e \u003cb\u003e Is there anything else we should know about this retrograde?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e If you want to take your Mercury retrograde preparation to a more advanced level, you can look at an \u003ca href=\"https://www.astro.com/swisseph/ae/2000/ae_2019.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eepheme\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003eris\u003c/a\u003e, a list of all the dates and the planetary positions.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e Here's an example: If you got into an interesting situation any time during the pre-shadow period (June 20 through the start of the retrograde on July 7) or the retrograde, look at the degree Mercury was in and find the next date that Mercury returns to that degree to see when you might next find that situation popping back up.

And when El was forced to use her powers to remove the piece of the Mind Flayer that had invaded her when it took a bite out of her leg, her telekinetic tank was clearly left on empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuckily, Hopper, Joyce and Murray (Brett Gelman) showed up just in time to lend the kids a much-needed assist in the battle against both the Mind Flayer and the Russians.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eGriswold Family, Scoop Troop and Bald Eagle\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter quickly sharing everything they had learned with one another, the group decided to split into three different factions: Scoop Troop \u0026mdash; Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo), Steve (Joe Keery), Robin (Maya Hawke) and Erica (Priah Ferguson) \u0026mdash; Griswold Family \u0026mdash; Eleven, Mike, Will, Lucas, Max (Sadie Sink), Jonathan and Nancy (Natalia Dyer) \u0026mdash; and Bald Eagle \u0026mdash; Murray, Joyce and Hopper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe plan was that Scoop Troop would drive to Dustin\u0026#8217;s radio tower where the walkie talkie signal was strong enough for Dustin and Erica to provide guidance to Murray, Joyce and Hopper as they infiltrated the underground Russian base. Meanwhile, Griswold Family would head to safety.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut when Griswold Family discovered that Billy \u0026mdash; who was waiting outside in his car \u0026mdash; had cut Nancy\u0026#8217;s ignition cable, they had no choice but to retreat back inside Starcourt Mall. And that\u0026#8217;s when the Mind Flayer monster showed up right after.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThe Final Battle of Starcourt\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith El unable to use her powers to defend herself or her friends against the Mind Flayer, Griswold Family was in a tight spot \u0026mdash; especially after El, Mike and Max were separated from the rest of the group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill, Lucas, Jonathan and Nancy eventually managed to make it back outside and \u0026mdash; thanks to Steve showing up just in time to ram Billy\u0026#8217;s car \u0026mdash; drive away. The Mind Flayer monster followed, giving El, Mike and Max a chance to try to make their own escape. Unfortunately, Billy spotted them trying to make a run for it, and forced back inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, after agreeing that they would finally go on an actual date, Hopper and Joyce hit a snag when the vault code that Murray had given them turned out to be incorrect. Luckily, Dustin was able to get in touch with his previously elusive Camp Know Where girlfriend Suzie, who helpfully provided the number that correlates with \u003ca href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/Plancks-constant\"  rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePlanck\u0026rsquo;s Constant\u003c/a\u003e \u0026mdash; a.k.a. the vault code \u0026mdash; following a rousing rendition of the \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://time.com/4475561/neverending-story-google-doodle/\"  rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eNeverEnding Story\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/em\u003etheme song.

He then carried her out to the food court, where the Mind Flayer monster was waiting. The monster was briefly distracted when Lucas, Will, Jonathan, Nancy, Steve and Robin began pelting it with the fireworks that Lucas stole from the grocery store. But it still seemed like all hope may be lost for El when Billy pinned her down to prevent her from escaping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a last ditch attempt to bring Billy back to himself, El began describing the memory she had seen of him surfing on the beach while his mother watched. El\u0026#8217;s recollection of Billy\u0026#8217;s happiest memory somehow broke through the Mind Flayer\u0026#8217;s hold on him and his true self reemerged long enough for him to sacrifice himself to save El.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnderground, Hopper managed to defeat the Russian assassin, but was left inside the room with the exploding key when Joyce closed the gate to the Upside Down.

Unfortunately, this meant that El and Mike, Jonathan and Nancy, and Will and all his friends had to say goodbye to one another \u0026mdash; a scene that was especially painful after El had just told Mike that she loved him. And while El\u0026#8217;s powers were still tapped out, reading the speech that Hopper had written to give to her and Mike at the beginning of the summer at least seemed to give her some closure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eEnd Credits Scene\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003cem\u003eStranger Things \u003c/em\u003eseason 3 mid-credits scene transported fans to what appeared to be a top-secret prison in Kamchatka, Russia.

But when the emergency operator picks up, flashbacks of what the Mind Flayer had just done to him keep him silent. Billy stumbles out of the phone booth as red lightning flashed across the sky \u0026mdash; a surefire sign that he had somehow become linked to the Upside Down \u0026mdash; to find a group of mysterious figures walking toward him. The group\u0026#8217;s leader then steps forward to reveal that he is a carbon copy of Billy himself. Flash-forward to later in the episode when a distressed Billy recalls the previous night\u0026#8217;s events and remembers his Upside Down self\u0026#8217;s message. \u0026#8220;I want you to build,\u0026#8221; he tells Billy. \u0026#8220;What you see.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter coming back to himself on the lifeguard chair, Billy flees to the pool\u0026#8217;s showers as the red mark on his arm begins to pulse and spread, indicating that the Mind Flayer has activated itself inside him. It is then that fellow lifeguard Heather (Francesca Reale) comes to check on him, and Billy \u0026mdash; despite managing to leave Karen unharmed earlier in the episode \u0026mdash; is no longer able to resist the Mind Flayer\u0026#8217;s hold on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlayed Billy kidnaps Heather and takes her to the old steel works, where he \u0026#8220;feeds\u0026#8221; her to the Mind Flayer to allow it to take control of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eChapter Three: \u0026#8220;The Case of the Missing Lifeguard\u0026#8221;\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt should come as no surprise that the first person in Hawkins to realize there\u0026#8217;s something wrong with Billy is Eleven, who catches a glimpse of what he was doing to Heather after she and Max decide to use her telepathic powers to spy on him. Unfortunately, the part of the Mind Flayer inside Billy also caught a glimpse of El and recognized her as the one who had closed the gate to the Upside Down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEl and Max (Sadie Sink) quickly set off on a mission to figure out what\u0026#8217;s going on. First stop: Billy\u0026#8217;s bathroom, where they discover both the remains of an ice bath \u0026mdash; a nod to the Mind Flayer\u0026#8217;s penchant for seeking out cooler temperatures \u0026mdash; and Heather\u0026#8217;s bloodied lifeguard whistle. El then tunes into Heather\u0026#8217;s headspace and sees her submerged in Billy\u0026#8217;s ice-filled bathtub begging for help before she was sucked away into its watery depths. Just like with Billy, it seems that Heather\u0026#8217;s true self had become trapped inside of her after the Mind Flayer invaded her body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis becomes clearer in the final scene of the episode, when flayed Billy and Heather violently attack Heather\u0026#8217;s parents with the intent of recruiting them to join the Mind Flayer\u0026#8217;s hive mind army.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eChapter Four: \u0026#8220;The Sauna Test\u0026#8221;\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"inline-portrait_small_2x alignnone \"\u003e\u003cimg data-attachment-id=\"5612158\" data-permalink=\"https://time.com/5614746/stranger-things-3-billy/stranger-things-season-3-03/\" data-orig-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/stranger-things-season-3-03.jpg?quality=85\" data-orig-size=\"2400,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"Netflix\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Stranger Things\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1551331235\",\"copyright\":\"Courtesy of Netflix\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"3\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"PHOTOS: Stranger Things 3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/stranger-things-season-3-03.jpg?quality=85\u0026w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/stranger-things-season-3-03.jpg?quality=85\u0026w=600\" src=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/stranger-things-season-3-03.jpg?w=560\u0026#038;quality=85\u0026#038;h=373\" alt=\"Stranger Things 3\" height=\"373\"\u003e\n\u003cfigcaption class=\"image-caption\" \u003e\u003cspan class=\"credit\" \u003eNetflix\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter flayed Billy and Heather finish feeding Heather\u0026#8217;s parents to the Mind Flayer, Billy takes some time off from terrorizing the people of Hawkins to report for duty at the pool.

So instead of seeking him out in person, El decides to use her powers to mentally connect with him \u0026mdash; just like she did with her mom in season 2 \u0026mdash; in hopes of finding the source of the Mind Flayer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter diving into Billy\u0026#8217;s mind, El finds herself inside one of Billy\u0026#8217;s best childhood memories \u0026mdash; showing off his surfing skills to his mom on a beach in California \u0026mdash; in a scene that gives off \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dalmb2bljE8\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003emajor \u003cem\u003eInception \u003c/em\u003evibes\u003c/a\u003e.

But when she tries to emerge from Billy\u0026#8217;s mind, it\u0026#8217;s clear that something has gone wrong. When El removes her blindfold, she is no longer surrounded by her friends in Hopper\u0026#8217;s cabin. Instead, Billy \u0026mdash; acting as the mouth-piece of the Mind Flayer \u0026mdash; is now there with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;You shouldn\u0026#8217;t have looked for me.

But what she hasn\u0026#8217;t seen is that, at that very moment, all of the flayed citizens of Hawkins are returning to the steel works to form one massive Mind Flayer monster. Turns out El was the Mind Flayer\u0026#8217;s main target all along.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eChapter 7: \u0026#8220;The Bite\u0026#8221;\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly doesn\u0026#8217;t appear until midway through episode 7, but his words come back to haunt Eleven when the now-massive Mind Flayer monster shows up at Hopper\u0026#8217;s cabin.

But Billy is hot on their trail. After finding El\u0026#8217;s blood \u0026mdash; which appears to be infused with essence of Mind Flayer \u0026mdash; on the supermarket floor, the Mind Flayer\u0026#8217;s influence over him seems to grow even stronger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eChapter 8: \u0026#8220;The Battle of Starcourt\u0026#8221;\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now, for the grand finale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter El drains her powers by using them to remove the piece of the Mind Flayer that was inside of her bite wound, she is left defenseless against both Billy and the Mind Flayer monster. So when Billy is waiting for the group outside of Starcourt Mall, after cutting Nancy\u0026#8217;s ignition cable, they have no choice but to retreat back inside. The kids are then left with nowhere to go when the Mind Flayer monster bursts through the mall\u0026#8217;s ceiling and traps them in the food court.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe next see Billy chasing after El, Mike and Max after Steve heroically rams his car to allow the rest of the group to escape.

El\u0026#8217;s recollection of Billy\u0026#8217;s happiest memory somehow breaks through the Mind Flayer\u0026#8217;s hold on him, and his true self reemerges long enough for him to sacrifice himself to save El and give Joyce time to close the gate to the Upside Down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProving that his final moments were his and his alone, Billy\u0026#8217;s last words to his sister Max are a simple apology for everything he has done: \u0026#8220;I\u0026#8217;m sorry.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs things stand now, it doesn\u0026#8217;t seem like there\u0026#8217;s any way that Billy could possibly return in season 4.

Their mission: to destroy the Continental Army, capture General Washington and his officers, subdue the colonial uprising, and restore order.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLed by their most storied military leaders, General William Howe and his brother Admiral Richard Howe, the British landed in New York with more than 30,000 troops and a sizeable number of Hessian mercenaries. They attacked an out-matched, out-maneuvered and inexperienced Washington in late August in Brooklyn and quickly surrounded the Continental Army on the east, west and south flanks. With 475 British ships anchored in the East River to the Americans\u0026rsquo; backs, the question for Washington was not: Do they escape? But \u003cem\u003ecould\u003c/em\u003e they escape?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCommandeering whatever would float, Washington\u0026rsquo;s only hope was to use the strong East River current and an unexpected blanket of fog to his advantage and evacuate as many men as possible from Brooklyn Heights to the safety of Manhattan before the British could mobilize and reposition their Navy. Washington was quickly running out of time to retreat and the American Revolution was on the verge of being extinguished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe First Maryland Regiment was deployed to bring up the rear and, sensing imminent disaster, it did the unthinkable. Rallying his remaining 400 men, Major Mordecai Gist turned them toward the massive British war force. Believing the British commanding general was stationed in a stone house at the army\u0026rsquo;s center, the regiment shocked the overwhelming British war force with an unexpected, targeted assault. The Marylanders attacked the British six times, losing scores of men with each surge, then regrouping and hurling themselves again and again at the dazed Brits, in what can be best described as a bloody street brawl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the end, only a handful of Marylanders managed to escape; the majority were killed. The rest were captured or mortally wounded. Washington was brought to tears as he watched the selfless bravery of his young soldiers.

The British found Brooklyn Heights abandoned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, who were these young soldiers who made the ultimate sacrifice to ensure the liberty of future generations? What motivated them? Why isn\u0026rsquo;t this pivotal moment more celebrated?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://time.com/newsletter-history\" \u003e\u003cem\u003eGet your history fix in one place: sign up for the weekly TIME History newsletter\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I began the research for my book \u003cem\u003eSaving Washington\u003c/em\u003e, I assumed that the regiment was a highly trained unit of battle-tested soldiers. The reality was almost as astonishing as the battle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young volunteers were a cross section of the colony of Maryland: wealthy merchants\u0026rsquo; sons, dockworkers, school kids and free and enslaved black youth. Of the original 1,200-man regiment, only four had formal military training. Early in the war, Washington had a difficult time keeping enlistees from running off when they heard the first shots of battle, let alone maintaining discipline as a fighting unit. To think that the devotion of these untrained and untested Maryland kids could drive them beyond their personal fears is hard to imagine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remembered being taught in school that the American Revolution was sparked by the tax burden imposed on the colonists, which particularly infuriated the merchant class. Merchants underwrote each colony\u0026rsquo;s militias and state regiments, essentially financing the revolt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut teenagers wouldn\u0026rsquo;t sacrifice themselves for taxes. Research conducted by the Maryland State Archivist \u003ca href=\"https://msamaryland400.wordpress.com/about/\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003esuggests\u003c/a\u003e that peer pressure, a sense of adventure, and growing anti-British sentiment played a role in why the young men enlisted. Mordecai Gist, who led the Maryland 400, even named his two sons Independent and States. But there\u0026rsquo;s evidence that they were also driven by an even more profound motivation. In many religious circles, the New World was code for the New Jerusalem. The concept that America was special, and that they were chosen by God to create and defend a new type of country, was incessantly preached. They were God\u0026rsquo;s children, not the King\u0026rsquo;s, and they were lectured to reject corrupt and immoral leaders. This drumbeat was heard and deeply absorbed by these young men. The boys of the Maryland 400 believed they were fighting with a divine purpose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, why has this dramatic act of heroism not been celebrated as one of America\u0026rsquo;s finest hours?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe celebrate our winners. The battles won. Our championship teams. The gold medals earned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn spite of the Battle of Brooklyn being the \u003ca href=\"https://theoldstonehouse.org/history/battle-of-brooklyn/\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003elargest\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://www.battlefields.org/learn/revolutionary-war/battles/brooklyn\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003ebloodiest\u003c/a\u003e battle of the American Revolution, the Americans were completely routed. A humiliated Washington almost lost the war that day. It was not a moment of celebration, but one of desperation. A moment the country wanted to forget.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut in a larger sense, the Maryland 400\u0026rsquo;s sacrifice at this most pivotal moment in American history now shines through the dense fog of history. Like the legendary Spartans of Thermopylae, America\u0026rsquo;s most important, yet most forgotten heroes, should serve as a beacon \u0026mdash; an illuminating reminder of the selfless devotion of true patriotism.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg class=\"alignleft\" src=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/long-view.png?w=150\u0026#038;h=150\" alt=\"The Long View\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHistorians\u0026#8217; perspectives on how the past informs the present\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eChris Formant is the author of \u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Saving-Washington/Chris-Formant/9781682618325\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003eSaving Washington: The Forgotten Story of the Maryland 400 and The Battle of Brooklyn\u003c/a\u003e, \u003cem\u003eavailable now.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/time/topstories/~4/Ue_u-97kCrg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/Ue_u-97kCrg/","published":"2019-07-04T13:00:18Z","guid":"http://time.com/?p=5617055"},{"title":"A Nuclear Reactor on Fire-Damaged Submarine Remains Safe and ‘Operational,’ Russian Authorities Say","content":"\u003caside class=\"right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad\" id=\"right-rail__ad-5620732\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module\" data-src=\"https://time.com/5620732/russia-submarine-fire-nuclear-reactor/\" data-widget-id=\"SB_2\" data-ob-template=\"timemag\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(MOSCOW) \u0026mdash; The nuclear reactor on one of the Russian navy\u0026#8217;s research submersibles hasn\u0026#8217;t been damaged in a fire that killed 14 seamen, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said Thursday, adding that the vessel would be put back into service after repairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Defense Ministry said the 14 seamen were killed by toxic fumes from Monday\u0026#8217;s blaze, the navy\u0026#8217;s worst accident in more than a decade.

A trillion of them, maybe more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there\u0026#8217;s enough room, Swiss scientists say. Even with existing cities and farmland, there\u0026#8217;s enough space for new trees to cover 3.5 million square miles (9 million square kilometers), they reported in Thursday\u0026#8217;s journal Science. That area is roughly the size of the United States.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe study calculated that over the decades, those new trees could suck up nearly 830 billion tons (750 billion metric tons) of heat-trapping carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. That\u0026#8217;s about as much carbon pollution as humans have spewed in the past 25 years. Much of that benefit will come quickly because trees remove more carbon from the air when they are younger, the study authors said. The potential for removing the most carbon is in the tropics.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;This is by far \u0026mdash; by thousands of times \u0026mdash; the cheapest climate change solution\u0026#8221; and the most effective, said study co-author Thomas Crowther, a climate change ecologist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSix nations with the most room for new trees are Russia, the United States, Canada, Australia, Brazil and China.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore his research, Crowther figured that there were other more effective ways to fight climate change besides cutting emissions, such as people switching from meat-eating to vegetarianism. But, he said, tree planting is far more effective because trees take so much carbon dioxide out of the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThomas Lovejoy, a George Mason University conservation biologist who wasn\u0026#8217;t part of the study, called it \u0026#8220;a good news story\u0026#8221; because planting trees would also help stem the loss of biodiversity. Planting trees is not a substitute for weaning the world off burning oil, coal and gas, the chief cause of global warming, Crowther emphasized. \u0026#8220;None of this works without emissions cuts,\u0026#8221; he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNor is it easy or realistic to think the world will suddenly go on a tree-planting binge, although many groups have started, Crowther said. \u0026#8220;It\u0026#8217;s certainly a monumental challenge, which is exactly the scale of the problem of climate change,\u0026#8221; he said. And as the Earth warms, and especially as the tropics dry, tree cover is being lost, he noted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe researchers used Google Earth to see what areas could support more trees, while leaving room for people and crops.

Iran\u0026rsquo;s oil production has dropped by 1.5 million barrel a day over the past year, poleaxing the Islamic Republic\u0026rsquo;s economy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Grace 1, able to ship 2 million barrels of crude oil, was intercepted by detachments of Royal Marines and Gibraltarian police, who boarded the tanker from a helicopter and speed boat in the early hours of Thursday morning. The ship is now anchored near Gibraltar, a British overseas territory on Spain\u0026rsquo;s southern tip that overlooks the strait between the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;We have detained the vessel and its cargo,\u0026rdquo; said Fabian Picardo, Gibraltar\u0026rsquo;s chief minister. \u0026ldquo;This action arose from information giving the Gibraltar government reasonable grounds to believe that the vessel, Grace 1, was acting in breach of European Union sanctions against Syria.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGibraltar didn\u0026rsquo;t say where the crude came from, but ship tracking data compiled by Bloomberg showed the vessel loaded at Iran\u0026rsquo;s Kharg Island oil terminal in mid-April. Several weeks later, the ship began a journey around the bottom of Africa, passing Cape Town in early June, rather than taking the more direct route through the Suez Canal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIran\u0026rsquo;s decision to lodge a diplomatic complaint shows Tehran isn\u0026rsquo;t attempting to disavow the cargo\u0026rsquo;s origin. Seyyed Abbas Mousavi, a spokesman for Iran\u0026rsquo;s foreign ministry, said on state TV that Britain\u0026rsquo;s move was \u0026#8220;a kind of extraterritorial sanction\u0026#8221; that could \u0026#8220;escalate tension in the region.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBritain\u0026rsquo;s Foreign Office confirmed that its ambassador had been summoned. Earlier in the day, Theresa May\u0026rsquo;s spokesman had offered London\u0026rsquo;s full support for Gibraltar\u0026rsquo;s actions. \u0026ldquo;We welcome this firm action to enforce EU sanctions against the Syrian regime,\u0026rdquo; the prime minister\u0026rsquo;s spokesman, James Slack, told reporters in London. \u0026ldquo;This sends a clear message that violation of the sanctions is unacceptable.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe row comes at a difficult time in Anglo-Iranian relations. Last month, London joined Washington in blaming Iran for attacks on two tankers in the Gulf of Oman. The U.K. is also campaigning for the release of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a British woman imprisoned in Iran after being accused of spying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Grace 1\u0026rsquo;s voyage to the Mediterranean was circuitous, providing plenty of time to plan today\u0026rsquo;s action. The distance from Iran to Syria, sailing around Africa, is about 23,300 kilometers (14,500 miles), compared with just 6,600 kilometers via the Red Sea and Suez Canal. A ship the size of the Grace 1, known as a Very Large Crude Carrier, or VLCC, can\u0026rsquo;t pass through the canal fully loaded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVLCCs have the option of transiting the canal by discharging half their cargo, sending the oil through the Sumed Pipeline, and pick it up again in the Mediterranean, but the pipeline\u0026rsquo;s owners have refused to accept Iranian crude since 2012.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIran has regularly supplied Syria with crude oil since the country descended into civil war in 2011. Iran backs the government headed by President Bashar Al-Assad, which has been sanctioned for most of this decade due to its bloody crackdown on the country\u0026rsquo;s civilians. Syria receives Iranian crude despite the embargo. It imported at least 32,000 barrels a day in 2018 and 66,000 in 2017, according to tanker tracking data compiled by Bloomberg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGibraltar said Grace 1 was destined for the Baniyas refinery, which is owned by the Syrian government and is subject to both U.S. and EU sanctions.

Absolutely. Because I want to drive sexual assault, unwanted sexual contact to zero in the Coast Guard,\u0026#8221; Schultz said. \u0026#8220;Will we do that in my lifetime?

Make no mistake though, Donald Trump is about to do to the United States military what Donald Trump does to everything he touches — cheapen it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDonald Trump\u0026#8217;s disrespect for the military is well-documented and stretches back decades. As a young adult, he made up an illness to dodge the draft during the Vietnam War, risking the life of someone else\u0026#8217;s son in his place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a businessman, he celebrated owning the tallest building in lower Manhattan on the afternoon of September 11, 2001, as firefighters, police officers, and military volunteers worked valiantly risked and lost their lives amid the smoldering rubble of the World Trade Center.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a politician, he has attacked Gold Star families, insulted American war heroes, denigrated the memories of fallen soldiers, refused to stand in honor of the war dead because of a rain shower, targeted enlisted service members for criminal prosecution, and forced 40,000 members of the armed forces to work for more than a month without pay during his federal government shutdown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#8217;s no surprise then, that he continues to demonstrate no regard for the sanctity of the U.S. military. When and how the country\u0026#8217;s military might is deployed is a matter for reasonable political disagreement, but there is near universal agreement that those who volunteer to serve their country are afforded a degree of reverence and respect, and are not to be wielded as a political bludgeon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least, that was the understanding until Donald Trump became commander-in-chief. Even as he made his contempt for veterans and enlisted service members clear, he was happy to rope the military into his racist political agenda, deploying troops to the southern border in a failed attempt to spread his own xenophobia to American voters shortly before the midterm elections.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor anyone who\u0026#8217;s followed Donald Trump\u0026#8217;s career at all, Thursday\u0026#8217;s military boondoggle follows a very familiar script — take something once thought to possess some kind of intrinsic value or inherent wealth and turn it into tawdry kitsch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his previous life, the public could largely afford to laugh at or ignore the Trumpification of higher education, corporate board rooms, steak, high fashion, and real estate. As president though, his Midas-touch-in-reverse is causing lasting damage to the country\u0026#8217;s sacred institutions, and eroding whatever moral standing in the world we once possessed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe military is but one example. Court orders are now routinely ignored. Federal laws are rendered meaningless. Bigotry in all its forms is now exalted in the halls of government.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDonald Trump has infected all of these things with his special brand of tacky, tasteless, corruption. On a day meant to celebrate our country\u0026#8217;s independence, the public is left to wonder if the country is worth celebrating at all.\t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"promo amp-wp-article-promo\"\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"post__figure post__figure--format-full\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"post__thumbnail\"\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003ca href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/membership/?c=cr042018-7-00-wp\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cimg width=\"2917\" height=\"2038\" src=\"https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/membership-graphic_2.03-1.png?w=2917\u0026amp;h=2038\u0026amp;crop=1\" class=\"attachment-full size-full\" alt=\"\" data-attachment-id=\"1142474\" data-permalink=\"https://thinkprogress.org/membership-graphic_2-03-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/membership-graphic_2.03-1.png?w=2917\u0026amp;h=2038\u0026amp;crop=1\" data-orig-size=\"2917,2038\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{\u0026quot;aperture\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;credit\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;camera\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;created_timestamp\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;copyright\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;focal_length\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;iso\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;shutter_speed\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;title\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;orientation\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;}\" data-image-title=\"membership graphic_2.03\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/membership-graphic_2.03-1.png?w=2917\u0026amp;h=2038\u0026amp;crop=1\" data-large-file=\"https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/membership-graphic_2.03-1.png?w=2917\u0026amp;h=2038\u0026amp;crop=1\" draggable=\"false\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1920px) 1920px,(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1920px) 1920px,(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1024px) 1024px,(min-width: 512px) and (max-width: 1024px) 1024px,(min-width: 512px) and (max-width: 768px) 768px,(max-width: 512px) 512px,(max-width: 768px) 768px,2917px\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/membership-graphic_2.03-1.png?w=1920\u0026#038;crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C1341px\u0026#038;ssl=1 1920w,https://i1.wp.com/thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/membership-graphic_2.03-1.png?w=1024\u0026#038;crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C715px\u0026#038;ssl=1 1024w,https://i1.wp.com/thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/membership-graphic_2.03-1.png?w=768\u0026#038;crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C537px\u0026#038;ssl=1 768w,https://i1.wp.com/thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/membership-graphic_2.03-1.png?w=512\u0026#038;crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C358px\u0026#038;ssl=1 512w,https://i1.wp.com/thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/membership-graphic_2.03-1.png?w=2917\u0026#038;crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C2038px\u0026#038;ssl=1 2917w\" /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/a\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n","url":"https://thinkprogress.org/donald-trump-fourth-of-july-display-cheapens-the-military/","published":"2019-07-04T11:00:14Z","guid":"https://thinkprogress.org/?p=1147789"},{"title":"When is a hairstyle not just a hairstyle?

Still, when he became engulfed in a dangerous depression after the dot.com bubble\u0026#8217;s burst \u0026#8212; owing to the economic crash, to the terrorist attack in New York, to the approach of middle age \u0026#8212; he saved himself by leaving VC, a kind of accidental if lucrative profession for him, and by learning how to \u003ca href=\"https://www.reboot.io/\"\u003ecoach others\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat he tells them from the outset \u0026#8212; as he learned about himself firsthand \u0026#8212; is that many executives hobble themselves unwittingly out of fear or some other driving force that they have no idea even exists, a driver that has be to identified to be conquered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColonna learned, for example, that he associated money with safety, having grown up in a chaotic environment with an alcoholic father, a mother with mental illness, and six siblings who were at times separated and cared for by other family members. Among these were Colonna\u0026#8217;s grandparents who owned a building in New York and provided their grandchildren both love \u0026#8212; as well as that missing sense of security.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, not everyone has access to Colonna, or his team of roughly 25 other coaches, or to one of his executive bootcamps. It\u0026#8217;s for this reason that Colonna recently authored the book \u0026#8220;\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Reboot-Leadership-Art-Growing-Up-ebook/dp/B0796SNDSK\"\u003eReboot\u003c/a\u003e,\u0026#8221; in which he shares many of his own stories while also signaling to readers the importance of recognizing that they aren\u0026#8217;t crazy, that much of modern life is a pretense, and that with some introspection, it\u0026#8217;s possible to understand the roots of one\u0026#8217;s character structure and, perhaps, stop embracing them unconsciously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe talked with Colonna today about the book in a conference call attended by dozens of Extra Crunch readers. We\u0026#8217;ll be releasing a transcript of that call shortly. In the meantime, we wanted to share part of our exchange that centered on the question: are most executives ultimately trying to impress their parents \u0026#8212; either living or dead? (Colonna had told us that the first person to come to him for real advice \u0026#8212; when Colonna was still advising startups as a board member \u0026#8212; was a young attorney who hated his profession but went to law school to please his father.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a nutshell, the answer, perhaps unsurprisingly, is yes \u0026#8212; at least to some degree. \u0026#8220;I think most of us are in an interesting dialogue with the belief systems we developed as children, and that most leaders are shaped, consciously or not, by those early belief systems,\u0026#8221; he said earlier today. \u0026#8220;If you believe the world is a dog-eat-dog world, where everybody is out to get their own, you\u0026#8217;re going to unconsciously build an organization that\u0026#8217;s filled with self-optimizers. Then you\u0026#8217;re going to call a coach and ask, \u0026#8220;Geez, why isn\u0026#8217;t anyone trusting each other?\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIndeed, Colonna\u0026#8217;s view (and he has seen a lot of executives over the years) is that \u0026#8220;one of the most important forces of any child\u0026#8217;s life are their parents. They shape positively and negatively our whole world view because they give us the sense of love, safety and belonging; they give us our sense of worthiness as human beings.\u0026#8221; It\u0026#8217;s why when he\u0026#8217;s doing his leadership coaching and development work, he works to \u0026#8220;really understand the early structures of a person\u0026#8217;s life \u0026#8212; not so we can spend the entire time therapeutically going through it, but so we can have a context for what they might be struggling with right now.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a wide-ranging chat, touching on whether people can become great leaders without facing some childhood adversity, the reason that coping skills sometimes become impediments, whether millennial leaders have it better or worse than their predecessors, and why the 30s can be the trickiest decade of all for people who are leading organizations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore on our chat soon, and if you don\u0026#8217;t subscribe to Extra Crunch, you can learn \u003ca href=\"https://techcrunch.com/extracrunch/\"\u003emore here\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"feedflare\"\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Rv9LbTLve2w:uyjmToQBRTI:2mJPEYqXBVI\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Rv9LbTLve2w:uyjmToQBRTI:7Q72WNTAKBA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Rv9LbTLve2w:uyjmToQBRTI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Rv9LbTLve2w:uyjmToQBRTI:-BTjWOF_DHI\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=Rv9LbTLve2w:uyjmToQBRTI:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Rv9LbTLve2w:uyjmToQBRTI:D7DqB2pKExk\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=Rv9LbTLve2w:uyjmToQBRTI:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Rv9LbTLve2w:uyjmToQBRTI:qj6IDK7rITs\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/Rv9LbTLve2w\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/Rv9LbTLve2w/","published":"2019-07-04T01:27:25Z","guid":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=1852179"},{"title":"MoviePass temporarily suspends service to improve its mobile app","content":"\u003cp id=\"speakable-summary\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.moviepass.com/\"\u003eMoviePass\u003c/a\u003e is temporarily suspending its service, starting on July 4, in order to finish working on improvements to its mobile app, the company \u003ca href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190703005567/en/MoviePass%E2%84%A2-Temporarily-Interrupt-Service-Complete-Improved-Mobile\"\u003eannounced\u003c/a\u003e today.

When Sinemia launched, it was able to capitalize on anti-MoviePass sentiment, but \u003ca href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/07/sinemia-faces-consumer-pushback-and-a-class-action-suit-over-a-battery-of-complaints/\"\u003equickly began to rack up its own negative feedback about hidden fees\u003c/a\u003e, cancellations without refunds and poor app performance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis \u003ca href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/02/another-major-theater-chain-is-reportedly-working-on-a-moviepass-competitor/\"\u003emakes room for new rivals to step in\u003c/a\u003e.

If we counted the number of unique combinations of pose, vocal nuance, and facial expressions you’ve made in your lifetime, it would likely number in the billions. For virtual humans to be believable, their actions can’t be preprogrammed in a traditional hard-coded sense, but must instead be extremely flexible. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eDeepfake tech typically takes tons of examples of human behavior as inputs and then produces outputs that approximate or elaborate on that behavior. It could grant smart assistants the capacity to understand and originate conversation with much more sophistication. Similarly, digital influencers could develop the ability to visually react in a believable way in real time, thanks to deepfake tech. Bringing Mickey Mouse to life beyond a Disney cartoon or guy in a suit at Disneyland is where we’re headed. 3D hologram projections of animated characters (and real people) that are able to speak in a realistic sounding voice, moving like their real world counterpart would. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eCreativity starts with copying.

But there hasn\u0026#8217;t been a really great option for bringing the benefits of wireless charging with you on the road, while keeping your desktop setup tidy until now, with TwelveSouth\u0026#8217;s recently released \u003ca href=\"https://www.twelvesouth.com/products/hirise-wireless\"\u003eHiRise Wireless\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe HiRise Wireless builds on the good reputation of the existing HiRise line from TwelveSouth, which includes the Duet, a great combo charger for both iPhone and Apple Watch. The Wireless version, as implied by the name, includes wireless charging of up to 10W, which means you get the fastest cable-free charging rate available for devices that support Qi charging, including the iPhone X, XR and XS, as well as the Pixel 3 and Samsung Galaxy S10.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe HiRise is unique in that it provides a charging puck that can both mount in the frame (which has a nice weighted base to stay rock solid on your desk) and pop out to either provide a lie-flat wireless charger (which will work with the new wireless AirPods charging case, for instance) or pack away in a bag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[gallery ids=\"1852301,1852304,1852303,1852302,1852300\"]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe upright angle the wireless charger provides when mounted in the frame is perfect for registering Face ID unlocks when used with an iPhone X or later, and positioned on your desk.

And the puck itself is a lot smaller than most wireless chargers, which isn\u0026#8217;t idea for typical at-home charging, but which is terrific for stowing it in a gadget pouch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe puck also has a rubberized ring bordering the charging pad to prevent your device from slipping around, and it works with a detachable USB-C to USB-A cable that comes in the box which adds to the portability, and means you can easily use it with whatever USB-C charging cables you already have on-hand for your Mac or other devices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026#8217;re in the market for a wireless charger and travel a decent amount, it\u0026#8217;s hard to beat the value of the HiRise Wireless. It\u0026#8217;s $79.99, which is more than you\u0026#8217;ll pay for a lot of quality wireless chargers, but Twelve South\u0026#8217;s unique design is worth the premium in this case for people looking for its unique flexibility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"feedflare\"\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=oQBDtnBHsko:TcAqGPsMjTk:2mJPEYqXBVI\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=oQBDtnBHsko:TcAqGPsMjTk:7Q72WNTAKBA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=oQBDtnBHsko:TcAqGPsMjTk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=oQBDtnBHsko:TcAqGPsMjTk:-BTjWOF_DHI\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=oQBDtnBHsko:TcAqGPsMjTk:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=oQBDtnBHsko:TcAqGPsMjTk:D7DqB2pKExk\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=oQBDtnBHsko:TcAqGPsMjTk:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=oQBDtnBHsko:TcAqGPsMjTk:qj6IDK7rITs\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/oQBDtnBHsko\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/oQBDtnBHsko/","published":"2019-07-04T16:15:48Z","guid":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=1852295"},{"title":"Why you should naturalize — now, not later","content":"\u003cp id=\"speakable-summary\"\u003eIt’s no secret that America thrives on tech-savvy immigrants who put down permanent roots:\u003ca href=\"https://www.bondcap.com/report/itr19/#view/260\"\u003e Three in five\u003c/a\u003e of the country’s biggest tech companies — Apple, Facebook, and Google among them — were founded by first- or second-generation immigrants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose giants combined boast a market cap of over \u003ca href=\"https://www.bondcap.com/report/itr19/#view/260\"\u003e$4 trillion\u003c/a\u003e and employ nearly \u003ca href=\"https://www.bondcap.com/report/itr19/#view/260\"\u003etwo million\u003c/a\u003e workers.

But as the ACCC points out, that doesn’t cover all types of water, and Samsung itself says that the Galaxy S10 isn’t advised for beach use. “Samsung showed the Galaxy phones used in situations they shouldn’t be to attract customers,” Mr Sims says, arguing that consumers value water resistance as a feature and were denied an informed choice. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"NMmi8p\"\u003eSamsung \u003ca href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-australia-samsung-elec-regulator/samsung-in-hot-water-over-splashy-australian-phone-ads-idUSKCN1TZ0EJ?feedType=RSS\u0026amp;feedName=technologyNews\"\u003etells Reuters\u003c/a\u003e that it’s standing by its marketing and plans to fight the case.\u003c/p\u003e","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/4/20682059/samsung-australia-lawsuit-accc-water-resistance","published":"2019-07-04T07:28:24Z","guid":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/4/20682059/samsung-australia-lawsuit-accc-water-resistance"},{"title":"Having 30,000 followers makes you a celebrity, UK advertising watchdog rules","content":"\u003cimg alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ugBzcId1ABTq1PdeeCLTMFIxsvE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/64672546/akrales_170126_1421_A_0062.0.0.jpg\" /\u003e\n\n\n  \u003cp id=\"xkLckX\"\u003eThe UK’s Advertising Standards Authority \u003ca href=\"https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/sanofi-uk-A19-557609.html\"\u003ehas ruled that 30,000\u003c/a\u003e is the magic number of followers that makes you a celebrity. The decision means that if you have such a following then you have to obey the same advertising rules as traditional celebrities like David Beckham or Stephen Fry, particularly when it comes to product endorsements. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"bPBez0\"\u003eThe regulator came to the decision after an Instagram user with 32,000 followers, \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thismamalife/?hl=en\"\u003eThisMamaLife\u003c/a\u003e, posted an ad for Phenergan Night Time sleeping tablets. Although they disclosed that the post was an ad at the beginning of its description, the ASA ruled that their follower count made them a celebrity, and thus \u003ca href=\"https://www.asa.org.uk/advice-online/health-celebrities-and-health-professionals.html\"\u003ebanned from drug endorsements\u003c/a\u003e in the UK. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-float-right\"\u003e\u003caside id=\"zzGoQt\"\u003e\u003cq\u003eCelebrities aren’t allowed to endorse medication under UK law\u003c/q\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"fjIbdq\"\u003eInitially Sanofi, the drug company that had paid for the ad, argued that ThisMamaLife had a comparatively small following compared to more established celebrities. However, the ASA said that the rules apply to anyone with over 30,000 followers. For the ASA, anyone with 32 thousand followers or 32 million followers will be treated the same. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"RrT0i5\"\u003e“We noted Sanofi’s argument regarding the comparatively low number of followers ThisMamaLife had in contrast to notable celebrities,” the ASA said in its ruling, “However, we considered that over 30,000 followers indicated that she had the attention of a significant number of people. Given that she was popular with, and had the attention of a large audience, we considered that ThisMamaLife was a celebrity for the purposes of the CAP Code.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"fI5beG\"\u003eThe UK’s rules are a lot stricter than the US, where celebrities are freely allowed to endorse drugs. The main thing the FTC is concerned about is that people, regardless of whether they’re a celebrity or not, disclose when a post has been paid for by an advertiser.

It’s a bit unwieldy in practice, because you have to time the two just right — otherwise, they come out of sync. On the other hand, the commentary in podcast form allows you to listen to it anywhere, if you don’t particularly care about rewatching the film. \u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9NBIEr8cWtXPnxVBUHW1qXplZag=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18279649/Netflix_Podcast_WatchingWith_Logo.jpg\"\u003e\n      \u003ccite\u003eImage: Netflix\u003c/cite\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"8HQHPX\"\u003eNetflix isn’t entirely without special features:  some films feature a “Trailers and More” section that includes some extra features. \u003cem\u003eAlways Be My Maybe\u003c/em\u003e’s section has the film’s trailer, as well as a trailer-like introduction to the film’s characters.

On July 1st, \u003ca href=\"https://www.sacbee.com/news/local/article232166722.html\"\u003eCal Fire seized 15,000 pounds of illegal fireworks\u003c/a\u003e from a spot near Nevada.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-wide-block\"\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"5dDZe8\"\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"\u003e\u003ciframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kjmPUYCe9fE?rel=0\" style=\"border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Uci7Wu\"\u003eThe video quality is usually low; light is usually supplied only by the fire itself. The videos that are most reassuring are the ones in which the firefighters arrive and begin administrating water before the clip ends. This does not occur in all flaming palm tree videos. Sometimes, horribly, the viewer simply witnesses the sparks flying off the palms. The fire wants to spread. The fire always wants to spread. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Dt4dom\"\u003eIt is while watching flaming palm tree videos that I am most acutely aware of the time-distortion that comes from video. I am watching the past. The reality of the video is the now that was. Most likely, the palm tree is already out by the time I have seen the footage. If the fire spread, it has already spread and — one hopes — was, at some point, contained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"7MwgiY\"\u003eWithout intervention, \u003ca href=\"https://www.citylab.com/environment/2012/08/palm-tree-fires-natures-tiki-torches/2962/\"\u003ea palm tree can burn for hours\u003c/a\u003e.

businesses. The premise is simple; operate with all your leaders and employees working remotely, sometimes all over the world, to cut costs and broaden your potential employee pool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo conventional businesses, the notion seems absurd; they rely on in-house collaboration and the reputational allure of a headquarters. So how, exactly, are these fully remote startups succeeding, and is it reasonable to prioritize it over having an established location?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eThe Benefits of Fully Remote Businesses\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost startups are attracted to the fully remote model because of one or a combination of the following benefits:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCost savings. \u003c/strong\u003eFirst and foremost, offices are expensive. \u003ca href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/01/24/how-iot-and-big-data-applications-will-revolutionize-our-smart-cities/\"\u003eSmart city technology\u003c/a\u003e may one day make commercial space more appealing and less expensive, but for now, the average entrepreneur can expect to shell out thousands of dollars a month for leasing even a small office space, and even more money to keep the lights on. Eliminating the need for a physical office space means thousands of dollars of savings every month, which can then be spent on more important assets and improvements, like research and development or marketing and advertising.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eManagement reduction.\u003c/strong\u003e Keeping up with an office isn’t just a matter of money; it’s also a matter of time. Most businesses have a designated office manager, or some other combination of roles to ensure the facilities are clean, organized, and conducive to a productive work space. Fully remote models also reduce the need for this time expenditure, sometimes cutting out the cost of a full-time salary and other times freeing up more hours for productive work.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCommute elimination.\u003c/strong\u003e The average commute in the United States is something like 30 minutes each way, resulting in an hour a day, or 5 hours a week of lost time. On top of that, many workers come into the office in a bad mood because they got stuck in traffic, or end up with less family time than they’d like because they get home so late. Fully remote models completely eliminate the need for commuting, or at least greatly reduce it.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFlexibility for workers.\u003c/strong\u003e Working from home (or from another place of your choosing) gives workers a tremendous amount of flexibility. They can set up and customize a home office of their very own, or work from a local café or coworking space. They can wear a suit if it helps them get in a “work” mindset, or something typically inappropriate for a workspace, like pajamas and \u003ca href=\"https://14kgoldteeth.com/\"\u003ecustom gold grillz\u003c/a\u003e. Workers can choose the environments that suit them best, which means they’ll work better and be happier at the same time. That means higher team productivity and higher morale.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBranding potential.\u003c/strong\u003e Some startups get clever with their branding, showing off their fully remote model to improve their brand reputation. For example, you could claim that you’re doing it to positively impact the environment, reducing the carbon emissions previously associated with vehicular commutes.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWider hiring options.\u003c/strong\u003e Companies that operate fully remotely don’t need to restrict their hiring options to any one local area. Instead, they can hire people all over the world, broadening their employee pool. This could be beneficial because it allows you to \u003ca href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/06/30/argentina-is-stepping-up-as-a-country-of-web-developers/\"\u003ehire people in other areas of the world\u003c/a\u003e for lower costs, or simply because the number of potential applicants you can consider skyrockets.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eProductivity. \u003c/strong\u003eThere’s significant evidence to suggest that people who work from home are more productive than their office-bound counterparts, though it’s not entirely understood why this is the case. It might be because workers have more flexibility, so they can work in a style that best suits their needs.

You can plug the BenQ into any laptop and start using it immediately in a conference room, huddle room, or workspace. You can use it alone, but it also works well with several presenters. All you need to do is press one button to switch to a different presenter. This solution also supports up to 16 different playback devices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstaShow works by transmitting and receiving signals to project your presentation over the IEEE 802.11ac standard, 5Ghz layer.

BenQ\u0026#8217;s receiver also offers a MODE button so you can choose between slide show mode or video mode. In video mode, InstaShow will automatically lower the resolution to 1280 x 720p HD to deliver an optimized video experience. In slide show mode, InstaShow offers the highest FHD 1920 x 1080p signal for a clear picture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther features include strong security measures, including \u003cspan class=\"a-list-item\"\u003eAES 128-bit security encryption and WPA2 authentication protocols.

None of the materials used for the device appear cheap or easy to break. Instead, the quality compact design and production shine through.

Each speaker must present separately.  The InstaShow WDC10 relies on a full-size HDMI and USB port available from whatever device you’re using for your presentation.

Combining the right digital twin technology, ever-smarter and more confidently accurate AI and deep domain expertise accelerates the evolution to autonomy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eIndustrial autonomy is not binary, black or white, yes or no. There’s a five-step evolutionary journey:\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHuman-led\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHuman-led/machine supported\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMachine led/human supported\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMachine led/human governed\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMachine controlled\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eAs an industry or a machine ascends toward Step 5, the number of humans required decreases.\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople move from being “in the loop” – triggering automated industrial events, even if in a remote-control room – to being “on the loop.” Teleoperators that oversee increasingly autonomous activities remotely are empowered to countermand or correct them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI believe autonomy will soon develop a Moore’s Law-type “Autonomy Quotient” (AQ). It will determine how many human teleoperators are required to assure the safety and efficacy of autonomous machines and processes. For example, it could be one human overseeing 10 autonomous vehicles or one human to 100 autonomous processes. The higher the AQ, the greater the autonomy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe ultimate value of digital twins \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEarlier I cited NASA’s original definition of digital twin. My preferred definition sounds simpler; “the digital reflection of a physical asset.” That is until one realizes that every industrial object in every factory in the world has its own digital twin. Each of those digital twins has multiple states for planning, design, operation, maintenance and so on of each object. Additionally, as noted above, digital twins are involved in a multitude of tasks across a broad swath of each industry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith an \u003ca href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/iot-devices-will-outnumber-the-worlds-population-this-year-for-the-first-time/\"\u003eestimated\u003c/a\u003e, 7.5 billion potential digital twins are in global industries right now. We find the highest value is making data available from all digital twins to all other digital twins across all processes in an open, interoperable and vendor-independent manner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eThe point of the digital twin tech is to keep all functions fully digital.\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis operation is utterly collaborative in the lifecycle of all industrial processes across multiple companies without any loss of data, analytics or time. Digital twins provide different capabilities at different stages. However, the main requirement is to enable handoffs from one stage to another \u0026#8212; from one company to another without these time-consuming and expensive losses. Islands of digitalization are insufficient to achieve autonomy. Digital twin tech is the necessary connective tissue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, my company, ABB, has shaved almost half the time required to build an electrical utility substation by using digital twin at each stage. This reduction in each process means deploying the operation at the planning, designing, and building (operations and maintenance digital twins come into play later).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003ePre-digital twin, it took 18 months to build a substation, but only four of those months were required for construction.\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other 14 were consumed in back-and-forth communications among the utility, the engineering company and us. Each party would digitize their input, but then the other parties would print it out, edit, re-digitize, send it to everyone else, and so on. Digital twins for planning, designing, and building allowed us to reduce 14 months of planning to seven. We also realized a 60 percent savings and built the substation in 11 months instead of 18. The operational and maintenance jobs are easier once the substation comes online because collaborative digital twins are built right into all substation functions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDigital twins enable collaborative global technology platforms. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ultimate value of digital twins is to create a collaborative global technology platform – not just from one company. This tech will be in all companies – that digitally stores functionality.  Digital twin tech helps with any expression and shares every function of every industrial object throughout its entire lifecycle. Combine that with high-confidence (that is, safe, fair and ethical) AI and deep domain expertise, and you get the digitally transformed, autonomous world of Industry 4.0.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eNecessary for a new generation of robots that can go where people or other hardware can’t. For example:\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA “data center sheriff” roams the endless racks of cloud-service server farms finding and replacing malfunctioning servers.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA “motor crawler” robot works inside a motor repairing and maintaining in a space too cramped and dangerous for a human.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA robot “transformer diver” saves the cost of draining a deep underwater transformer of oil, finding the area that needs repair and refilling the oil.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAnd a drone-like “plant helicopter” can alight where’s there’s trouble – current or future – to make repairs.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eAll of them will need digital twin representations of their work environments in their cybernetic brains.\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of which sounds metallically mechanistic, but it has a lot to do with people. Digital-twin-enabled autonomy is going to make people more valuable \u0026#8212; \u003cem\u003eon the loop\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen you look back, in 1910, a person in a control room had to keep an eye on a handful of dials. By the 1990s, people were watching and trying to control hundreds. Today, there are thousands of devices “reporting” to an industrial control room, and people are maxed out. People in this tech industry are extensively under pressures that are not alleviated. Early retirement seems the only options for those in frenetic control-room industries such as oil \u0026amp; gas, utilities, transportation and mining.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eThe rising Autonomy Quotient ratings of vehicles, machines, and processes place people on the loop will be completely overloaded with real-time data. Hence, help from digital twin tech.\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdd to that nightmare \u0026#8212; their strategic responsibilities are often compounded from autonomous objects. They are going to need help through every phase of this new industrial activity. As Industry 4.0 evolves from automation to autonomy, much of that help will come from digital twins – enhanced by AI and domain expertise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eThe digital twin will form an integral part of the workplace, serving and co-existing with people.\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHumans will remain invaluable (at least for the lifetime of anyone reading these words in 2019). Even so, they are going to need increasingly comprehensive and supportive digital representations of the autonomous industrial world alongside them to do their jobs effectively. The help they will receive will give a new, more humane meaning to the term “digital twin.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe post \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/07/04/digital-twin-from-automation-to-autonomy/\"\u003eDigital Twin: from Automation to Autonomy\u003c/a\u003e appeared first on \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\"\u003eReadWrite\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://readwrite.com/2019/07/04/digital-twin-from-automation-to-autonomy/","published":"2019-07-04T18:00:15Z","guid":"https://readwrite.com/?p=153314"},{"title":"Today, the Tech Talent Shortage is Everybody’s Problem","content":"\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cimg width=\"300\" height=\"185\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Talent-Shortage-is-Everybody%E2%80%99s-Problem-300x185.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"Tech Talent Shortage is Everybody’s Problem\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Talent-Shortage-is-Everybody%E2%80%99s-Problem-300x185.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Talent-Shortage-is-Everybody%E2%80%99s-Problem-260x160.jpg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Talent-Shortage-is-Everybody%E2%80%99s-Problem.jpg 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eOver the last few years, we’ve observed the technology economy as it has grown, warped, and \u003cu\u003e\u003ca class=\"editor-link editor_tip\" title=\"\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/01/10/how-to-get-into-tech-without-a-tech-background/\" data-original-title=\"\"\u003eevolved\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/u\u003e.

Para analisar o discurso das drag queens – grupo importante na discussão de identidade e papeis de gênero e com voz ativa na comunidade LGBTQ –  eles escolheram as 80 participantes do programa RuPaul\u0026#8217;s Drag Race.

Só que manifestações de racismo, homofobia, machismo e ameaças muitas vezes dependem de uma análise contextual para serem detectadas – e cada grupo tem um modo específico de falar, o que dificulta a análise. Se é difícil para seres humanos classificarem, para robôs é ainda pior. “Essas tecnologias não são plenamente capazes de reconhecer o contexto e discernir quando um conteúdo é legítimo”, diz Dennys Antonialli, diretor-executivo do InternetLab e um dos pesquisadores envolvidos. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEm relação ao discurso LGBTQ analisado pelos brasileiros, a tecnologia falha em captar o diferente significado de palavras consideradas tóxicas quando usadas por membros da comunidade queer. As drags queens costumam usar expressões chulas ou têm uma linguagem mais dura justamente porque, como personalidades públicas, estão na linha de frente e precisam se posicionar como estratégia de sobrevivência ou aceitação. É claro que um robô não entende isso – especialmente se ele foi feito ou treinado por seres humanos que também não entendem. “Elas acabam usando um banco de dados que muitas vezes estão recheados e viciados com vários vieses.

The prior administration — and again, I’m not taking shots at anyone personally, I’m just saying as far as policies are concerned — this wasn’t the approach,” he explained. “We know the same-old, same-old approach that we see incarcerating people based on their socio-economic stature, their zip code, their status, their race, their gender — that doesn’t work.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cu\u003eBell has made\u003c/u\u003e more than a few enemies since he ousted McCulloch in a primary last August. Rank-and-file prosecutors responded to Bell’s win by voting to \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/12/20/wesley-bell-st-louis-prosecutor-police-union/\"\u003ejoin a police union\u003c/a\u003e before he was even sworn in, an unusual move that, as the American Civil Liberties Union \u003ca href=\"https://www.aclu-mo.org/en/news/statement-prosecutors-decision-join-st-louis-police-officers-association\"\u003epointed out\u003c/a\u003e, placed them under “direct governing authority” of the officers they’re sometimes tasked with prosecuting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn his second day in office, Bell issued an \u003ca href=\"https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/stlamerican.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/c/9d/c9d3b51a-145c-11e9-8245-cfc48d6090eb/5c3673d90c7cc.pdf.pdf\"\u003einternal memo\u003c/a\u003e implementing parts of his criminal justice reform platform immediately, making significant changes to the office’s approach to prosecuting marijuana-related offenses and other misdemeanors, and largely eliminating the use of cash bail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Conviction and Incident Review Unit, then, is just the latest shake-up Bell is making.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe timeline to get the unit up and running depends on how the interview process goes; the job was posted when Bell announced the creation of the unit on June 25 and will stay open until July 10. He’s confident that the unit will be successful, due to community buy-in to get it off the ground. “If we’re the leading incarcerator by far in the world, then there’s an issue that needs to be addressed,” he said. “When people hear and understand the facts, when they understand the policies and research, they get on board. And I’m an example of that. I’m in office because of that: going out into conservative areas and talking to people. And when you talk to them, they get it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe unit’s independence is crucial, said Nina Morrison, senior litigation counsel at the Innocence Project; she has represented numerous clients who have become exonerated, thanks in part to the work of conviction integrity units.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class='stylized pull-left'data-shortcode-type='pullquote' data-pull='left'\u003e“It’s been so important to have people who are independent of the rest of the work of the office.\u0026#8221;\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s been so important to have people who are independent of the rest of the work of the office,” said Morrison, who works on wrongful convictions and handles requests for access to post-conviction DNA evidence. “And in many respects, the most successful [conviction integrity] units are staffed by people who did not spend their careers in that same office. Because it’s just hard, as a matter of human nature, to be reevaluating cases that colleagues you worked with handled, and to fairly and objectively evaluate whether they got it wrong or might have even done something improper to secure conviction.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cu\u003eLessons from Ferguson\u003c/u\u003e largely informed the unit’s forward-looking design and its prioritization of resources to address future police shootings and incidences of misconduct.

While Bell believes maintaining relationships with law enforcement is important, he doesn’t think those ties should get in the way of holding police accountable. He opposed the move by some prosecutors in his office to align themselves with the St. Louis Police Officers Association, because he was concerned that membership in a police union would get in the way of the prosecutorial mission.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDue to procedural hurdles, the prosecutors never officially joined that union. Despite initial tension, their desire to do so hasn’t impeded the way the office does business, Bell said. He wanted to be sure to include law enforcement in policymaking and keep an open channel of communication. “We view law enforcement as partners, and so after the primary election, we made a point to reach out to the area chiefs and leadership and meet with them so that we could start not only talking to but including them on our policymaking,” he said, “letting them know how we see things, and we also want to see and hear how they see things.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class='stylized pull-right'data-shortcode-type='pullquote' data-pull='right'\u003e\u0026#8220;Mr. Bell can operate his office in the manner he sees fit.\u0026#8221;\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt doesn’t appear that the police officers necessarily see Bell as a partner, though. “Mr. Bell can operate his office in the manner he sees fit,” Sgt.

But that unit received little attention, according to the National Registry of Exonerations, and was closed only a few years later in 2007 due to budget cuts. But the longest standing unit, \u003ca href=\"https://www.dallascounty.org/government/district-attorney/divisions/conviction-integrity.php\"\u003eestablished in Dallas\u003c/a\u003e in 2007, would serve as a model for others going forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe units each operate differently depending on their leadership, but they often \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/04/24/wrongful-convictions-prosecutors-innocence-organizations/\"\u003ework together with organizations\u003c/a\u003e like the Innocence Project to identify potential cases and procure access to relevant evidence that might lead to an exoneration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We saw in Dallas, and in several units in Texas and elsewhere \u0026#8212; including in particular, Brooklyn, New York \u0026#8212; the enormous power that these units have to do justice,” Morrison said. “And it can be an overnight sea change when you go from an administration in a particular DA’s office that reflexively refuses to even look at a claim of wrongful conviction to one that has a unit dedicated to proactively reviewing those claims.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mechanics of the unit in St. Louis County won’t be finalized until someone is brought in to lead it, but it will be walled off from the rest of the prosecutor’s office. Staff will conduct independent reviews of claims of wrongful convictions and lead investigations into cases involving police shootings and allegations of misconduct as they occur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We will err on the side of not limiting the way the unit receives referrals, to ensure we critically review any credible challenges,\u0026#8221; Bell said. \u0026#8220;This is how we ensure justice is and was actually served.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It is difficult to overstate the importance of this independent unit, especially in a place like Saint Louis County,” Jessica Brand of the Justice Collaborative, an independent research and advocacy nonprofit focused on reforming the justice system, said in a statement to The Intercept.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class='stylized pull-left'data-shortcode-type='pullquote' data-pull='left'\u003e“It is difficult to overstate the importance of this independent unit, especially in a place like Saint Louis County.\u0026#8221;\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe work of units that reopen past convictions as well as groups like Innocence Project have led to an increase in the number of exonerees in the U.S. There have been nearly 2,500 recorded exonerations since 1989, Maurice Possley, a journalist and researcher at the National Registry of Exonerations, told The Intercept. “And we only know the ones that we know about,” he explained. “We don’t know how many wrongful convictions there are out there that haven’t been corrected. Or people went ahead and served their time, or did their sentence, and went on with their lives.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile many of Morrison’s cases were brought through individual requests and not conviction integrity units, she said the units have still played a crucial role in setting her clients free. “I’ve represented more than two dozen people who’ve been freed from prison based on DNA and other evidence. And not all of those cases were conviction integrity cases,” she said. “But I would say at least a third of those are ones where I don’t think my innocent client would have been freed if there hadn’t been someone in the DA’s office who decided that they were gonna take it upon themselves to go above and beyond the call and do the right thing. It’s hard to overstate the power that prosecutors have when they put in the resources and the commitment to proactively look at these cases.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe increasing number of conviction integrity units \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/03/13/california-death-penalty-moratorium/\"\u003eraises further questions\u003c/a\u003e about the continued use of the\u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/06/18/georgia-execution-death-row/\"\u003e death penalty\u003c/a\u003e in places like Missouri, where four death row inmates\u003ca href=\"https://www.madpmo.org/innocence/\"\u003e have been exonerated\u003c/a\u003e since 1999. “People have been exonerated from death row, definitively, by DNA testing.” Possley said. “I don’t know how you can ever have a system that is 100 percent error-free; it’s run by human beings,” he explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne challenge that post-conviction units face is that it’s hard for observers to understand why an innocent person might plead guilty, Possley explained. But defendants are often promised lesser sentences for a guilty plea. “More than 90 percent of cases don’t even go to trial. If everybody demanded a trial, the system would collapse. So when you have that much justice administered through plea bargaining,” he continued, “innocence isn’t part of that equation.” To that end, the units are a good thing. “Sunshine is a great tonic, in my opinion. And it can be very helpful in telling people to do the right thing.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe post \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\"

In 2017, none of the 10 active divisions had one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast year, the Army re-established an active SHORAD battalion in Germany. The 5th Battalion of the 4th Air Defense Artillery Regiment was stood up with Avengers \u0026#8212; modified Humvees with a turret on top and two pods of Stinger missiles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Avengers were first used by the Army in 1990, but in recent years most had been relegated to the National Guard or stored in depots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA total of 72 Avengers were pulled out of mothballs last year from Letterkenny Army Depot in Pennsylvania, Holler said. Half are now with the 5-4 ADA and the others are ready for issue at a pre-positioned equipment depot in Germany.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Avenger is a short-range surface-to-air missile that can be attached to a turret on top of a Humvee or they can be mobile and fired over the shoulder. This means they can shoot on the move and are very portable, and why White thinks they will play a big role in providing short-range defense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe plan is to eventually have 10 SHORAD battalions again to defend maneuver units and other critical assets within each of the Army\u0026#8217;s divisions, Holler said.

It is is designed to detect and destroy specific targets within groups of ships by employing advanced technologies that reduce dependence on intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance platforms, network links and GPS navigation in electronic warfare environments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLRASM will play a significant role in ensuring military access to operate in open ocean/blue waters, owing to its enhanced ability to discriminate and conduct tactical engagements from extended ranges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLockheed Martin’s website said the LRASM technology will reduce dependence on ISR platforms, network links, and GPS navigation in aggressive electronic warfare environments. This advanced guidance operation means the weapon can use gross target cueing data to find and destroy its pre-defined target in denied environments. Precision lethality against surface and land targets ensures the system will become an important addition to the US Navy warfighter’s arsenal. LRASM provides range, survivability, and lethality that no other current system provides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe LRASM successfully completed B-1B integration and flight testing, leading the way to an early operational capability (EOC) declaration by the U.S. Air Force in December 2018. The program now marches on with F/A-18E/F flight testing leading to an EOC milestone in 2019.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_43275\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-43275\" style=\"width: 1306px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\u003e\u003cimg class=\"size-full wp-image-43275\" src=\"https://defence-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/mfc-mmm-7388-corrected-04.jpg.pc-adaptive.1920.medium.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1306\" height=\"765\" srcset=\"https://defence-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/mfc-mmm-7388-corrected-04.jpg.pc-adaptive.1920.medium.jpeg 1306w, https://defence-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/mfc-mmm-7388-corrected-04.jpg.pc-adaptive.1920.medium-300x176.jpeg 300w, https://defence-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/mfc-mmm-7388-corrected-04.jpg.pc-adaptive.1920.medium-768x450.jpeg 768w, https://defence-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/mfc-mmm-7388-corrected-04.jpg.pc-adaptive.1920.medium-1024x600.jpeg 1024w, https://defence-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/mfc-mmm-7388-corrected-04.jpg.pc-adaptive.1920.medium-750x439.jpeg 750w, https://defence-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/mfc-mmm-7388-corrected-04.jpg.pc-adaptive.1920.medium-1140x668.jpeg 1140w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1306px) 100vw, 1306px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-43275\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"\u003ePhoto by Lockheed Martin\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n","url":"https://defence-blog.com/news/u-s-navy-award-lockheed-martin-additional-contract-for-long-range-anti-ship-missile.html","published":"2019-07-04T08:20:46Z","guid":"https://defence-blog.com/?p=43273"},{"title":"U.S. Air Force temporarily relocate MQ-9 remotely piloted aircraft to Romania","content":"\u003cp\u003eThe U.S. Air Force announced the temporary relocation of personnel and MQ-9 remotely piloted aircraft from the Miroslawiec Air Base in Poland to Campia Turzii in Romania.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMQ-9 Reaper Remotely Piloted Aircraft, personnel and support equipment with the 52nd Expeditionary Operations Group Detachment 2 at Miroslawiec Air Base, Poland, have temporarily relocated to Campia Turzii Air Base, Romania, while the runway at Miroslawiec undergoes construction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe detachment is a geographically separated unit assigned to the 52nd Fighter Wing at Spangdahlem AB, Germany, whose mission is to conduct Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance in order to meet combatant commander objectives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe MQ-9s have been operating out of Poland since May 2018.

and How to Get Iran’s Residency","content":"\u003cp\u003eIran is located in a region of the world dotted with violent conflicts. This has turned the country into one of the world’s most significant migration hubs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost of the migrants flooding to Iran are often from the lower classes of their society who for many reasons, including cultural ones, are incapable of pushing their way into Europe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmid the current situation, a new by-law recently passed by the cabinet provides such migrants particularly those from Afghanistan with a new chance to get Iran’s residency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe by-law facilitates getting Iran’s residency. Each investor will get a five-year Iranian residency if they invest a minimum of €250,000, a report by IRNA said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInvestments can also be made in other currencies accepted by the Central Bank of Iran (CBI).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe by-law is aimed at encouraging foreign investors to make investments in Iran through various ways including opening accounts in the Iranian banks, buying investment bonds and securities as well as investment in the housing sector within official procedures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow the main question lingering in mind is that why should one get Iran’s residency?\u003cbr /\u003e\nThere are some good reasons: First, it is interesting to know that Iran is home to about 3,200,000 foreign nationals. The figure is two times more than the number of foreign nationals living in a country like Qatar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTherefore, if the new by-law manages to convince 0.1 percent of the migrants to get Iranian residency, this means about €128 million will enter the country, a figure which stands at about one-fifth of trade volume between Iran and France in 2017.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecond, Iran is located in a region of the world dotted with violent conflicts. This has turned the country into one of the most significant migrant hubs of the world. Most of the migrants flooding to Iran are from the lower classes of their society who for many reasons including cultural ones are incapable of pushing their way into Europe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThird, the main issue is that the current regulations to get Iranian residency are not facilitating. But now the new by-law is set to make the process easier. Those people qualified to get Iranian residency fall into five groups:\u003cbr /\u003e\n1. Those who have lived in Iran for five consecutive or non-consecutive years in Iran. The applicants should also be above 18.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2. Those who have resided consecutively or non-consecutively in Iran for at least two years but enjoy specific scientific and professional achievements but whose expertise should be approved by the related authorities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e3. Those who have resided consecutively or non-consecutively in Iran for at least two years but provided valuable public services. Their services should be approved by the related authorities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e4. Those who have resided consecutively or non-consecutively in Iran for at least two years and provided valuable production or construction services. Their services should be approved by the related authorities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e5. Those who have resided consecutively or non-consecutively in Iran for at least two years and enjoy a personal revenue, salary or retirement pension. Their services should be approved by an Iranian bank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e6. Those who have Iranian spouse and children.\u003cbr /\u003e\nThe newly approved by-law has also removed the prerequisites of two years of legal residency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd finally, one of the facilities provided by the new by-law is that the investment should not necessarily be made in production or construction areas.

Opposing Iran and limiting the country. Of course, these three planks are related and associated with one another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKhabar Online: What is his policy towards Iran?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExpert: At the beginning, the most important factor was Trump’s opposition to Obama’s policy toward Iran and the Middle East.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother point that Trump mentioned time and again was his bitter memories of cases where, in his view, Iranians had humiliated Americans. The last one of those cases was the capture of American sailors and the broadcast of their video showing them crying. Such events were not tolerable for a nationalistic individual like him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoreover, he tried to adopt an active regional policy vis-à-vis his main ally, Israel, and his cronies such as Saudi Arabia and other sheikhdoms. He was trying to remove their fear of Iran by making them feel Washington was supporting them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother key contributor was his associates each of which were against Iran one way or another. In the closest circle of his associates, there was no one who would know and have a balanced policy toward Iran. Those who somehow had such tendencies such as the defense secretary and the secretary of state were fired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd finally, Tehran lacks academic education. He does not know Iran, its history and its culture. Such a lack of knowledge wouldn’t be problematic under normal circumstances, but such knowledge is needed when a relationship becomes critical in the true sense of the word. Furthermore, He has a confused and disorganized mind. Of course, all those who make decisions about Iran have minds like this. Nevertheless, it seems that tangible changes have recently taken place in that regard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKhabar Online: Why did those changes occur?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExpert: These changes, or let’s say developments, have different reasons. The reality is that under the circumstances, the Americans are willing to threaten to intervene in other countries militarily as long as no war will break out. The second point is that after the situation became critical, especially after Iran’s downing of the US drone, most countries and independent personalities warned about the outbreak of an all-out and destructive war that would engulf many countries. Given Iran’s self-restraint and the fact that Iran will never initiate a war, most criticism was directly or indirectly directed toward the US.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe third point is related to sheikhdoms. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) was the most ardent advocate of war. As remarks by UAE authorities suggested, they not only wanted a destructive war, but sought to disintegrate Iran and change its religious denomination in the long run. Apparently, their experiences over the past two months have brought them to the conclusion that the military option is not the solution, a point which was straightforwardly announced by Anwar Gargash after the downing of the American unmanned aerial vehicle. Gargash is currently the spokesperson for the hawkish and interventionist anti-Iran sheikhdoms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKhabar Online: How will the status of relations between China, Russia and Iran be? Will they stand by Iran’s side?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExpert: Russia stood firm by Syria and Venezuela, but is unlikely to stand by Iran that firmly. This is related to our status as a country, not Moscow’s policy. The reality is that Iran is a country which is alone and, in a sense, does not take allies. This has historical, cultural, religious, social and identity-related reasons, and is not that much related to the situation in recent decades. This does not mean that we are backing Russia. And it is undeniable that the Russians are seeking their own interests and have dealt serious blows to us over the past two centuries. However, it is necessary to understand issues precisely, scientifically and with neutrality. We should also take a stance in accordance with our interests. We need neutrality when understanding issues, not neutrality in taking positions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe same goes for China, which has adopted a conservative policy and basically owes its eye-catching development to this very policy. Iran is an important and exceptional country from different points of view, and both countries will definitely take this into consideration in their future programs. However, they are unlikely to stand by our side in critical and dangerous times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe post \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\"

EU Foreign Policy Chief: Fan of Iran Deal, Critic of Trump","content":"\u003cp\u003eThe first thing you should know about him is that he is adamantly opposed to the United States’ unilateralism. It was on April 26, 2019 when he took a swipe at Washington’s unilateral moves and interventionist measures, namely revoking sanctions waivers for Iranian oil. Addressing a conference on EU-US relations held in Madrid, Borrell said one should wait and see whether Washington’s decision will actually come into force as the move might face opposition by different countries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, Borrell is one of advocates of the Iran nuclear deal. In comments on May 8, 2019 in response to Iran’s scaling back its commitments under the nuclear deal, he said Iran fortunately did not tear up the nuclear agreement and kept it from being completely torn apart. He said the Europeans would be the first countries to be affected by Iran’s ramping up its nuclear activities. Borrell also noted that Washington’s denunciation of the nuclear deal is bad news.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe underlined the Iranians did not tear up the agreement; rather, they said they would not live up to their commitments and adopt measures to limit the agreement if the US fails to keep its side of the bargain under the deal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe should not forget that Spain is the same country that recalled its frigate and temporarily stopped it from continuing to accompany the American USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier moving towards the Persian Gulf at a time when there was much propaganda in order to militarize the strategic body of water. At that time, Borrell said the Spanish government had taken all aspects of the issue into consideration and finally decided to recall the frigate. The Persian Gulf is filled with tensions. Of course, this issue should not be aggrandized and regarded as a complex issue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif sat down for talks with Borrell at an international forum called The Raisina Dialogue in early 2019.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKamal Kharrazi, the head of the Iranian Strategic Foreign Relations Council, also met Borrell in Spain last year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBorrell, in a tweet in February 2019, expressed congratulations on the 40th anniversary of the victory of the 1979 Islamic Revolution of Iran and described Iran as a regional heavyweight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, it seems the replacement of Mogherini with Borrell will not be to Iran’s detriment. Even one may say that Borrell, given his caution and great diplomatic experience, would adopt stances that would be closer to Iran and farther away from the US and its regional allies including Israel and Saudi Arabia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe post \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ifpnews.com/exclusive/new-eu-foreign-policy-chief-fan-of-iran-deal-critic-of-trump/\"\u003eNew EU Foreign Policy Chief: Fan of Iran Deal, Critic of Trump\u003c/a\u003e appeared first on \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ifpnews.com\"\u003eIran Front Page\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://ifpnews.com/exclusive/new-eu-foreign-policy-chief-fan-of-iran-deal-critic-of-trump/","published":"2019-07-04T09:15:06Z","guid":"https://ifpnews.com/?p=145317"},{"title":"Iran Summons UK Envoy over Oil Tanker Seizure","content":"\u003cp\u003eThe ministry’s spokesman Seyyed Abbas Mousavi said on Thursday Iran expressed its strong protest to the top British diplomat over the incident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMousavi also slammed the detention of the vessel as an illegal and destructive measure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is a destructive move done at the request of the US government,” said the spokesman in an interview with the state TV.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This amounts to the imposition of a kind of extraterritorial sanction and will fuel tensions in the region,” said the spokesman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Grace-one tanker was halted early on Thursday by Gibraltar police and customs agencies, aided by a detachment of British Royal Marines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Gibraltar government claims the vessel was carrying crude oil to a refinery in Syria.
