By unveiling the \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/longform/video-game-streaming/\"\u003evideo-game streaming service Project Xcloud\u003c/a\u003e, he’s saying the console doesn’t matter as much moving forward. “I may start on a phone; I may go to a console; I may end up on a PC—but your game catalog should be available,” he says. “Your friends you play with should be there, wherever you’re playing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn this edited interview with \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e, Nadella talks about partnering with Microsoft\u0026#8217;s long-time video game foil Sony, dealing with toxicity in video games, and which game is his current favorite Xbox title.

What changed?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eNadella\u003c/em\u003e: I wanted to acknowledge that gaming is an important thing, and instead of trying to draw a direct line to what the rest of the company was doing at that time, we can still love gaming for gaming’s sake. Since then, what has changed is the connected tissue of this company, which is the cloud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do you need to have a gaming distribution business as well as a separate Azure business in which you sell developer tools and computing power to game publishers? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor us, we will have both. The number of people who use Azure as the cloud backend for their game development is growing—our partnership with Sony [as an example].\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThat was surprising. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s a beginning for us. First of all, it’s all driven by Sony. They looked at who are all their partners that they can trust. In fact, it turns out, even though we’ve competed, we’ve also partnered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do they trust?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBasically and fundamentally the fact that we have a business model in the areas that they’re partnering with us, where we’re dependent on their success. So we will do the best job for them, whether it’s in cloud or whether it’s in A.I. or what have you, in order to make sure that Sony can succeed with their own IP creation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSony is going to be using Azure?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s a core piece of the partnership. They also have—beyond gaming—other assets, like interesting devices and silicon (chip) businesses, which could be interesting in the context of what we’re doing in Azure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOverall, if you look at all the parts of these businesses,  whether it’s in entertainment, gaming, or the camera businesses, all of these things can use more cloud computing power. But they can also go-to-market with Microsoft in some industrial cases, especially for their things around cameras.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWith Amazon and Google getting into the gaming business and pushing streaming, it seems that hardware devices will become less relevant. Will the streaming software platforms eventually determine how games are played and how content is distributed? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOur general point of view is that you\u0026#8217;ve got to put people at the center, and then everything else that people use becomes relevant. So I don’t sort of make statements like “devices are not relevant” or “software is all relevant.” The mere reality is that we move between devices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eEven in gaming, I may start on a phone; I may go to a console; I may end up on a PC—but your game catalog should be available. Your friends you play with should be there, wherever you’re playing. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo to me, being able to think about both the market in that expansive way, but, most importantly, think about the use cases for the people in such a way that you’re not bound to only one device or one [software] input—that’s the other thing. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWith the idea of playing games across multiple platforms getting more popular, what will gaming be like five years from now?\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eEach of the platform companies will make their own sets of decisions. The way I look at it, in a world where people are going to play more across more platforms, the opportunity is for us to expand the market—if you really open up. But each player will make their own decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThere’s things you can’t control and you just have to live in the world with it.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat did you think of the gaming business and Xbox prior to becoming Microsoft\u0026#8217;s CEO? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eXbox has a long tradition in our company. I’ve always known the people who have been running that, over the years. Even when I was running Azure, some of the core hypervisor and security work, we would share. In fact, I don’t know if this story has been told, Azure Sphere [Microsoft’s security software for managing Internet-connected devices] comes out of the security work out of Xbox.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn some sense, the entire notion of how do you have the “hardware root of trust” [an IT security feature] docked to a cloud service with a secure channel backed to the update? That’s entirely, one of the things the Xbox has. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhen Xbox was introduced, it was pitched as a gateway to the living room. What you are doing seems like a different view.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe living room is not the only place where people play games—the living room is a super important place where they play games. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe still love our console, we’re going to have another console. We’re going to keep at it, because we think that there are people who want to play games on the console. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it just so happens that people love to play games on PCs. We didn’t have much of a value proposition to them other than saying we have the Windows operating system, and we’ve done everything we’ve can to serve developers there. But we’re now going to do even more on the PC. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWith Xcloud, we can reach anybody on a mobile phone to play AAA games [gaming’s equivalent to Hollywood blockbusters]. It’s more of an extension than to say what we were doing [in the living room] was wrong or not or didn’t make sense. It’s just that hey, it has become clearer and bigger, we have been able to really jump on that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA vocal minority in gaming has a toxic aspect to it. Do you worry that will harm Microsoft’s reputation?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAbsolutely. I mean look, toxicity is not just limited to gaming. When I think about Internet safety and the need for tools around moderation, investments by us around moderation—this is what we are doing with the Xbox ambassadors. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s all super important stuff. Whenever you have a community that’s an online community—whether it is Yammer inside Microsoft or whether it is Xbox Live and the community outside—they all have to basically be governed by certain norms or civility, and we have to do that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the things I realized is we can’t just complain about what the world looks like. You\u0026#8217;ve got to start by saying, \u0026#8216;Okay, can the people who are creating these communities first, live the values?\u0026#8217; And through that, make sure that the physics of the local interactions is what is reflected in the broader community. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWith so much scrutiny on the tech companies, is this the right time for Microsoft to make a big effort to be a larger consumer tech company?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI mean we are [a consumer tech company]. The question is—because I think there\u0026#8217;s a [misconception] the press has gotten—are you a consumer company or are you an enterprise company? We have tremendous success in the enterprise, but really, the way I’ll always see it is we are focused on users who we can do unique things with in both work and life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are a billion users of Windows—they use it at work, they use it at home. Therefore we always had dual use. I look at, can we do more things around productivity across work and life? What can we do in gaming, obviously, which is entertainment? These are categories we’ve always been in. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt doesn’t take anything away from our success in commercial, but it also gives us a huge opportunity in what the world views as a consumer business. So be it. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDo you play games?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eA little bit. I’m not a big gamer, I will say that. There’s an Xbox game, which is a cricket game that I love [Nadella is referring to the \u003cem\u003eDon Bradman Cricket\u003c/em\u003e gaming franchise].

Not Far Away,” a traveling exhibit that first opened in Madrid and has now taken up residence at the Museum of Jewish Heritage in downtown Manhattan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, the facts: During World War II, 6 million European Jews were murdered by the German Nazi regime across a number of concentration and extermination camps all over Western Europe. Millions of others—from the LGBTQ community to the Roma to the invalid—were also brutally killed. Humans were shipped in trains like cattle to destinations unknown to them as part of one of the worst tragedies ever chronicled, many executed upon arrival in gas chambers effectively used as tools of mass murder. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eToday, although confronted with artifacts, relics, the tales of survivors, and the undeniable truth about the brutalities of the Holocaust, some continue to the deny the legitimacy of history. One more fact: The liberation of the death camps, an event that coalesced with the end of the war, took place in 1945—a mere 74 years ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MJH_hi-res_by-John-Halpern.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2673006\" srcset=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MJH_hi-res_by-John-Halpern.jpg 3000w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MJH_hi-res_by-John-Halpern.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MJH_hi-res_by-John-Halpern.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MJH_hi-res_by-John-Halpern.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MJH_hi-res_by-John-Halpern.jpg?resize=1024,683 1024w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MJH_hi-res_by-John-Halpern.jpg?resize=281,187 281w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MJH_hi-res_by-John-Halpern.jpg?resize=755,503 755w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MJH_hi-res_by-John-Halpern.jpg?resize=100,67 100w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MJH_hi-res_by-John-Halpern.jpg?resize=60,40 60w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MJH_hi-res_by-John-Halpern.jpg?resize=154,103 154w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MJH_hi-res_by-John-Halpern.jpg?resize=591,394 591w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MJH_hi-res_by-John-Halpern.jpg?resize=392,261 392w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MJH_hi-res_by-John-Halpern.jpg?resize=252,168 252w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MJH_hi-res_by-John-Halpern.jpg?resize=697,465 697w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MJH_hi-res_by-John-Halpern.jpg?resize=234,156 234w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MJH_hi-res_by-John-Halpern.jpg?resize=500,333 500w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MJH_hi-res_by-John-Halpern.jpg?resize=578,385 578w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MJH_hi-res_by-John-Halpern.jpg?resize=600,400 600w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MJH_hi-res_by-John-Halpern.jpg?resize=90,60 90w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MJH_hi-res_by-John-Halpern.jpg?resize=185,123 185w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MJH_hi-res_by-John-Halpern.jpg?resize=115,77 115w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MJH_hi-res_by-John-Halpern.jpg?resize=738,492 738w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MJH_hi-res_by-John-Halpern.jpg?resize=777,518 777w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3000px) 100vw, 3000px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eMuseum of Jewish Heritage, New York, N.Y.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eInspiration\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBack in 2007, Ferreiro’s brother suddenly passed in Spain. Two years later, while still reeling from his loss, Ferreiro was given\u003cem\u003e Man’s Search for Meaning,\u003c/em\u003e by Viktor E. Frankl, about the author’s own experience as a prisoner in a Nazi camp. Although previously familiar with the Holocaust, Ferreiro credits the book as the propelling force behind the concept. “I guess if I had been a writer I would have tried to write a book,” Ferreiro says. “But [what] we know how to do is exhibitions, so I just felt this need to create [one].”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhat followed were 10 years of reaching out to the likes of Paul Salmons, the show’s eventual curator, as well as the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and Museum, the memorial site of the largest concentration camp, Auschwitz-Birkenau, in Poland. Partnering with the latter, a Unesco World Heritage site, gave Musealia access to more than 100 artifacts. Over 30 other institutions—including the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C., the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam, and smaller private collections around the world—lent materials as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe exhibit opened in Madrid in December 2017. Originally conceived as a six-month stint that would relocate to New York for a period before its next stop, the Spanish run was so successful (an estimated 600,000 people visited the space), it was extended twice. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow in New York City, it is set to stay put through Jan. 3, 2020, before moving to an as yet-to-be-disclosed location.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf a visit on an average Sunday in the summer is any indication, Ferreiro and his associates’ work has clearly paid off. Cagey about specific statistics concerning the number and origin of visitors, Jeff Simmons, in charge of the exhibit’s communications and public relations team, reveals that, since its opening, more than 60,000 people have made the pilgrimage to downtown New York to visit. “Visitors have come from across the country and from abroad and, to date, are from more than 30 countries,” Simmons writes in an email. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eExperience\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBoth in Spain and in the U.S., questions about a guest’s religion are left untapped—a fact deemed of little significance. “In a way, it’s more important for non-Jewish people to visit,” says Ferreiro, who isn’t Jewish. “Because, of course, Jews are the victims, but the illness of hatred, in this case of anti-Semitism, is in the bodies of others. So I think it’s important for us as non-Jews to actually be very aware that we are the ones that carry or could potentially carry this seed of hatred.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSalmons, also not Jewish, echoes Ferreiro’s sentiments: “It’s important to show that the victims didn’t just appear in history as murder victims,” he says. “This was a catastrophe for world civilization. If we’re going to understand how and why it happened, we have to look beyond the Jewish world of Europe to understand the history, the people that actually created this genocide and were complicit in it. There are a lot more people that are involved in this history than the victims themselves.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Goldin-Family-Passport_MJH-collection.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2673002\" srcset=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Goldin-Family-Passport_MJH-collection.jpg 5184w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Goldin-Family-Passport_MJH-collection.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Goldin-Family-Passport_MJH-collection.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Goldin-Family-Passport_MJH-collection.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Goldin-Family-Passport_MJH-collection.jpg?resize=1024,683 1024w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Goldin-Family-Passport_MJH-collection.jpg?resize=281,187 281w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Goldin-Family-Passport_MJH-collection.jpg?resize=755,503 755w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Goldin-Family-Passport_MJH-collection.jpg?resize=100,67 100w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Goldin-Family-Passport_MJH-collection.jpg?resize=60,40 60w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Goldin-Family-Passport_MJH-collection.jpg?resize=154,103 154w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Goldin-Family-Passport_MJH-collection.jpg?resize=591,394 591w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Goldin-Family-Passport_MJH-collection.jpg?resize=392,261 392w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Goldin-Family-Passport_MJH-collection.jpg?resize=252,168 252w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Goldin-Family-Passport_MJH-collection.jpg?resize=697,465 697w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Goldin-Family-Passport_MJH-collection.jpg?resize=234,156 234w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Goldin-Family-Passport_MJH-collection.jpg?resize=500,333 500w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Goldin-Family-Passport_MJH-collection.jpg?resize=578,385 578w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Goldin-Family-Passport_MJH-collection.jpg?resize=600,400 600w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Goldin-Family-Passport_MJH-collection.jpg?resize=90,60 90w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Goldin-Family-Passport_MJH-collection.jpg?resize=185,123 185w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Goldin-Family-Passport_MJH-collection.jpg?resize=115,77 115w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Goldin-Family-Passport_MJH-collection.jpg?resize=738,492 738w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Goldin-Family-Passport_MJH-collection.jpg?resize=777,518 777w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 5184px) 100vw, 5184px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eChiune Sugihara helped thousands of Jews flee Europe by issuing Japanese transit visas—such as this\none for Jakob Goldin, accompanied by his wife, Roza, and daughter Isabella.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe New York exhibit is spread throughout three different floors. (Slight changes are made to the show as it travels from one city to the next.) Although focusing on the tragedies that came to define Auschwitz, the organizers make a point to explore the social and political changes that allowed for the crimes to be committed. Visitors are confronted with relics: from a prisoner’s jacket from the Sachsenhausen concentration camp to a buckled red shoe belonging to a woman we know nothing about, to a pair of socks padded by Barbara Gamzer while in hiding to muffle her child’s footsteps. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHorrific tales of familial misfortunes are also exposed, like the story of Alfons and Felicia Haberfeld, once owners of a successful 100-year-old liquor factory. In 1939, they decided to board an ocean liner to New York City to bring samples to the World’s Fair. When gearing up to return to their 2-year-old daughter and her grandmother in Poland, war broke out.

Two groves of trees have been planted just inside the entrance, giving way to striking works of art: an 18-foot mirrored-steel sculpture by British artist Conrad Shawcross and, floating across the soaring ceiling, a digital art installation by conceptual artist Jenny Holzer. Up the escalator in the sky lobby, there’s a restaurant by a James Beard Award–winning chef, serving pour-over coffee to go and classic chicken ballotine to stay. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut there’s something else here you probably wouldn’t expect: a three-story, luminescent white orb, which is home to the latest project by one of the world’s most influential filmmakers. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe attraction, named the \u003ca href=\"https://comcastcentercampus.com/universal-sphere/\"\u003eUniversal Sphere\u003c/a\u003e, is executive-produced by Steven Spielberg and opened just weeks ago, though it’s been years in the making.

But during construction there was still no definitive plan for the space. An architect assigned to the project shared a new idea he had come across from London-based company Immersive: a visionary new mode of storytelling, using a sphere as a form of virtual reality without the headset or glasses. Roberts immediately saw the possibilities, and he reached out to someone with filmmaking experience for advice on how to proceed. “I asked Steven, ‘Who’s someone who could take this new sphere and help us make a film?’” recalls Roberts. “When he offered to partner with us himself, we were blown away. What an amazing privilege to work with Steven Spielberg to explore a new form of moviemaking.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Sphere-Entrance.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2669819\" srcset=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Sphere-Entrance.jpg 2400w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Sphere-Entrance.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Sphere-Entrance.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Sphere-Entrance.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Sphere-Entrance.jpg?resize=1024,683 1024w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Sphere-Entrance.jpg?resize=281,187 281w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Sphere-Entrance.jpg?resize=755,503 755w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Sphere-Entrance.jpg?resize=100,67 100w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Sphere-Entrance.jpg?resize=60,40 60w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Sphere-Entrance.jpg?resize=154,103 154w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Sphere-Entrance.jpg?resize=591,394 591w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Sphere-Entrance.jpg?resize=392,261 392w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Sphere-Entrance.jpg?resize=252,168 252w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Sphere-Entrance.jpg?resize=697,465 697w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Sphere-Entrance.jpg?resize=234,156 234w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Sphere-Entrance.jpg?resize=500,333 500w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Sphere-Entrance.jpg?resize=578,385 578w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Sphere-Entrance.jpg?resize=600,400 600w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Sphere-Entrance.jpg?resize=90,60 90w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Sphere-Entrance.jpg?resize=185,123 185w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Sphere-Entrance.jpg?resize=115,77 115w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Sphere-Entrance.jpg?resize=738,492 738w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Sphere-Entrance.jpg?resize=777,518 777w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2400px) 100vw, 2400px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eThe Universal Sphere inside Comcast Technology Center in Philadelphia.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo experience the Universal Sphere firsthand, you must reserve a complimentary ticket online.

As Geoff Colvin observed in an overview of this year\u0026#8217;s tally, this is the first time since the creation of the Global 500 in 1990—\u0026#8221;and arguably\u0026#8230;the first time since World War II\u0026#8221;—that a nation other than the U.S. has topped the ranks of global big business. Geoff\u0026#8217;s essay bears an apt title: \u0026#8220;\u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/longform/fortune-global-500-china-companies\"\u003eIt\u0026#8217;s China\u0026#8217;s World\u003c/a\u003e.\u0026#8221; \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn Chinese, the Global 500 is known as the \u003cem\u003ewubai qiang\u003c/em\u003e (五百强), which literally means \u0026#8220;500 strong.\u0026#8221; And yet, as astute \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e readers know, the ranking is based strictly on revenue—and is thus a measure of size, not strength.

Xiaomi, which went public only last year, may be the youngest firm to ever crack the Global 500. Chinese property developer Country Garden made this year\u0026#8217;s biggest leap, rising 176 places to No. 177. Tech giants Alibaba Group and Tencent Holdings, which debuted on the Global 500 only last year, climbed 118 places to No. 182 and 92 places to No. 237 respectively.

Talking about life and what we could possibly do down the road together. We had the time of our lives while shooting Breaking Bad and truly built a very special bond. Knowing that we couldn’t share the screen for quite a while \u0026#8211; our thoughts turned to a new project. We sipped cocktails and thought about what it should be. The younger one looked at his drink and said, you know what we should do? We should do a really special Mezcal. The older one said, you mean the liquor with a worm at the bottom? Nah, that was just some bullshit gimmick, I mean real, artesanal Mezcal made by hand in Mexico. After that dinner we couldn’t get the idea out of our heads. So, we started traveling to Oaxaca to see if we could find it, and we mean it had to be “it,” something so damn good even people who don’t think they like Mezcal will love it. It had to be perfect or we weren’t going to do it. We searched high and low all over Oaxaca, met incredible people along the way and after a beautiful yet grueling search throughout that majestic landscape we believed we may have found our place. Our Mezcal. It was on a dirt-road, in tiny village, hours away from the center of town, we found it and it was perfect. Holy shit it was perfect. We looked at each other and just simply nodded. This is it. We named it Dos Hombres \u0026#8211; two guys on a quest. It’s been a long and crazy journey and we couldn’t be happier to share this with you and the rest of the world. We are crazy about the taste, the aroma, and the versatility of this smokey, age-old alcohol. Try it, and let us know what you think. We are certain you will love it. Well, that’s our story. What’s yours? Go to Doshombres.com to get a bottle of your own.

It also needs to mend a pension system on the hook for an estimated $50 billion to current and future retirees. The government-owned electric utility, the main source of power, also wants to restructure $9 billion of debt. The federal oversight board is negotiating with bondholders to reduce billions of debt, but the political crisis will likely delay that. Before the political upheaval, it had expected to give the court a restructuring plan by mid-July.

Keleher is accused of pressuring her department to direct a contract to a company with which she had a close relationship but which was unqualified to bid, according to the Justice Department. Avila-Marrero is charged with steering contracts to BDO and giving internal information to the company. BDO then subcontracted the work, inflating the cost, according to the Justice Department. Rossello’s former treasury secretary, Raul Maldonado, disclosed in June that his department was being investigated for influence peddling, issuance of fake licenses, destruction of documents and improperly accessing taxpayer records.

Perhaps surprisingly, the answer to that question increasingly appears to be, \u0026#8220;Yes.\u0026#8221; At least that\u0026#8217;s according to the experts I consulted. In lieu of a newsletter column today, below is an excerpt from that piece.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAttend any cybersecurity confab, and you’ll encounter some version of the following refrain. \u0026#8220;There are two types of companies in this world: those that have been hacked and those that don’t yet know they’ve been hacked.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe phrase that launched a thousand quips was coined by Dmitri Alperovitch, a Moscow-born entrepreneur and one of the world’s foremost hacker-sleuths. In 2011, as head threat researcher at antivirus pioneer McAfee, he created the classification while investigating—and publicly revealing—half a decade’s worth of (likely Chinese) cyber­attacks on more than 70 organizations, including defense contractors, tech companies, and the United Nations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow the huff of resignation is due for an update. \u0026#8220;I’ve since modified that phrase,\u0026#8221; Alperovitch tells \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e. \u0026#8220;The first two companies still exist, but now there’s a third type that’s able to successfully defend itself against intrusion.\u0026#8221; Ah, hope yet!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOne could write off Alperovitch’s addendum as a savvy sales pitch. As the cofounder and chief technology officer of CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity company that stunned investors with a \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/06/15/crowdstrike-ipo-cyber-saturday/\"\u003eshare price–popping IPO\u003c/a\u003e in June, there’s no wonder he’s feeling a bit of good cheer. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut there’s something to Alperovitch’s revision. Richard A. Clarke, former White House security adviser to both Bushes and to Clinton, agrees with the new, tripartite framing. He says as much in his just-published book, coauthored with Obama cyber lead Robert K. Knake, \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Fifth-Domain-Defending-Companies-Ourselves/dp/052556196X\"\u003eThe Fifth Domain\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e—a reference to cyber as the newest theater of war, after land, sea, air, and space. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eConsider NotPetya. The devastatingly global computer-wiping attack, which Russia released on the world in 2017, caused billions of dollars of damage to corporations such as \u003ca href=\"http://content.fortune.com/fortune500/fedex-58/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFedEx\u003c/a\u003e, Maersk, and \u003ca href=\"http://content.fortune.com/fortune500/merck-72/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMerck\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut not all firms succumbed. \u0026#8220;What you don’t hear about is the list of American companies that were there doing business in Ukraine”—ground zero for the attack—\u0026#8221;that didn’t get damaged,\u0026#8221; Clarke says. Firms like \u003ca href=\"http://content.fortune.com/fortune500/boeing-24/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBoeing\u003c/a\u003e, DowDuPont, and \u003ca href=\"http://content.fortune.com/fortune500/johnson-johnson-39/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eJohnson \u0026amp; Johnson\u003c/a\u003e \u0026#8220;were the dogs that didn’t bark, and in our book, we tried to figure out why.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo, what separates the hacks from the hack-nots? At a technical level, the unharmed firms had patched their machines against the vulnerability exploited by NotPetya. But a more fundamental question is, Why did some companies patch, while others neglected to?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn a word: prioritization. The most resilient organizations have buy-in across the—literal—board. Any executive who blocks a chief information security officer better have a damn good reason.

Surprisingly, almost everything about the story is conveyed without any text, but that doesn\u0026#8217;t stop the game from creating a super interesting world to explore and characters to interact with. The original concept of the game when Alex Preston of developer Heart Machine envisioned it was \u003cem\u003eThe Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past\u003c/em\u003e meets \u003cem\u003eDiablo\u003c/em\u003e. You will see those similarities throughout your time with the game, but \u003cem\u003eHyper Light Drifter\u003c/em\u003e always manages to feel like its own unique thing, not simply some homage or mashup. The pixel art and animations are some of the best I\u0026#8217;ve seen in any game ever, and the music creates an atmosphere that\u0026#8217;s perfect for every situation you\u0026#8217;re in. This is a game you will lose yourself in even on the somewhat tiny screen of an iPhone. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI won\u0026#8217;t say everything is 100% perfect. The virtual controls can be a bit fiddly when the action gets intense, but if you have an MFi controller handy then you can simply use that. However, then you\u0026#8217;re losing out on one of the more surprisingly great features of the iOS port, the haptic feedback, which is used expertly and adds tremendously to the experience. Honestly? You get used to the virtual controls and you\u0026#8217;re going to be dying left and right anyway, for me the occasional flub is worth having the awesome haptic feedback and not having to lug a controller around.

I\u0026#8217;d rather have borders than have some weirdly stretched pixels or cropped environments anyway.

2019\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the PC end of the chart some things stayed the same when compared to \u003ca href=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/2019/05/25/superdata-says-that-hearthstone-is-up-and-wow-is-down/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eApril\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca

in the same order.  The \u0026#8220;LDFCF\u0026#8221; remains solid.  Repetition is dull though, so the interesting part is slots 6-10.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eWorld of Tanks\u003c/em\u003e, which seems to live in the 6-8 range, popped up one place to 6th as sales of \u003cem\u003eTotal War: Subsided\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 7th position we have the return of \u003cem\u003eWorld of Warcraft\u003c/em\u003e\u0026#8230; or \u003cem\u003eWorld of Warcraft West\u003c/em\u003e\u0026#8230; what ever that means in the reporting sense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eWoW\u003c/em\u003e had gone missing from the chart in April and May, helping to cement speculation that the \u003cem\u003eBattle for Azeroth\u003c/em\u003e expansion had been less than a success with the player base.  Even from where I sit it is hard to deny that mistakes were made.  But for June it is back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas that because the long awaited 8.2 patch and the ability to unlock flying in the expansion had finally arrived?  Did the approach of \u003cem\u003eWoW Classic\u003c/em\u003e and the load tests get people to re-up?  Or did Blizz fiddle the numbers in April and May so that other titles from its stable would get attention?  One notable thing about those two charts is that \u003cem\u003eWoW\u003c/em\u003e went away and \u003cem\u003eHearthstone\u003c/em\u003e appeared one month and \u003cem\u003eOverwatch\u003c/em\u003e the next.  Blizz controls the data that is released on revenues, so this could have been an attempt to show they are not still just a one product company.  Or maybe not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 8th place if newcomer\u003cem\u003e FIFA Online 3\u003c/em\u003e, followed by perennial bottom of the list contender \u003cem\u003eDOTA 2\u003c/em\u003e, and \u003cem\u003eRoblox\u003c/em\u003e, which pops onto the list every now and then, taking 10th place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd, to quickly summarize, \u003cem\u003eFortnite\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eFIFA 19\u003c/em\u003e maintained their spots at the top of the console chart, with \u003cem\u003eGTA V\u003c/em\u003e continuing to place mid-pack (expect it to pop next month with the new casino update for online), while \u003cem\u003ePokemon Go\u003c/em\u003e, with anniversary celebrations kicking off in June, made it to 2nd on the Mobile end, up from 7th, while \u003cem\u003eCandy Crush Saga\u003c/em\u003e fell from 2nd last month to 4th in June.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBasically I want to get back to PC topics and bring up an \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/_SuperData/status/1153723936158420997\"

class=\"wp-caption-text\"\u003eOverwatch in-game spending\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeaving aside box sales, which I am sure followed the usual pattern of an early spike followed by a low rumble afterwards, \u003cem\u003eOverwatch\u003c/em\u003e has successfully crossed the billion dollar mark.  That is a hell of an achievement.  It is interesting to see the PC side lead the console side by what looks like a ratio of 3 to 1.  I wonder if that also happens to represent the breakout of the player base.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I am also reminded that \u003cem\u003eWoW\u003c/em\u003e had multiple consecutive billion dollar revenue years over its life and, were Blizz to break out the numbers, I would bet that it is still good for more than half that much revenue during an expansion year and not a ton less for an off year.  The subscription model is still pretty good when you can make it work.  Or, if you don\u0026#8217;t want to go that route, you might need to sell champions like \u003cem\u003eLeague of Legends\u003c/em\u003e, which still surpasses a billion annually selling those and skins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain,

Digital sales were likely boosted by the above-average download rates seen so far this year but also point to the sustained popularity of the\u003cem\u003e Crash Bandicoot\u003c/em\u003e IP.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eTom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege\u003c/em\u003e‘s player base is as strong as ever. \u003c/strong\u003eJune was \u003cem\u003eRainbow Six\u003c/em\u003e‘s best month for Monthly Active Users and sixth-best month for in-game spending on the back of the Operation Phantom Sight update, despite the title being well into its fourth year.

2019\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the PC end of the chart some things stayed the same when compared to \u003ca href=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/2019/05/25/superdata-says-that-hearthstone-is-up-and-wow-is-down/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eApril\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca

in the same order.  The \u0026#8220;LDFCF\u0026#8221; remains solid.  Repetition is dull though, so the interesting part is slots 6-10.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eWorld of Tanks\u003c/em\u003e, which seems to live in the 6-8 range, popped up one place to 6th as sales of \u003cem\u003eTotal War: Subsided\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 7th position we have the return of \u003cem\u003eWorld of Warcraft\u003c/em\u003e\u0026#8230; or \u003cem\u003eWorld of Warcraft West\u003c/em\u003e\u0026#8230; what ever that means in the reporting sense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eWoW\u003c/em\u003e had gone missing from the chart in April and May, helping to cement speculation that the \u003cem\u003eBattle for Azeroth\u003c/em\u003e expansion had been less than a success with the player base.  Even from where I sit it is hard to deny that mistakes were made.  But for June it is back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas that because the long awaited 8.2 patch and the ability to unlock flying in the expansion had finally arrived?  Did the approach of \u003cem\u003eWoW Classic\u003c/em\u003e and the load tests get people to re-up?  Or did Blizz fiddle the numbers in April and May so that other titles from its stable would get attention?  One notable thing about those two charts is that \u003cem\u003eWoW\u003c/em\u003e went away and \u003cem\u003eHearthstone\u003c/em\u003e appeared one month and \u003cem\u003eOverwatch\u003c/em\u003e the next.  Blizz controls the data that is released on revenues, so this could have been an attempt to show they are not still just a one product company.  Or maybe not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 8th place if newcomer\u003cem\u003e FIFA Online 3\u003c/em\u003e, followed by perennial bottom of the list contender \u003cem\u003eDOTA 2\u003c/em\u003e, and \u003cem\u003eRoblox\u003c/em\u003e, which pops onto the list every now and then, taking 10th place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd, to quickly summarize, \u003cem\u003eFortnite\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eFIFA 19\u003c/em\u003e maintained their spots at the top of the console chart, with \u003cem\u003eGTA V\u003c/em\u003e continuing to place mid-pack (expect it to pop next month with the new casino update for online), while \u003cem\u003ePokemon Go\u003c/em\u003e, with anniversary celebrations kicking off in June, made it to 2nd on the Mobile end, up from 7th, while \u003cem\u003eCandy Crush Saga\u003c/em\u003e fell from 2nd last month to 4th in June.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBasically I want to get back to PC topics and bring up an \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/_SuperData/status/1153723936158420997\"

a low rumble afterwards, \u003cem\u003eOverwatch\u003c/em\u003e has successfully crossed the billion dollar mark.  That is a hell of an achievement.  It is interesting to see the PC side lead the console side by what looks like a ratio of 3 to 1.  I wonder if that also happens to represent the breakout of the player base.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I am also reminded that \u003cem\u003eWoW\u003c/em\u003e had multiple consecutive billion dollar revenue years over its life and, were Blizz to break out the numbers, I would bet that it is still good for more than half that much revenue during an expansion year and not a ton less for an off year.  The subscription model is still pretty good when you can make it work.  Or, if you don\u0026#8217;t want to go that route, you might need to sell champions like \u003cem\u003eLeague of Legends\u003c/em\u003e, which still surpasses a billion annually selling those and skins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, \u003cem\u003eOverwatch\u003c/em\u003e is a big success, but you can kind of see why it only makes the SuperData chart on rare occasions.  It stands among giants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn to other things\u0026#8230; like the \u003ca href=\"https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/top-10/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eNPD chart for June\u003c/a\u003e.  As always, the NPD

At the beginning of the movie, when Mandy comes to while lying facedown on the lawn outside her parents’ house, the first glimpse of her exposes her fingers, alien and abstractly arranged among blades of grass. When she goes inside to take a shower, the camera captures her silently processing her physical state—the bruises on her arms, the uneasy jolt of realization as she takes off her jeans. It stays with her at school, where she goes to basketball practice and regains her composure. And it fixes on her face, later that night, after Mandy starts receiving a string of texts from friends about a video of a girl who seems to be her. Barreto’s unblinking, freckled face dominates the screen as Mandy tries to untangle what she’s seeing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe most striking thing about \u003cem\u003eShare\u003c/em\u003e, the debut feature from Pippa Bianco airing on HBO tonight, is how it subverts the logic of viral videos. The medium tends to dehumanize, taking people—complicated mulches of flesh and foibles and desires—and reducing them to the essence of a single moment. \u003cem\u003eShare\u003c/em\u003e does the opposite. It fixes on Mandy as she realizes that something terrible has happened to her, and that videos of the event are circulating among virtually everyone she knows. It offers up her interiority, but also her experience. Viewers hear the frantic pings of her cellphone, sense how rooms get quiet when she enters them, feel the eyes on her at all times. Bianco forces audiences into an intimacy with Mandy that suffuses the film. Everything she sees, everything she feels, is everything that happens.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn Barreto, a 21-year-old British unknown, Bianco has an actor who’s persuasively ordinary as a teenager, but also totally hypnotic. As the events of the movie unspool, Mandy’s vitality seems to seep out of her. She’s almost entirely passive, acquiescing to everything that happens to her. The central question occupying \u003cem\u003eShare\u003c/em\u003e is exactly what happened to Mandy that night, and yet there are no dramatic courtroom scenes or therapeutic revelations. Instead, the movie sleepwalks with Mandy through a series of ongoing events. Her parents take her to file a police report after finding the video on her laptop. She’s suspended from the basketball team for drinking alcohol. After one of the best players on the boy’s team, A.J. (Nicholas Galitzine), is arrested for “video voyeurism” for filming Mandy while she was passed out, she starts receiving strings of abusive messages. And even when she blocks the numbers they keep coming.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eShare\u003c/em\u003e is based on Bianco’s 2015 short film of the same name, which captured a single school-day in the life of a teenage girl featured in an assault video that goes viral. The feature-length \u003cem\u003eShare\u003c/em\u003e has the same cloying dread and claustrophobia, but it’s distinguished by how faithfully it commits to Mandy’s experience. In one moment, Bianco films Mandy’s hands from underwater while she’s doing dishes, as if she’s submerged. She films Mandy playing video games alone, and dully making herself a sandwich. On her little brother’s birthday, Mandy can barely form the syllables to sing when his cake is brought out. Her mother, Kerri (Poorna Jagannathan), is initially fired up by the urge to protect her daughter, but as the movie goes on she, too, is gradually beaten down. Her father, Mickey (J.C. MacKenzie), has difficulty coming to terms with what’s happened to Mandy. “I know things like this happen to someone every day, and that they happen here,” Kerri tells Mandy. “But he didn’t know that. Because he didn’t have to.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eShare\u003c/em\u003e isn’t the kind of movie to clumsily advocate for anything, or sensationalize its subject (Bianco recently directed an episode of HBO’s \u003cem\u003eEuphoria\u003c/em\u003e, which is a \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/06/euphoria-hbo-review-zendaya/591955/?utm_source=feed\"\u003emuch less sensitive production\u003c/a\u003e). It acknowledges that the act of going to the police makes Mandy’s life infinitely harder, without guaranteeing that she’ll get any kind of justice, or even clarity about what happened to her. It understands the social dynamics of high school, and the agonies of being ostracized, or just being lonely. It refuses to condemn Mandy for anything, just as it deigns to show the complicated humanity of the people who victimize her. More than anything, though, it shows the horror of having a private moment transform into a public spectacle—the mounting anxiety played out in robotic chimes, the throb of humiliation. In committing to the fullness of what Mandy endures, \u003cem\u003eShare\u003c/em\u003e takes a 21st-century act of exposure and flips it, filling in the background around the glare of a viral detonation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/j4kHGX5LdKM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/j4kHGX5LdKM/","published":"2019-07-27T10:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-594907"},{"title":"The Bill for America First Is Coming Due","content":"\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIn this crowded and enervating week of news, it would have been easy to miss two small but consequential signs of the damage President Donald Trump and his team have done to America’s standing in the world.

You could be forgiven if you didn’t notice.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eMembers of the committee majority, led by Chairman Jerry Nadler, crowded together in front of a podium to unveil their next steps following the testimony Wednesday of former Special Counsel Robert Mueller. What began as an announcement of high-profile lawsuits building on that testimony quickly devolved into a confused back-and-forth with reporters as Nadler and his colleagues repeatedly insisted they were not beginning impeachment proceedings before admitting that, yes, they were basically doing just that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e“Impeachment isn’t a binary thing,” argued Representative Mary Gay Scanlon, the committee’s vice chair. “What we’ve been saying, what we’ve been doing, is starting a process.

The force of their arguments was self-evident. During the press conference, though, that clarity evaporated. In shuffling toward impeachment proceedings, the Democrats are starting, however hesitantly, to take up their constitutional responsibilities in the face of what they themselves recognize as the president’s continued abuses of power. But their hesitation strips away the moral clarity in defense of the rule of law that impeachment proceedings might otherwise have offered.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe Democratic leadership in the House of Representatives has test-driven a range of arguments against the initiation of an impeachment inquiry or outright impeachment itself. At first, before the release of the Mueller report, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi insisted that Trump is “\u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/magazine/wp/2019/03/11/feature/nancy-pelosi-on-impeaching-president-trump-hes-just-not-worth-it/?utm_term=.34399262399b\"\u003ejust not worth it\u003c/a\u003e,” worrying that impeachment would divide the country. The president “\u003ca href=\"https://www.pressherald.com/2019/05/23/pelosi-claims-trump-wants-to-be-impeached-as-war-of-words-continues-after-meeting/\"\u003ewants to be impeached so he can be exonerated by the Senate\u003c/a\u003e,” she later suggested. Yet at the same time, she called his actions “\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/rebeccaballhaus/status/1131617343908532225\"\u003evillainous to the Constitution\u003c/a\u003e.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe muddled nature of the Democratic position was on full display following Mueller’s testimony. At a \u003ca href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?463006-1/speaker-pelosi-impeachment-depends-the-facts-law\"\u003epress conference\u003c/a\u003e following Mueller’s testimony, Pelosi declared that Trump’s actions would have resulted in indictment had he not been president and accused him of engaging in a “cover-up”—but she did not change her view on impeachment. Standing alongside her was House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, who that day had accused the president of criminal conduct and “disloyalty” to his country—but who, the next morning, \u003ca href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/25/politics/impeachment-window-democrats/index.html\"\u003esuggested\u003c/a\u003e that he had not yet reached the point of supporting impeachment, though the president’s defiance of a court order might “push [him] over the edge.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe basic message is that the movers and shakers among the House Democrats believe the president to be a criminal who is disloyal to his country and abusive of his office, and yet somehow his conduct is not quite bad enough to justify the constitutional remedy designed to address the problem posed by such a leader. Pelosi and Schiff both have argued that impeachment proceedings are too dire a remedy to use in a situation in which the Senate would fail to convict an impeached president. But this is a separate argument, and to some extent one at cross purposes, from their hints that Trump’s actions so far just don’t rise to a level that warrants impeachment. There may be a clear, forceful line of logic somewhere in here, but the House leadership has instead dabbled in a range of arguments while committing to none.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eFriday’s House Judiciary Committee press conference flipped that dynamic on its head. The committee is moving toward impeachment proceedings—or, perhaps, has already begun them—with the same confusion that characterizes Pelosi’s opposition to it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThere is a logic behind Nadler’s approach, clarified by the stated reason for convening the press conference in the first place: The committee announced that it had \u003ca href=\"https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/6218761/6e-Petition-7-26-2019.pdf\"\u003efiled an application\u003c/a\u003e for a court to unseal grand jury material contained in, but redacted from, the Mueller report. Such material is protected by law from release under all but the rarest of circumstances. Due to a quirk in a \u003ca href=\"https://www.lawfareblog.com/summary-dc-circuit-rules-grand-jury-secrecy-mckeever-v-barr\"\u003erecent court decision\u003c/a\u003e, the committee’s hand may well be strengthened in obtaining that material if it can claim to be engaged in an impeachment inquiry, rather than just in the normal process of congressional oversight. In this sense, a press conference establishing that the committee is considering whether to bring articles of impeachment is a necessary step in beginning this litigation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003ePelosi \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/ThePlumLineGS/status/1154801614965940224\"\u003ereportedly signed off\u003c/a\u003e on the language used at the committee’s press conference, suggesting that she and the Judiciary Committee may have reached some kind of compromise. Soft-pedaling an impeachment inquiry allows the committee to reap the benefits of beginning proceedings in a forum in which it’s helpful—that is, the courts—while mitigating whatever damage Democratic leadership worries those proceedings would incur in the political space. The speaker has \u003ca href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/07/politics/pelosi-impeachment-trump-congress/index.html\"\u003evoiced concern\u003c/a\u003e that “the I-word,” \u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-doesnt-want-to-be-impeached--but-he-is-fascinated-by-the-i-word/2019/06/11/1a230480-8b95-11e9-b162-8f6f41ec3c04_story.html?utm_term=.f2f2d6b87e4d\"\u003eas Trump reportedly calls it\u003c/a\u003e, could backfire in the form of increased political support for the president. By fudging whether an inquiry actually exists or not, the committee might make it more difficult for that inquiry to be turned against the Democrats. Thus have Pelosi and Nadler split the baby.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eBut all these evasions and half measures on the part of the Judiciary Committee add up to what appears to be an absence of conviction. When Solomon suggested that the proverbial baby be cut in two, the point was that the woman who agreed did not actually care all that much about the fate of the child.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eImpeachment can carry \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/05/impeaching-trump-refuse-accept-unacceptable/590104/?utm_source=feed\"\u003egreat moral force\u003c/a\u003e. In 1974, the constitutional scholar Charles Black described the role of Congress in impeachment proceedings as “determining finally some of the weightiest of constitutional questions”—what the Constitution means when it says that a president may be removed for “high crimes and misdemeanors,” and which actions by a president are so vile or unacceptable that the country can no longer move forward under that person’s leadership. The act of beginning an impeachment inquiry is an opportunity to consider what the United States is and what it should be or could be. It is a declaration of constitutional and historical meaning.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIf Friday’s press conference was a declaration of anything, it was lost in the confusion. The trouble with bringing urgent moral questions down to the level of political horse-trading is that the urgency dissolves, and with it the sense of moral crisis that House Democrats worked so hard over the course of Mueller’s testimony to build up.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIs moral clarity too much to expect? The process of impeachment is a political judgment, assigned by the Constitution to the branch of government that is both the most politically sensitive and, with its hundreds of members, the most challenged by the problems of collective action. So if the House shuffles awkwardly in the direction of impeachment proceedings, maybe shuffling is the best it can manage. And three months after the release of the Mueller report, any movement toward seriously considering impeachment is both welcome and long overdue.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThen again, the confusion of the press conference stems in part from the sheer strangeness of the prize the Judiciary Committee has invoked impeachment in order to obtain: that is, the grand jury material. The odds in court are uncertain, and the redacted material makes up a minuscule portion of a report that, as Democrats have emphasized again and again, is profoundly unflattering to the president.

In terms of work-life balance, “the candidate’s always going to be struggling, because they need to be out there—they’re the person,” said Kelly Dittmar, a political scientist at Rutgers University. “They need to be at the night events, and the morning breakfasts and all of that.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGrechen Shirley laid out the harrowing schedule she adhered to while running for office: On a typical day, she’d cold-call potential donors—a joyless, unending activity she refers to as “call time”—from 9 a.m. till 2 p.m., take a roughly 90-minute break with her kids, and then resume work into the night, putting in more call time and making appearances at schools, churches, civic associations, and the like. Some days, she said she’d be lucky to get four or five hours of sleep. \"For the average working person to take a year or a year and a half off of their life, and not take a salary but work pretty much 24/7, it's fairly impossible,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese FEC rulings make life less stressful for candidates like Grechen Shirley and Hegar, but publicizing the grind of being a working parent can be politically advantageous, too. “What this allows these women candidates to do,” Dittmar said, “is give another example of how they may have pushed the boundary when it comes to gender equity, or in this case equity more broadly, for parents of young children… You've proven that this is one system in which you've made that change and you could do similar things if you got into Congress.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/Da0riEPFNRc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/Da0riEPFNRc/","published":"2019-07-27T11:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-594943"},{"title":"Why A$AP Rocky’s Sweden Arrest Has Captured Trump’s Attention","content":"\u003cp\u003e“We don’t want to fight y’all.

Kushner spoke with Trump, and so did Kardashian’s husband, Kanye West.

But there’s some precedent for these players to be involved in this way. Rocky is not just a \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liZm1im2erU\"\u003ehit musician\u003c/a\u003e, but also a well-connected celebrity who’s close with \u003ca href=\"https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/kanye-west-new-music-asap-rocky-travis-scott/\"\u003eWest\u003c/a\u003e and the \u003ca href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/3256028/kendall-jenner-reveals-shes-dating-rapper-asap-rocky-in-the-same-week-kylie-splits-from-long-term-boyfriend-tyga/\"\u003eKardashians\u003c/a\u003e. Moreover, Kim Kardashian has made the fight against unjust incarceration her signature political issue. In 2018, she successfully lobbied Trump to grant clemency to \u003ca href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/marcusjones/trump-pardon-clemency-alice-johnson-kardashian?bfsource=relatedmanual\"\u003ea first-time drug offender with a life sentence\u003c/a\u003e.

Previously, he’d spun his every move on incarceration reform, as well as his alliance with West, as \u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/white-house/trump-says-kanye-west-has-increased-his-support-in-black-communities\"\u003eovertures to black voters\u003c/a\u003e. He clearly wants his advocacy for Rocky to be seen in the same way. “I personally don’t know A$AP Rocky, but I can tell you he has tremendous support from the African American community in this country,” he \u003ca href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/07/25/745161310/rapper-a-ap-rocky-charged-in-sweden-for-assault\"\u003esaid to reporters\u003c/a\u003e. On Twitter \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1154501344323080192\"\u003ehe wrote\u003c/a\u003e, “Sweden has let our African American Community down in the United States.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTrump has also used the Rocky case to score points on another issue of concern to him: immigration. “Sweden should focus on its real crime problem!” he \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1154502673514684416?lang=en\"\u003etweeted on Thursday\u003c/a\u003e, alluding to—and amplifying—the \u003ca href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/sweden-crime-rates-immigration-policies/\"\u003econservative argument\u003c/a\u003e that Sweden’s tolerance of migrants has compromised its peace and order. At a 2017 rally, for example, Trump referenced \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/19/world/europe/last-night-in-sweden-trumps-remark-baffles-a-nation.html\"\u003ea nonexistent terror attack in Sweden\u003c/a\u003e; that same year, the \u003ca href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/sweden-counters-trumps-immigration-criticism\"\u003ecountry’s migration minister said\u003c/a\u003e, “The next time, I hope the president, if he’s going to speak about Sweden, is better informed about what the conditions really are here.” Now right-wing pundits such as \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/Cernovich/status/1154452428604895232\"\u003eMike Cernovich\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/thecjpearson/status/1154464031857623042\"\u003eCJ Pearson\u003c/a\u003e are drawing attention to reports that Jafari, Rocky’s alleged victim, is an Afghan immigrant with prior drug convictions and has been released from custody.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePerhaps addressing both sides of the American protests—the Rocky supporters alleging racism and the Trump supporters alleging reckless immigration policies—Sweden’s U.S. ambassador, Karin Olofsdotter, tweeted, “Under Swedish law, every person has the right to a free and fair legal process regardless of ethnic background, wealth and religious affiliation.” Rocky’s Swedish lawyer, Slobodan Jovicic, \u003ca href=\"https://time.com/5636424/asap-rocky-swedish-court-charges/?utm_source=feedburner\u0026amp;utm_medium=feed\u0026amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+time%2Ftopstories+%28TIME%3A+Top+Stories%29\"\u003edismissed the idea\u003c/a\u003e that his client was being subjected to racism, telling reporters, “I don’t see that angle at all.” The main point the Swedish representatives have tried to make, though, is that the protests of Americans regarding Rocky’s situation should be of no consequence.

Americans tend \u003ca href=\"https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2018/02/08/89-of-readers-say-no-parade/\"\u003enot to favor\u003c/a\u003e displays of military power, except in the aftermath of successful wars: The Civil War, World War I, World War II, and the 1991 Gulf War were all followed by parades. Military displays nonetheless have the benefit of showing the American people what their investment in national defense has yielded. Contrary to President Donald Trump’s assertion that “our nation is stronger today than it ever was before,” the “Salute to America” looked more like a military antiques road show than a display of a 21st-century military power.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe age of the current force was most apparent in the Army hardware on display on the National Mall. The M-1A2 Abrams tanks and M-2 Bradley infantry combat vehicles parked near the Lincoln Memorial represent a generation of armored vehicles that were designed in the 1970s and procured in large numbers during the 1980s. More than three decades later, they remain, albeit with modification, the mainstay of the U.S. Army and have been used in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe aircraft that flew over the capital echoed the theme of an advanced but aging force. The B-2 Spirit stealth bomber was another product of the Reagan defense buildup. Although it is an impressive aircraft able to evade enemy radar, the U.S. Air Force has fewer than 20 of them—far short of the 132 the Air Force originally envisioned purchasing when the bomber first took flight in 1988, and its successor, the B-21 Raider, has yet to make its first flight. The two F-22 Raptors that flanked it are newer aircraft but, like the B-2, exist in only small numbers (187 rather than the 750 originally envisioned)—part of a production run that was truncated more than a decade ago when it appeared that the United States wouldn’t face sophisticated adversaries in the foreseeable future. Now, in an era when China and Russia are manufacturing capable combat aircraft and air defenses, America’s non-stealthy aircraft are becoming more vulnerable. Decades after it was introduced, stealth is still working its way into the U.S. military—in the form of the F-35 plane that the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps are procuring. In the meantime, most U.S. combat aircraft are not stealthy and are less and less useful in high-threat environments. Indeed, as a result of a lack of aircraft-modernization programs over the past 30 years, the Air Force’s fighter force is half the size it was when the Berlin Wall fell, and has reached an unprecedented average age of \u003ca href=\"https://csbaonline.org/uploads/documents/CSBA_AFAIS_Report_v9.pdf\"\u003e26 years.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/07/trump-fourth-of-july/593359/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: Trump commandeers the Fourth of July\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eAbsent from the skies over the nation’s capital were unmanned air vehicles such as the MQ-9 Reaper. Less sexy, and much less expensive, than manned combat aircraft, the Reaper has become a pillar of U.S. military operations in recent years. Unmanned systems like it offer a glimpse into the future of warfare and an example of how the military will need to integrate new technologies. Absent also were the Special Operations warriors and their specialized capabilities that have been crucial to the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, and beyond.

They also might have seen Virginia-class nuclear-powered attack submarines—capable vessels that are nonetheless being purchased in numbers too small to keep our inventory from declining at a time when both China and Russia are increasingly active under the seas. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe United States tends not to parade its nuclear forces in public.

In the 1990s, it reveled in notions of the “unipolar moment” and the “end of history.” Following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, it was consumed with the need to defeat irregular adversaries who lacked the ability to contest U.S. supremacy in any domain of warfare. The need to win the wars the U.S. was already fighting took precedence over the responsibility to prepare for the very different wars America might have to fight in the future. As a result, the growth in military spending after the 9/11 attacks went to fund the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan rather than modernize the U.S. armed forces.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/03/trumps-budget-harms-national-security/584716/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: Trump’s budget harms national security\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Trump administration’s defense budgets have increased the readiness of U.S. forces, but have yet to deliver new military concepts and capabilities.

One project would replace 46 miles (74 kilometers) of barrier in New Mexico for $789 million. Another would replace 63 miles (101 kilometers) in Arizona for $646 million. The other two projects in California and Arizona are smaller.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other funds were not at issue in the case.

Between April and November of 1919, white people in cities and towns across the country instigated race riots, attacking and often killing their black neighbors. The period would come to be known as Red Summer.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time the hottest weekend of the season came around, Chicago had already seen two dozen bombings of black residents, none of which was solved by the cops. So the city was already a powder keg of racial resentment when group of teenage boys decided that they wanted to go for a swim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEugene Williams, a black 17-year-old originally from Georgia, was among those boys. He and his friends had built a raft to play on in Lake Michigan. While most public accommodations in Chicago were not legally segregated, the beaches around Lake Michigan were the site of strong informal segregation. And as Williams and his friends swam and dove off their raft, they unknowingly drifted into the white section of the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eContemporary reports from the \u003ca href=\"http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/August-2019/1919-Race-Riot/\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003eChicago \u003cem\u003eEvening \u003c/em\u003e\u003ci\u003ePost\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e state that white people in the water and on the beach grew agitated when they saw black teenagers in \u0026#8220;their\u0026#8221; section of the lake. A 24-year-old white man named George Stauber began throwing rocks at the boys. It is unclear exactly what happened next \u0026mdash; some witnesses saw Williams get hit by the rocks and fall into the water; others say he ducked under to avoid getting hit. But accounts agree that Williams drowned in Lake Michigan as a result of Stauber\u0026rsquo;s racist harassment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to \u003ca href=\"http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/August-2019/1919-Race-Riot/\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003eJohn Turner Harris\u003c/a\u003e, a friend of Williams who was interviewed decades later by historian William M. Tuttle, when it became clear that Williams was dead, a black police officer attempted to arrest Stauber. A white cop intervened and did not allow the arrest. An argument broke out between the two officers and Williams\u0026rsquo; friends ran to notify other African Americans. According to contemporary reports by the \u003ca href=\"http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/August-2019/1919-Race-Riot/\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003eChicago Commission on Race Relations\u003c/a\u003e, a thousand black Chicagoans gathered following the news of the drowning. An altercation between that group and the police resulted in the death of James Crawford, a black man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmotions remained elevated for the rest of the day, eventually escalating into violence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Irish-American gangs of young men in so-called athletic clubs were the initial cause of the riots,\u0026rdquo; said Cole. The night after Williams\u0026rsquo; death, Irish Americans crossed over from their neighborhood, Bridgeport, into the African-American neighborhoods of Chicago\u0026rsquo;s south side. \u0026ldquo;They invaded the neighboring black areas and started attacking,\u0026rdquo; says Cole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the next week, battles raged in Chicago. The death toll of the riots was 38 people. Additionally, over 500 people, most of whom were black, were injured and over a thousand people were left homeless. As the violence wore on, the Illinois Reserve Militia was called in to ease the riots. On July 31, the day after the militia entered the city, the violence eased but destruction continued, with arson destroying dozens of homes. The militia remained in Chicago until August 8. It was \u0026ldquo;the deadliest incidence of racial violence ever\u0026rdquo; in Chicago, says Cole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://time.com/newsletter-history\" \u003e\u003cem\u003eGet your history fix in one place: sign up for the weekly TIME History newsletter\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe effects of those July altercations have reverberated across history and continue to affect Chicagoans to this day. According to Cole, the riots were a major factor in the expansion and the hardening of racial segregation in Chicago, which is now the \u003ca href=\"https://www.apnews.com/d759f01363584b3a9aa232f07082475a\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003esecond most\u003c/a\u003e segregated city in the United States, following Detroit. One mechanism by which the city got that way is a legal tool called a restrictive covenant, which was used to bar African Americans from owning or renting certain properties. \u0026ldquo;After the riots there\u0026rsquo;s a massive increase of the use of this legal tool,\u0026#8221; Cole says. \u0026#8220;That further contains African Americans because they literally cannot move into many neighborhoods because that\u0026rsquo;s the law.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time the Supreme Court declared such covenants unconstitutional in 1948, millions of homes were already restricted, making it effectively impossible for African Americans to move outside of their segregated Chicago neighborhoods. These neighborhoods were never equitable when compared to white neighborhoods, and as the city\u0026#8217;s black population grew in size, they offered no room to expand geographically. Landlords were able to take advantage of these circumstances, exploiting black tenants who paid more money for worse conditions. \u0026ldquo;There was no incentive to maintain quality housing because there\u0026rsquo;s huge demand and not enough supply,\u0026#8221; Cole says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut, despite the riots\u0026#8217; significance in that history, Cole has found that few are aware of this part of the city\u0026#8217;s past. \u0026ldquo;The history is essentially unknown in the city and the state and the country,\u0026rdquo; Cole says. \u0026ldquo;When people say \u0026lsquo;Chicago is segregated\u0026rsquo; they don\u0026rsquo;t even appreciate why, let alone how.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver time, the choice to not teach the story of such a moment can erase it from the collective awareness of future generations. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s not that you forgot about it; you never knew it because you were born two generations later,\u0026rdquo; says Cole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe centennial of the riots marks an opportunity to change that situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlready, the city of Chicago is planning to mark the anniversary. There will be a guided bike tour of the city highlighting locations significant to the riots, as well as a lecture on the past and present of race relations in Chicago.

In particular, CRR19 is inspired by the memorial work of the artist Gunter Demnig, who created a public art project to memorialize the victims of the Holocaust, not in a museum or a monument, but rather on the streets where they once lived. Demnig installs \u003cem\u003estolpersteine\u003c/em\u003e, or stumbling stones, near the last known residences of Holocaust victims. The stones are small, containing the names of victims as well as information about what happened to them during the war. The purpose is to force people to grapple with the effects of the Holocaust as they walk down the street during their day-to-day life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;We could be inspired by \u003cem\u003estolpersteine\u003c/em\u003e, applying that sort of concept,\u0026#8221; Cole says. \u0026#8220;Locating small markers at locations of importance and installing 38 markers where 38 people were killed in the summer of 1919, a hundred years ago this week.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole emphasizes, however, that Germany\u0026#8217;s remembrance did not begin overnight. \u0026ldquo;It didn\u0026rsquo;t happen in 1946,\u0026#8221; he says. \u0026#8220;In fact, several generations of Germans did their best to say nothing about the Holocaust. It was really their grand-kids that started to do much more, saying \u0026lsquo;we need to deal with this because our parents and our grandparents tried to silence this.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; On the centennial of Red Summer, he believes, the time has come for Chicago to do the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe actual construction of the memorials has not yet begun, as the organization is still in the fund-raising stage.

His papers have been published, the notes he made in his books digitized, a log of his every day compiled, each movement traced, all utterances analyzed, every dog-eared page scanned and uploaded, like so much hay tossed up to a loft.

We wanted to stop and talk to the men, but we were afraid. The white guards on horseback glared at us as we slowed down our machine, so we went on.

Live Nation told Billboard that \u0026#8220;about a dozen artists\u0026#8221; asked for tickets to sell on resale markets in 2016 and 2017. One of the acts who had their tickets directly sold on resale sites was Metallica. The popular metal band\u0026#8217;s members claim they were unaware that the ticketing consultant they hired had made this decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe major impact of artist\u0026#8217;s selling their ticket on resale markets is arguably a good one. Rather than letting scalpers earn money by marking up tickets for resale, performers were able to retain more revenue themselves. (The global secondary ticket market may be worth more than $15 billion in 2020, according to \u003ca href=\"https://blog.technavio.com/blog/top-13-companies-secondary-ticket-market\"\u003emarket research firm Technavio\u003c/a\u003e.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eHow ticket resales work\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImagine tickets for a Beyonce show with face value of $100, and a scalper bought 10 tickets online, which eventually sold for $500 each on StubHub. The scalper would have made $4,000 on those 10 tickets, while Beyonce\u0026#8217;s organization would have received just $1,000. In an actual recent case, the band Bikini Kill sold tickets to their show for about $40, but soon after the cheapest tickets on the secondary market went for three or four times that price (depending on the city).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo then what\u0026#8217;s the problem with artists going directly to resale? There are two important issues. The first one is deception. A popular artist may choose to only sell tickets for $50 in order generate good will from fans, who will believe their performer is not trying to gauge them.  But if the artists are actually selling a lot of those tickets on resale, that\u0026#8217;s kind of a lie. The other issue: Some of the tickets put on resale would have been purchased by real fans if sold at face value. Those tickets sold above face value are costing fans serious money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eTaylor Swift has a better way\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe concert industry seems to be figuring out better pricing policies, with Taylor Swift leading the way. After a 2015 tour in which she lost about $150 million by selling her tickets below market value, according to an analysis by the \u003ca href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/138fb9fa-cc1a-11e8-b276-b9069bde0956\"\u003eFinancial Times\u003c/a\u003e (paywall), Swift decided that she would no longer fight the law of supply and demand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwift wanted her biggest fans to get reasonably priced tickets and also wanted to make sure she reaped the benefits of the extremely high prices that can be garnered on resale. Swift used TicketMaster\u0026#8217;s \u003ca href=\"https://www.popsugar.com/news/How-Does-Ticketmaster-Verified-Fan-Work-44271292\"\u003eVerified Fan platform\u003c/a\u003e (also owned by Live Nation), which uses online data to make sure that people buying tickets are actual fans. The platform tracks whether buyers have purchased Swift tickets or merchandise before. For those who were not verified fans, ticket prices were hiked. The Financial Times estimates that Swift made an additional $1.4 million per show on her 2018 tour as a result of the changes compared to 2015.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eGarth Brooks\u0026#8217; bold gambit\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLive Nation tells Billboard that requests for secondary-market tickets has recently declined as artists seek other creative—and less morally questionable—ways to extract make money from performances. Among these are dynamic pricing, under which not every ticket is sold immediately and the cost of newly released tickets rises and falls as a measurement of initial demand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps the boldest recent move to fend off the resale market was made by the country singer Garth Brooks on his 2014-17 world tour.  Brooks sold all tickets for about $70. If a show sold out, he would add another show at the same price. By making the supply of his tickets basically endless, it made it tough for scalpers. Every Brooks fan knew that as long as they waited, there would probably be a $70 ticket available eventually.

But here’s the most sobering part: Earth Overshoot Day is probably a vast underestimation of the actual level of unsustainable planetary wreckage, and the scientists behind the numbers are the first to admit it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid Lin, the chief science officer of the Global Footprint Network, likes to use the analogy of a bank account: If you have $100 in the bank and spend $200, that puts you in the red. You’ll have a deficit of $100. If you keep living like that, spending what you don’t have, eventually you’ll be in trouble. It’s not a sustainable way to live.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach year, the human population grows. We consume more natural resources than the planet can regenerate in a year, and emit far more carbon dioxide than our forests and oceans can possibly sequester. Thus, our deficit grows. We fall further and further in the red. Last year’s Earth Overshoot Day was Aug. 1, three days later than this year’s.

The calculation is limited by the quality of the global data, which in itself might have some big underestimations built in. Research has suggested that the UN Food and Agriculture Organization might be \u003ca href=\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/01/official-statistics-understate-global-fish-catch-new-estimate-concludes\"\u003eunderestimating the size of the global seafood harvest\u003c/a\u003e by 30%.

But the truth is that it probably barely scratches the surface. Earth Overshoot Day does not, for example, take into account soil degradation, or water contamination, or mass species decline—because it isn’t designed to do that. It is simply a calculation of some inputs and outputs as they are now, and not how much resources might be depleted by human activity in the future. Ecological damage that doesn’t impact humans isn’t reflected here, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It frequently gets misunderstood,” Lin says. “People think it’s this sustainability indicator of everything, which it isn’t. Because no such thing actually exists. It’s theoretically impossible.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe global data for those indicators don’t exist—and even if they did, scientists would have to choose a time parameter for that “sustainability.” Is it sustainable for five years? Or for 10?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOvershoot Day doesn’t take into account, for example, whether our current level of agricultural output is ruining soils for future generations, or whether the current rate of groundwater pumping will result in desperate water shortages a few years down the line. “It’s a measure of what is. Not what could be,” Lin says. It’s a snapshot of Earth’s current deficits, but the future survivability of Earth depends on a lot more than what can be captured by that. “You could sell your organs for money, and your bank accounts that year might look okay, but that’s not sustainable,” Lin says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s safe to say the situation is a lot worse than Overshoot Day lets on. But there’s still a place for the metric as a benchmark for the bare minimum of the trouble we’re in. “In spite of these things, we are still in overshoot. And we don’t have a better global measure for looking at this. No one has suggested a better way yet,” Lin says.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://qz.com/1676243/earth-overshoot-day-is-earlier-than-ever-and-it-underestimates-the-crisis/","published":"2019-07-27T15:05:07Z","guid":"https://qz.com/1676243//"},{"title":"How a Texas family discovered they owned a forgotten Ben Enwonwu portrait valued at $200,000","content":"\u003cimg width=\"1024\" height=\"577\" src=\"https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Ben-Enwonwu-Christine-est.-£100000-150000-without-frame-e1564249170463.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;w=1024\" class=\"attachment-medium_10 size-medium_10 wp-post-image\" alt=\"Ben Enwonwu, Christine\" /\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eImagine finding an almost-forgotten portrait of your mother in your family house, doing a Google search on the artist’s name and discovering that what you own is a precursor to the artist’s best-known work that sold in 2018 for $1.6 million. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eThis is exactly what happened very recently to one of the members of the Davis family in Texas. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eThe portrait, \u003c/span\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eChristine,\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e is the latest remarkable find of work by one of the most revered African artists of the 20th century, Ben Enwonwu.

The freeze had prevented the government from tapping approximately $2.5 billion in Defense Department money to replace existing sections of barrier in Arizona, California and New Mexico with more robust fencing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe case the Supreme Court ruled in began after the 35-day partial government shutdown that started in December of last year. Trump ended the shutdown in February after Congress gave him approximately $1.4 billion in border wall funding. But the amount was far less than the $5.7 billion he was seeking, and Trump then declared a national emergency to take cash from other government accounts to use to construct sections of wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe money Trump identified includes $3.6 billion from military construction funds, $2.5 billion in Defense Department money and $600 million from the Treasury Department\u0026#8217;s asset forfeiture fund.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe case before the Supreme Court involved just the $2.5 billion in Defense Department funds, which the administration says will be used to construct more than 100 miles (160 kilometers) of fencing. One project would replace 46 miles (74 kilometers) of barrier in New Mexico for $789 million. Another would replace 63 miles (101 kilometers) in Arizona for $646 million. The other two projects in California and Arizona are smaller.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other funds were not at issue in the case. The Treasury Department funds have so far survived legal challenges, and Customs and Border Protection has earmarked the money for work in Texas\u0026#8217; Rio Grande Valley but has not yet awarded contracts. Transfer of the $3.6 billion in military construction funds is awaiting approval from the defense secretary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lawsuit at the Supreme Court was brought by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of the Sierra Club and Southern Border Communities Coalition. The justices who lifted the freeze on the money did not give a lengthy explanation for their decision. But they said among the reasons they were doing so was that the government had made a \u0026#8220;sufficient showing at this stage\u0026#8221; that those bringing the lawsuit don\u0026#8217;t have a right to challenge the decision to use the money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexei Woltornist, a spokesman for the Justice Department, said in a statement, \u0026#8220;We are pleased that the Supreme Court recognized that the lower courts should not have halted construction of walls on the southern border.

Between April and November of 1919, white people in cities and towns across the country instigated race riots, attacking and often killing their black neighbors. The period would come to be known as Red Summer.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time the hottest weekend of the season came around, Chicago had already seen two dozen bombings of black residents, none of which was solved by the cops. So the city was already a powder keg of racial resentment when group of teenage boys decided that they wanted to go for a swim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEugene Williams, a black 17-year-old originally from Georgia, was among those boys. He and his friends had built a raft to play on in Lake Michigan. While most public accommodations in Chicago were not legally segregated, the beaches around Lake Michigan were the site of strong informal segregation. And as Williams and his friends swam and dove off their raft, they unknowingly drifted into the white section of the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eContemporary reports from the \u003ca href=\"http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/August-2019/1919-Race-Riot/\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003eChicago \u003cem\u003eEvening \u003c/em\u003e\u003ci\u003ePost\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e state that white people in the water and on the beach grew agitated when they saw black teenagers in \u0026#8220;their\u0026#8221; section of the lake. A 24-year-old white man named George Stauber began throwing rocks at the boys. It is unclear exactly what happened next \u0026mdash; some witnesses saw Williams get hit by the rocks and fall into the water; others say he ducked under to avoid getting hit. But accounts agree that Williams drowned in Lake Michigan as a result of Stauber\u0026rsquo;s racist harassment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to \u003ca href=\"http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/August-2019/1919-Race-Riot/\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003eJohn Turner Harris\u003c/a\u003e, a friend of Williams who was interviewed decades later by historian William M. Tuttle, when it became clear that Williams was dead, a black police officer attempted to arrest Stauber. A white cop intervened and did not allow the arrest. An argument broke out between the two officers and Williams\u0026rsquo; friends ran to notify other African Americans. According to contemporary reports by the \u003ca href=\"http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/August-2019/1919-Race-Riot/\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003eChicago Commission on Race Relations\u003c/a\u003e, a thousand black Chicagoans gathered following the news of the drowning. An altercation between that group and the police resulted in the death of James Crawford, a black man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmotions remained elevated for the rest of the day, eventually escalating into violence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Irish-American gangs of young men in so-called athletic clubs were the initial cause of the riots,\u0026rdquo; said Cole. The night after Williams\u0026rsquo; death, Irish Americans crossed over from their neighborhood, Bridgeport, into the African-American neighborhoods of Chicago\u0026rsquo;s south side. \u0026ldquo;They invaded the neighboring black areas and started attacking,\u0026rdquo; says Cole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the next week, battles raged in Chicago. The death toll of the riots was 38 people. Additionally, over 500 people, most of whom were black, were injured and over a thousand people were left homeless. As the violence wore on, the Illinois Reserve Militia was called in to ease the riots. On July 31, the day after the militia entered the city, the violence eased but destruction continued, with arson destroying dozens of homes. The militia remained in Chicago until August 8. It was \u0026ldquo;the deadliest incidence of racial violence ever\u0026rdquo; in Chicago, says Cole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://time.com/newsletter-history\" \u003e\u003cem\u003eGet your history fix in one place: sign up for the weekly TIME History newsletter\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe effects of those July altercations have reverberated across history and continue to affect Chicagoans to this day. According to Cole, the riots were a major factor in the expansion and the hardening of racial segregation in Chicago, which is now the \u003ca href=\"https://www.apnews.com/d759f01363584b3a9aa232f07082475a\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003esecond most\u003c/a\u003e segregated city in the United States, following Detroit. One mechanism by which the city got that way is a legal tool called a restrictive covenant, which was used to bar African Americans from owning or renting certain properties. \u0026ldquo;After the riots there\u0026rsquo;s a massive increase of the use of this legal tool,\u0026#8221; Cole says. \u0026#8220;That further contains African Americans because they literally cannot move into many neighborhoods because that\u0026rsquo;s the law.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time the Supreme Court declared such covenants unconstitutional in 1948, millions of homes were already restricted, making it effectively impossible for African Americans to move outside of their segregated Chicago neighborhoods. These neighborhoods were never equitable when compared to white neighborhoods, and as the city\u0026#8217;s black population grew in size, they offered no room to expand geographically. Landlords were able to take advantage of these circumstances, exploiting black tenants who paid more money for worse conditions. \u0026ldquo;There was no incentive to maintain quality housing because there\u0026rsquo;s huge demand and not enough supply,\u0026#8221; Cole says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut, despite the riots\u0026#8217; significance in that history, Cole has found that few are aware of this part of the city\u0026#8217;s past. \u0026ldquo;The history is essentially unknown in the city and the state and the country,\u0026rdquo; Cole says. \u0026ldquo;When people say \u0026lsquo;Chicago is segregated\u0026rsquo; they don\u0026rsquo;t even appreciate why, let alone how.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver time, the choice to not teach the story of such a moment can erase it from the collective awareness of future generations. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s not that you forgot about it; you never knew it because you were born two generations later,\u0026rdquo; says Cole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe centennial of the riots marks an opportunity to change that situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlready, the city of Chicago is planning to mark the anniversary. There will be a guided bike tour of the city highlighting locations significant to the riots, as well as a lecture on the past and present of race relations in Chicago. Additionally, the city of Chicago will also have a program on Monday morning, in honor of the anniversary, hosted by Chicago mayor Lori Lightfoot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://chicagoraceriot.org/\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Chicago Race Riot of 1919 Commemoration Project\u003c/a\u003e (CRR19), a group led by Cole, hopes to make sure the memory lasts beyond the weekend. On Saturday, they\u0026#8217;re launching an effort by to create a public art project to honor the victims of the riots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole was inspired to memorialize the victims of American racism during a trip to Berlin, seeing the way Germany has acknowledged its own dark past. In particular, CRR19 is inspired by the memorial work of the artist Gunter Demnig, who created a public art project to memorialize the victims of the Holocaust, not in a museum or a monument, but rather on the streets where they once lived. Demnig installs \u003cem\u003estolpersteine\u003c/em\u003e, or stumbling stones, near the last known residences of Holocaust victims. The stones are small, containing the names of victims as well as information about what happened to them during the war. The purpose is to force people to grapple with the effects of the Holocaust as they walk down the street during their day-to-day life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;We could be inspired by \u003cem\u003estolpersteine\u003c/em\u003e, applying that sort of concept,\u0026#8221; Cole says. \u0026#8220;Locating small markers at locations of importance and installing 38 markers where 38 people were killed in the summer of 1919, a hundred years ago this week.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole emphasizes, however, that Germany\u0026#8217;s remembrance did not begin overnight. \u0026ldquo;It didn\u0026rsquo;t happen in 1946,\u0026#8221; he says. \u0026#8220;In fact, several generations of Germans did their best to say nothing about the Holocaust. It was really their grand-kids that started to do much more, saying \u0026lsquo;we need to deal with this because our parents and our grandparents tried to silence this.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; On the centennial of Red Summer, he believes, the time has come for Chicago to do the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe actual construction of the memorials has not yet begun, as the organization is still in the fund-raising stage. And while two alderwomen, Pat Dowell and Sophia King, will speak at the launch even on Saturday, the installation does not yet have official approval from the city; its funding and timeline have to be finalized first. The Chicago mayor\u0026#8217;s office did not respond to an inquiry about plans to memorialize the events of 1919.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, CRR19 already received some grant money and are beginning a crowd-funding campaign. In a statement released by the organization Eve Ewing, a sociologist at the University of Chicago said, \u0026ldquo;My hope is that CRR19, by making a mark on street corners that many of us pass daily, will invite small moments of reflection on the historical significance of the places that makeup our everyday experiences.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/time/topstories/~4/J2utKoDca5Q\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/J2utKoDca5Q/","published":"2019-07-27T14:00:10Z","guid":"http://time.com/?p=5636039"},{"title":"Woman Dies in Alaska Trying to Reach the Into the Wild Bus","content":"\u003caside class=\"right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad\" id=\"right-rail__ad-5637086\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module video-2\" data-src=\"https://time.com/5637086/woman-dies-alaska-into-the-wild-bus/\" data-widget-id=\"SB_4\" data-ob-template=\"timemag\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFAIRBANKS, Alaska \u0026mdash; A newlywed woman from Belarus who was swept away by a river in Alaska was trying to reach an abandoned bus made famous by the book and film \u0026#8220;Into the Wild.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVeramika Maikamava, 24, and her husband, Piotr Markielau, also 24, on Thursday were heading for the bus where hiker Christopher McCandless met his death in 1992, \u003ca href=\"http://www.newsminer.com/news/local_news/woman-dies-trying-to-reach-famed-into-the-wild-bus/article_b0a03440-aff4-11e9-af35-23e2291ffd6c.html\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Fairbanks Daily News-Miner reported\u003c/a\u003e .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bus has been the source of multiple rescues since it was made famous, first by Jon Krakauer\u0026#8217;s book published in 1996 and then by Sean Penn\u0026#8217;s 2007 film.

With human safety operators behind the wheel as backups, the vans will follow one of two routes between the stores: a roundabout five-mile (one-way) trip that avoids some tricky driving scenarios, or a more direct, uncompromising two-mile shot. “The main aim is to do that repeatedly, safely, without a safety driver onboard,” says Gatik CEO Gautam Narang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1542129#p3\"\u003eRead 5 remaining paragraphs\u003c/a\u003e | \u003ca href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1542129\u0026comments=1\"\u003eComments\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"feedflare\"\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=0hVPq7ehDlc:f0r8Xv4rRvo:V_sGLiPBpWU\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=0hVPq7ehDlc:f0r8Xv4rRvo:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=0hVPq7ehDlc:f0r8Xv4rRvo:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=0hVPq7ehDlc:f0r8Xv4rRvo:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=0hVPq7ehDlc:f0r8Xv4rRvo:qj6IDK7rITs\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=0hVPq7ehDlc:f0r8Xv4rRvo:yIl2AUoC8zA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","url":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1542129","published":"2019-07-27T12:02:11Z","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1542129"},{"title":"Starving predators survive together, but maybe only in math-land","content":"\u003cdiv id=\"rss-wrap\"\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"intro-image intro-left\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Animoji-Lion-800x493.png\" alt=\"Ferocious, right?

Hence, there are physics journals and papers devoted to all manner of topics, including evolution and population dynamics.

From the outside it looks like a nine-tenths Q8 and all the better for being less imposingly large. Open a door and the interior greets you with fashion-forward styling—including orange Alcantara if you're bold—and an infotainment system that's better than anything else on sale.

Not least the ones Carroll repeats towards the end of the film: What information had Cambridge Analytica amassed on him? Where did they get it from? What did they use it for? \u0026#8212; apparently resigning himself to never knowing.

The lack of control over what\u0026#8217;s done with people\u0026#8217;s information is the central point around which the documentary pivots. The key warning being there\u0026#8217;s no magical cleansing fire that can purge every digitally copied personal thing that\u0026#8217;s put out there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd while Carroll is shown able to tap into European data rights \u0026#8212; purely by merit of Cambridge Analytica having processed his data in the UK \u0026#8212; to try and get answers, the lack of control holds true in the US. Here, the absence of a legal framework to protect privacy is shown as the catalyzing fuel for the \u0026#8216;great hack\u0026#8217; \u0026#8212; and also shown enabling the ongoing data-free-for-all that underpins almost all ad-supported, Internet-delivered services. tl;dr: Your phone doesn\u0026#8217;t need to listen to if it\u0026#8217;s tracking everything else you do with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe film\u0026#8217;s other obsession is the breathtaking \u003cem\u003escale\u003c/em\u003e of the thing. One focal moment is when we hear another central character, Cambridge Analytica\u0026#8217;s Brittany Kaiser, dispassionately recounting how data surpassed oil in value last year \u0026#8212; as if that\u0026#8217;s all the explanation needed for the terrible behavior on show.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;Data\u0026#8217;s the most valuable asset on Earth,\u0026#8221; she monotones.

Yet they do this without ever entirely getting under her skin or allowing her role in the scandal to be fully resolved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0026#8217;s often allowed to tell her narrative from behind dark glasses and a hat \u0026#8212; which has the opposite effect on how we\u0026#8217;re invited to perceive her. Questions about her motivations are never far away.

Syrian Mother’s Letter to Her Daughter, “For Sama” Shows War in an Unusually Intimate Light","content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cu\u003eFor the majority\u003c/u\u003e of Western audiences, the region known as “the Middle East” is conceived as a vast swath of constant and inscrutable chaos. In this imagination, diverse conflicts, insurgencies, and civilian revolutions are flattened into a single horrorscape, represented by ubiquitous images of billowing smoke and colorless destruction. Violence, it would appear, is endemic to the region, as natural and inevitable as the endless, hostile desert.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis lack of historicity — and subsequent denial of responsibility — can be partly blamed on Western media that rewards sensationalist, reductionist headlines over nuance. Meanwhile, many residents of the region, including those living in conflict zones, are \u003ca href=\"https://rsf.org/en/2019-rsf-index-middle-easts-journalists-deliberately-targeted\"\u003edenied\u003c/a\u003e any semblance of free, accurate media coverage, with local mainstream outlets trafficking in government propaganda.

The film’s poster plays with stereotype: a woman stands against a backdrop of wrecked buildings and rubble. Her stoic face and dismal surroundings evoke routine associations of tragedy, yet the image contains an unexpected detail: An infant girl, fresh-faced and wide-eyed, gazes up from the carrier strapped to her mother’s chest. She is the eponymous Sama, al-Kateab’s firstborn, whose birth and early years frame a film that is once a maternal love letter and the story of a revolution. “Sama, I’ve made this film for you,” says al-Kateab in a voiceover. “I need you to understand what we were fighting for.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is this framing that sets “For Sama” apart from so many war documentaries. The majority of the film centers on the confined, harrowing life of al-Kateab’s young family during the \u003ca href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-aleppo-timeline/timeline-the-battle-for-aleppo-idUSKBN1430PJ\"\u003esiege of East Aleppo\u003c/a\u003e by Syrian government forces in 2016. She restricts herself to a limited cast of characters — a team of doctors and activists running a makeshift hospital, and one household from her neighborhood — thus forcing audiences into the cloistered, tense reality of the war’s daily, deadening grind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis intimate approach was al-Kateab’s way of disrupting, and expanding, conventional coverage of her people. “I never felt represented in the news stories about Syria,” said al-Kateab in an interview with The Intercept. “There is no human sense in those reports. They talk about a ‘war’ and people think armies, front lines, tanks — but it’s not like that. This is not two equal sides fighting each other. It’s about people fighting for a better life, for freedom, and armies that want to destroy them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe narrative, character-driven scope of the film by no means precludes the political dimensions of Syria’s conflict. Al-Kateab became invested early on in the civilian uprisings against Syrian President Bashar Assad, and was led to journalism through her involvement in the streets. The film’s earliest scenes show 18-year-old al-Kateab as a young activist, riding the initial wave of euphoric hope that overtakes Aleppo University, where she was studying when the revolution began. She soon begins shooting amateur footage of protests and rallies — first on her phone, then on borrowed cameras, and eventually, her own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe story soon turns from ebullient campus protests to the darkening, and increasingly violent, events of the regime’s backlash. When the rebel contingent is beaten back into East Aleppo, al-Kateab chooses to follow, alongside a small group of young freedom fighters and volunteer doctors. Amidst an escalating campaign of bombings by regime and Russian forces, the group erects a small, makeshift hospital, tending to the wounded under increasingly dire conditions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class='stylized pull-right'data-shortcode-type='pullquote' data-pull='right'\u003e“I don’t believe in sheltering people. These things are happening!\u0026#8221;\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe film is frequently excruciating to watch. Shots of falling mortars cut to scenes of pandemonium in the hospital, where doctors clamber over bloodstained floors, struggling to save the mangled victims that flood in minutes after each blast. Al-Kateab records it all in the frame of her hand-held camera, refusing to flinch from images far more horrific than most Western audiences are accustomed to seeing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe filmmakers’ decision to include these more shocking scenes was a deliberate departure from the sanitizing distance they saw in most mainstream Western journalism. Al-Kateab and Watts have little patience for \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/26/reader-center/yemen-photos-starvation.html\"\u003edebates\u003c/a\u003e about the “appropriateness” of showing the more gruesome aspects of war. “I don’t believe in sheltering people,” said al-Kateab. “These things are happening! Giving people the option of ignoring it is wrong. Children are dying, hospitals are being bombed, and these horrors are going on still, in places like Idlib.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOriginally, al-Kateab set out to capture these scenes in an effort to create a body of evidence she hoped would one day help indict the regime. “I really didn’t feel we’d make it out of Aleppo alive,” she said, “so I thought, the least I can do is leave a record so one day, when Assad is brought to justice, there will be proof of all his crimes.” The resulting archive totaled over 500 hours of footage, ranging from personal, diary-like entries from al-Kateab’s makeshift bedroom and the regime’s \u003ca href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=21256\u0026amp;LangID=E\"\u003ecampaign against civilians and hospitals\u003c/a\u003e to shots of post-shelling rescue operations undertaken beneath a still-rumbling sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of the most striking footage comes in the film’s quietest moments. In one, al-Kateab is cuddling with her newborn when the idyllic scene is disrupted by the sound of nearby shelling. She coos, “There’s lots of airstrikes today, right? But we haven’t been hit, yay!” In another scene, a shot of pink-cheeked Sama pans to the grey-blue body of a dead boy of roughly the same age.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am not just a woman,” al-Kateab said of these intimate scenes, “but this was one of the main ways I experienced the conflict — as a woman, as a mother. I see that baby boy, dead, and of course I’m thinking: That could be Sama. I could be the mother of a dead baby. I could die myself at any moment. I had to show that moment, that feeling.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-center  width-fixed' style='width: 1000px;'\u003e \u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-article-large wp-image-260619\" src=\"https://prod01-cdn05.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/07/02-FOR_SAMA_2-1563992428-1000x667.jpg\" alt=\"02-FOR_SAMA_2-1563992428\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"caption\"\u003eWaad, Hamza, and Sama al-Kateab look at graffiti they painted on a bombed-out building, protesting the forced exile of the civilian population in East Aleppo by the Syrian regime and their Russian and Iranian allies in Dec. 2016.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class='caption source' style=''\u003eStill: Courtesy of PBS Distribution\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe juxtaposition of tenderness and horror throughout the film shows the stakes of the Syrian conflict in their inescapably personal dimensions. This felt essential to al-Kateab and Watts, who both recognize the fatigue felt by many in the West over the issue of Syria. Watts hopes the film will render the “conflict” into more tangible, and human, terms. “People have a very vague attitude about Syria and about the Middle East in general — a sense that the wars are like natural disasters, just sweeping in with no context, no reason,” said Watts. “We want to change that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class='stylized pull-center'data-shortcode-type='pullquote' data-pull='center'\u003e“People have a very vague attitude about Syria and about the Middle East in general — a sense that the wars are like natural disasters, just sweeping in with no context, no reason.\u0026#8221;\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother primary “character” looms just beyond the frame of al-Kateab’s film: the international community, personified in the NGOs and rapporteurs who correspond with the hospital team from beyond Aleppo’s besieged borders. Al-Kateab’s husband, Hamza al-Kateab, is the point of contact for many of these conversations, conducting late-night media interviews and consultations with negotiators on his cellphone. In these interactions, too, the question of efficacy arises. “I spent hours and hours speaking to them — journalists, [World Health Organization], the U.N. — but I don’t know if it made a difference,” Hamza said in an interview with The Intercept. “It didn’t seem like the media reports were making any impact on policymakers. And NGOs seemed to have a very set idea of the ‘right’ way to ‘solve’ a conflict — they didn’t listen much to our wishes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThroughout the conflict, the hospital staff and activists had one primary request, which went unheeded, said Hamza: “Please, if you want to help, just get Assad out of power. After that, the Syrians will take care of Syria.” Instead, he said, the international community “negotiated with the regime. Meanwhile, the regime was slaughtering us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"shortcode\" data-shortcode=\"newsletter\" data-campaign=\"\" data-cta=\"\" data-headline=\"\" data-layout=\"\" data-subhead=\"\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe greatest disappointment of all, say the al-Kateabs, was the \u003ca href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/01/syrian-regime-aleppo-airstrike-aid-convoy-united-nations-report\"\u003eforced evacuation\u003c/a\u003e of their city in 2016, which felt tantamount to defeat. “That pain was worse than anything we experienced the entire war,” said Waad al-Kateab. “Leaving our home, after fighting for it for so long broke our hearts. The U.N. negotiators said they were ‘saving Aleppo’ and yet they played right into the regime’s hands.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe al-Kateabs are now living as refugees in the U.K. They say the \u003ca href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/announcement/for-sama-wins-best-documentary-at-cannes-film-festival/\"\u003ewarm reception\u003c/a\u003e of their film has given them a renewed sense of agency, and even hope. “What we didn’t expect was how many people would ask us, after watching the film, ‘What can we do?’” says Waad, her voice rising with excitement. In response, the al-Kateabs plan to launch awareness and advocacy campaigns about the Assad regime’s \u003ca href=\"https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/mb853q/how-assad-is-using-hospital-bombings-to-win-his-war-in-syria\"\u003ebombing of hospitals\u003c/a\u003e, and to address the plight of Syrian refugees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No one grows up dreaming of being a refugee,” said Hamza, who has been unable to practice as a doctor since leaving his country. Waad added, “We want people to understand that each refugee is an individual with a story. There are reasons these people are refugees — they are fleeing danger, and just want a better life for themselves and their families.” The al-Kateabs continue to call, openly and unequivocally, for the removal of the Assad regime, while nurturing hopes of returning one day. “It might not happen in five years, or 10 years, but we have to believe we will go back,” said Waad. Hamza agreed, “If Assad is allowed to win, if the world refuses to bring him to justice — we are living in a terrible world. We can’t let ourselves believe that’s true.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If I had one message, it would be this,” he added. “Don’t turn your back on Syria.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe post

Donn Yates, 4th FW commander. “Rapid Forge is developing interoperability between 4th and 5th generation aircraft, F-35A and F-15E, and it is also rapidly projecting airpower into the theater using amazing capabilities that we have, and then being able to test and experiment with command and control, in accordance with a flexible mindset.” \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe operation was a collaborative effort between European and U.S. Forces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e“European forces from NATO member nations of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland participated alongside Airmen from U.S. Air Forces in Europe, F-15E Strike Eagles from the 4th FW and F-35A Lightning II from the 421st EFS,” said U.S. Air Force Lt. Col. Maxwell Cover, 421st EFS F-35A pilot. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA key part of Rapid Forge was testing the U.S. Air Force’s ability to operate in an austere environment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e“The U.S. Air Force had been looking to explore its ability to deploy a light and lean force to rapidly stand up a C2 facility anywhere in the world,” Yates said. “This ability prevents U.S. forces from being restricted to a fixed site, while demonstrating we are a credible and capable competitor with any adversary.” \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOperating this way has resulted in the concept of the multifunctional Airman, an Airman who is trained to perform a variety of tasks, not just those within their specific specialty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCover said the 421st EFS had a team of highly trained maintenance personnel at each training location for Rapid Forge. Airmen were cross-trained into all the different F-35A maintenance functional areas. Instead of having seven to nine personnel to operate all the functional areas, two personnel can do all the F-35A servicing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe 4th FW also discovered the concept of the multifunctional Airman to be beneficial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYates said his base built their team towards the multifunctional Airman concept prior deploying to Rapid Forge. He said for his team, the concept involved training Airmen to fuel jets, marshal aircraft, provide security, and lead troops, among other skills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis concept makes expeditionary operations like Rapid Forge possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e“The multifunctional Airman concept is key to operating in an austere environment,” Cover said. “We want to minimize our footprint and change the calculus of where a potential adversary thinks we can operate. To do that, we are going to need to cut down the number of people we need to accomplish the mission and have more of a middleweight fighting force that is highly capable.” \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe continued change in strategy and policy during Rapid Forge was intended to strengthen the deterrence effect of U.S. forces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCover said it is important the U.S. Air Force maintains a strategy that seeks a continuing advantage to deter aggression and assure our NATO allies. Operation Rapid Forge was built upon a strategy that allows us to promote deterrence of possible aggressors by operating in remote locations with a minimal footprint, while still maintaining the strength of our fighting force.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lessons and skills learned from Rapid Forge resulted in a successful operation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e“We came here to accomplish three objectives,” Yates said. “Get the team here in a very quick timeline, establish our air expeditionary wing and achieve training, and get everyone home safe. We have accomplished the first two objectives and are working on the third, so I consider Rapid Forge to be a huge success.”\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_43839\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-43839\" style=\"width: 1402px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\u003e\u003cimg class=\"size-full wp-image-43839\" src=\"https://defence-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/5587013.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1402\" height=\"936\" srcset=\"https://defence-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/5587013.jpg 1402w, https://defence-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/5587013-300x200.jpg 300w, https://defence-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/5587013-768x513.jpg 768w, https://defence-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/5587013-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://defence-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/5587013-750x501.jpg 750w, https://defence-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/5587013-1140x761.jpg 1140w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1402px) 100vw, 1402px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-43839\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"\u003ePhoto by Senior Airman Milton Hamilton\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_43840\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-43840\" style=\"width: 1299px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\u003e\u003cimg class=\"size-full wp-image-43840\" src=\"https://defence-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/5606939.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1299\" height=\"833\" srcset=\"https://defence-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/5606939.jpg 1299w, https://defence-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/5606939-300x192.jpg 300w, https://defence-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/5606939-768x492.jpg 768w, https://defence-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/5606939-1024x657.jpg 1024w, https://defence-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/5606939-750x481.jpg 750w, https://defence-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/5606939-1140x731.jpg 1140w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1299px) 100vw, 1299px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-43840\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"\u003ePhoto by Tech.

For one thing, the Guatemalan high court’s injunctions still stand.

Such an arrangement would make a mockery of the notion that those fleeing persecution in Central America have any recourse.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"k52STh\"\u003eAnd should passing through Guatemala led to rejection in the US, asylum seekers may be tempted to find other, potentially more dangerous routes north. Water routes that bypass Guatemala for countries without asylum arrangements with the US could be established, for instance, with boats traveling from northern Honduras to Belize, or even straight to Mexico.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"fN0Ljs\"\u003eAlthough the deal’s been signed, it may not be implemented \u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"3wYcEg\"\u003eWith US activists and Democratic politicians decrying the deal, lawsuits are expected to follow.

Because the agreement is not officially called a “safe third country” agreement, Morales may have hoped to skirt the letter, if not the spirit, of the court’s injunctions. However, it is not clear whether his administration — and the agreement — will be protected by these sort of semantics. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"j95Fn7\"\u003eAdding to the tumult, Guatemala is in the midst of a presidential election. The next leg of which will take place on August 11, and term-limited Morales will leave office in January. Both candidates running to replace Morales have criticized the deal; one called the agreement “irresponsible” and the other has strongly opposed signing any sort of safe third country agreement for months. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"oX7Gsk\"\u003eWhoever wins will be tasked with defending the deal in Guatemala’s courts, and well as figuring out how to implement it. If they don't scrap it completely, that is.

Iran Doesn’t Want the Bomb?","content":"\u003cp\u003eApparently, the UN Security Council Resolution 2231’s endorsement of the Iran nuclear deal was not enough to give assurance to the P5+1 about the transparency of Iran’s intentions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnti-Iran hawks in Washington along with Israel have tirelessly tried to gather shreds of evidence to claim Iran has a clandestine nuclear program to develop a bomb, and keeps it from the IAEA inspectors. Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claimed Iran has undeclared nuclear activities and even some European officials who are opposed to Trump’s unilateral withdrawal from the deal have claimed that the US’ pullout would get Iran closer to the bomb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe JCPOA’s inability to prevent Iran from developing a bomb was the core argument the Trump administration has used to criticize the nuclear deal. According to frequent reports by the IAEA, Iran has fully complied with the JCPOA and there is no proof that confirms the accusations. The question, nevertheless, is why politicians and pundits in the West, often cynically, are seeking to find reasons to prove that Iran has some cogent incentives to make the bomb, instead of asking question why Iran does not want a nuclear bomb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn spite of Ayatollah Khamenei’s \u003cem\u003efatwa\u003c/em\u003e on the prohibition of nuclear weapons, which is interpreted as an impassable hindrance inside Iran, it should not be a surprise that still many pessimistic observers in the West aren\u0026#8217;t convinced about peaceful nature of Iran\u0026#8217;s nuclear activities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne argument is that Iran has strong \u003cspan style=\"color: #3366ff;\"\u003e\u003ca style=\"color: #3366ff;\" href=\"https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR310.html\"\u003eincentives\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/span\u003eto possess nuclear weapons because by possessing nukes, the country can be assured of having a towering bulwark against its enemies. The US and Israel, two of Iran’s enemies, are nuclear powers and in an outright military war with Iran; they have a decisive upper hand against the Islamic Republic. Therefore, if Iran is a rational actor, it should think about having nuclear weapons as a balancing component in the military realm. In the same way, possessing nukes would heighten the cost of pursuing a regime change policy for the US and its allies, and there will remain no way but peaceful coexistence with an atomic Iran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second argument is related to the balance of conventional military power in the Middle East. Iran’s main rivals all have a much higher military budget than Iran or simultaneously play host to the US military bases. So, it is not imaginable Iran could win a war if they decide to accumulate power and act collectively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_147651\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-147651\" style=\"width: 913px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://ifpnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/k-1.png\"\u003e\u003cimg class=\"size-full wp-image-147651\" src=\"https://ifpnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/k-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"913\" height=\"377\" srcset=\"https://ifpnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/k-1.png 913w, https://ifpnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/k-1-300x124.png 300w, https://ifpnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/k-1-696x287.png 696w, https://ifpnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/k-1-912x377.png 912w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 913px) 100vw, 913px\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-147651\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: #3366ff;\"\u003e\u003ca style=\"color: #3366ff;\" href=\"https://csis-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/publication/181212_Iran_GCC_Balance.Report.pdf\"\u003ehttps://csis-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/publication/181212_Iran_GCC_Balance.Report.pdf\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, Iran under sanctions cannot freely buy the needed military equipment. Having the nuclear weapons could compensate the shortcomings in conventional forces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther arguments rely on some propositions which consider Iran as an aggressive player with malign intentions to intimidate smaller states, annihilate Israel, consolidate power in domestic politics, etc. All those arguments are wrong. There are strong strategic arguments in the opposite direction which explain why Iran doesn\u0026#8217;t want nuclear weapons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo begin with, Israel and the United States are potential enemies for Iran but they are not yet an existential threat. Iran has well-equipped allies with high proficiency in asymmetric warfare across the region. This has given an extraordinary self-confidence to Iranian military commanders who strongly \u003cspan style=\"color: #3366ff;\"\u003e\u003ca style=\"color: #3366ff;\" href=\"https://www.jns.org/irans-irgc-two-pillars-of-deterrence-are-influence-and-missile-capability/\"\u003ebelieve\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/span\u003ethese strategic assets are not less effective than the nuclear deterrence. Historical records show this assessment is not irrelevant. The past wars in Lebanon, Syria, Yemen, Iraq and Afghanistan, to various degrees, were the battlefields of Iran and the US but in all of them, the US and its allies lost or at least failed to win. Israel is not safe and invulnerable to Iran’s ballistic missiles. The conventional deterrence works against Israel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlus, Iran under the most severe inspection ever seen, cannot have a clandestine nuclear program with military dimensions. If so, it would expose itself to bear the huge costs which include international sanctions or even preemptive attacks. In this case, after Iran’s retaliation, falling into an outright war would be inevitable and this is not desirable for Iran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter all, if Iran possesses nuclear weapons, an arms race in the Middle East would be inevitable, and under such circumstances, Iran would not feel safe more than now. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has already \u003cspan style=\"color: #3366ff;\"\u003e\u003ca style=\"color: #3366ff;\" href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/saudi-crown-prince-mohammed-bin-salman-iran-nuclear-bomb-saudi-arabia/\"\u003ewarned\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e, “Without a doubt if Iran developed a nuclear bomb, we will follow suit as soon as possible.” On the Iranian perspective, Saudi Arabia’s apparent stability is misleading and no one can bet on its continuity. Iran cannot be assured who will rule over this fragile country in the future and should be worried about less rational rulers taking power and pursuing an antagonistic policy towards Iran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIran knows world powers plus Israel won’t tolerate Arab countries get close to a nuclear bomb and break up the current monopoly of nuclear weapons in the region. Israel with the US support struck the Iraqi nuclear reactor on 7 June 1981 and did it once again against an alleged Syrian nuclear site in Deir ez-Zor region in 2007. There is no reason that Israel would hesitate to do the same against another Arab country which is decided to join the nuclear club.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne might argue that such a limited war between Iran’s potential rivals is not so bad. Iran can stand aside and let its rivals weaken each other. But in fact, if it happens Iran will get involved in an enigma: On the one hand, Iran ideologically is committed to defend the Islamic world against Israeli ambitions. On the other hand, Tehran, in the way of preventing its neighbours from acquiring nuclear bombs, prefers passing the buck to other powers. If Saudi Arabia is the case and a preemptive attack would be successful, Iran should be worried about the Israeli upper hand; otherwise, if it fails, Iran should be worried again about an increase in the Saudis’ self-esteem and its geopolitical consequences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSaudi Arabia has always been a major \u003cspan style=\"color: #3366ff;\"\u003e\u003ca style=\"color: #3366ff;\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/242073\"\u003esponsor\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/span\u003eof various terrorist groups around the world who extremely have an anti- Shiite fervour. For Iran, it’s unreasonable to rule out the possibility of transferring nuclear materials to those non-state groups. Without precautionary measures including support of non-proliferation regulations, Iran’s vital interests are at risk. For this purpose, Iran should try to undermine the intentions of Arab countries to acquire a nuclear bomb or even its knowhow. Therefore, Iran’s possession of a nuclear bomb is counterproductive, because it will give Arab countries what they want as an excuse to acquire a bomb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, North Korea’s fate is a good instance to display how having nuclear weapons and still being under sanctions could be coincident. That’s true; the nukes provide maximum deterrence in the face of foreign military menace but it doesn’t help a country protect itself from the international sanctions and isolation. Pakistan is another example to indicate that nuclear weapons are not a panacea especially for those who give higher priority to prosperity and development.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor these reasons, with or without the JCPOA, it is very far-fetched that Iran decides to militarize its nuclear program. But there are two exceptions: First, if Iranian leaders come to the conclusion that the country’s survival is threatened by a massive foreign invasion (e.g. by the US or Israel), it may be hard for them to keep distance from the weaponisation of the nuclear program. Second, if Saudi Arabia or anyone else among hostile Arab countries reach or approach nuclear weapons by anyway, Iran will incentivize to do the same way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther than this, Iran prefers to remain a nuke-free country. The non-proliferation regime perhaps cannot reckon on good intentions and ethical inclinations by the states, but can count on their strategic calculations in support of the survival. If the nuclear non-proliferation regime is supposed to have a sense, it should rely on eliminating the incentives to get a bomb not just blockading the way of the stimulated nations. Iran doesn’t have convincing strategic intentions to get the bomb and has a tough religious obstacle as well, while thank to the JCPOA, it is also bound by legal commitments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite all of these, the US still is deeply skeptical about its intentions and has decided to double down on sanctioning Iran and in parallel, has helped some Arab countries especially Saudi Arabia to have an equivalent nuclear infrastructure to be able to compete with Iran. At the same time, there is no sign the US wants to hold Israel accountable for its unlawful nuclear arsenal and its negative role in eroding the non-proliferation regime in the Middle East. It’s time the US reconsiders its own misconceptions on Iran’s strategic thinking and about ways to keep efficient the non- proliferation regulations in the Middle East and around the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe post \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ifpnews.com/exclusive/why-iran-doesnt-want-the-bomb/\"\u003eWhy Iran Doesn’t Want the Bomb?\u003c/a\u003e appeared first on \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ifpnews.com\"\u003eIran Front Page\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://ifpnews.com/exclusive/why-iran-doesnt-want-the-bomb/","published":"2019-07-27T09:39:40Z","guid":"https://ifpnews.com/?p=147649"},{"title":"Saffron: A Miraculous Plant with Anti-Cancer, Anti-Alzheimer’s Properties","content":"\u003cp\u003eCountries such as Iran, Afghanistan, China, India, Spain, Italy and Greece are among major producers of this plant.

This is one of the reasons behind the high price of this product. Saffron is made up of around 150 compounds. However, three are the main ones that produce the special qualities of this plant.

Saturday July 27, 2019.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this interview, the British diplomat has discussed a wide range of issues, from Europe’s efforts to save the Iran nuclear deal by establishing a special mechanism called the Instrument in Support of Trade Exchanges (INSTEX) to the Iranian and British seizures of their oil tankers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe has also expressed London’s support for bilateral talks between Iran and the United States to settle their disputes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the Saudi-led coalition’s aggression against Yemen, Macaire defends the UK’s arms sales to the Arab kingdom, arguing that if the UK stops selling weapons to Saudi Arabia, they would buy it from other countries, and that will make no difference.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat follows is the full text of the interview conducted by Sara Massoumi:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMr. Ambassador, as you know the Iran deal is in a coma. What does the E3 have in its pocket to save one of the most important multilateral agreements in the world?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell I agree with you that it’s one of the most important diplomatic achievements, and one of the most important agreements that’s been signed in recent years and let’s just remind ourselves why it’s so important, and why we got into this agreement. It’s important not only because it’s vital for international security and for the stability of this region, but it’s also important because it demonstrated that Iran could resolve issues with the international community through discussion and agreement rather than confrontation and conflict. That’s why we are extremely keen, in the UK but I know also in other parties of the agreement, to maintain it and to make it work. The early withdrawal of the United States from the agreement was a very significant blow but as you know we on the European side have been trying to do everything we can to ensure that the full agreement is implemented, including economic benefits for Iran that were part of sanctions-lift.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDo you have any new update about INSTEX and whether it is going to be operational in the near future?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eINSTEX is moving ahead consistently, involving intensive work from the shareholder governments and from the institution itself. So the first transactions are now in the process of being negotiated and finalized. We will need to see those first transactions and make sure they are a success before we can then expand to do more work. But I would repeat what I have said before: it is important to understand what INSTEX is. You know INSTEX is not going to solve all the problems of Iran’s economy and that was never the case. And INSTEX is not a way of persuading companies who have decided they can’t do business with Iran but they should do business with Iran. But there are many companies and I talk to them all the time who do want to do business and who we want to encourage to do business but they can’t because of the failures of the banking channels and INSTEX is meant to be a mechanism designed to deal with that problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou know that Iran depends on its oil sale for its economy and one of the initial P5+1 commitment to Iran in JCPOA was the lifting of oil sanctions; so what’s your plan to help Iran sell its oil?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe support Iran’s legitimate oil trade, we regard that as part of Iran’s legitimate economic activity, and we have always said with INSTEX that it needs to start with sectors that are of most immediate importance, the humanitarian sectors, and that’s what INSTEX is doing. But we do think that Iran should be allowed to sell its oil, and this would be said to the United States as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIran’s foreign minister says Europeans lack determination and power to implement JCPOA. What’s your response?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy response is that European parties are implementing JCPOA. The JCPOA required the EU to lift all of its nuclear-related sanctions on Iran which it did and the sanctions remain lifted. It also of course cancelled seven UN Security Council resolutions. It put in place plans for cooperation on Iran’s civil nuclear program. All these still stand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://ifpnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/photo_2019-07-27_15-45-42.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-147659\" src=\"https://ifpnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/photo_2019-07-27_15-45-42.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" srcset=\"https://ifpnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/photo_2019-07-27_15-45-42.jpg 1280w, https://ifpnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/photo_2019-07-27_15-45-42-300x200.jpg 300w, https://ifpnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/photo_2019-07-27_15-45-42-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://ifpnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/photo_2019-07-27_15-45-42-696x464.jpg 696w, https://ifpnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/photo_2019-07-27_15-45-42-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://ifpnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/photo_2019-07-27_15-45-42-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou removed European sanctions but it\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eseems that your companies and banks are following OFAC and US Treasury\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003einstructions rather than their own governments.

So what we’re doing is to say that we pursue our own policy as European countries and as parties to JCPOA and we want to see JCPOA implemented so we’re doing our best to make sure that happens. We also have a source of great concern that Iran has now stopped implementing the nuclear side, some of the elements of the nuclear side of the agreement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf we accept all these excuses, don’t you think it’s a kind of confession to EU’s political and economic inability, and don’t you think that JCPOA experience shows it to other countries that the EU is not a reliable and credible partner regarding multilateral agreements?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, I don’t agree with that at all, what you’ve seen is a remarkable consistency and determination by the EU. A lot of people in this country were predicting that when United States of America walked out, other parties would also walk out on the European side; we remained committed to the JCPOA. I noticed that you’re not including in this Russia and China who are also parties to the agreement and all of those parties are committed and try to make it work. That is not to say we can simply wish away the impact of American withdrawal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe EU’s inability to confront US sanctions made the Iranian people ask if the P4+1 couldn’t afford to implement their own commitments then why did we started negotiations with them. We could have ignored them and choose US as the only negotiator and maybe we would not be in this situation today.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think that in our view, Iran and America do need to sort out their issues, we are not saying they shouldn’t. There is clearly a very very big dimension. What we would like is to deescalate the tensions and to see international negotiations that allow concerns of both sides to be met and I think the JCPOA showed that when the international community deals with Iran with respect and enters into good faith negotiations a lot can be achieved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"td_quote_box td_box_left\"\u003e\n\u003ch2 style=\"text-align: left;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: #000080;\"\u003eEurope believes Iran and America do need to sort out their issues through bilateral talks.

Even new companies are coming talking to us all the time, asking about how they can do business with Iran.
