Very early on, I felt that it really suited the style of music that I was playing, and it just all kind of fit together.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHawtin began planning his DJ schedule around far-flung locations in Japan in order to try the local styles. In 2007 he took a professional sake course with John Gauntner, an English-speaking wine educator in Japan. “I think on day two or day three, I knew I was going to be involved in sake somehow for the rest of my life,” says Hawtin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eA DJ residency in the city of Ibiza—which Hawtin describes as an “international crosspoint”—in 2011 brought an opportunity to meld his music and the drink. Touring through the venue, Hawtin came upon a back space that he felt could serve as a sake bar. The party series, called ENTER, “was about bringing people into a wider experience of what turns me on,” Hawtin says. “To me it didn\u0026#8217;t seem like a harebrained idea to bring sake into that mix. I felt that if I enjoyed sake when I was playing music as a performer, then it wasn\u0026#8217;t too much of a stretch to think that the people listening and dancing to my music would also like that experience.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ES-ROKA-CWfull-AlexC-www.contentldn.com_.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2676130\" srcset=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ES-ROKA-CWfull-AlexC-www.contentldn.com_.jpg 3040w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ES-ROKA-CWfull-AlexC-www.contentldn.com_.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ES-ROKA-CWfull-AlexC-www.contentldn.com_.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ES-ROKA-CWfull-AlexC-www.contentldn.com_.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ES-ROKA-CWfull-AlexC-www.contentldn.com_.jpg?resize=1024,683 1024w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ES-ROKA-CWfull-AlexC-www.contentldn.com_.jpg?resize=281,187 281w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ES-ROKA-CWfull-AlexC-www.contentldn.com_.jpg?resize=754,503 754w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ES-ROKA-CWfull-AlexC-www.contentldn.com_.jpg?resize=100,67 100w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ES-ROKA-CWfull-AlexC-www.contentldn.com_.jpg?resize=60,40 60w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ES-ROKA-CWfull-AlexC-www.contentldn.com_.jpg?resize=154,103 154w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ES-ROKA-CWfull-AlexC-www.contentldn.com_.jpg?resize=591,394 591w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ES-ROKA-CWfull-AlexC-www.contentldn.com_.jpg?resize=392,262 392w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ES-ROKA-CWfull-AlexC-www.contentldn.com_.jpg?resize=252,168 252w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ES-ROKA-CWfull-AlexC-www.contentldn.com_.jpg?resize=697,465 697w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ES-ROKA-CWfull-AlexC-www.contentldn.com_.jpg?resize=234,156 234w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ES-ROKA-CWfull-AlexC-www.contentldn.com_.jpg?resize=500,333 500w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ES-ROKA-CWfull-AlexC-www.contentldn.com_.jpg?resize=578,385 578w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ES-ROKA-CWfull-AlexC-www.contentldn.com_.jpg?resize=600,400 600w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ES-ROKA-CWfull-AlexC-www.contentldn.com_.jpg?resize=90,60 90w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ES-ROKA-CWfull-AlexC-www.contentldn.com_.jpg?resize=184,123 184w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ES-ROKA-CWfull-AlexC-www.contentldn.com_.jpg?resize=115,77 115w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ES-ROKA-CWfull-AlexC-www.contentldn.com_.jpg?resize=738,492 738w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ES-ROKA-CWfull-AlexC-www.contentldn.com_.jpg?resize=776,518 776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3040px) 100vw, 3040px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eThree styles of sake from ENTER.Sake.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"image-credit\"\u003eENTER.Sake\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe bar, \u003ca href=\"http://www.entersake.com/\"\u003eENTER.Sake\u003c/a\u003e, became a platform for experimentation.

Because when it comes to dining trends that actually resonate with guests, from globally renowned brands like Patrón and Woodford Reserve to regional craft distilleries like Minneapolis’s Tattersall Distilling and Seattle’s Copperworks Distilling, being able to offer a signature spirit you can’t find anywhere else has become a restaurant power move. And it’s being embraced by distilleries located even in the most sacred of places: bourbon country.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eA Trend Breaks With Tradition on the Kentucky Bourbon Trail\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt \u003ca href=\"https://www.makersmark.com/\"\u003eMaker’s Mark\u003c/a\u003e in Loretto, Ky., the bourbon maker known for hand-dipping its bottles in wax is also responsible for launching a unique customization trend. The Maker’s Mark Private Select program, which began at the end of 2015 and released its first barrels in the spring of 2016, is one of the most popular options for chefs and restaurants interested in creating their own signature bourbon. The program, which started as a way to give the distillery’s local partners in Kentucky something special, now has a six-month wait for clients across the country to create a barrel of bourbon at the distillery. The bourbon then takes another six months to finish aging before being bottled, registered, and shipped out. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut what actually makes these products and the program notable? “Since each barrel of Maker’s Mark is theoretically identical, it wouldn’t make much sense for us to let customers choose their own that would be exactly the same as the next guy’s,” explains Jane Bowie, director of Private Select and head of innovation at Maker’s Mark. “So we created our barrel program to actually allow customers to have a hand in the creation of their very own whiskey barrel by adding 10 custom wood finishing staves into their barrel of Maker’s Mark bourbon. The finishing staves can be any combination of five stave styles, which each produces its own flavor profile, and that were selected for this program as they highlight existing flavors already found in classic Maker’s Mark.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Signature-Spirits-Makers-Mark-Select-Program-Tasting.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Signature Spirits-Makers Mark-Select Program Tasting\" class=\"wp-image-2676494\" srcset=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Signature-Spirits-Makers-Mark-Select-Program-Tasting.jpg 2880w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Signature-Spirits-Makers-Mark-Select-Program-Tasting.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Signature-Spirits-Makers-Mark-Select-Program-Tasting.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Signature-Spirits-Makers-Mark-Select-Program-Tasting.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Signature-Spirits-Makers-Mark-Select-Program-Tasting.jpg?resize=1024,683 1024w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Signature-Spirits-Makers-Mark-Select-Program-Tasting.jpg?resize=281,187 281w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Signature-Spirits-Makers-Mark-Select-Program-Tasting.jpg?resize=755,503 755w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Signature-Spirits-Makers-Mark-Select-Program-Tasting.jpg?resize=100,67 100w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Signature-Spirits-Makers-Mark-Select-Program-Tasting.jpg?resize=60,40 60w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Signature-Spirits-Makers-Mark-Select-Program-Tasting.jpg?resize=154,103 154w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Signature-Spirits-Makers-Mark-Select-Program-Tasting.jpg?resize=591,394 591w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Signature-Spirits-Makers-Mark-Select-Program-Tasting.jpg?resize=392,261 392w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Signature-Spirits-Makers-Mark-Select-Program-Tasting.jpg?resize=252,168 252w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Signature-Spirits-Makers-Mark-Select-Program-Tasting.jpg?resize=697,465 697w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Signature-Spirits-Makers-Mark-Select-Program-Tasting.jpg?resize=234,156 234w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Signature-Spirits-Makers-Mark-Select-Program-Tasting.jpg?resize=500,333 500w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Signature-Spirits-Makers-Mark-Select-Program-Tasting.jpg?resize=578,385 578w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Signature-Spirits-Makers-Mark-Select-Program-Tasting.jpg?resize=600,400 600w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Signature-Spirits-Makers-Mark-Select-Program-Tasting.jpg?resize=90,60 90w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Signature-Spirits-Makers-Mark-Select-Program-Tasting.jpg?resize=185,123 185w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Signature-Spirits-Makers-Mark-Select-Program-Tasting.jpg?resize=115,77 115w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Signature-Spirits-Makers-Mark-Select-Program-Tasting.jpg?resize=738,492 738w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Signature-Spirits-Makers-Mark-Select-Program-Tasting.jpg?resize=777,518 777w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2880px) 100vw, 2880px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eMaker\u0026#8217;s Mark clients taste different bourbon.

We have a pretty special mocktail recipe ready for your sipping pleasure. . .  But, enough about us! This post is about Team @oldforester And the amazing work they are currently doing at Tales of the Cocktail. Just being candid, never in my wildest dreams did I believe that one day I would have the privilege to work with the likes of @jackiezykan \u0026amp; @apeisthesht from #teamoldfo just 5 short years ago.  It is sometimes hard to believe that it wasn\u0026#39;t all that long ago when I made the personal choice to have my last drink and yet, here I am, on my way down to Tales of the Cocktail and I am doing it to help share our mission of creating a better drinking culture. . .  So why the Team Old-Fo Post? Well, helping to create a better drinking culture and raise awarness for Mental Health Issues in our industry is exactly what they are doing this week at Tales!  Rather than hiring in bartenders for this years event their team decided to jump behind the bar themselves. With the money saved, and other crafty ways to raise awarness, team Old Forester is making a contribution back to @mentalhealthamerica To help riase awarness \u0026amp; support for those in our industry \u0026amp; outside who struggle with Mental Health Issues.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\"\u003eA post shared by \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/themocktailproject/\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e The Mocktail Project\u003c/a\u003e (@themocktailproject) on \u003ctime style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2019-07-18T15:43:31+00:00\"\u003eJul 18, 2019 at 8:43am PDT\u003c/time\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cscript async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe mocktail bar was part of this year’s “Beyond the Bar” series, a content track at the conference focused on bartender wellness, which includes supporting abstention from drinking. Along with Hawkins’s mocktail bar, there were sessions tackling sexual harassment, fitness groups for cycling and running, and even a session on how to reduce the waste your bar creates, making it more eco-friendly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe series launched in 2018, when Caroline Rosen became executive director of the Tales of the Cocktail Foundation, the organization behind the conference. “I think the beautiful thing about Tales is, it is something that was truly created by the spirits and hospitality community. That’s really the benefit. That’s why I believe it’s so important to this day,” says Rosen. “When we had an opportunity to come in and step into this next chapter of Tales, what we did is we sat down with a few stakeholders across the world. I think that one of the bigger things that we continued to hear was, we need to be able to support the full bartender.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eRosen says that now, more than ever, people are considering being a bartender as a lifetime career. As such, it’s important that bartenders feel supported and able to take care of themselves and their community.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“We wanted to create something that was interweaved throughout everything we did at Tales, and that was ‘Beyond the Bar,’ where we looked at everything from tough conversations around sexual harassment to inclusivity, sustainability, health, and wellness,” Rosen explains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\"\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B0JdE2KlYZB/\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

I personally didn\u0026#39;t even know what Tales of the Cocktail was in 2017 when I launched TMP, why would I? I didn\u0026#39;t come from the hospitality industry. In 2018, A dear friend and supporter of our mission mentioned that I should look into going to this amazing event one of these years. One year later @brownforman \u0026amp; @chambordchannel asked if we would host a pop-up bar to help provide an alternative option for this years Tales. The immediate answer was yes! I don\u0026#39;t know where this mission is going to lead me over the next year, five or ten, I just know that we are not going away! The time to start thinking about being mindful \u0026amp; inclusive for those who don\u0026#39;t imbibe, or just pausing to take a break from imbibing is now!  We met some amazing folks last night while at our event: @listenbar \u0026amp; @thep.in were both in attendance, along with many familure faces like @bourbonbarrelfoods \u0026amp; even a couple of old buddies along the @kentuckybourbontrail  We may leave #nola tomorrow but, our very first tales experience will always stick with us. We shared conversarions with sober curious attendees. Those in recovery. Mental Health advocates. Non-drinking bartenders. Bartenders that did imbibe.  We even had one attendee walk up to our bar and ask; \u0026#34;Can you please make myself and four other mocktails for my friends and myself?  They have had way too much to drink and we came to your event especially to get off our feet and take a break from drinking.\u0026#34; It\u0026#39;s that above story why I love this project so much!  It brings everyone togetger snd provides an option for ALL. Whether you do, or you don\u0026#39;t imbibe, we were all sharing the same space, talking, laughing, connecting.  Mocktails really are for everyone!!! Now it is time to go find some coffee \u0026amp; pastries for us.

Adding a spirit to a recipe is just another layer, another addition,” Hawkins told a crowd of roughly 30 people at his mocktail gathering. “The mocktail project is very simple: It’s about creating spaces where cocktails and mocktails can coexist and really helping to create a safer, more-inclusive drinking culture.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnother person who made a similar decision is Mark Goodwin. This past year, he founded \u003ca href=\"https://thep.in/\"\u003eThe Pin Project\u003c/a\u003e, which offers a wearable pin that bartenders and patrons alike can put on when they want to let others know they’ve chosen to not drink that day.\u0026nbsp; Goodwin received a grant from the Tales of the Cocktail Foundation in 2018 to get the project going.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“It was a whole bunch of little conversations with friends and family in the industry that sort of led to the big idea,” Goodwin says. “I was finding myself going to work with every intention to not drink, and then a friend comes into the bar and wants to buy you a shot or your other bartender’s friend comes in, and they just pour a shot for you—it’s this awkward thing, so you just do it.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/20190719_174527.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2676415\" srcset=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/20190719_174527.jpg 4032w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/20190719_174527.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/20190719_174527.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/20190719_174527.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/20190719_174527.jpg?resize=1024,768 1024w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/20190719_174527.jpg?resize=281,212 281w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/20190719_174527.jpg?resize=671,503 671w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/20190719_174527.jpg?resize=100,75 100w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/20190719_174527.jpg?resize=60,45 60w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/20190719_174527.jpg?resize=154,116 154w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/20190719_174527.jpg?resize=1440,1080 1440w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/20190719_174527.jpg?resize=525,394 525w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/20190719_174527.jpg?resize=392,294 392w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/20190719_174527.jpg?resize=224,168 224w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/20190719_174527.jpg?resize=620,465 620w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/20190719_174527.jpg?resize=208,156 208w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/20190719_174527.jpg?resize=444,333 444w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/20190719_174527.jpg?resize=513,385 513w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/20190719_174527.jpg?resize=600,450 600w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/20190719_174527.jpg?resize=90,68 90w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/20190719_174527.jpg?resize=80,60 80w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/20190719_174527.jpg?resize=164,123 164w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/20190719_174527.jpg?resize=115,86 115w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/20190719_174527.jpg?resize=656,492 656w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/20190719_174527.jpg?resize=691,518 691w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/20190719_174527.jpg?resize=1376,1032 1376w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/20190719_174527.jpg?resize=1044,783 1044w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/20190719_174527.jpg?resize=632,474 632w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/20190719_174527.jpg?resize=536,402 536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 4032px) 100vw, 4032px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eThe Pin Project\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"image-credit\"\u003eEmily Price/Fortune\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhat’s now a pin started out as a tattoo of sorts that Goodwin would draw on his arm with a Sharpie at the beginning of his shift as a visual reminder of the promise he had made to himself. The pin serves as not only a visual reminder to the person wearing it, but also a nonverbal sign to those around them that they’ve chosen to not drink for the evening, hopefully preventing situations like those accidental, sometimes peer-pressured shots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eRather than give the pins away, Goodwin charges $15 for them as a way to give the pin value, and have those who wear it make a conscious investment in its purchase. The proceeds from the pin go to connecting mental health and substance abuse counselors with people in the service industry who need them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe idea isn’t for the pin to be worn just by permanently sober people—although it certainly can be—it’s also meant for people who might just want to take a night off from drinking, or even those who are doing something as simple as picking their friend up from the airport and need to stay sober to do that safely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s just been so incredible to see this tiny, little small baby of an idea resonate with so many people,” Goodwin says.

The Mocktail Project’s installation was sponsored by Brown-Forman, the parent company of Woodford Reserve and Jack Daniel’s.\u0026nbsp;Last year, William Grant \u0026amp; Sons—the group encompassing brands such as Hendrick’s, Glenfiddich, and Sailor Jerry—was one of the first major brands to enter the space: It made the bold move to throw an opening party for Tales of the Cocktail 2018 with no alcohol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“The reason we did the party is we wanted to prove that we can come together as an industry and have fun, and we don’t have to drink to that,” says Charlotte Voisey, the head of ambassadors for William Grant \u0026amp; Sons, who originally proposed throwing the spirit-free bash. “We’re starting to talk a bit more about these issues right now and doing away with the peer pressure that has existed a long time in this industry to drink. You don’t have to be a night owl and drink every night. All those clichés that used to surround the idea of what a bartender is—it doesn’t have to be that way.”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe theme of the party was dubbed “Spirit Free and Dreaming.” Voisey says the brand decided to go to an extreme to prove that point. “There are a lot of people who don’t drink in this industry,” Voisey says. “We talk about diversity and inclusion; they’ve been excluded this whole time from all these events because the focus was always on consumption rather than conversation.” Brands like Hendrick’s and Glenfiddich were still at the party in their full glory—just the alcohol wasn’t. A dozen bars were set up representing each of William Grant \u0026amp; Sons’ labels, along with elaborate spirit-free cocktails inspired by each one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Julia-Momose-menu-2018.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2676639\" srcset=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Julia-Momose-menu-2018.jpg 3000w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Julia-Momose-menu-2018.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Julia-Momose-menu-2018.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Julia-Momose-menu-2018.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Julia-Momose-menu-2018.jpg?resize=1024,683 1024w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Julia-Momose-menu-2018.jpg?resize=281,187 281w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Julia-Momose-menu-2018.jpg?resize=755,503 755w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Julia-Momose-menu-2018.jpg?resize=100,67 100w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Julia-Momose-menu-2018.jpg?resize=60,40 60w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Julia-Momose-menu-2018.jpg?resize=154,103 154w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Julia-Momose-menu-2018.jpg?resize=591,394 591w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Julia-Momose-menu-2018.jpg?resize=392,261 392w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Julia-Momose-menu-2018.jpg?resize=252,168 252w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Julia-Momose-menu-2018.jpg?resize=697,465 697w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Julia-Momose-menu-2018.jpg?resize=234,156 234w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Julia-Momose-menu-2018.jpg?resize=500,333 500w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Julia-Momose-menu-2018.jpg?resize=578,385 578w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Julia-Momose-menu-2018.jpg?resize=600,400 600w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Julia-Momose-menu-2018.jpg?resize=90,60 90w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Julia-Momose-menu-2018.jpg?resize=185,123 185w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Julia-Momose-menu-2018.jpg?resize=115,77 115w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Julia-Momose-menu-2018.jpg?resize=738,492 738w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Julia-Momose-menu-2018.jpg?resize=777,518 777w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3000px) 100vw, 3000px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eA mocktail menu by Chicago bartender Julia Momose.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Voisey says the initial reaction from the industry was that of surprise, in the end, people came and had a great time. “People would say, ‘Wow, I can’t believe that’ or ‘That’s great,’ but very few people asked why, because everybody knew why, and that’s the whole point,” Voisey says. “Everybody knew the message we were trying to make and that it was an important message.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis year, alcohol returned to the launch party, which kicks off the first night of Tales of the Cocktail.

His solution? Whipped egg yolks. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe creative improvisation caught on and became a revered local drink in its own right, eventually leading Van Giang to open his own shop, \u003ca href=\"http://www.giangcafehanoi.com/\"\u003eGiảng Cafe\u003c/a\u003e, which has since become a national attraction in the city.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTraditional \u003cem\u003ecà phê trúng\u003c/em\u003e (Vietnamese egg coffee) is a Northern Vietnamese specialty made with robusta beans, whisked eggs, sugar, and condensed milk. As is the case with culturally defining culinary endeavors, it was only a matter of time until the drink made its way across oceans and continents, tickling palates and developing devotees among folks living outside Vietnam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eA note should be made about the most elemental form of Vietnamese coffee, which predates and is the basis of Van Giang’s glorious invention. The traditional java is of the dark roast kind—incredibly strong and bitter—with flavors counterbalanced by sweetened condensed milk. Served hot or cold, coffee in Vietnam was first introduced around 1857 during French colonization. Limited refrigeration capabilities, the use of cows solely as work animals, and scarcity of fresh milk led to the widespread use of condensed milk for storing dairy long term. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_4530.jpg?w=683\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2676013\" srcset=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_4530.jpg 2000w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_4530.jpg?resize=100,150 100w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_4530.jpg?resize=200,300 200w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_4530.jpg?resize=768,1152 768w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_4530.jpg?resize=683,1024 683w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_4530.jpg?resize=141,212 141w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_4530.jpg?resize=335,503 335w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_4530.jpg?resize=67,100 67w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_4530.jpg?resize=40,60 40w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_4530.jpg?resize=103,154 103w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_4530.jpg?resize=720,1080 720w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_4530.jpg?resize=263,394 263w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_4530.jpg?resize=392,588 392w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_4530.jpg?resize=112,168 112w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_4530.jpg?resize=310,465 310w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_4530.jpg?resize=104,156 104w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_4530.jpg?resize=222,333 222w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_4530.jpg?resize=257,385 257w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_4530.jpg?resize=533,800 533w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_4530.jpg?resize=80,120 80w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_4530.jpg?resize=82,123 82w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_4530.jpg?resize=115,173 115w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_4530.jpg?resize=328,492 328w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_4530.jpg?resize=345,518 345w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eAt Hanoi Soup Shop, which recently opened in Manhattan’s East Village, patrons get to drink the famous egg coffee concoction that’s popular in Vietnam. \u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"image-credit\"\u003eBriana Balducci\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eToday, the Southeast Asian country is the second largest producer of coffee in the world (Brazil is No. 1) and the first when only taking into account the robusta variety (from the \u003cem\u003eCoffea canephora \u003c/em\u003eplant, boasting high bitterness and low acidity levels). Currently, most Vietnamese coffee in North America is actually made with \u003ca href=\"http://www.cafedumonde.com/\"\u003eCafé du Monde\u003c/a\u003e’s coffee and chicory beans—produced in New Orleans—a departure from the robusta beans still used in Hanoi and its surrounding areas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet, while standard Vietnamese coffee and cuisine can be found throughout Western countries relatively easily, egg coffee is not prevalent. In New York City, for example, aficionados virtually have a single option: Hanoi Soup Shop on St. Marks Place in Manhattan’s East Village neighborhood. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“It absolutely could be a dessert,” says Sara Leveen, co-owner of Hanoi Soup Shop and Hanoi House, of \u003cem\u003ecà phê trúng,\u003c/em\u003e whose flavor many describe as tiramisu-like. “It is what you make of it: What did you have before? What are you craving? The custard itself tastes like it could very easily be a dessert,” Leveen explains. “It’s sweet, but then you mix in all that dark black coffee, and it is strong.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFollowing a trip around the world that included stops in Vietnam, where they developed a taste for the local culinary offerings, Leveen and her now-fiancé Ben Lowell opened \u003ca href=\"https://www.hanoihousenyc.com/\"\u003eHanoi House\u003c/a\u003e, a Vietnamese eatery, back in 2017. “There were just some dishes from Hanoi that we would find bastardized versions of in places in Chinatown,” she recalls. That is likely the result of the history of migration to the United States: As most Vietnamese immigrants hail from the southern part of Vietnam, they brought along regional specialties. Although now widespread in Vietnam, \u003cem\u003ecà phê trúng\u003c/em\u003e is undoubtedly a northern creation. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOnly serving dinner initially, the business partners eventually added brunch service once a week, offering a menu that included the egg concoction. “It was three egg yolks for one order of coffee, whipped to order, with a drizzle of honey and condensed milk,” Leveen says. Needing to heat the milk with hot coffee as the eggs were whisked (so that, once they hit the coffee, they’d stay warm but not get shocked), each drink would take four minutes to prepare. “It was a pain in the ass, but people loved it,” she says. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_4566.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2676014\" srcset=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_4566.jpg 3000w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_4566.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_4566.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_4566.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_4566.jpg?resize=1024,683 1024w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_4566.jpg?resize=281,187 281w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_4566.jpg?resize=755,503 755w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_4566.jpg?resize=100,67 100w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_4566.jpg?resize=60,40 60w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_4566.jpg?resize=154,103 154w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_4566.jpg?resize=591,394 591w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_4566.jpg?resize=392,261 392w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_4566.jpg?resize=252,168 252w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_4566.jpg?resize=697,465 697w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_4566.jpg?resize=234,156 234w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_4566.jpg?resize=500,333 500w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_4566.jpg?resize=578,385 578w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_4566.jpg?resize=600,400 600w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_4566.jpg?resize=90,60 90w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_4566.jpg?resize=185,123 185w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_4566.jpg?resize=115,77 115w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_4566.jpg?resize=738,492 738w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_4566.jpg?resize=777,518 777w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3000px) 100vw, 3000px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eManhattan’s Hanoi House didn’t offer takeout, so the owners decided to open Hanoi Soup Shop (reminiscent of Vietnamese coffee shops, with counter seats) for the lunch crowd.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"image-credit\"\u003eBriana Balducci\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis past April, the couple opened an all-day Vietnamese café two doors down from their first shop. More of a takeout effort, \u003ca href=\"https://hanoisoupshop.com/\"\u003eHanoi Soup Shop\u003c/a\u003e decidedly demanded the presence of \u003cem\u003ecà phê trúng\u003c/em\u003e on the menu: But could a quick takeout business serve a coffee that requires almost five minutes to be made? “We hacked it,” Leveen says. Instead of whisking the eggs directly into the drink, the staff now cooks a custard base and aerates it. Making large batches, they cook it, cool it, and then pour it into the coffee, which can be served either hot or cold. According to Leveen, “out of 50 people that walk through the door every day, six to eight of them are coming just for coffee.” Hanoi Soup Shop’s Vietnamese egg coffee costs $8, about double the amount for the café’s regular hot Vietnamese coffee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFans will also find faithful renditions of the treat up in Canada.

(Like Hanoi Soup Shop, the egg custard at Coffee Dak Lak is prepared in advance.) The beans used here are imported directly from Vietnam and are a mixture of robusta and arabica beans. “An ideal ratio to make a good tasting coffee,” says Khanh Pham, the general manager at the Canadian coffee shop. In terms of popularity, Pham estimates that about 80% of customers who stop in daily do so singularly for a cup of coffee. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eCà phê trúng\u003c/em\u003e is not the only Hanoi drink that claims a spot on Western culinary bucket lists: Coconut coffee is a popular order at both Hanoi House and Coffee Dak Lak as well. In Toronto, Pham’s staff uses coconut cream and condensed milk, pours it onto a Vietnamese coffee espresso, and tops it off with roasted coconut crumbs. In New York City, the Hanoi House team prepares a frozen coconut coffee made with coconut gelato, coconut milk, and coffee. As Leveen mentions, the Vietnamese way of preparing the drink is slightly different (“badass,” in her own terms): sweetened coconut milk and ice are blended to form a sort of frappé that then gets drenched in coffee, giving rise to a liquid dessert-like brew that appeals to masses worldwide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eMore must-read stories from \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—What you should know about \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/07/28/modena-italy-food/\"\u003eItaly’s new food capital\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—\u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/2019/06/30/queer-eye-antoni-porowski-netflix/\"\u003eQueer Eye\u0026#8217;s Antoni Porowski\u003c/a\u003e on \u003ca href=\"http://content.fortune.com/fortune500/netflix-379/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eNetflix\u003c/a\u003e, social media, and opening a restaurant\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—Why \u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/longform/charleston-restaurants-food-scene/\"\u003eCharleston’s food scene\u003c/a\u003e is stronger than ever right now\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—Why this \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/longform/israeli-food-sandwich-sabich\"\u003eclassic Israeli sandwich\u003c/a\u003e should be on your foodie to-do list\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—Listen to our new audio briefing, \u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/radio/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e 500 Daily\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://flipboard.com/@fortune\"\u003eFollow \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e on Flipboard\u003c/a\u003e to stay up-to-date on the latest news and analysis\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://fortune.com/2019/08/03/what-is-vietnamese-egg-coffee/","published":"2019-08-03T12:00:22Z","guid":"https://fortune.com/?p=2676003"},{"title":"Apple Marked the End of an Era This Week.

A survey of Boston Summer Youth Employment Program (SYEP) participants found that \u003ca href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149718918300636\"\u003eone in five teens\u003c/a\u003e reported contributing directly to household expenses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe benefits extend beyond providing early work experience for those who might struggle to gain it elsewhere: Participation in jobs programs can even improve academic performance. A 2014 study of the New York City SYEP program showed encouraging results on some academic outcomes, including an increase in \u003ca href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/pam.21780\"\u003eschool attendance\u003c/a\u003e. And a follow-up study of the same program also showed a greater likelihood of \u003ca href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w21470\"\u003epassing statewide exams\u003c/a\u003e needed to graduate from high school.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThese summer jobs programs can also lead to reductions in crime. For example, \u003ca href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/346/6214/1219.full\"\u003eone study\u003c/a\u003e found that participating in Chicago’s One Summer Plus program decreased violent crime for participating youth by 43% over a 16-month period relative to a control group of youth who had applied to the program, but were unable to gain a spot. Similarly, \u003ca href=\"https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/131/1/423/2461127?redirectedFrom=fulltext\"\u003eanother report\u003c/a\u003e found that participating in the New York City SYEP reduced the probability of incarceration and mortality from homicides, suicides, and accidents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eDespite these encouraging results, little has been done to expand funding for summer jobs programs at the federal level. In the early 1990s, federal funding was terminated on the assumption that in a full employment economy, employers would hire youth without any government subsidy. Yet, the fact that youth unemployment rates are twice that of adults—and even higher for non-white youth—suggests otherwise.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, Congresswoman Robin Kelly and Senators Richard Durbin and Tammy Duckworth are looking to restore funding for youth employment. They \u003ca href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/984\"\u003erecently introduced a bill\u003c/a\u003e that would establish a five-year, $1.5 billion competitive grant program to support summer and year-round employment opportunities for youth ages 14 to 24.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIncreasing funding for summer youth employment programs is ripe for bipartisan support.

Much of the funding will go toward keeping out an unwanted intruder from the West Indies known as the lantana camara weed that’s threatening the structure. The walls are some 11 meters (36 feet) in height.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe project will involve restoration of the stone walls, monitoring of their movement and combating the invasive weed, said Lovemore Nyandima, a regional director for the Great Zimbabwe Museum.

It makes a lot of sense really as mobile devices are just tiny but very capable computers, and as long as the controls make sense on a touchscreen, why not bring your game to an additional platform with a few billion potential customers? Sometimes though, even knowing full well that a game originated on a major gaming console or PC, I just can\u0026#8217;t help but be impressed with the quality of game I\u0026#8217;m playing on my little iPhone. That\u0026#8217;s exactly the case with \u003cem\u003eBattle Chasers: Nightwar\u003c/em\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://toucharcade.com/link/http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1455088996?mt=8\"\u003e(\u0026#36;9.99)\u003c/a\u003e, a game originally developed for consoles and PC by Airship Syndicate a couple of years ago but brought to mobile this week thanks to HandyGames.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/626x0w.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"462\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-256470\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/626x0w.jpg 1000w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/626x0w-300x139.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/626x0w-768x355.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eBattle Chasers: Nightwar\u003c/em\u003e is a turn-based RPG based on the Battle Chasers comic book series which ran during the turn of the millennium. It features a cast of characters from the comic that are immediately likable: Gully, a young girl who wields her father\u0026#8217;s magical gauntlets; Garrison, a swordsman and friend of Gully\u0026#8217;s father who has sworn to protect her; Knolan, an aging mage with a sharp tongue; Calibretto, a war golem with a heart of gold; and Red Monika, a rogue who you\u0026#8217;re not quite sure about upon first meeting her. The game opens with an animated, fully-voiced introduction which shows the group\u0026#8217;s airship getting shot down, and the game begins with you taking control of Gully as she awakens on an island below. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026#8217;m not a big RPG person but every once in a while one really grabs me, and \u003cem\u003eBattle Chasers: Nightwar\u003c/em\u003e has done exactly that since the moment I fired it up. Once you get past the initial exposition and introductory stuff, the game\u0026#8217;s core loop becomes clear, and it\u0026#8217;s a lot of fun. The gameplay is split up into two main types. One where you\u0026#8217;re exploring a huge overworld, tapping to move down set paths and generally covering a ton of ground. Then there are smaller dungeons you\u0026#8217;ll play through where you have direct control over your characters via a virtual analog stick. In both styles you\u0026#8217;ll encounter enemies in turn-based battle, find NPCs to talk to, come across all sorts of loot and treasure, and basically advance the story by completing quests. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"clear:both;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"video-responsive\"\u003e\n\t\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ckI5Iz5q53M\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eBattle Chasers: Nightwar\u0026#8217;s\u003c/em\u003e main criticism on other platforms was that the difficulty was imbalanced which required the player to grind at certain points to beef themselves up enough for the next leg of the journey. The happy accident about being on mobile is that the grinding portions are actually a perfect fit, as this is a fun game to hop into for a few minutes and knock out a couple of battles or sit down with for hours at a time. You can save and quit at any time, and there\u0026#8217;s multiple graphical settings to save on battery if you need, which makes \u003cem\u003eBattle Chasers: Nightwar\u003c/em\u003e a really great experience on mobile.

In a few extremely rare cases, cancerous cells have evolved the ability to move from host to host, essentially becoming an immortalized parasite.

Cancer? Parasite? Disease? To an extent, its formal name covers things nicely: canine transmissible venereal tumor, or CTV. As the \"venereal\" implies, dogs transmit CTV during sex. It results in tumor growth, often on the external genitalia. But, unlike the cancer \u003ca href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2015/12/new-type-of-contagious-cancer-spreading-among-tasmanian-devils/\"\u003espreading among Tasmanian devils\u003c/a\u003e, the immune system quickly suppresses CTV, and the tumors quickly regress.

After all, Square paid only $90 million in stock for Caviar when it acquired the company back in 2014. However, DoorDash is VC cash-rich. The business, still privately-owned, has raised an astronomical sum of venture capital. This year alone it\u0026#8217;s raised $1 billion, including a Series G funding of $600 million that valued it at $12.6 billion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"embed breakout\"\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"\u003e\n\u003cp lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThis is fucking insane. \u003ca href=\"https://t.co/tOy4gSM3qo\"\u003epic.twitter.com/tOy4gSM3qo\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026mdash; Kate Clark (@KateClarkTweets) \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/KateClarkTweets/status/1157039891466731521?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"\u003eAugust 1, 2019\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cscript async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen a company raises that many huge rounds so close together, you can only assume it\u0026#8217;s burning through a lot of cash.

To begin with, there is \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18411138/google-voice-how-to-use-grandcentral-secondary-phone-number-voicemail-texts-sms\"\u003eGoogle Voice\u003c/a\u003e, probably the best-known such service, which gives you a phone number that is associated your Google account. Voice has been available from Google since 2009 (when the original service, GrandCentral, was acquired), and is still free; however, it hasn’t undergone a whole lot of updating since. Other services, such as Hushed and Burner, also provide separate phone numbers for reasonably low fees; they market themselves as alternatives for users who want temporary, easily deleted numbers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"SoCiSy\"\u003eOpenPhone, on the other hand, is pushing itself as a resource for independent workers or small businesses that want to separate their business and personal calls and texts. It distinguishes itself from Google Voice by touting its customer support, the availability of toll-free numbers, and the ability to have more than one number per phone. It is currently only available in the US and Canada.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"rrt27m\"\u003e\u003cdiv data-anthem-component=\"gallery:8719600\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"kaSZE9\"\u003eHow to register for OpenPhone\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"a8Idsr\"\u003eYou can sign up either on the web or on your phone (if you choose to download the \u003ca href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.openphone\"\u003eAndroid\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/openphone-business-phone-line/id1241817309\"\u003eiOS\u003c/a\u003e app first); I signed up on the web. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"lofQg8\"\u003eTo begin with, you get to choose a phone number. You can select any US or Canada area code; be aware that some codes will offer more choices than others. You can also, if you want, choose a toll-free number, or even try to find a number with a word embedded in it — I was able to find a number that had “0GYM” as its last four characters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"8Gl4lu\"\u003eOnce you’ve chosen a phone number, you create an account, and verify it with your phone’s carrier number (you can’t use another VoIP number, such as Google Voice). You then have the option of providing your company name, number of employees and which industry you’re in. (If you’re just registering as an individual, you can skip this step.) \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"cO5J30\"\u003eOpenPhone offers a seven-day free trial, although you do have to provide your credit card data in order to sign up. After the trial, OpenPhone costs $10 per month for an Individual account. A Team account, which costs $15 a month, adds a dedicated account manager and priority support.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"cIG7RJ\"\u003eAnd then, if you haven’t already, you download the app to your phone, and you’re ready to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"RX71Lm\"\u003eA nicely simple UI\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"TzrlEm\"\u003eThe interface is almost Spartan in its simplicity. The home page lists your recently-used contacts. If the person you want to contact isn’t there, you can swipe left to tap in the phone number, or swipe right for the features list, which includes access to your contact list.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"4Wab20\"\u003eOpenPhone has its own contact list, which you can sync with your phone’s. Once you’ve chosen the person you want to contact, you simply use the field at the bottom of the screen to send a text or the phone icon on the upper right to make a call. Records of phone calls and text messages for each contact are all on the same screen, making it simple to see all your previous conversations. You can also (via a menu) copy the number, block it or delete the conversation. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"k4WdSB\"\u003e\u003cdiv data-anthem-component=\"gallery:8719616\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"MBr7rL\"\u003eThe apps has several nice options. One is the ability to set business hours; calls that come outside of your set hours will go straight to voicemail, and  you can record a separate voicemail for those hours (such as “Our office is currently closed, but leave a message, and someone will call you back in the morning”). You can also forward calls to another number if, for example, you are going on vacation and want someone else to get the calls. A “Do Not Disturb” feature lets you temporarily mute calls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"wTJbbe\"\u003eYou can have as many as five phone numbers associated with your carrier number (Google Voice only allows one).  It’s very easy to request another number straight from the features menu, but be aware that you’ll pay $9.99 for each additional number.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"LUDMtN\"\u003eI tried out OpenPhone and found that service worked perfectly well. In fact, the quality of the voice calls, using an internet connection, was better on my end than my usual Google Voice calls. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"ciwnK5\"\u003eCan still be glitchy\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"TEG6vy\"\u003eAnyone trying out this service should be aware that it is still very new, and this shows. To begin with, the feature set is still a bit tentative. One example: OpenPhone boasts that it lets you you can link your OpenPhone number to your phone carrier rather than Wi-Fi or your data plan. However, there are still so many restrictions attached to this method that it’s not really viable: you can’t make outgoing calls, you can’t attach more than one number to your carrier number, and it’s only available for iOS phones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"6UWGgW\"\u003eIn addition, there were a few coding glitches that popped up here and there. After my couple of calls, the names of the two contacts I had recently contacted were garbled together on the main page. Once I closed and opened the app, that resolved itself; still, something like that is a sign of an app still in development. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"W6zZWr\"\u003eThere are other cloud-based business solutions out there with more features, but they tend to charge $30 / month per user or more. For freelancers and startups, OpenPhone could be a good way to provide yourself with a separate business line. Just be aware that, since it’s a startup, there could be an occasional hiccup along the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Pg2XNn\"\u003e\u003csmall\u003e\u003cem\u003eVox Media has affiliate partnerships.

If the Galaxy S line is the company’s mainstream device, the Note is for true Samsung aficionados, often offering cutting edge features and bizarre experiments before any of its other hardware.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"6RrVwK\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTwo (or four) Notes\u003c/strong\u003e: Samsung is rumored to have \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/12/18662730/samsung-galaxy-note-10-photos-renders-features-screen-headphone-jack\"\u003etwo models\u003c/a\u003e of Note 10 this year: a smaller 6.3-inch Note 10, and a souped-up Note 10 Plus with a massive 6.8-inch display. For comparison, the S10 has a 6.1-inch screen, and the S10 Plus offers a 6.4-inch panel, meaning that standard Note 10 will be smaller than both the larger S10 Plus and last year’s Note 9, which also had a 6.4-inch screen. Both Notes will feature Samsung’s Infinity-O displays, too, with razor-thin top bezels achieved by putting a single hole-punch camera directly in the middle of the top of the display. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"CWGZE3\"\u003eThe difference between the two Note 10s isn’t just screen size, though.

There’s Lockheed Martin’s Skunkworks division, which produced the U-2 spy plane and the SR-71 Blackbird.

In 2015, Facebook brought in former DARPA and Google technologist Regina Dugan to run the division, but she ended up leaving after only 18 months on the job. Facebook ultimately Facebook disbanded the hardware group in a year later in December 2018, and shifted its personnel and projects to other parts of the company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"I08Ejb\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eCNBC\u003c/em\u003e’s report takes a look at the rise and fall of Building 8, the challenges that it brought to Facebook, and why the company split up, revealing some interesting details about it along the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-float-right\"\u003e\u003caside id=\"Ttmno6\"\u003e\u003cq\u003eFacebook reportedly mused TV and wall-sized video chat devices\u003c/q\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"9Whxjr\"\u003eFacebook initially became interested in a home assistant-type device shortly after Amazon launched its Echo speakers, and Dugan was brought onboard to help the company realize some of its hardware ideas. One of the projects a predecessor to the Portal called “Little Foot”, an iPad that moved towards a person in a room. As Facebook increasingly looked towards video, the Building 8 team began developing it as a video chat device. \u003cem\u003eCNBC\u003c/em\u003e says that they experimented with a variety of sizes, including ones the size of a large television, and that “the ideal experience would be a wall-to-ceiling product.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"aDLw8C\"\u003eThe report notes that Building 8’s secretive nature caused some resentment between it and other divisions within the company. It had an enormous budget, and when select Facebook staff members were invited to visit, to look at early prototypes, like the Portal, its brain-reading devices, and an AR project called Project Sequoia (which resembled “the hologram-like computers in ‘Iron Man’ movies), they were assigned an escort. Those visitors were invited to Building 8 with a slab of metal — which was machined on-site into a bottle opener when they arrived.

That seems to be the reason for Dugan’s exit from the company, and when Facebook placed Andrew “Boz” Bosworth in charge of its hardware efforts, she left months later. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"nNZOon\"\u003eThe problems didn’t stop there. Former employees told \u003cem\u003eCNBC\u003c/em\u003e that “when it came to technological decisions, Bosworth offered little direction.” On top of that, Facebook was rocked by a \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/10/17165130/facebook-cambridge-analytica-scandal\"\u003eprivacy scandal in March 2018\u003c/a\u003e, which prompted him to delay the Portal’s release, and “rethink the design.” The device ultimately \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/10/8/17928554/facebook-portal-announced-camera-price-video-chat\"\u003eended up being announced last October\u003c/a\u003e, and was released in November.

Every now and again, a book or author will come along that really breaks away from the conversation and ignores those tropes and conventions. One recent example is Singaporean author JY Yang, who published the final installment of their genre-blending \u003cem\u003eTensorate\u003c/em\u003e series last month. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"8iBDrU\"\u003eThe series is made up of four short novellas: \u003ca href=\"https://us.macmillan.com/theredthreadsoffortune/jyyang/9780765395399/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Red Threads of Fortune\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e, \u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://us.macmillan.com/theblacktidesofheaven/jyyang/9780765395412/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Black Tides of Heaven\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e, \u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://us.macmillan.com/thedescentofmonsters/jyyang/9781250165855/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Descent of Monsters\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e,\u003c/em\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://us.macmillan.com/theascenttogodhood/jyyang/9781250165886/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Ascent to Godhood\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e. \u003c/em\u003eIt’s set in a world where an oppressive monarchy called the Protectorate is facing an entrenched revolution from a rebel group called the Machinists. The Protectorate holds onto power by controlling who can utilize a magical system known as Slackcraft, and it utterly controls the lives of its subjects. However, it’s grown decadent and corrupt over the decades, and under the reign of Lady Sanao Hekate, The Protector, it’s brutally cracked down on its citizens. That’s given rise to the Machinists, who work to topple the government, all while bringing power to the people with the help of machines that take the place of Slackcraft and those who control it. \u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LxmYMK04T55yAjIh4N8E2_V8Oa8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18483282/TensorateSeries4.jpg\"\u003e\n      \u003ccite\u003eImage: Tor.com\u003c/cite\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"zQmPbZ\"\u003eYang plays out their story through an incredible blend of science fiction and fantasy. There’s magic, dinosaurs, weird scientific experiments, spycraft, revolutionaries, mad scientists, and more, all packed into the four books. \u003cem\u003eThe Red Threads of Fortune\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eThe Black Tides of Heaven\u003c/em\u003e each tell the story of Sanao Hekate’s children: Mokoya, who has prophetic visions, and Akeha, who can innately understand what motivates people into action. Akeha leaves the Grand Monastery to join the Machinists, while Mokoya sets off on her own after the death of her daughter, hunting Naga, giant monsters that roam the world. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"3A1X44\"\u003eIn \u003cem\u003eThe Descent of Monsters\u003c/em\u003e, we follow Chuwan Sariman, a Tensorate investigator who is trying to piece together what happened at an experimental science facility, and who ultimately finds a horrifying conspiracy that shows just how far the Protectorate will go to hold onto its power. In the latest and final installment, \u003cem\u003eThe Ascent of Goodhood\u003c/em\u003e, we learn how the Protectorate came to be, and how Sanao Hekate became its leader. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-float-right\"\u003e\u003caside id=\"othLSt\"\u003e\u003cq\u003ethe arc of Yang’s story feels is eerily relevant in 2019\u003c/q\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"UdG8QL\"\u003eThe arc of Yang’s story feels eerily relevant in 2019. It’s a story about the balance of power in society, and how corruption sets in quickly, no matter what one’s original intentions are. We see glimpses of how that happens: the experimental and immoral programs that the Protectorate sets up to try and hold onto power, and the lengths that the Machinists will go to take on their enemies. Along the way, Yang shows how those conflicts impact the people involved, and how they rationalize what they’re fighting for. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"LfKmrJ\"\u003eThe series hails from \u003ca href=\"http://Tor.com\"\u003eTor.com\u003c/a\u003e, an imprint of Tor Books that’s been \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/8/17819652/tor-com-sci-fi-fiction-anthology-stories-publishing\"\u003eexperimenting with digital-first, and shorter novellas and novelettes\u003c/a\u003e for the last decade. The same publisher released \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/13/17928580/martha-wells-murderbot-exit-protocol-artificial-condition-exit-strategy-science-fiction-book-review\"\u003eMartha Wells’ fantastic \u003cem\u003eMurderbot\u003c/em\u003e series\u003c/a\u003e, which demonstrated that long-form storytelling doesn’t necessarily need to be in the structure of your standard novel. Wells played out Murderbot’s story in four installments, each with their own arc and characters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-float-left\"\u003e\u003caside id=\"8e5JFN\"\u003e\u003cq\u003eYang takes an unconventional approach to their story \u003c/q\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"7lC8SV\"\u003eYang takes that a step further in their series: not only are they sketching out a massive world and story between the four installments, they’re playing with the form that those stories take. \u003cem\u003eThe Red Threads of Fortune\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eThe Black Tides of Heaven\u003c/em\u003e are relatively conventionally told, but Yang takes a slightly different approach with \u003cem\u003eThe Descent of Monsters, \u003c/em\u003ewriting out a thriller through the use of official reports, documents, and letters. \u003cem\u003eThe Ascent of Goodhood\u003c/em\u003e, meanwhile, is a one-sided conversation between Lady Han and an unnamed partner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"3PEm3S\"\u003eWith that unconventional approach, Yang plays out a much larger story than the four slim books would otherwise suggest. We get the outlines of a grand history and epic struggle between an oppressive empire and the people who oppose it. In the form of an fantasy saga, this story might have been written with excruciating detail (looking at you, George R.R. Martin), but here, Yang covers the high points, telling the stories of the key characters, and allowing the reader to connect the dots and put together how they fit alongside one another. It’s an appealing format, especially for an impatient reader like myself. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"e2rgoh\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp

But that isn’t for lack of trying: Hundreds of millions in U.S. funds, training, and equipment have flowed to Central American borders in an effort to turn them into U.S.-style defensible zones and sources of biometrics. The buildup began in 2008 with the \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/04/world/americas/04mexico.html\"\u003eMérida Initiative\u003c/a\u003e, a massive security assistance project to Mexico, and with the parallel Central American Regional Security Initiative. It was continued by Programa Frontera Sur, the Obama administration’s attempt to beef up Mexico’s southern border after record numbers of unaccompanied children tried to reach the U.S. in 2014. That was the year in which Mexico’s then-interior minister summed up his job as, “Who doesn’t have the necessary documents to enter into our country and enter the United States, we can’t allow them into our territory.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA bewildering number of acronyms comprise the U.S. border apparatus that reaches around the world: from BORTAC, an elite, Special Forces-style unit of the Border Patrol, deployed to Iraq to train local forces, to EXBS, the State Department’s Export Control and Related Border Security Program. According to Miller, U.S. Customs and Border Protection “has trained new patrol and homeland security units for Kenyan, Tanzanian and Ugandan borders,” and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security can be found assisting border projects in the Philippines, the Dominican Republic, India, Poland, Turkey, and Vietnam. The Border Patrol has multiple offices in Canada and Mexico. A posting in Puerto Rico gives the agency sway in the Caribbean. Soldiers and police from around the world are flown to the Southwest region of the U.S. to learn; in Guatemala, Israel, and Jordan, Miller meets officials who know tiny Arizona towns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[1](%7B%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22left%22%7D) --\u003e\u003cblockquote class=\"stylized pull-left\" data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"left\"\u003e\u003c!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[1] --\u003e\u0026#8220;Hundreds of millions in U.S. funds have flowed to Central American borders to turn them into U.S.-style defensible zones.\u0026#8221;\u003c!-- END-CONTENT(pullquote)[1] --\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c!-- END-BLOCK(pullquote)[1] --\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConsider the border between Guatemala and Honduras. There, the U.S. has sponsored border task forces named, ironically, for indigenous groups, who for decades have suffered human rights abuses at the hands of U.S.-trained forces in both countries. Miller visits the Guatemalan Chortí Task Force, which was stood up with $13.4 million from U.S. Southern Command in 2015 and received training in communications, intelligence, firearms, setting up checkpoints, and looking for tracks of migrants on foot. On patrol with their Honduran counterpart, the Maya Chortí, Miller gets a glimpse of a brand-new airport in the jungle. Its goal is to attract tourists visiting the “Mundo Maya” corridor of archeological sites in the region, and it features kiosks from U.S. industrial conglomerate 3M equipped for fingerprinting and the facial recognition of elite travelers who want to breeze through security. Meanwhile, living Mayan communities are \u003ca href=\"https://www.pri.org/stories/2018-07-03/government-says-border-patrol-agents-southwest-speaks-spanish-many-migrants-speak\"\u003eincreasingly fleeing\u003c/a\u003e the region, thanks to crushing poverty, \u003ca href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/jul/29/guatemala-climate-crisis-migration-drought-famine\"\u003eclimate change\u003c/a\u003e, land \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/06/23/guatemala-land-defender-san-rafael-mine/\"\u003edispossession\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/07/30/criminalization-environmental-activists-global-witness-report/\"\u003eviolence\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Central America as elsewhere, the U.S. border apparatus got its start and ideological underpinnings during the age of territorial expansion, and Miller dives into that history in the Philippines and elsewhere. But the “exponential growth” of the apparatus starts with 9/11 and leads to a blurring of lines between immigration and war: migration as threat, the nation as homeland, everything as security. It’s not just the border that Americans are pushing outward; it’s the very concept of the border as a front line in a war. This too, has been a focus of U.S. training. Officials tell Miller bluntly that many foreign border forces are “constrained,” meaning they don’t have the broad powers of search, seizure, and arrest that U.S. border agencies claim. In many countries, a CBP trainer says, customs agents are “tax collectors\u0026#8221;; the U.S. is trying to “move forward in increasing their authority so that they’re able to do what they need to do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe U.S. also aims to “extend the border beyond the physical border” into the online realm, in the words of a contractor for CBP’s National Targeting Center, which screens travelers and cargo. That border is one that inhales vast quantities of data in order to profile individuals long before they reach U.S. shores, subjecting them to “extreme vetting.” As The Intercept’s Sam Biddle has \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/12/03/air-travel-surveillance-homeland-security/\"\u003ereported\u003c/a\u003e, Homeland Security has even made open-source software available to enable other countries to do the kind of watchlisting and no-fly lists the U.S. does.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[2](%7B%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22right%22%7D) --\u003e\u003cblockquote class=\"stylized pull-right\" data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"right\"\u003e\u003c!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[2] --\u003eThe exponential growth of the border apparatus starts with 9/11 and the blurring of lines between immigration and war.\u003c!-- END-CONTENT(pullquote)[2] --\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c!-- END-BLOCK(pullquote)[2] --\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot much in this sector is open-source. Much of Miller’s book relates his hops around a series of expos and conferences where border technology is sold. The expos show off the amount of money to be made in this particular chunk of the military-industrial complex, from ground sensors to social media mining. (The U.S. Chamber of Commerce even had a rep at the Seguridad Expo in Mexico City.) Wandering around the show floors at these events (I attended some of the \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/04/22/at-border-security-expo-officials-dismiss-trumps-wall-ive-got-200-foot-bluffs-on-my-border/\"\u003esame ones\u003c/a\u003e Miller writes about), the exhibits are more craven than impressive. The ideology on display is important, but the mercenary motives of the trend to secure the world’s borders are also obvious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere, and generally speaking when talking about obsessions with borders, the U.S. has a rival in Israel. A rival and partner: CBP and DHS officers go to Israel for training, and the Israeli company Elbit \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/06/01/israel-texas-government-relationship/\"\u003ebuilds surveillance towers\u003c/a\u003e for the U.S. border.

Miller quotes the U.S. diplomat George Kennan (\u003ca href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/solving-x-george-f-kennan/\"\u003earchitect\u003c/a\u003e of the containment policy against communism), who declared “a certain unchallengeable antagonism between ‘him that has’ and ‘him that has not.’” The threat to U.S. dominance was one that sprung from “a jealous and embittered world.” These words describe exactly (\u003ca href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/426058-pentagon-warns-of-threat-to-bases-from-climate-change\"\u003eflooding bases\u003c/a\u003e aside) the obsession with climate change\u003ca href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/vb93ey/framing-climate-change-as-a-national-security-threat-is-dangerous\"\u003e as a military threat\u003c/a\u003e. No one doubts that climate change has and will cause massive displacement and migration around the world, but it does not also have to cause prosperous states to harden their borders even more. In the world order envisioned by the U.S. and many other countries, citizenship has become more important than fundamental human rights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe basic theme of Miller’s book — that all these systems exist to ensure “open borders for the elite and a caste system for everyone else” — is familiar.

forth by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman that would loosen some of the restrictions placed on women through the kingdom’s network of so-called “guardianship laws,” a move critics say is too little, too late. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"6EBF1Q\"\u003eThe decree marks the most significant changes to date of Saudi Arabia’s \u003cem\u003ewilayah\u003c/em\u003e, or guardianship, system — a network of regulations on the movements and behavior of women that required them to seek the permission or accompaniment of a close male relative in matters of work, leisure, finances, law, and health.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"WY0T24\"\u003eThe new law permits unprecedented mobility to women, including the right to obtain a passport and travel abroad without a male relative’s permission. Any Saudi over 21 — regardless of gender — will now be able to obtain, renew, and use a passport.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"yY7Cjp\"\u003eIt also extends to the workplace and the home. Women will now receive standard employment discrimination protections.

Sanctioned after Turning Down Trump’s Invitation: Report","content":"\u003cp\u003eZarif has received an unexpected invitation to meet President Donald Trump in the Oval Office last month during his visit to New York, a report by the \u003cem\u003eNew Yorker\u003c/em\u003e said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe American magazine has quoted US and Iranian sources and a well-informed diplomat as saying that the diplomatic overture was made by Senator Rand Paul, the Kentucky Republican, during a meeting with Zarif in New York on July 15th.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith President Trump’s blessing, Paul had been working on the idea for several weeks, in consultation with the White House and the State Department, the report said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn intermediary had reached out to the Iranians on Paul’s behalf three weeks before Zarif was due in New York for meetings at the United Nations. On July 14th, the day before leaving for New York, Paul had a discussion about Iran with the President, while playing a round at the Trump golf course in Sterling, Virginia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn July 15th, Paul and his senior adviser, Doug Stafford, met Zarif at the elegant residence of Iran’s UN ambassador, on Fifth Avenue, a block from the Metropolitan Museum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his decades as a diplomat, Zarif, who studied under Condoleezza Rice’s PhD adviser, at the University of Denver, has built a modest rolodex with the private numbers of members of the House and Senate, the report claimed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I always see people from Congress,” Zarif told the \u003cem\u003eNew Yorker\u003c/em\u003e and a small group of journalists later that week, without naming names. But this was his first meeting with Paul, who is on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two men initially talked about long-standing issues, notably Tehran’s nuclear program, and also recent flare-ups in the Persian Gulf, according to the sources.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul’s mission was to break through the messy layers of conflict and launch a direct diplomatic channel, at the highest level. The overture was a miniature version of Trump’s tactic in circumventing traditional diplomacy by dealing directly with the North Korean leadership.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring an hour-long conversation, Zarif offered Paul ideas about how to end the nuclear impasse and address Trump’s concerns. He later outlined some of them to a group of journalists in the US and subsequently in more detail to \u003cem\u003eNew Yorker\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As a diplomat, I have to always think about alternatives,” he told \u003cem\u003eNew Yorker\u003c/em\u003e. Among them was the idea that the Iranian Parliament could codify, in law, a fatwa issued by Iran’s Leader, originally in 2003 and again in 2010, that forbids the production or use of nuclear weapons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We consider the use of such weapons as \u003cem\u003eharaam\u003c/em\u003e [forbidden] and believe that it is everyone’s duty to make efforts to secure humanity against this great disaster,” Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said, in 2010.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut, if Trump wanted more, he would also have to offer more, Zarif suggested. Another possibility was moving forward one of the later steps of the nuclear deal brokered between Iran and the world’s six major powers in 2015—the accord that Trump abandoned in May, 2018.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZarif said that Iran could bring forward ratification of the so-called Additional Protocol, which is currently due to be implemented by 2023—potentially this year. The protocol, which has already been signed and ratified by a hundred and forty-six nations, allows more intrusive international inspections—on both declared and undeclared nuclear sites in member states—in perpetuity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn exchange, Zarif suggested, Trump could go to Congress to lift sanctions on Iran, as originally provided under the 2015 nuclear deal but not ratified in legislation. Both sides would then feel more secure in the commitments sought in the original deal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul proposed that the Iranian diplomat lay out the same ideas to Trump in person. The President, Paul said, had authorized him to extend an invitation to meet in the Oval Office as early as that week, the US, Iranian, and diplomatic sources told \u003cem\u003eNew Yorker\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn Wednesday, a senior Administration official told reporters, in a teleconference briefing, “President Trump has been very open that he is ready to speak to the senior leadership in Tehran and that he has certainly not prevented any of our friends or allies from communicating with them as well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The President has placed no restrictions on elected officials having conversations with foreign counterparts,” the official said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring its first two years, the Trump Administration reached out to Iran about possible meetings at least eight times, including twice when Trump and the Iranian President, Hassan Rouhani, were both at the UN General Assembly, European and Iranian diplomats told the \u003cem\u003eNew Yorker\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZarif told Paul that the decision to meet Trump in the Oval Office was not his to make; he would have to consult with Tehran. He expressed concern that any meeting might end up as little more than a photo op, without substance, the sources told the \u003cem\u003eNew Yorker\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter his meeting with Paul, Zarif relayed the overture to Iran’s leaders.

The full text of the piece follows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe imposition of injudicious and unwise sanctions on Zarif not only amounts to an unfair attack by the US on a prominent and internationally recognized diplomat, but is also a shot fired at the heart of diplomacy. The move is a sign of confusion and desperation in the United States’ foreign policy arena and shows the pillars of power in the White House are on shaky ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose who claim to be advocates of dialogue and those who, from dawn to dusk, and even in their nighttime tweets, speak of unconditional talks with Iran should be reminded that they have lost eligibility for negotiations by violating the most important and obvious conditions for talks, i.e., respecting the other party and removing rivals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bitter sarcasm and major paradox of this saga is that a country which claims to be the leader of some sort of western civilization and which regards itself as the greatest source of inspiration and promoter of values such as democracy, liberalism and human rights does not care about any other way and mechanism than use of force, threat and war.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe United States is the greatest imposer of sanctions in history. From the Americans’ standpoint, sanctions are a complement and prelude to war.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis country has paid special attention to “sanctions” as a tool, especially since World War II, and slapped bans, under different pretexts, on dozens of countries, hundreds of companies and organizations, and thousands of people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, sanctions gradually turned into the most important tool to exert pressure and force against independent countries that opposed the US. Today, sanctions are the most important tool in the United States’ toolbox of foreign policy. In the twentieth century, this toolbox lacks main tools of foreign policy, i.e., diplomacy, dialogue, interaction and understanding, more than ever before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, the current US administration is ahead of its rivals when it comes to resorting to sanctions, and is seen as the government which uses the tool of sanctions more frequently than any other government in the world. By looking at the dark record of the current US administration, one realizes the reality that basically American statesmen are strangers to political rationality, diplomacy and understanding, and that the foreign policy of this country boils down to two words: threats and sanctions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking at the main key works in the language of American officials, especially Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, National Security Advisor John Bolton and President Donald Trump will suffice to realize the true extent of these individuals’ grudge, malice and animosity toward human values such as dialogue, understanding, mutual respect, non-interference and peaceful coexistence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe post \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ifpnews.com/exclusive/ban-on-zarif-shows-confusion-in-us-foreign-policy-spokesman/\"\u003eBan on Zarif Shows Confusion in US Foreign Policy: Spokesman\u003c/a\u003e appeared first on \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ifpnews.com\"\u003eIran Front Page\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://ifpnews.com/exclusive/ban-on-zarif-shows-confusion-in-us-foreign-policy-spokesman/","published":"2019-08-03T09:20:41Z","guid":"https://ifpnews.com/?p=148251"},{"title":"What Will Extensive US Sanctions on FM Zarif Do to Him?","content":"\u003cp\u003eMasoumeh Poursadeqi has, in an article published by the analytical news website alef.ir, weighed in on the developments pertaining to US sanctions on Iranian Foreign Minister Mohamad Javad Zarif. Highlights of the article follow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome individuals have been put on the sanctions list of the US Treasury.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe band includes the United States’ unilateral sanctions, including the seizure of these individuals’ assets and barring them from entering American soil. However, these sanctions are so wide-ranging and go beyond US borders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sanctions imposed on Zarif by the Treasury\u0026#8217;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) come in line with an executive order by US President Donald Trump, under the pretext that Zarif implements orders by Leader of Iran’s Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was predicted that after the impositions sanctions on Ayatollah Khamenei, the sphere of bans would expand to include individuals and institutions directly related to him. Zarif is the first such individual to have targeted by sanctions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese sanctions have two parts: primary and secondary. In the primary part, all of the individual’s assets and interests on those assets in the United States are seized, and it is reported to OFAC accordingly. Generally speaking, OFAC regulations bans all communications with any American individual in the United States who is related to sanctioned individuals’ assets or interests on those assets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the secondary part, people are involved in specific transactions with sanctioned individuals will be subjected to sanctions as well. Moreover, any foreign financial institute which has knowingly conducted transactions for, or on behalf of the sanctioned individual, or has facilitated such transactions, could be the subject of sanctions pertaining to the client account or payable account.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, the effectiveness of these sanctions outside the United States could, to a great extent, be influenced by psychological elements and fear, which is usually referred to as “over-compliance.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother important point is that being put on the Specially Designated Nationals And Blocked Persons List (SND) can have numerous consequences, but only includes Washington’s unilateral sanctions, namely the seizure of assets and being barred from entering the country.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for the case of Zarif, sanctions imposed on him do not go beyond US borders and other countries can have meetings and news interviews with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBasically, all US sanctions are unilateral and other countries are under no obligation to abide by those sanctions. And even if some governments comply with those sanctions, it is due to political or economic considerations and the kind of relations they have with the United States.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNevertheless, ambiguity still hangs over the issue of visa issuance for the Iranian foreign minister. According the United States’ domestic law, it is forbidden to issue visas to sanctioned individuals. Of course, the US secretary of state is authorized to give permission for the issuance of a visa. However, this visa must be issued based on a “headquarters agreement” signed between the US and UN.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe post \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ifpnews.com/exclusive/what-will-extensive-us-sanctions-on-fm-zarif-do-to-him/\"\u003eWhat Will Extensive US Sanctions on FM Zarif Do to Him?\u003c/a\u003e appeared first on \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ifpnews.com\"\u003eIran Front Page\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://ifpnews.com/exclusive/what-will-extensive-us-sanctions-on-fm-zarif-do-to-him/","published":"2019-08-03T11:39:20Z","guid":"https://ifpnews.com/?p=148289"},{"title":"New Life Breathed into Howz-e Soltan Lake in Central Iran","content":"\u003cp\u003eThe Lake is located 40km north of the city of Qom, 85km south of Tehran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: #ffffff; color: #3366ff;\"\u003e\u003ca style=\"background-color: #ffffff; color: #3366ff;\" href=\"https://ifpnews.com/iran-photos/hoz-e-soltan-salt-lake-central-iran/\"\u003eHowz-e Soltan\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e, which is \u003cspan style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\"\u003ealso\u003c/span\u003e known as Saveh-Qom Lake and Shahi Lake, has an area of 240 square kilometres, and is bound by Alborz Mountain Chain in the north.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe extent and shape of the lake becomes different in each season in relation to precipitation, but due to the heavy rainfall in the beginning of Persian New Year 1398 (mid-March 2019), the water level of Howz-e Soltan Lake has doubled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn dry seasons, the lake dries up due to extreme heat and salt harvesting begins in the area.

Just utterly crawling with cawing corvids. Initially, this was unnerving and unwelcome \u0026mdash; Los Angeles is meant to be populated with palm trees, smoothie bowls, and Instagram filters. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember seeing shiny black feathers, beady eyes, and cacophonous murders in the brochure. Over time, however, I warmed to my crow neighbours.
