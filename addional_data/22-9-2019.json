Caucus\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are so many lessons here:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1. Conventional wisdom is oftentimes ignorance.\u003c/strong\u003e All movements start from the bottom up, and most pundits don’t recognize it, they’re too busy hanging in the club. This is how it always happens in music and how it will happen again. And one thing we know for sure, radio will not be in the lead. All phenomena start online, that’s where this year’s biggest hit, Lil Nas X’s “Old Town Road” started, not even on YouTube or Spotify, but TikTok. Platforms change the sound. It’s McLuhan in action. And on streaming services shorter and more pays better than long and less. “Old Town Road” is not even two minutes long. And when it’s done you repeat it, not only embedding it in your brain, but causing Lil Nas X to make more money. You’ve got to adjust to the new paradigm, the old one is never coming back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2. You start off the radar.\u003c/strong\u003e Especially today, when it’s so hard to get notice. Traction happens way down the line. You’ve got to pay your dues and invest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3. Warren enacted an all out ground game in Iowa.\u003c/strong\u003e Knowing that it would pay dividends later. Your marketing plan today is long instead of short. If the total effect is now, you’re losing. People want to be invested, they want to come on along the way, they want to spread the word, they want to own it. So when you carpet bomb, people notice and then they move on, there’s little sticking power. And, you’ve got to spend money to make money/have an impact. In the previous decade great was good enough. In other words, if your work was great, people found it and you. But not today, there’s too much in the channel, you’ve got to work it. The key is to establish a base audience, that you can depend on, that will keep your career alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e4. People always say you’ve got not chance until you do.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e5. The biggest media outlets are always the last to know.\u003c/strong\u003e TV is too busy talking to itself and newspapers/print think about their audience first, they’ve got giant blind spots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e6. Sincerity triumphs.\u003c/strong\u003e As does credibility. People have to believe in you. You create this bond when they see you. It’s all about personal interaction. Want to have a career? Go on the road and cement the bond, a hit single is not enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e7. Everybody wants to get behind momentum\u003c/strong\u003e, excitement, once you start to break through, you’re a phenomenon, you get the attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e8. You don’t know who is gonna win until you play the game.\u003c/strong\u003e Biden was a shoo-in until he was not. History repeats, can you say Muskie, can you say Jeb Bush?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e9. After the census, after the gerrymandering, the people decide.\u003c/strong\u003e And in most cases, politics is not their number one concern, so you must educate them, and usually this happens on a personal live basis. Live means ever more in a digitized world, it’s not only concerts, in a world of marketing falsehoods, where everybody is selling, you can only evaluate and find truth when you’re experiencing it live.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e10. Preparation counts.\u003c/strong\u003e After these barely pubescent one hit wonders will come a swath of musicians, who practiced, who live for the music as opposed to the riches and the fame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e11. It’s a joke until it’s mainstream.\u003c/strong\u003e People made fun of the Beatles’ haircuts until they wanted one themselves. Indie rock was a sideshow until Nirvana blew up big.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e12. Never change to appease the crowd.\u003c/strong\u003e You’re selling credibility. But it is fine to switch positions if that’s what’s in your heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo how did the media get it so wrong? How did the Democratic National Committee get it so wrong?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause you can’t will the future into being.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is the story of the era, the toppling of old institutions for new ones. In the sixties it was all about the war. Today it’s all about economics. What future do I have? Can I pay my bills? Can I own a house? No one believes the corporation will take care of you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce you go in the wrong direction, you’re history. If Biden loses in Iowa it’s all over. He was seen as a winner, the man who could easily beat Trump, but if he can’t even win in his own party?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo now we’ve got Warren, Bernie, Trump and Kamala.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBiden is fading.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKamala is faltering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBernie is too old in every way, he missed his moment, which was 2016, but he did presage change, he was more in touch with voters than Hillary or the DNC. Bernie acknowledged that the Democrats had moved left. That’s future of the party, the youth, and now they’re taking the reins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you thought that Warren couldn’t win, you’ve now been proven wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGet ready for the new reality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"pf-content\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e~~~\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVisit the archive: http://lefsetz.com/wordpress/\u003cbr /\u003e\n–\u003cbr /\u003e\n@Lefsetz http://www.twitter.com/lefsetz\u003cbr /\u003e\n–\u003cbr /\u003e\nIf you would like to subscribe to the LefsetzLetter\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe post \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ritholtz.com/2019/09/get-ready-for-the-new-reality/\"\u003eGet ready for the new reality\u003c/a\u003e appeared first on \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ritholtz.com\"\u003eThe Big Picture\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"feedflare\"\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?a=gABdN1G3vN4:DQkDhRyCyuU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?a=gABdN1G3vN4:DQkDhRyCyuU:7Q72WNTAKBA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?a=gABdN1G3vN4:DQkDhRyCyuU:dnMXMwOfBR0\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?d=dnMXMwOfBR0\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?a=gABdN1G3vN4:DQkDhRyCyuU:V_sGLiPBpWU\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?i=gABdN1G3vN4:DQkDhRyCyuU:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?a=gABdN1G3vN4:DQkDhRyCyuU:qj6IDK7rITs\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?a=gABdN1G3vN4:DQkDhRyCyuU:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?i=gABdN1G3vN4:DQkDhRyCyuU:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?a=gABdN1G3vN4:DQkDhRyCyuU:KwTdNBX3Jqk\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?i=gABdN1G3vN4:DQkDhRyCyuU:KwTdNBX3Jqk\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?a=gABdN1G3vN4:DQkDhRyCyuU:l6gmwiTKsz0\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?d=l6gmwiTKsz0\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?a=gABdN1G3vN4:DQkDhRyCyuU:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?i=gABdN1G3vN4:DQkDhRyCyuU:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?a=gABdN1G3vN4:DQkDhRyCyuU:TzevzKxY174\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?d=TzevzKxY174\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheBigPicture/~4/gABdN1G3vN4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheBigPicture/~3/gABdN1G3vN4/","published":"2019-09-22T10:00:43Z","guid":"https://ritholtz.com/?p=232720"},{"title":"Younger, Fiduciary-minded, Tech Driven Wealth Managers Staying Ahead of the Curve…","content":"\u003cdiv class=\"pf-content\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNo Jacket Required: Inside the World of New School Wealth Management\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003ciframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 200px;\" src=\"https://player.megaphone.fm/BLM6638994229\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-embed-id=\"https://megaphone.link/BLM6638994229\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\nSource: \u003ca href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-19/no-jacket-required-inside-the-world-of-new-school-wealth-management\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eBloomberg\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBloomberg:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;On this episode of Trillions, we explore their world via a new conference by advisors for advisors called WealthStack.

bourbon, and for the first time consumers won’t have to travel all the way to Kentucky to pick up a bottle. The first installment of Maker’s Mark Wood Finishing Series—a release known simply as Release: RC6 (more on the name later)—marks the first nationally available limited-edition bourbon from the iconic distiller and will hit store shelves nationwide over the next couple of months.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s no small development for a distillery that has added exactly one new whiskey (Maker’s 46) to its core lineup in more than six decades of making its signature wheated bourbon and has historically released only a small number of experimental, limited-release bottles for purchase at its distillery in Loretto, Ky. It’s a move that signals not only a new chapter for Maker’s but also the direction of the larger bourbon industry. Consumers want more and different whiskeys, prompting even the most traditional distillers to innovate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MM-RC6_Bottle-wMMPS-MM46_StarHill-2811.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2701363\" srcset=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MM-RC6_Bottle-wMMPS-MM46_StarHill-2811.jpg 3000w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MM-RC6_Bottle-wMMPS-MM46_StarHill-2811.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MM-RC6_Bottle-wMMPS-MM46_StarHill-2811.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MM-RC6_Bottle-wMMPS-MM46_StarHill-2811.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MM-RC6_Bottle-wMMPS-MM46_StarHill-2811.jpg?resize=1024,683 1024w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MM-RC6_Bottle-wMMPS-MM46_StarHill-2811.jpg?resize=281,187 281w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MM-RC6_Bottle-wMMPS-MM46_StarHill-2811.jpg?resize=755,503 755w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MM-RC6_Bottle-wMMPS-MM46_StarHill-2811.jpg?resize=100,67 100w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MM-RC6_Bottle-wMMPS-MM46_StarHill-2811.jpg?resize=60,40 60w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MM-RC6_Bottle-wMMPS-MM46_StarHill-2811.jpg?resize=154,103 154w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MM-RC6_Bottle-wMMPS-MM46_StarHill-2811.jpg?resize=591,394 591w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MM-RC6_Bottle-wMMPS-MM46_StarHill-2811.jpg?resize=392,261 392w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MM-RC6_Bottle-wMMPS-MM46_StarHill-2811.jpg?resize=252,168 252w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MM-RC6_Bottle-wMMPS-MM46_StarHill-2811.jpg?resize=697,465 697w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MM-RC6_Bottle-wMMPS-MM46_StarHill-2811.jpg?resize=234,156 234w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MM-RC6_Bottle-wMMPS-MM46_StarHill-2811.jpg?resize=500,333 500w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MM-RC6_Bottle-wMMPS-MM46_StarHill-2811.jpg?resize=578,385 578w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MM-RC6_Bottle-wMMPS-MM46_StarHill-2811.jpg?resize=600,400 600w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MM-RC6_Bottle-wMMPS-MM46_StarHill-2811.jpg?resize=90,60 90w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MM-RC6_Bottle-wMMPS-MM46_StarHill-2811.jpg?resize=185,123 185w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MM-RC6_Bottle-wMMPS-MM46_StarHill-2811.jpg?resize=115,77 115w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MM-RC6_Bottle-wMMPS-MM46_StarHill-2811.jpg?resize=738,492 738w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MM-RC6_Bottle-wMMPS-MM46_StarHill-2811.jpg?resize=777,518 777w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3000px) 100vw, 3000px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eFrom left to right: Maker\u0026#8217;s Mark Limited Edition, Private Select, and MM 46.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"image-credit\"\u003eMaker\u0026#8217;s Mark\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt Maker’s, that means a whole lot of experimentation in wood finishes for its flagship bourbon, which typically spends five to six years in American oak casks before bottling. Maker’s 46—released in 2010—represents the first commercial outgrowth of Maker’s experimental wood finishing efforts. By taking cask strength Maker’s and inserting 10 specially seasoned French oak wood staves into the cask for the final nine weeks of aging, Maker’s produced a bourbon emphasizing notes of vanilla, caramel, and spice. The distillery’s Private Select program, which allows customers (mainly bars and restaurants) to craft their own unique barrel of Maker’s by selecting from a menu of finishing staves, grew out of that original experimentation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThose forays into wood finishing experimentation have not only continued behind the scenes for the past decade but also accelerated. “This product is 65 years old, made by traditional practices passed down through the decades,” says Jane Bowie, Maker’s Mark director of Private Select. “And it’s only now that we’re figuring out the science behind those practices. It’s not like they were talking about ‘lignan degradation’ back then.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThey’re certainly talking about it now. Working with partners at nearby Independent Stave Company (ISC), a maker of barrels for the wine and spirits industries, Maker’s has in recent years poured ample time and resources into defining and developing wood staves that can impart or amplify very specific flavors to its bourbon. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MM-RC6_StavesOnBarrel_Cellar-023.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2701366\" srcset=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MM-RC6_StavesOnBarrel_Cellar-023.jpg 3000w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MM-RC6_StavesOnBarrel_Cellar-023.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MM-RC6_StavesOnBarrel_Cellar-023.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MM-RC6_StavesOnBarrel_Cellar-023.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MM-RC6_StavesOnBarrel_Cellar-023.jpg?resize=1024,683 1024w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MM-RC6_StavesOnBarrel_Cellar-023.jpg?resize=281,187 281w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MM-RC6_StavesOnBarrel_Cellar-023.jpg?resize=755,503 755w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MM-RC6_StavesOnBarrel_Cellar-023.jpg?resize=100,67 100w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MM-RC6_StavesOnBarrel_Cellar-023.jpg?resize=60,40 60w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MM-RC6_StavesOnBarrel_Cellar-023.jpg?resize=154,103 154w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MM-RC6_StavesOnBarrel_Cellar-023.jpg?resize=591,394 591w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MM-RC6_StavesOnBarrel_Cellar-023.jpg?resize=392,261 392w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MM-RC6_StavesOnBarrel_Cellar-023.jpg?resize=252,168 252w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MM-RC6_StavesOnBarrel_Cellar-023.jpg?resize=697,465 697w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MM-RC6_StavesOnBarrel_Cellar-023.jpg?resize=234,156 234w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MM-RC6_StavesOnBarrel_Cellar-023.jpg?resize=500,333 500w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MM-RC6_StavesOnBarrel_Cellar-023.jpg?resize=578,385 578w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MM-RC6_StavesOnBarrel_Cellar-023.jpg?resize=600,400 600w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MM-RC6_StavesOnBarrel_Cellar-023.jpg?resize=90,60 90w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MM-RC6_StavesOnBarrel_Cellar-023.jpg?resize=185,123 185w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MM-RC6_StavesOnBarrel_Cellar-023.jpg?resize=115,77 115w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MM-RC6_StavesOnBarrel_Cellar-023.jpg?resize=738,492 738w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MM-RC6_StavesOnBarrel_Cellar-023.jpg?resize=777,518 777w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3000px) 100vw, 3000px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eIn barrel aging whiskey, casks are “raised” by joining the staves in a circle and temporarily hooping them at one end.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"image-credit\"\u003eMaker\u0026#8217;s Mark\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s a highly scientific approach to what is largely considered the art of distilling and maturing bourbon. Working with ISC’s Research Center (that’s the “RC” in “RC6”), Bowie and her team have tested and tasted hundreds of such experiments, as ISC’s researchers have subtly tweaked the aging, toasting, and treatment of various wood staves. The resulting tasting notes have ranged from mocha and tobacco to “baby vomit,” Bowie says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor the bourbon now released as RC6—“6” being the sixth stave recipe the ISC Research Center developed at Maker’s direction—Bowie and her team wanted to preserve the fruity notes abundant in the yeast Maker’s uses in distillation. “Our yeast tastes like hefeweizen,” Bowie says. “So we started talking about those fruit characteristics that are so prominent [in the yeast] and that are often underappreciated, because of the caramel and the vanilla and all those classic wood notes you get. Sometimes the yeast and the distilling gets lost in the product.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe American oak finishing staves developed for the RC6 release first spent 18 months outdoors, exposed to the weather on a lot outside Independent Stave’s cooperage in Lebanon, Ky. This “seasoning” process allows the wood to dry and break down somewhat (that’s your “lignan degradation”), leaching out bitter tannins and preparing the staves to better interact with the liquid (for comparison, most staves spend three to six months seasoning before being crafted into barrels). ISC then toasted them in a convection oven—the exact time and temperature is a trade secret—before Maker’s inserted them into barrels of cask strength Maker’s Mark for exactly eight weeks and five days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MM-RC6_Bottle-wNeat_StarHill-2922.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2701364\" srcset=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MM-RC6_Bottle-wNeat_StarHill-2922.jpg 3000w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MM-RC6_Bottle-wNeat_StarHill-2922.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MM-RC6_Bottle-wNeat_StarHill-2922.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MM-RC6_Bottle-wNeat_StarHill-2922.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MM-RC6_Bottle-wNeat_StarHill-2922.jpg?resize=1024,683 1024w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MM-RC6_Bottle-wNeat_StarHill-2922.jpg?resize=281,187 281w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MM-RC6_Bottle-wNeat_StarHill-2922.jpg?resize=755,503 755w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MM-RC6_Bottle-wNeat_StarHill-2922.jpg?resize=100,67 100w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MM-RC6_Bottle-wNeat_StarHill-2922.jpg?resize=60,40 60w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MM-RC6_Bottle-wNeat_StarHill-2922.jpg?resize=154,103 154w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MM-RC6_Bottle-wNeat_StarHill-2922.jpg?resize=591,394 591w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MM-RC6_Bottle-wNeat_StarHill-2922.jpg?resize=392,261 392w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MM-RC6_Bottle-wNeat_StarHill-2922.jpg?resize=252,168 252w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MM-RC6_Bottle-wNeat_StarHill-2922.jpg?resize=697,465 697w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MM-RC6_Bottle-wNeat_StarHill-2922.jpg?resize=234,156 234w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MM-RC6_Bottle-wNeat_StarHill-2922.jpg?resize=500,333 500w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MM-RC6_Bottle-wNeat_StarHill-2922.jpg?resize=578,385 578w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MM-RC6_Bottle-wNeat_StarHill-2922.jpg?resize=600,400 600w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MM-RC6_Bottle-wNeat_StarHill-2922.jpg?resize=90,60 90w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MM-RC6_Bottle-wNeat_StarHill-2922.jpg?resize=185,123 185w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MM-RC6_Bottle-wNeat_StarHill-2922.jpg?resize=115,77 115w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MM-RC6_Bottle-wNeat_StarHill-2922.jpg?resize=738,492 738w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MM-RC6_Bottle-wNeat_StarHill-2922.jpg?resize=777,518 777w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3000px) 100vw, 3000px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eMaker\u0026#8217;s Mark, served neat, at Star Hill Provisions in Loretto, Ky.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"image-credit\"\u003eMaker\u0026#8217;s Mark\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis specific process took two years of experimentation to perfect, Bowie says, but the results speak for themselves.

RC6 is distinctively Maker’s, but the fruit on the nose and the brightness on the finish make for a unique spirit and—along with the baking spice—an autumnal bottling that could hardly be more appropriate for a late-September release. Just 255 barrels were produced (so between 45,000 and 50,000 bottles, roughly), but at a suggested retail price of $60 you’d hardly know it’s a limited release.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMaker’s plans to release a new iteration of its Wood Finishing Series annually, and Bowie and company are already hard at work on their next round of experimentation, a process that never really stops. “We spend so much of our time trying to understand why things taste the way they do,” she says. “So this is just a way to share that with the public.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eMore must-read stories from \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—\u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/09/07/red-wine-blends-us-wine-sales/\"\u003eRed blends are more popular than ever\u003c/a\u003e in the U.S.\u003cbr\u003e—What exactly is a \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/longform/what-is-a-super-premium-spirit/\"\u003esuper-premium spirit\u003c/a\u003e anyway?\u003cbr\u003e—\u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/09/08/spotify-playlists-wine-pairings/\"\u003eYour next Spotify playlist might be curated with wine pairings in mind\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e—\u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/longform/sanford-and-benedict-wines-california/(opens%20in%20a%20new%20tab)\"\u003eSome of California\u0026#8217;s most famous wines\u003c/a\u003e came from a science experiment\u003cbr\u003e—How the \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/longform/cognac-industry-climate-change/\"\u003e$3.6 billion cognac industry\u003c/a\u003e is trying to outrun climate change\u003ca href=\"https://flipboard.com/@fortune\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eFollow Fortune on Flipboard\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e to stay up-to-date on the latest news and analysis.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://fortune.com/2019/09/22/makers-mark-limited-edition/","published":"2019-09-22T10:00:56Z","guid":"https://fortune.com/?p=2701338\u0026showAdminBar=true"},{"title":"WeWork Is London’s Largest Tenant.

In the past, flexible office operators would typically lease around 20,000 square feet of space, Swinnerton says. Now, WeWork is taking on buildings in excess of 200,000—the Waterloo office, for example, is a whopping 280,000 square feet. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe larger footprint means WeWork must expand beyond its original target community of freelancers and start-ups by seeking to woo a host of big name corporate enterprises. HSBC, for instance, has taken up more than 1,000 desks in the new Waterloo building. Deloitte has installed its U.K. innovation team in WeWork’s Moorgate office. Facebook is even renting an entire building from WeWork in the heart of London’s theatre district. Corporate enterprises now make up about 40% of its global membership—up from 20% in March 2017.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWeWork has also tapped into a kink in London’s office market—traditional landlords there have historically imposed long and inflexible leases on office tenants compared to elsewhere in the world. According to Mat Oakley, director of European commercial research at real estate company Savills, ten-year leases are not uncommon. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e“Even if there is a wobble with regard to what WeWork does next, much of the logic they have set out in terms of how they think people will work isn’t going to go backwards,” said Andrew Allen, global head of investment research for real estate at Aberdeen Standard Investments. “There are clearly very many occupiers who do want flexibility of their space and are willing to pay for that.”\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe trend towards a new style of office space is, nonetheless, mixed: the occupancy rate for flexible office space in London is around 85%, down from around 90% five years ago.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut while general occupancy rates might be on a downward trend, WeWork has an edge over other operators in this sector because most are smaller and can only compete on price, says Oakley. Given that WeWork has deeper pockets, it can afford to give away better incentive packages, helping to sustain demand.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e“The biggest challenge for them in London is probably going to be there just aren’t enough buildings being developed that they could take space in,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA delayed IPO—and Brexit\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 1.063rem;\"\u003eOn the other hand, the decision to postpone the IPO, is both embarrassing and could scupper a critical source of credit financing that would have resulted from a successful listing.

Here’s What You Should Know","content":"\n\u003cp\u003eIt would come as a shock to many people, if having ordered a Bordeaux, the sommelier then appeared with a bottle of white wine in hand. While \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/10/macon-burgundy-wines/\"\u003eBurgundy\u003c/a\u003e needs to be qualified—the reds of Gevrey-Chambertin, the whites of Puligny-Montrachet—most people assume Bordeaux to be red unless otherwise stated. And for good reason; as recently as 2006, 96% of dry Bordeaux was red—and that number used to be even higher. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut white Bordeaux is expanding, making up more than 10% of the vineyards these days, and the U.S. is the top destination for the wines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“It\u0026#8217;s a growing market,” says Jean-Jacques Dubourdieu of Denis Dubourdieu Domaines. The winemaker produces white Bordeaux at several of its properties, including Clos Floridene and Château Doisy-Daëne. “Few people know white Bordeaux, but as long as someone proposes it, as long as someone explains to customers what white Bordeaux is, it’s a real market, and quite loyal,” Dubourdieu says. “People buy it one year, and then they continue to buy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eDubourdieu’s family have been advocates for quality dry white wines since 1948, when his grandfather released the first vintage of a dry Doisy-Daëne. The property is in Barsac; like the neighboring region, Sauternes, it’s traditionally known for sweet white wines. At that time white grapes made up the majority of the region’s plantings, but most of those were destined for distillation or simple plonk. After severe frosts decimated Bordeaux’s vineyards in 1956, many growers replanted with reds. Over the next several decades, wine drinkers around the world started buying more red wine over white, and Bordeaux’s reds commanded higher and higher prices. Wasting a vineyard by planting less remunerative white grapes made little sense to most growers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eDenis Dubourdieu, Jean-Jacques’ father, was a leader in revealing the potential for white wines in Bordeaux. “My father brought in improvements like skin contact maceration before pressing, and after pressing, the cold stabilization.” These techniques help manage the natural nutrients that make for a good fermentation; too little and the yeast don’t finish fermentation, but with too much they can produce reductive, sulfur-matchstick aromas. In the vineyards, Dubourdieu developed vineyard techniques that would get the most aromatic character out of the grapes—Sauvignon Blanc, in particular.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSauvignon Blanc and Sémillon are the leading grape varieties for white Bordeaux, most often blended together. In lighter styles, a small amount of Muscadelle might be added to provide more floral notes. “The good thing about Sémillon is that it gives good structure in the mouth,” Dubourdieu says, “so it’s quite interesting to blend them. I’m less convinced by Muscadelle. It’s a lot of work to make a good Muscadelle.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSauvignon Gris, a variant of Sauvignon Blanc with a pinkish hue to it, has long been an unacknowledged part of some vineyards and was mixed in Sauvignon Blanc somewhat indiscriminately. “We find this variety interesting because it gives structure and long aromas in the mouth,” says Benedicte Piat, co-owner of Château Couronneau. They favor it in their blend over Sémillon, which Benedicte says is “too soft and flat.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSoon other varieties may appear as well. In June, the Bordeaux \u0026amp; Bordeaux Supérieur Association approved the addition of Liliorila, Petit Manseng, and Alvarinho in those appellations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhite Bordeaux used to be an all-or-nothing affair, but that’s changed, too. “Textbooks polarize white Bordeaux as being cheap and cheerful, or even not so cheerful,” says master of wine and Bordeaux authority Mary Gorman-McAdams. “And then the great whites at the other end, but the really interesting stuff is that diversity in the middle.” A top white Bordeaux like Château Haut-Brion Blanc can cost $800 or more, but many great examples like Clos Floridene, Doisy-Daëne, or Château Couronneau can be found in the $20 to $50 range. For Gorman-McAdams, that represents a maturity for the category, and an embrace of what different vineyards can do best. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile in the past quality white Bordeaux was mostly in the hands of people like Denis Dubourdieu and Andre Lurton, another early advocate, today more producers are pursuing a greater range of expression. “For a while, back in the early ’90s, people were using the toolboxes Denis Dubourdieu and his team had developed more rigidly, but now there’s a comfort level and a confidence level in white winemaking,” Gorman-McAdams says. “It’s not just in the whites. In all things Bordeaux there is this going back into the vineyard and focusing on the manifestation of the terroir.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eStylistically, these white Bordeaux wines fill a gap whites from other parts of the world don’t address. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“The first time I went to California with some white Bordeaux samples people were like, What were you doing?” says Christophe Orlarei, sales manager for the Bordeaux specialist distributor WineBook. “You’re in Chardonnay land. But the beauty of white Bordeaux is that it’s obviously not \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/31/labor-day-white-wine-fall/\"\u003eSauvignon Blanc\u003c/a\u003e, it’s not Chardonnay, it’s somewhere in-between the two. As a former sommelier, I used to love that kind of wine because that’s your transition between a bone-dry white wine and something more oaky, more creamy, and more powerful.” Orlarei says that dual nature makes them great wines at the table. “If you get a white Bordeaux, you can definitely go the whole way through your meal,” he suggests, and not need a different wine for each course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eRed Bordeaux is known for aging well, and that’s true for the whites as well. “The Sémillon grape is what makes all the difference in the white Bordeaux,” Orlarei explains. “When it’s young it’s a bit more mellow than the \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/video/3-reasons-why-chardonnay-is-expensive/\"\u003eChardonnay\u003c/a\u003e but a little more sophisticated than the Sauvignon Blanc, and then the Sémillon starts showing all of its power and you get that creaminess and maturity. It’s a great wine to drink over the course of a few years.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor all its qualities, white Bordeaux is probably not going to take over the world. Dubourdieu says that volume may have peaked; all the places best suited to white grapes are planted. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, the wines themselves will keep getting better. “When my grandfather started the Doisy-Daëne dry in 1948,” Dubourdieu says, “it was the shame of the village because he was making a ‘simple’ white Bordeaux on a classified estate.” But, as Dubourdieu continues, his grandfather insisted it was a good place to make dry wine: “In terms of soil and terroir, I think in some places it’s quite easy; we just have to promote that taste.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eMore must-read stories from \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—How this distiller is making a \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/longform/westland-american-whiskey-pnw-washington/\"\u003enew American whiskey\u003c/a\u003e from the ground up\u003cbr\u003e—\u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/longform/wine-industry-climate-change-new-grapes/\"\u003eCan new grapes save the wine industry\u003c/a\u003e from climate change? \u003cbr\u003e—Seven ways to enjoy \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/31/labor-day-white-wine-fall/%E2%80%8E\"\u003ewhite (wine) after Labor Day\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e—Beermakers are experimenting with \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/09/02/sustainable-packaging-beer/\"\u003enew—and sustainable—six-pack designs\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e—\u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/longform/finger-lakes-red-wine/%E2%80%8E\"\u003eWinemakers in New York\u0026#8217;s Finger Lakes\u003c/a\u003e region are moving beyond Riesling\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href=\"https://flipboard.com/@fortune\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eFollow Fortune on Flipboard\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e to stay up-to-date on the latest news and analysis.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://fortune.com/longform/bordeaux-france-white-wine/","published":"2019-09-22T11:30:10Z","guid":"https://fortune.com/?post_type=longform\u0026p=2693323"},{"title":"Philadelphia’s Pizzeria Beddia Wants to Be More Than Just the ‘Best Pizza in America’","content":"\n\u003cp\u003eThe day before \u003cem\u003eBon Appetit\u003c/em\u003e published the story that changed Joe Beddia’s life, the bespectacled Philly pizzaiolo happened to be in New York. Andrew Knowlton—at the time, the magazine’s restaurant editor—invited him over to the \u003cem\u003eBA\u003c/em\u003e offices. “I walked out of the elevator, and he handed me the magazine,” Beddia says. It was the July 2015 issue; the cover star was a galette swollen with blueberries, and in the bottom right corner, etched into a purple splotch of berry syrup, were the words: “\u003ca href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/people/chefs/article/beddia\"\u003eThe Best Pizza in America, p.86\u003c/a\u003e.” Beddia knew a story was coming, but he didn’t know this story was coming. “It was very emotional,” he says. “I couldn’t even open it up. They fucking wrecked me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFour years later, Beddia was getting wrecked in a different way. His original, idiosyncratic pizzeria (no phone, no chairs, no more than 40 pies per night) in Philly’s Fishtown neighborhood had just been reborn in March as a proper restaurant. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.pizzeriabeddia.com/\"\u003ePizzeria Beddia\u003c/a\u003e 2.0 has table service, seating for over 100, a liquor license, and a restaurant group—Defined Hospitality (also working with the trendy-dining likes of Root and Suraya)—behind it.

The first few months after opening, he was working seven days a week, trying to control everything, juggling multiple jobs. “I got to a bad place and wasn’t really taking care of myself,” he says, and the early pies were not as dialed-in and face-meltingly delicious as I’d come to expect from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Joe-Beddia.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Joe Beddia\" class=\"wp-image-2700020\" srcset=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Joe-Beddia.jpg 7810w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Joe-Beddia.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Joe-Beddia.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Joe-Beddia.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Joe-Beddia.jpg?resize=1024,683 1024w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Joe-Beddia.jpg?resize=281,187 281w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Joe-Beddia.jpg?resize=754,503 754w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Joe-Beddia.jpg?resize=100,67 100w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Joe-Beddia.jpg?resize=60,40 60w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Joe-Beddia.jpg?resize=154,103 154w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Joe-Beddia.jpg?resize=591,394 591w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Joe-Beddia.jpg?resize=392,261 392w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Joe-Beddia.jpg?resize=252,168 252w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Joe-Beddia.jpg?resize=697,465 697w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Joe-Beddia.jpg?resize=234,156 234w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Joe-Beddia.jpg?resize=500,333 500w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Joe-Beddia.jpg?resize=578,385 578w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Joe-Beddia.jpg?resize=600,400 600w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Joe-Beddia.jpg?resize=90,60 90w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Joe-Beddia.jpg?resize=184,123 184w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Joe-Beddia.jpg?resize=115,77 115w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Joe-Beddia.jpg?resize=738,492 738w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Joe-Beddia.jpg?resize=777,518 777w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 7810px) 100vw, 7810px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eJoe Beddia from Pizzeria Beddia.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"image-credit\"\u003eCourtesy of Jason Varney\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the sourcing and quality of the toppings was impeccable as always—I bow down to the combo of Cubanelle rings, chives, and looping garlic scapes cooked to a nearly jerky-like texture—the crusts of three different pizzas one night ventured beyond the usual crispy into overbaked. The mainstay “#1” pie (Jersey Fresh–brand crushed tomatoes, whole-milk mozzarella, and a flurry of grated Galen’s Good Old gouda) was a little too greasy, while a special featuring mild ricotta, ferocious Calabrian chile paste, and a forest of mustard greens was a little too dry. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eLucky for Beddia, the new pizzeria is about so much more than pizza.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eOutside the box\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIs it weird that most delicious thing here is a product that arrives at the restaurant fully cooked, in a can? Maybe, but I challenge you not to fall can’t-eat-can’t-sleep in love with the Judion beans. These supersize Spanish legumes eat like filled pasta, each delicate membrane encasing creamy velvet umami. They come to the table drenched in grassy Arbequina olive oil, dusted with sea salt, and lit up with what looks like an entire lemon’s worth of zest. Beddia first had them at a wine bar in Paris and came home resolved to put them on his opening menu. “Good luck finding them,” his purveyors said, but Beddia was persistent, tracking down the two importers bringing Judions into the United States. “We’ve bought them out of beans twice, each.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe menu at Pizzeria Beddia is compact, but every little snack and addition absolutely bangs. There are plump anchovy fillets from the northern coast of Spain, the best money can buy, and a room-temp wedge of Red Cat, a racy washed-rind cheese from beloved local dairy Birchrun Hills. Rising like a pyramid from a pool of olive oil, the portion is large enough to make you think, I’ll never finish that, and then you do, with sponge-like cubes of focaccia. Topped with vivid marinara, the same focaccia dough becomes tomato pie, a staple of the region’s Italian-American bakeries. Its pillowy body erupts from a dark, sturdy, olive oil–fried crust, and the amount of tomato sauce on top is perfect—neither swampy nor stingily airbrushed. Beddia serves it as a single square, purposely cold, like Monday night leftovers from a one o’clock Eagles game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Beddia-behind-the-kitchen.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Beddia behind the kitchen\" class=\"wp-image-2700021\" srcset=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Beddia-behind-the-kitchen.jpg 2880w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Beddia-behind-the-kitchen.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Beddia-behind-the-kitchen.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Beddia-behind-the-kitchen.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Beddia-behind-the-kitchen.jpg?resize=1024,683 1024w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Beddia-behind-the-kitchen.jpg?resize=281,187 281w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Beddia-behind-the-kitchen.jpg?resize=755,503 755w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Beddia-behind-the-kitchen.jpg?resize=100,67 100w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Beddia-behind-the-kitchen.jpg?resize=60,40 60w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Beddia-behind-the-kitchen.jpg?resize=154,103 154w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Beddia-behind-the-kitchen.jpg?resize=591,394 591w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Beddia-behind-the-kitchen.jpg?resize=392,261 392w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Beddia-behind-the-kitchen.jpg?resize=252,168 252w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Beddia-behind-the-kitchen.jpg?resize=697,465 697w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Beddia-behind-the-kitchen.jpg?resize=234,156 234w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Beddia-behind-the-kitchen.jpg?resize=500,333 500w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Beddia-behind-the-kitchen.jpg?resize=578,385 578w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Beddia-behind-the-kitchen.jpg?resize=600,400 600w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Beddia-behind-the-kitchen.jpg?resize=90,60 90w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Beddia-behind-the-kitchen.jpg?resize=185,123 185w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Beddia-behind-the-kitchen.jpg?resize=115,77 115w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Beddia-behind-the-kitchen.jpg?resize=738,492 738w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Beddia-behind-the-kitchen.jpg?resize=777,518 777w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2880px) 100vw, 2880px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eJoe Beddia helps prepare a pie in the kitchen at Pizzeria Beddia.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"image-credit\"\u003eCourtesy of Jason Varney\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOrder all three salads.

Each is a game of hide-and-seek; you always win. The butter lettuce salad has a more traditional construction: Its mix of leaves, sheer watermelon radish slices, apples, almonds, and herbs is tossed with fish sauce vinaigrette. That vinaigrette, sweet and savory with a whiff of the docks, is an instant classic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eA cellar of 25 or so natural wines complements these crackerjack extras and overtures. Beddia is obsessed with wine—after closing the original pizzeria, he considered a career making it—and the list he’s curated represents the ascendant category’s spectrum of expressions, from mindlessly crushable to provocative and thought-provoking. Considered together, these elements put Pizzeria Beddia less in a league with Frank Pepe’s in New Haven, Pizzeria Bianco in Phoenix, or Scarr’s in New York than with a cool Parisian \u003cem\u003ecave à manger.\u003c/em\u003e Is it a coincidence 11th arrondissement darling \u003ca href=\"https://www.worldsbestbars.com/bar/paris/bastille-and-the-marais/septime-la-cave/\"\u003eSeptime La Cave\u003c/a\u003e serves the same anchovies that Beddia does in Philly?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003ePie in the sky\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHopefuls lined up down the block to get into the original Pizzeria Beddia.

Crisp enough to hold a point, spotted like a cheetah with char, but not overdone. The profound, long-lasting, bready flavor of the 32-hours-fermented dough went shot for shot with bossy toppings like the aforementioned anchovies and a fruity-hot garlic-habanero cream inlaid with sweet cherry tomatoes.

But the rest of the sprawling, lift-served bike park actually remains open until mid-October, which makes it a great opportunity to give the booming, exciting sport of downhill mountain biking a try without quite as massive crowds of experts flying past you. It’s the same riding as you’d do in the summer, but gentler and calmer—like so much around the town this time of year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe mountains stay open for alpine hiking and sightseeing—one of the summer’s main draws—though the likelihood of getting a clear view across the valley floor falls a bit as the clouds roll in for the season. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut you can also skip the mountain entirely and hike for free on trails like the short but stunning Cirque Lake, or the arduous but rewarding Panorama Ridge that ends overlooking the impressive Garibaldi Lake. Even places that are often mobbed in summer, like the Lost Lake trails, make for peaceful walking come fall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAlternatively, you can admire whatever view the clouds allow from the comfortable surrounds of the Scandinave Spa. The secluded Scandinavian-style baths—hot tubs, cold pools, saunas, and more—are designed to give soakers the cozy feeling of relaxing in a forest while looking up at the towering mountains above. Entrance buys you a warm robe and access for as long as you want to alternate between the eucalyptus steam baths, chilly waterfall, cozy solarium, and hot pools.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd, like so much in Whistler in September, there’s a deal to be had: This month, you can buy a $100 gift card for $80. The off-season entrance fee is only $75 CAD ($57 U.S.), but you’ll want to use that gift card to tack on a massage. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Whistler-Canada-03.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Whistler Canada 03\" class=\"wp-image-2700921\" srcset=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Whistler-Canada-03.jpg 2880w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Whistler-Canada-03.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Whistler-Canada-03.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Whistler-Canada-03.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Whistler-Canada-03.jpg?resize=1024,683 1024w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Whistler-Canada-03.jpg?resize=281,187 281w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Whistler-Canada-03.jpg?resize=755,503 755w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Whistler-Canada-03.jpg?resize=100,67 100w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Whistler-Canada-03.jpg?resize=60,40 60w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Whistler-Canada-03.jpg?resize=154,103 154w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Whistler-Canada-03.jpg?resize=591,394 591w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Whistler-Canada-03.jpg?resize=392,261 392w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Whistler-Canada-03.jpg?resize=252,168 252w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Whistler-Canada-03.jpg?resize=697,465 697w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Whistler-Canada-03.jpg?resize=234,156 234w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Whistler-Canada-03.jpg?resize=500,333 500w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Whistler-Canada-03.jpg?resize=578,385 578w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Whistler-Canada-03.jpg?resize=600,400 600w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Whistler-Canada-03.jpg?resize=90,60 90w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Whistler-Canada-03.jpg?resize=185,123 185w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Whistler-Canada-03.jpg?resize=115,77 115w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Whistler-Canada-03.jpg?resize=738,492 738w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Whistler-Canada-03.jpg?resize=777,518 777w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2880px) 100vw, 2880px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eMountain biking in autumn.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"image-credit\"\u003eCourtesy of Tourism Whistler/usta Jeskova\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eComplete your full day of fall pampering with a culinary deal so good that it’s almost guilt-inducing to take advantage of what the restaurant needs to do to stay open (a great way to assuage that guilt is to spend the cash on a nice bottle of wine): the $39 CAD ($30 U.S.) fall menu at Alta Bistro. Offered each evening besides Saturdays, the three-course prix fixe menu offers dishes combining local, seasonal produce with innovative techniques and global flavors, like the starter of butternut squash soup with coconut cream, curry oil, and garam masala popcorn. Perennial stars like the elk tartare with chocolate and chicken liver parfait meet seasonal specialties such as Walla Walla onion carbonara with mushrooms and chili through the three savory courses (the menu does not include dessert). \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Alta Bistro leads the pack as the town’s best restaurant at any price, you’ll find similar deals at Aura in the Nita Lake Lodge ($39) and various seasonal specials at Bearfoot Bistro (where the oyster happy hour is always a strong move). \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut while the deals are good, one of the best parts of enjoying Whistler in the fall is doing it quietly. Grabbing pastries at Purebread without a line out the door, sitting down to an impromptu dinner at Sushi Village without factoring in an extra hour or two to wait for a table. Slowly sipping coffee and breaking bread at Bred, the new plant-based bakery from Alta Bistro’s former baker, without needing to vacate for the next folks. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s the few weeks each year that Whistler returns, briefly, to its small-town roots and remembers what it’s like to take a few deep breaths of that fresh mountain air before the crowds return.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eMore must-read stories from \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—\u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/longform/rwanda-vacation-singita-kwitonda-resort/%E2%80%8E\"\u003eRwanda’s newest luxury safari lodge\u003c/a\u003e offers a plush sanctuary for your next getaway\u003cbr\u003e—This tiny Caribbean island grows \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/07/28/caribbean-nevis-island-mangoes/\"\u003e44 types of mangoes\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e—This is \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/24/oprah-winfrey-jersey-shore-hotels/\"\u003ewhere Oprah stays\u003c/a\u003e when she vacations at the Jersey Shore\u003cbr\u003e—\u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/longform/new-zealand-travel-tips-tasman-bay/\"\u003eNew Zealand’s hottest destination\u003c/a\u003e is one you’ve never heard of\u003cbr\u003e—Listen to our audio briefing, \u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/radio/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e 500 Daily\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://flipboard.com/@fortune\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eFollow Fortune on Flipboard\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e \u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003eto stay up-to-date on the latest news and analysis.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://fortune.com/longform/whistler-canada-shoulder-season/","published":"2019-09-22T12:30:52Z","guid":"https://fortune.com/?post_type=longform\u0026p=2689387"},{"title":"What’s the Difference Between a Recession and a Depression?

In fact, the modern concept of gross domestic product (GDP) as a way to measure economic growth wasn\u0026#8217;t developed until the aftermath of the Great Depression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSimon Kuznets, an economist who won the Nobel Prize for his work in this area, put forth a \u003ca href=\"https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/title/971\"\u003ereport\u003c/a\u003e to Congress in 1934 using a concept called national income to track economic activity.

The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) lists the longest GDP contraction on record as 65 months in length which was from October 1873 to March 1879 in what is known as the Long Depression. In comparison, the Great Depression of 1929-1932 was 43 months long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a land price boom-bust in the early 1800s, the word panic entered the lexicon and was used to describe speculative economic episodes that resulted in a spectacular collapse. The term ‘panic’ was used for the remainder of the century to describe what is now termed a depression. Government officials decided they needed something that was less alarming to the public which is how the terms recession and depression came to be used to describe economic downturns of varying severity. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eRecession vs. Depression\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere is no standard definition of the difference between a recession and a depression but depressions are typically more severe in terms of the magnitude and length of the economic contraction. If we compare the past six recessions with the past six depressions, the distinction becomes clear. Here are the past six U.S. recessions:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003ciframe id=\"fortune-iframe-embed-3199225963c61e5898bd7e2dd253be64cbe30744\" class=\"fortune-iframe-embed\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/CDQ8N/1/?iframe_id=fortune-iframe-embed-3199225963c61e5898bd7e2dd253be64cbe30744\" width=\"100%\" height=\"366\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the past six U.S. depressions (some of which were called panics at the time):\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003ciframe id=\"fortune-iframe-embed-26547ef28ba533e48c2eb8f33c664b45f29b7ffb\" class=\"fortune-iframe-embed\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Hocfr/1/?iframe_id=fortune-iframe-embed-26547ef28ba533e48c2eb8f33c664b45f29b7ffb\" width=\"100%\" height=\"366\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eHow long do recessions last? \u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe average GDP contraction over the past six recessions was -2.5%, lasting 12 months on average. The average GDP contraction over the past six depressions was -28.5%, lasting 22 months on average. It is worth noting that the United States was more or less an emerging market when many of these depressions and panics occurred. Economic activity was nearly as volatile as the stock market during the 19th century and early part of the 20th century. The economy is far more mature now while the stock market still exhibits similar levels of volatility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are pundits and professional investors alike these days who evoke comparisons between today\u0026#8217;s economy and what began in the fall of 1929 prior to the onset of the Great Depression. Anyone making Great Depression analogies hasn\u0026#8217;t read enough history books. Even the Great Financial Crisis of 2007-2009, which somehow didn\u0026#8217;t morph into an all-out depression, looks tame when compared to economic downturns in the pre-WWII era. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are, however, smaller countries that can find themselves in the throes of a panic or depression. Greece, for instance, saw GDP decline 26% from 2008-2013 and unemployment spike to nearly 30%. Both of these figures were worse than what the U.S. experienced during the Great Depression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor most individuals, these economic definitions likely don\u0026#8217;t matter all that much for their personal situation. A shallow recession can feel like an opportunity for some but a depression for others.

Like its brethren islands, the land of Zut is preserved and protected under law, barring considerable infrastructure, running water, and electrical grids. Aside from a few stone dwellings dotting the coastline, Zut is mostly deserted.  However, Krešimir Mudronja, owner of Restaurant Festa, has created a bustling sanctuary mingling archaic heritage with high-end dining to attract 15,000 visitors annually.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“The odds were stacked against us, but we pulled through and created a tourist destination out of an isolated and uninhabited island,” says Mudronja as he reflects on the beginnings of Festa.

The cove, a delightfully unexpected sign of life, is a compilation of beachside pleasures that nod to Mudronja’s family and the generations that preceded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/FD_Kresimir-Mudronja_owner.jpg?w=683\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2701593\" srcset=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/FD_Kresimir-Mudronja_owner.jpg 2001w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/FD_Kresimir-Mudronja_owner.jpg?resize=100,150 100w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/FD_Kresimir-Mudronja_owner.jpg?resize=200,300 200w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/FD_Kresimir-Mudronja_owner.jpg?resize=768,1151 768w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/FD_Kresimir-Mudronja_owner.jpg?resize=683,1024 683w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/FD_Kresimir-Mudronja_owner.jpg?resize=141,212 141w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/FD_Kresimir-Mudronja_owner.jpg?resize=336,503 336w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/FD_Kresimir-Mudronja_owner.jpg?resize=67,100 67w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/FD_Kresimir-Mudronja_owner.jpg?resize=40,60 40w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/FD_Kresimir-Mudronja_owner.jpg?resize=103,154 103w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/FD_Kresimir-Mudronja_owner.jpg?resize=720,1080 720w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/FD_Kresimir-Mudronja_owner.jpg?resize=263,394 263w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/FD_Kresimir-Mudronja_owner.jpg?resize=392,588 392w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/FD_Kresimir-Mudronja_owner.jpg?resize=112,168 112w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/FD_Kresimir-Mudronja_owner.jpg?resize=310,465 310w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/FD_Kresimir-Mudronja_owner.jpg?resize=104,156 104w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/FD_Kresimir-Mudronja_owner.jpg?resize=222,333 222w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/FD_Kresimir-Mudronja_owner.jpg?resize=257,385 257w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/FD_Kresimir-Mudronja_owner.jpg?resize=534,800 534w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/FD_Kresimir-Mudronja_owner.jpg?resize=80,120 80w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/FD_Kresimir-Mudronja_owner.jpg?resize=82,123 82w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/FD_Kresimir-Mudronja_owner.jpg?resize=115,172 115w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/FD_Kresimir-Mudronja_owner.jpg?resize=328,492 328w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/FD_Kresimir-Mudronja_owner.jpg?resize=346,518 346w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2001px) 100vw, 2001px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eKrešimir Mudronja\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"image-credit\"\u003eFešta\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eEvoking History\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAccessible only by boat, the island of Zut floats quietly off the ridge of Kornati National Park, a sprawling archipelago in the Adriatic’s Dalmatian region.  Approximately 150 privately owned isles welcome maritime excursions that hark to yesteryear, when mainlanders used wooden lateen sailboats to transfer vegetation and livestock to and from the coastal towns of Murter, Zadar, and Sibenik. Mudronja spent his childhood visiting his grandparents on Zut, learning about the ecology of the land, lessons that are echoed in every aspect of Festa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“Spending time with them was the last chance to really grapple with the old ways in which people used to live and think,” he remembers. “I used those times to connect with this epic land that was a result of centuries of labor done by the hands of my ancestors. Everything on the island is family owned and went through years of conservation processes. That is the best homage we could have given to everyone that came before us.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1993, during the Croatian war for independence, Mudronja’s father uprooted from Murter and constructed a stone house at Zut’s marina. His beachside terrace, shaded by cypress trees, became a modest restaurant where he served Italian soldiers passing through. Under the same roof, which seemingly acts as both museum and restaurant, nautical artifacts and family heirlooms help recall deep-rooted history. Brac stone once used as storage and preservation basins for olive oil have been brilliantly repurposed as decor: large tables, a lobster aquarium, flower pots, and cases displaying souvenirs and honey for purchase. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Festa-Air.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2701595\" srcset=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Festa-Air.jpg 3000w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Festa-Air.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Festa-Air.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Festa-Air.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Festa-Air.jpg?resize=1024,575 1024w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Festa-Air.jpg?resize=281,158 281w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Festa-Air.jpg?resize=895,503 895w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Festa-Air.jpg?resize=100,56 100w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Festa-Air.jpg?resize=60,34 60w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Festa-Air.jpg?resize=154,87 154w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Festa-Air.jpg?resize=701,394 701w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Festa-Air.jpg?resize=392,220 392w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Festa-Air.jpg?resize=252,142 252w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Festa-Air.jpg?resize=697,392 697w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Festa-Air.jpg?resize=234,132 234w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Festa-Air.jpg?resize=500,281 500w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Festa-Air.jpg?resize=578,325 578w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Festa-Air.jpg?resize=600,337 600w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Festa-Air.jpg?resize=90,51 90w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Festa-Air.jpg?resize=107,60 107w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Festa-Air.jpg?resize=219,123 219w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Festa-Air.jpg?resize=115,65 115w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Festa-Air.jpg?resize=875,492 875w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Festa-Air.jpg?resize=892,501 892w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3000px) 100vw, 3000px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eSeafood restaurant Fešta is situated in the inlet of Golubovac on the island of Žut.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"image-credit\"\u003eFešta\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe menu is a symbiosis of old and new in which fresh-caught lobster, octopus, bluefish, and Kornati lamb are prepared with herbs and plants found on Zut. “We use everything we can forage on the island, such as spices, olives, figs for dessert, and a few ingredients for cocktails in our lounge bar by the sea.” Olive oil, made from an indigenous tree called oblica, “is native to the land and as such is defined by the untouched, isolated nature of the islands.” Other resources are brought in from Murter or fishermen, crab hunters, and suppliers scattered throughout the Adriatic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMudronja and his team of 40 reside in lodging behind the restaurant. “The employees live on the island like us, our family.

It’s going to impact the rest of the air around you and the people around you. I also like to remind people that it is your business whether you share your cannabis consumption with others. Do that in your own time and comfort and by your own judgment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCannabis and the workplace is a hot topic. Putting aside medical use, should someone bring up their recreational use with their coworkers?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s been one of the bigger questions: Do I smoke with my boss if I know that we both partake? It’s really up to you if you think it’s appropriate for the work relationship that you have. I don’t think it’s a problem, though, to offer the same way you would say, “Let’s go out for a drink after work.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThat leads to a common situation: happy hour with your coworkers. Since the rules are often more relaxed at this function, with alcoholic drinks and/or cigarettes, how do you talk about cannabis?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTreat it as any other topic of interest you have or thing that you do. You can say, “Hey, I have a joint if anyone wants to join in.” Confidently make the offer or simply smoke or vape as you do. Have the confidence and comfort level in the same way we do with drinking. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOn the flip side, there are a lot of liberal companies where people are very open about their cannabis use. What if you don’t want to partake?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you’re the person who wants to decline when everyone else is doing it, stick to basic, casual language: “Thanks, but I’m good.” You absolutely don’t have to come up with an excuse. Don’t make a big deal out of it, and it won’t be a big deal. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Post_HigherEtiquette_3DBook-e1568834154233.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2700098\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u0026#8220;Higher Etiquette: A Guide to the World of Cannabis, from Dispensaries to Dinner Parties\u0026#8221;\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"image-credit\"\u003eTen Speed Press/Penguin Random House\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou talk in your book about cocktail and dinner parties incorporating cannabis, with weed pairings, edibles, shared joints, and vape pens. It’s almost like having a cigarette or cigar after dessert. If you want to have cannabis available for guests while entertaining, what are some general tips? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eKnow what you’re offering your guests and label things clearly. You don’t pour all your different alcohols into decanters and leave them unlabeled, so don’t leave jars of nugget or concentrate out without telling people what it is. It’s also nice to have a variety of options, like some form of vape, flower, joint and/or bowl. It’s funny, because back in the 1940s, you had ashtrays and cigarettes on hand; it was a part of entertaining. Now, if you’re going to have a joint, you have to bring back things like the ashtray. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThat’s a great point. In the book, you also note that a host should place the vape pen in front of the place card at a dinner setting. Why is that?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s stylistically a good place, but also useful and practical for a guest. It has been really fun to explore questions like this and talk to people who have been throwing cannabis dinner parties for years!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnother interesting situation has to do with parenting, specifically cannabis and playdates. There’s often the stereotype of moms getting together for coffee or wine—both vices in their own right—while the kids have playtime. Cannabis may be an option too. How do you approach the topic with another parent?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eObviously, we’re not letting anyone underage smoke or be impacted by the smoke, but you want to be respectful of how someone is raising their children, even if that’s different from you. Know what your boundary is for cannabis. Rather than ask a parent outright, which can sound judgmental, ask if you can have a conversation first because of this boundary. But I do like to ask people why they have this boundary. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s really unfortunate that cannabis comes from a good century of negative assumptions. I talked to one mom who said she took an edible on vacation and noticed how much she was able to engage with her son. She wasn’t focused on bills or things at work—she was focused on him in the moment. It’s going to take a long time for the stigma to go away. But if you’re going to engage in cannabis within safe ranges on a playdate, offer it to the other parent too. Equate it as you would that glass of wine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"wp-block-image\"\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"aligncenter\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Higher-Etiquette_Page-147-by-Sam-Kalda.jpg?w=555\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2700095\" srcset=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Higher-Etiquette_Page-147-by-Sam-Kalda.jpg 1495w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Higher-Etiquette_Page-147-by-Sam-Kalda.jpg?resize=81,150 81w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Higher-Etiquette_Page-147-by-Sam-Kalda.jpg?resize=163,300 163w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Higher-Etiquette_Page-147-by-Sam-Kalda.jpg?resize=768,1418 768w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Higher-Etiquette_Page-147-by-Sam-Kalda.jpg?resize=555,1024 555w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Higher-Etiquette_Page-147-by-Sam-Kalda.jpg?resize=115,212 115w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Higher-Etiquette_Page-147-by-Sam-Kalda.jpg?resize=272,503 272w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Higher-Etiquette_Page-147-by-Sam-Kalda.jpg?resize=54,100 54w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Higher-Etiquette_Page-147-by-Sam-Kalda.jpg?resize=33,60 33w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Higher-Etiquette_Page-147-by-Sam-Kalda.jpg?resize=83,154 83w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Higher-Etiquette_Page-147-by-Sam-Kalda.jpg?resize=585,1080 585w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Higher-Etiquette_Page-147-by-Sam-Kalda.jpg?resize=213,394 213w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Higher-Etiquette_Page-147-by-Sam-Kalda.jpg?resize=319,588 319w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Higher-Etiquette_Page-147-by-Sam-Kalda.jpg?resize=91,168 91w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Higher-Etiquette_Page-147-by-Sam-Kalda.jpg?resize=252,465 252w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Higher-Etiquette_Page-147-by-Sam-Kalda.jpg?resize=85,156 85w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Higher-Etiquette_Page-147-by-Sam-Kalda.jpg?resize=180,333 180w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Higher-Etiquette_Page-147-by-Sam-Kalda.jpg?resize=209,385 209w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Higher-Etiquette_Page-147-by-Sam-Kalda.jpg?resize=433,800 433w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Higher-Etiquette_Page-147-by-Sam-Kalda.jpg?resize=65,120 65w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Higher-Etiquette_Page-147-by-Sam-Kalda.jpg?resize=67,123 67w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Higher-Etiquette_Page-147-by-Sam-Kalda.jpg?resize=267,492 267w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Higher-Etiquette_Page-147-by-Sam-Kalda.jpg?resize=281,518 281w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1495px) 100vw, 1495px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eReprinted with permission from \u0026#8220;Higher Etiquette: A Guide to the World of Cannabis, from Dispensaries to Dinner Parties\u0026#8221; by Lizzie Post, copyright © 2019.

Do your research ahead of time. Make sure your accommodations are in a place where it’s going to be easy to have the experience you’re looking for. It’s actually hard to find hotels that allow cannabis, and I’m still waiting for someone to do a weed airline! But there are great “bud and breakfasts” and wonderful events that allow onsite consumption.

Cannabis will be something we’ve absorbed into society the way we have the etiquette around alcohol and cigarettes. It’s a personal choice for people and let it be that.

Both head political movements whose popularity is built upon the promise of automatically putting extra cash in your bank account every month, ostensibly to boost the purchasing power of the most economically vulnerable families.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/06/27/andrew-yang-democratic-debate-ubi/\"\u003eU.S. presidential candidate Andrew Yang\u003c/a\u003e and Luigi Di Maio, head of Italy’s populist Five-Star Movement, are both big believers in the notion of every eligible citizen receiving a universal basic income—or, as Yang calls it, the \u0026#8220;freedom dividend.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s nothing new about national basic income proposals. The idea first arose in 16th-Century Europe when humanists began arguing that noble families—the one percent of the day—should bear a greater responsibility for taking care of the poor, not solely leaving it up to the church.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s been on the periphery of mainstream economic theory ever since.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn more recent decades the idea has been tested in a few dozen small-scale trials. For \u003ca href=\"https://www.sacbee.com/news/local/article226280230.html\"\u003ea pilot in Stockton, Calif.\u003c/a\u003e, 100 area residents are receiving $500 each month. In Finland, 2,000 homeless people were given around $620 a month. And a plan in Namibia gave $15 a month (the equivalent to around a week’s wages at the time) to 1,000 people under the age of 60. The longest running of such schemes can be \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/2/13/16997188/alaska-basic-income-permanent-fund-oil-revenue-study\"\u003efound in Alaska\u003c/a\u003e, which Yang cites often on the campaign trail, where the state has been sharing profits from oil revenue since 1982, giving Alaskans what usually amounts to between $1,000 and $2,000 per year, depending on the price of oil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what sets the Yang plan and the Italy initiative apart is the ambition. They\u0026#8217;re not just pilot projects or studies orchestrated by social scientists. They\u0026#8217;re official fiscal policy—or could be if Yang manages to defy the odds and get into the White House.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eThe Italians: more stingy than Yang \u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eItaly’s \u003cem\u003ereddito di cittadinanza\u003c/em\u003e (or, citizen’s income) plan went into effect earlier this year.  While it\u0026#8217;s not a carbon copy of the plan Yang envisions for the U.S., there may be some valuable lessons to be learned from how the Italians pulled it off—and what\u0026#8217;s far from perfect about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere\u0026#8217;s how it works in the \u003cem\u003ebel paese\u003c/em\u003e:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo qualify, you must be an Italian or EU citizen and have an annual income under €9,360 (roughly $10,320), which would put you, officially, under the poverty line. (There are other conditions: you cannot have more than €6,000 in savings or a second property valued at above €30,000). The ample fine print means the benefit helps only certain segments of the population.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach month, a beneficiary’s income is automatically topped up to €780 via a special government-issued prepaid debit card. If you work, and earn less than that, you get the difference between your wage and €780. You get the full €780 if you are unemployed or retired with no pension.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryday life in Italy is built around red tape. This is no exception. The benefit must be renewed every 18 months.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Marco Leonardi, an economist specializing in labor and welfare for the State University of Milan, the Italian plan is probably mislabeled. He thinks it carries too many limits and conditions for it to be considered a true universal income plan. Given that it’s only available to people who are unemployed or who earn less than a certain amount, he said, “it would be more accurate to call it a kind of unemployment assistance, or low-income assistance.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen it was being developed, the Italian program was closer to the classic, theoretical universal income plan, which, according to Israeli-American author and analyst Yuval Levin, requires something closer to a no-strings-attached policy to realize the widest possible societal impact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuch a plan “must give people resources and authority and greater freedom to find new and more effective ways to lift themselves up from poverty,” Levin said, which is pretty close to the way Yang describes the potential for his initiative.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn contrast to Yang\u0026#8217;s proposal, the Italian plan tries to incentivize specific behaviors such as looking for work, which planners believe is more constructive in an economy where the rates of employment and labor competitiveness have lagged well behind other G7 nations. Yang\u0026#8217;s has no such strings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndrea Ciarini, an economic sociologist at La Sapienza University in Rome, notes debt-stricken Italy cannot afford a true universal income along the lines of Yang\u0026#8217;s. (Even before the Italian plan was ratified, the country repeatedly ran afoul of rules for members of the euro currency zone that limit large budget deficits and government debt as a percentage of gross domestic product).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A lack of cash is what\u0026#8217;s required Italy’s plan to be so limited,” Ciarini said. “But even as it is, nearly 1 million Italian families are receiving some kind of assistance, which is enough to have some impact in Italy’s slow-growing economy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eRules and conditions apply: No Netflix or Spotify \u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe hope, according to the architects at the Five-Star Movement, is that its initiative will stimulate growth while improving the outlook of the poorest Italians. Economists say it will be another year before such impacts can be measured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe estimated cost for the Italian plan is roughly $33 billion, though the actual budget for this year is far smaller—under $10 billion. That is still a lot of money for Italy’s cash-strapped government, but it is a rounding error compared to the $3.8 trillion price-tag that non-partisan analysts say Yang’s “Freedom Dividend” would cost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo put that in perspective, Yang’s idea is about 380 times more expensive than Italy’s; the U.S. is about five times as populous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYang says he would pay for his plan by taxing tech companies like \u003ca href=\"/fortune500/amazon-com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAmazon\u003c/a\u003e, Uber, and Facebook, companies, he worries, that are championing automation at the expense of blue-collar jobs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eItaly\u0026#8217;s program is paid for by taxpayers—in the form of more deficit spending.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat may explain why the fine print of the Italian plan can be so maddening. Italians can use the debit card to pay for life\u0026#8217;s necessities: things like rent, clothes for work or school and food.

With much of her summer spent on fundraising, she had a similarly light footprint in other early voting states.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eShe campaigned in New Hampshire once in the last two months. She also hasn\u0026#8217;t been in South Carolina, where she\u0026#8217;s counting on a strong showing among black voters, in two months but plans to double her organizing staff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOther candidates are also planning a fall surge in Iowa. Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has rapidly expanded his paid staffers in the state, bringing his total to 100, one of the field\u0026#8217;s most expansive Iowa footprints.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHis campaign is convening more than two dozen donors in Iowa this weekend to discuss strategy, according to an aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the plans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eButtigieg plans to crisscross the state by bus this weekend, with visits to smaller cities in central and northern Iowa. He\u0026#8217;s inviting the media to join him on the bus to engage more casually than he has in the past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSanders, meanwhile, recently severed ties with his Iowa political director, one of a series of staff shake-ups in key early voting states. The campaign also replaced Sanders\u0026#8217; New Hampshire state director.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAmy Klobuchar, who has focused heavily on Iowa since joining the race, is zeroing in this week on a \u0026#8220;blue wall\u0026#8221; tour of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, states that supported Democrats for decades before flipping to President Donald Trump in 2016.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Minnesota senator is stressing the similarities between her home state and the blue wall states, and her ability to win over voters in areas that backed Trump — an argument, she says, for why she would be the best Democratic nominee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eO\u0026#8217;Rourke is also taking a wider view of the map. Since suspending his campaign for nearly two weeks to remain in his hometown of El Paso, Texas, after a mass shooting there that killed 22 people, he\u0026#8217;s vowed to take the quest to deny Trump a second term directly to the president.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0026#8217;s still visiting early voting states but is traveling to unusual places like the Mississippi towns where recent immigration raids led to nearly 700 people arrested and an Arkansas gun show.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe idea is to distinguish O\u0026#8217;Rourke in a crowded field. But Trippi said the strategy could prove fatal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;It\u0026#8217;s Iowa or nothing,\u0026#8221; he said. \u0026#8220;Touring every state but the early states is a big mistake.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eMore must-read stories from \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—\u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/09/20/new-york-statute-of-limitations-rape/\"\u003eNew York’s rape laws\u003c/a\u003e are now some of the toughest in the nation.

Conventional wisdom is oftentimes ignorance.\u003c/strong\u003e All movements start from the bottom up, and most pundits don’t recognize it, they’re too busy hanging in the club. This is how it always happens in music and how it will happen again. And one thing we know for sure, radio will not be in the lead. All phenomena start online, that’s where this year’s biggest hit, Lil Nas X’s “Old Town Road” started, not even on YouTube or Spotify, but TikTok. Platforms change the sound. It’s McLuhan in action. And on streaming services shorter and more pays better than long and less. “Old Town Road” is not even two minutes long. And when it’s done you repeat it, not only embedding it in your brain, but causing Lil Nas X to make more money. You’ve got to adjust to the new paradigm, the old one is never coming back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2. You start off the radar.\u003c/strong\u003e Especially today, when it’s so hard to get notice. Traction happens way down the line. You’ve got to pay your dues and invest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3. Warren enacted an all out ground game in Iowa.\u003c/strong\u003e Knowing that it would pay dividends later. Your marketing plan today is long instead of short. If the total effect is now, you’re losing. People want to be invested, they want to come on along the way, they want to spread the word, they want to own it. So when you carpet bomb, people notice and then they move on, there’s little sticking power. And, you’ve got to spend money to make money/have an impact. In the previous decade great was good enough. In other words, if your work was great, people found it and you. But not today, there’s too much in the channel, you’ve got to work it. The key is to establish a base audience, that you can depend on, that will keep your career alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e4. People always say you’ve got not chance until you do.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e5. The biggest media outlets are always the last to know.\u003c/strong\u003e TV is too busy talking to itself and newspapers/print think about their audience first, they’ve got giant blind spots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e6. Sincerity triumphs.\u003c/strong\u003e As does credibility. People have to believe in you. You create this bond when they see you. It’s all about personal interaction. Want to have a career? Go on the road and cement the bond, a hit single is not enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e7. Everybody wants to get behind momentum\u003c/strong\u003e, excitement, once you start to break through, you’re a phenomenon, you get the attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e8. You don’t know who is gonna win until you play the game.\u003c/strong\u003e Biden was a shoo-in until he was not. History repeats, can you say Muskie, can you say Jeb Bush?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e9. After the census, after the gerrymandering, the people decide.\u003c/strong\u003e And in most cases, politics is not their number one concern, so you must educate them, and usually this happens on a personal live basis. Live means ever more in a digitized world, it’s not only concerts, in a world of marketing falsehoods, where everybody is selling, you can only evaluate and find truth when you’re experiencing it live.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e10. Preparation counts.\u003c/strong\u003e After these barely pubescent one hit wonders will come a swath of musicians, who practiced, who live for the music as opposed to the riches and the fame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e11. It’s a joke until it’s mainstream.\u003c/strong\u003e People made fun of the Beatles’ haircuts until they wanted one themselves. Indie rock was a sideshow until Nirvana blew up big.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e12. Never change to appease the crowd.\u003c/strong\u003e You’re selling credibility. But it is fine to switch positions if that’s what’s in your heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo how did the media get it so wrong? How did the Democratic National Committee get it so wrong?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause you can’t will the future into being.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is the story of the era, the toppling of old institutions for new ones. In the sixties it was all about the war. Today it’s all about economics. What future do I have? Can I pay my bills? Can I own a house? No one believes the corporation will take care of you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce you go in the wrong direction, you’re history. If Biden loses in Iowa it’s all over. He was seen as a winner, the man who could easily beat Trump, but if he can’t even win in his own party?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo now we’ve got Warren, Bernie, Trump and Kamala.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBiden is fading.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKamala is faltering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBernie is too old in every way, he missed his moment, which was 2016, but he did presage change, he was more in touch with voters than Hillary or the DNC. Bernie acknowledged that the Democrats had moved left. That’s future of the party, the youth, and now they’re taking the reins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you thought that Warren couldn’t win, you’ve now been proven wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGet ready for the new reality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"pf-content\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e~~~\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVisit the archive: http://lefsetz.com/wordpress/\u003cbr /\u003e\n–\u003cbr /\u003e\n@Lefsetz http://www.twitter.com/lefsetz\u003cbr /\u003e\n–\u003cbr /\u003e\nIf you would like to subscribe to the LefsetzLetter\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe post \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ritholtz.com/2019/09/get-ready-for-the-new-reality/\"\u003eGet ready for the new reality\u003c/a\u003e appeared first on \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ritholtz.com\"\u003eThe Big Picture\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"feedflare\"\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?a=gABdN1G3vN4:DQkDhRyCyuU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?a=gABdN1G3vN4:DQkDhRyCyuU:7Q72WNTAKBA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?a=gABdN1G3vN4:DQkDhRyCyuU:dnMXMwOfBR0\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?d=dnMXMwOfBR0\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?a=gABdN1G3vN4:DQkDhRyCyuU:V_sGLiPBpWU\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?i=gABdN1G3vN4:DQkDhRyCyuU:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?a=gABdN1G3vN4:DQkDhRyCyuU:qj6IDK7rITs\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?a=gABdN1G3vN4:DQkDhRyCyuU:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?i=gABdN1G3vN4:DQkDhRyCyuU:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?a=gABdN1G3vN4:DQkDhRyCyuU:KwTdNBX3Jqk\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?i=gABdN1G3vN4:DQkDhRyCyuU:KwTdNBX3Jqk\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?a=gABdN1G3vN4:DQkDhRyCyuU:l6gmwiTKsz0\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?d=l6gmwiTKsz0\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?a=gABdN1G3vN4:DQkDhRyCyuU:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?i=gABdN1G3vN4:DQkDhRyCyuU:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?a=gABdN1G3vN4:DQkDhRyCyuU:TzevzKxY174\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?d=TzevzKxY174\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheBigPicture/~4/gABdN1G3vN4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheBigPicture/~3/gABdN1G3vN4/","published":"2019-09-22T10:00:43Z","guid":"https://ritholtz.com/?p=232720"},{"title":"Younger, Fiduciary-minded, Tech Driven Wealth Managers Staying Ahead of the Curve…","content":"\u003cdiv class=\"pf-content\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNo Jacket Required: Inside the World of New School Wealth Management\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003ciframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 200px;\" src=\"https://player.megaphone.fm/BLM6638994229\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-embed-id=\"https://megaphone.link/BLM6638994229\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\nSource: \u003ca href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-19/no-jacket-required-inside-the-world-of-new-school-wealth-management\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eBloomberg\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBloomberg:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;On this episode of Trillions, we explore their world via a new conference by advisors for advisors called WealthStack.

Over, First Amendment","content":"\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThis past week, with some fanfare, Facebook announced its own version of the Supreme Court: a 40-member board that will make final decisions about user posts that Facebook has taken down. The announcement came after extended deliberations that have been described as Facebook’s “constitutional convention.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWe don’t usually use sweeping terms like \u003cem\u003eSupreme Court \u003c/em\u003eand \u003cem\u003econstitution\u003c/em\u003e to describe the operation of private companies, but here they seem appropriate. Internet platforms such as YouTube and Facebook have been called the modern public square. That description understates the platforms’ importance for the many people who use them in place of newspapers, TV stations, the postal service, and even\u003ca href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/18/facebook-libra/\"\u003e money\u003c/a\u003e. People whose posts are removed from major platforms say they are being excluded from the most important communication channels of our age. We should care deeply about the rules these companies apply to our speech and behavior—whether PayPal should process \u003ca href=\"https://www.wired.com/2010/12/paypal-wikileaks/\"\u003edonations to WikiLeaks\u003c/a\u003e, for example, or whether the security provider Cloudflare should protect \u003ca href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/why-we-terminated-daily-stormer/\"\u003eneo-Nazi sites\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/cloudflare-8chan-support-ddos/\"\u003e8chan\u003c/a\u003e, or whether Facebook should have taken down the famous \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/10/technology/facebook-vietnam-war-photo-nudity.html\"\u003eVietnam War photo\u003c/a\u003e of a naked girl fleeing her village.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eBut private platforms aren’t really the public square, and internet companies aren’t governments. That’s exactly why they are free to do what so many people seem to want: set aside the First Amendment’s speech rules in favor of new, more restrictive ones. Messages we might once have heard from a soapbox in the park—including very troubling ones about dangers of vaccines, conspiracy theories, or racist agendas—can be banished from social-media platforms.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe prevailing framework for free expression is getting a do-over. The existence of private Supreme Courts and constitutional conventions makes it possible, even easy, to imagine that this do-over will be governed by the same constraints as real-world governments: constitutional rules to protect individual rights, and democratic processes to set the laws we live under. Other rules that are being retrofitted for private internet platforms also sound like the mechanisms that keep real-world governments accountable to the public. Advocacy groups have demanded appeals or other due-process-like \u003ca href=\"https://santaclaraprinciples.org/\"\u003erights\u003c/a\u003e for people accused of violating those rules. Some advocates—concerned that “\u003ca href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-twitter-solicit-outside-groups-often-on-the-right-to-referee-political-speech-11546966779\"\u003ebehind-the-scenes lobbying\u003c/a\u003e,” to borrow \u003cem\u003eThe Wall Street Journal\u003c/em\u003e’s phrase, is shaping platforms’ speech rules—are calling for the same kind of transparency we would expect from real legislators about their interactions with lobbyists.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThose are all good developments—up to a point. But we should not fool ourselves that mimicking a few government systems familiar from grade-school civics class will make internet platforms adequate substitutes for real governments, subject to real laws and real rights-based constraints on their power. Compared with democratic governments, platforms are far more capable of restricting our speech. And they are far less accountable than elected officials for their choices. We should pay close attention to those differences before urging platforms to take on greater roles as arbiters of speech and information.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eMajor platforms can restrict our speech more effectively than any government in history. They can’t jail dissenters, but they can silence them. Increasingly, platforms such as Facebook rely on software that can monitor everything we write, route it for review, or just automatically delete forbidden words or images. Platforms can take down lawful but hateful, harassing, misleading, or offensive posts, and do so very swiftly—even with appeals, they resolve \u003cem\u003ein minutes\u003c/em\u003e disputes that might take courts months or years.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eBut the same lack of democratic or constitutional accountability that makes platforms so effective as content regulators makes them very hard to constrain in other ways. The platform versions of “due process” or legislative “sunshine laws” will be pale reflections of the originals. Twitter may seek public \u003ca href=\"https://about.twitter.com/en_us/safety/safety-partners.html\"\u003einput\u003c/a\u003e on its speech rules, but users will never influence those rules the way voters influence actual legislation—by electing representatives to voice our interests, and ousting them if they fail to do so. Members of the Facebook Supreme Court are not charged with upholding the rights users have under the Constitution, human-rights law, or any other legal instrument. Their\u003ca href=\"https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2019/01/oversight-board/\"\u003e job\u003c/a\u003e, by and large, will be to interpret the platform’s existing policies. Our rights against platforms are, at best, Bill of Rights Lite.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eMany platforms try hard to do the right thing in their speech policies. Google, where I worked for many years, poured substantial resources into defining responsible rules, and wrestled with a lot of very hard judgment calls. Platforms will also respond to outside pressure, including the \u003ca href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?464404-1/violence-extremism-online\"\u003eSenate hearing last week\u003c/a\u003e over content posted by violent extremists. Every public outcry over the spread of fake news or hate speech nudges internet companies to assume more of the powers that Americans and citizens of other democracies deny their governments—to prohibit legal speech, keep users under pervasive surveillance, and use algorithmic content filters to make certain things literally unsayable. The more platforms assume these powers, the more we should worry about the fact that we won’t actually control how they will use them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWe should be realistic about who is likely to call the shots as private, for-profit platforms assume greater roles in restricting online speech. Most obviously, governments that control access to major markets are well positioned to influence platforms’ decisions worldwide. It’s no coincidence that YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Microsoft, which earn substantial portions of their revenues in Europe, apply European hate-speech standards globally—even in countries where that speech is legal. Less democratic regimes in the next round of emerging markets will no doubt want similar authority. Platforms’ rules are shaped by advertisers too. YouTube \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/17/arts/youtube-broadcasters-algorithm-ads.html\"\u003eoverhauled\u003c/a\u003e its content policies when advertisers threatened to defect in 2017—and small filmmakers lost ad revenue as a result. Business partners can influence platforms’ decisions about content, and so can business \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/daphnehk/status/1159883689464983554\"\u003erivals\u003c/a\u003e. A platform that fears bad press or legislative setbacks has reason to appease whoever can make those things happen.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIf platforms aren’t accountable to us, why are we encouraging them to assume so much practical control over our speech? One line of thinking seems to be that it’s too late to do anything else—that platforms already have rules, so they might as well have better ones. That reasoning is almost always a one-way ratchet. It justifies telling platforms to do more instead of telling them to roll back changes they’ve already made. The evolution of the filtering algorithms many platforms use to automatically block images and videos online provides a good example. Platforms originally built tools such as \u003ca href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/photodna\"\u003ePhotoDNA\u003c/a\u003e to detect the worst of the worst content: child pornography. Then, in 2016, they \u003ca href=\"https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2016/12/partnering-to-help-curb-spread-of-online-terrorist-content/\"\u003eretooled\u003c/a\u003e the algorithms to identify content that platforms—applying their own terms of service rather than the law—designate as “terrorist.” Now the European Union’s highest court is \u003ca href=\"http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2019/09/filtering-facebook-introducing-dolphins-net-new-stanford-cis-white-paper-or-why\"\u003econsidering\u003c/a\u003e whether Facebook must use filters to stop users from calling an Austrian politician a “lousy traitor” and a “fascist.” We can only guess what the next expansion of filters’ roles will be. If platforms’ existing policing capabilities are always a reason to demand more, it’s hard to identify any stopping point.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eTreating platforms like governments—encouraging their control, but constraining them with flimsy versions of democratic input or due process—is not part of democracies’ usual playbook when companies gain too much power, or when their businesses cause harm. Market forces and competition are supposed to keep private commercial power in check. When those fail to do so, the next line of defense is to enforce competition law, not to establish new quasi-governmental rules for companies. If businesses are profiting from messes that hurt everyone else—as polluters or cigarette companies have done, and as many people allege platforms are doing now—governments can tax them to fund corrective measures such as waste cleanup or education campaigns. If a company is uniquely well positioned to solve a problem—as platforms may be in the case of viral content—Congress can empower courts to make them do it, as long as the content is actually illegal.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eBut we aren’t following the usual playbook, in which government sets the rules and companies follow them. We can’t—not as long as we want platforms to block speech that the U.S. government, following the First Amendment, has no power to restrict. Bypassing the First Amendment requires putting power in private hands. And that in turn means giving up on real democratic input, due process, Supreme Court review, or any of the other tools we use to constrain actual governments.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eProminent in the current “techlash” are two distinct criticisms: that tech companies have grown too strong, and that they aren’t doing enough to make users behave. In essence, critics are telling platforms to take on more power to police their users. If the pundits of 2009 were blithely confident that platforms would use their influence only for good, the pundits of 2019 seem to think this will still happen as long as platforms behave responsibly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eBut the way that democratic countries issue instructions for responsible private behavior is by passing laws. Those laws are constrained by the Constitution, including the First Amendment, for a reason. Lawyers can argue—and \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/28/us/isis-influence-on-web-prompts-second-thoughts-on-first-amendment.html\"\u003esome respected ones\u003c/a\u003e do—for more restrictive interpretations of the First Amendment, in which courts and lawmakers can prohibit online the sort of speech that would be legal in a park or a bar. But that kind of legal rule change would be an incremental and careful process. Instead, private companies are reshaping our speech norms in fits and starts. This big do-over is what happens when we put platforms in charge. In our rush to deputize companies as enforcers of new rules for the public square, we are forfeiting constitutional protections and major aspects of self-governance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/ejtC4u_KwCk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/ejtC4u_KwCk/","published":"2019-09-22T10:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-598462"},{"title":"\u003cem\u003eEvangelical\u003c/em\u003e Has Lost Its Meaning","content":"\u003cp class=\"dropcap\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003eOnce or month or so Tommy Kidd and I get together for lunch at our favorite taco joint. Over the carnitas and barbacoa and guacamole we catch up on how our writing projects are going, and perhaps gossip a bit about what’s happening at Baylor University, where we both work. And more often that not, we end up talking about our complicated relationship to American evangelical Christianity. Because the future of that movement, which is our movement, matters to us—and, we think, matters to America.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTommy is a Southern Baptist; I’m an Episcopalian, in the Anglican tradition descending from the Church of England. Very different things, one might think, and in some ways one would be right. Where \u003ca href=\"https://hbcwaco.org/\"\u003eTommy’s church\u003c/a\u003e has a praise band, \u003ca href=\"http://www.stalbanswaco.org/\"\u003emine\u003c/a\u003e has organ music; the central event on Sunday morning at his church is the sermon, while at mine it’s the Eucharist. And yet both of our traditions are closely connected, if in different ways, to evangelicalism.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Southern Baptist Convention, the largest Protestant denomination in America, is generally if not universally evangelical: just look at \u003ca href=\"http://www.sbc.net/search/search.asp?q=Evangelical\"\u003ethe uses of the term \"evangelical\" on the denomination’s website\u003c/a\u003e. There aren’t very many evangelicals in the Episcopal Church any more—there aren’t many \u003cem\u003eEpiscopalians\u003c/em\u003e any more—but most of the founders of modern evangelicalism, in the eighteenth century, were priests of the Church of England, and some of the more recent figures who are dearest to today’s evangelicals are also Anglican (most famously, C. S. Lewis).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eAnd that’s one of the most important points to grasp about evangelicalism: it’s not a denomination. It’s not even a single tradition. It is, rather, a complex and fluid movement dedicated to the renewal of Christianity, largely among Protestants, though its efforts have occasionally reached into Catholicism. Its focus is on preaching the \u003cem\u003eeuangelion\u003c/em\u003e, a New Testament Greek word meaning \"good news\" or \"good message.\" The specific contours of that message are often debated: while most scholars of the movement hold to the \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_W._Bebbington%23Bebbington_quadrilateral\"\u003eBebbington quadrilateral\u003c/a\u003e, some think a more complete picture is given by the \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_W._Bebbington%23Bebbington_quadrilateral\"\u003eLarsen pentagon\u003c/a\u003e. Those debates can get rather scholastic.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eSo if you need something a little pithier, here’s the definition that Kidd offers in his new book: “Evangelicals are born-again Protestants who cherish the Bible as the Word of God and who emphasize a personal relationship with Jesus Christ through the Holy Spirit.\" It would be difficult to do much better in a single sentence.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThat said, the state of evangelicalism in America today is such that a single sentence can’t capture much of the complexity. Thus the full title of Kidd’s book: \u003cem\u003eWho Is an Evangelical? The History of a Movement in Crisis\u003c/em\u003e. And Kidd believes, as do I, that the language of \"crisis\" is appropriate: as he comments late in his book, \"the 2016 presidential election would become the most shattering experience for evangelicals since the \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scopes_Trial\"\u003eScopes Trial\u003c/a\u003e.\"\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/07/evangelical-christians-face-deepening-crisis/593353/?utm_source=feed\"\u003ePeter Wehner: The deepening crisis in Evangelical Christianity\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"dropcap\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003eKidd begins his book with a concise but assured history of the evangelical movement from its origins in 18th-century England through the 20th century. The Scopes Trial—especially as reported by H. L. Mencken’s outraged mockery of William Jennings Bryan’s insistence that Darwinian theory and Christianity are incompatible—established evangelicals in the American public mind as ignorant yahoos who could safely be ignored. (That Mencken had great respect for more thoughtful evangelicals, including the conservative Presbyterian J. Gresham Machen, went unnoticed. It’s instructive to contrast Mencken’s \u003ca href=\"https://history.msu.edu/hst203/files/2011/02/Mencken-In-Memoriam-WJB.pdf?mod=article_inline\"\u003eobituary of Bryan\u003c/a\u003e with his \u003ca href=\"https://www.patheos.com/blogs/protestprotest/2017/08/skeptics-view-christianity/\"\u003eobituary of Machen\u003c/a\u003e.) This general dismissal by journalists and intellectuals lasted until the rise of self-declared evangelical Jimmy Carter, which led to \u003cem\u003eTime\u003c/em\u003e magazine declaring 1976 The Year of the Evangelical.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eBut this is where the strangest, and perhaps the most consequential, chapter in the history of American evangelicalism began. For in the 1980 election the newly confident evangelical movement, in their self-understanding as the \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_Majority\"\u003eMoral Majority\u003c/a\u003e, supported not their coreligionist Jimmy Carter but the divorced former Hollywood actor Ronald Reagan. And that inaugurated the affiliation of white American evangelicals with the Republican Party that has lasted to this day. As Kidd explains,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eForming the Moral Majority freed [Falwell] from tax regulations against direct political advocacy by churches. Unlike [Billy] Graham, Falwell did not begin by seeking access to the top levels of power. Instead, he sought to mobilize fundamentalists and evangelicals to change the occupants of political offices. He told Christians that it was sinful not to vote. Asking pastors to hold voter registration drives, Falwell told them that they needed to get people “saved, baptized, and registered” to vote. The agenda of the Republican evangelical insiders was born.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe precise contours of what happened to evangelicals during the Carter administration are still hotly debated by historians. Certainly abortion rights—which Carter supported and Reagan did not—played a major role, even though that was a recent priority for evangelicals. More generally, the social conservatism of many evangelicals, especially in the South, made them feel less and less at home with the comparatively progressive sexual and racial politics of the Democratic Party. And the fact that Reagan could speak openly of God—in the Sixties, well after his divorce and remarriage, he had had some kind of religious awakening, and became a regular attender of Bel Air Presbyterian Church in Los Angeles—sweetened the pill.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eBut it seems to me that, of all the traits that attracted evangelicals to Reagan, perhaps the most important was Reagan’s sunny and fervent \u003cem\u003epatriotism\u003c/em\u003e. Already white American evangelicals had a tendency to associate Christianity closely with the American experiment, and to think of their country as a “Christian nation,” or at the very least actuated by \u003ca href=\"https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=Judaeo-Christian+values%252C+\u0026amp;year_start=1800\u0026amp;year_end=2000\u0026amp;corpus=15\u0026amp;smoothing=3\u0026amp;share=\u0026amp;direct_url=t1%253B%252CJudaeo%2520-%2520Christian%2520values%253B%252Cc0\"\u003e“Judeo-Christian values.”\u003c/a\u003e But as the decades passed and American church leaders in almost all denominations became less interested in traditional Christian doctrines and more interested in what some scholars have come to call \u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moralistic_therapeutic_deism\"\u003eMoralistic Therapeutic Deism\u003c/a\u003e, a larger and larger proportion of white evangelicals became what Pew Research calls \u003ca href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/08/29/religious-typology-overview/\"\u003e“God-and-Country Believers.”\u003c/a\u003e These folks, almost all of whom are white, may not attend church often or at all, and they may not be interested in, or even \u003cem\u003eaware of\u003c/em\u003e, the beliefs that have typically characterized evangelical Christians, but they know this much: they believe in God, and they believe in America, they love Donald Trump because he speaks blunt Truth to culturally elite Power, and when asked by pollsters whether they are evangelicals they say Yes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eBy now, God-and-Country believers are so accustomed to voting Republican—and to being disdained or mocked by Democrats—that few of them can remember doing anything else.

So we now have a peculiar situation in which people who don’t know what the term “evangelical” historically connotes and who massively distrust one another—God-and-Country Moralistic Therapeutic Deists on the one hand, and a press that simply \u003ca href=\"https://www.getreligion.org\"\u003edoesn’t get religion\u003c/a\u003e on the other—have combined to take the term away from those of us who know and care about its history.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThus Kidd:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\r\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWhy do respondents with marginal evangelical characteristics say that they are, in fact, evangelicals?

He joked that had he known how busy he would have been when he was elected this spring, he would have turned down the position heading the union.

In \u003ci\u003eSurfacing\u003c/i\u003e, the Scottish essayist and poet Kathleen Jamie recounts her 2014 visit to Quinhagak, a coastal village of some 700 people located south of Napakiak. Five years earlier, while watching the Bering Sea swallow their land, creep closer to their homes, and threaten their community, Quinhagak’s residents, most of them indigenous Yup’iks, invited Rick Knecht, an archaeologist from the University of Aberdeen in Scotland, to help them preserve what the water was taking away. Jamie reports that that erosion of a mile-long stretch of beach had revealed a 500-year-old village filled with Yup’ik artifacts: “line weights, harpoon heads, jewelry, wooden arrow-shafts, fishing weights, darts, models of animals, even ceremonial dance-masks, ritually broken after use.” The discovery of these objects soon led to a renewed interest among the Quinhagak community about a way of life that had all but been forgotten. Before Jamie joined Knecht in Alaska, the archaeologist had told her that the site, named Nunallaq—or “Old Village”—“was revitalizing a damaged culture” and “developing resilience and confidence” among Quinhagak’s residents.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWarren Jones, the former president of the village corporation that owns the land in Quinhagak and most of the businesses that operate on it, tells Jamie how the dig inspired the first ceremonial dance in the village in a hundred years. Jones credits interest in Knecht’s work to an increase in young Quinhagaks attending college, and believes what’s happening there can show other Alaskan villages how a return to traditional ways of life can prepare them for the future. As one village elder tells Jamie during a discussion about hunting, “We gotta \u003ci\u003eremember\u003c/i\u003e. If the planes stop flying and no food comes in, we gotta \u003ci\u003eremember\u003c/i\u003e how to live.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith \u003ci\u003eSurfacing\u003c/i\u003e, Jamie doesn’t join the chorus of voices calling for immediate action to prevent the effects of climate change from getting worse. She admits to feeling “powerless to resist” the “global forces and corporations” blamed for the crisis. She can’t, however, be accused of throwing in with \u003ca href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/what-if-we-stopped-pretending\"\u003ethe climate defeatists\u003c/a\u003e. \u003ci\u003eSurfacing \u003c/i\u003eis a work of cautious optimism, with the author occasionally tilting too far toward wide-eyed hope. “If you imagine all the incidents the people here spoke of,” she writes of Quinhagak, “all the looking and listening, the stories and encounters, remembered and repeated and layered over thousands of years, you might indeed come to know your own backyard. And how it might help you.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSuch stories are not, of course, found only in Alaska. Later in the book, Jamie spends time at an archaeological site named the Links of Noltland in her native Scotland. Buried for 5,000 years, the site is home to a recently exposed seaside settlement from the Neolithic and Bronze Ages. As steady winds erode human remains and other evidence of communities that existed on the spot for 700 years, archaeologists race to save as much of it as they can. The subsistence farmers who lived here, Jamie writes, practiced “a way of life that bound you inescapably.” More than once, archaeologists tell her that these people “just got on with it”—the business of living.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Does this matter, is the question,” Jamie wonders. “Do we want to know how it was to be human, here, five thousand years ago? Do we want to know where we’re coming from as we cruise into the future? What we were, or might be again? How we ‘engaged,’ if that’s the word, how we configured our relationship with the rest of the natural world, with the planet.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJamie appears content to let the reader answer these questions, and she moves on to essays about losing her parents, her bout with cancer, and the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests in China. For Terry Tempest Williams, there is no moving on from such questions. The Utah-based conservationist’s new book, \u003ci\u003eErosion: Essays of Undoing\u003c/i\u003e, reads like a longer, louder, and less searching book than Jamie’s. “Without a respect for origins,” Williams declares, “the human spirit falters.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn her impassioned collection of essays, poems, and interviews dating back to 2012, Williams returns often to the idea that in order to adapt to the climate crisis, everyone will need to understand “what indigenous communities have always known, and are increasingly willing to share—that we are one with the land, not apart from it.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe veteran nature writer Barry Lopez makes a similar argument in his recent, \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/03/barry-lopez-warns-about-climate-change-new-book/585031/?utm_source=feed\"\u003ecareer-spanning book \u003cem\u003eHorizon\u003c/em\u003e,\u003c/a\u003e and like him, Williams understands that her observations—and, ultimately, her faith in humanity and optimism about its future—come from a place of privilege. While everyone is experiencing the effects of climate change, it’s easy to write “Our undoing is also the making of our becoming” when the ocean isn’t lapping at your front door. “I have the privilege of looking forward,” Williams admits in \u003ci\u003eErosion\u003c/i\u003e, later adding, “This is who I am—Boom! A white woman of privilege born of the Covenant—I am not on the outside but inside.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWilliams’s impatience with subtlety, penchant for aphorisms (“Wilderness is a necessity, not a luxury”; “The silence before us is time”), and wide embrace of repetition threaten to dull the book’s message early on.

After an abortive attempt to merge with the then-all-women’s Vassar College, Yale’s then-president, Kingman Brewster, announced that female students would be accepted in the class of 1973. More than 2,800 “female Uebermensches” applied for what would eventually be 230 spots in the freshman class. (Smaller numbers of female students also transferred into the sophomore and junior classes that fall.)

They arrived on campus preceded by an oppressively auspicious reputation, which some felt kept them from being treated like ordinary students. But 1969 was anything but an ordinary time in the United States—the Vietnam War was in full swing, young men were being drafted, and the trial of the Black Panther Bobby Seale would unfold right there in New Haven the following year—and that tumult frequently upstaged and overshadowed the unique situation in which Yale’s first undergrad women found themselves.\u003cspan\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" height=\"15\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" title=\"Click and drag to move\" width=\"15\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe high-school senior Rebecca Newman read the \u003cem\u003eTimes \u003c/em\u003estory at home in Denver, Colorado, while she was waiting to find out whether she would be one of Yale’s lucky “superwomen.” “My mother, God bless her, said, ‘Well, \u003cem\u003eI \u003c/em\u003ethink you’re in this category!” Newman remembers with a laugh.

According to Eve Rice, the chair of the 50th Anniversary Committee and a member of the class of 1973, in the process of converting Vanderbilt from a men’s dorm to a women’s dorm, the university stationed a 24-hour guard at its entrance, making it the only dorm on campus with a guard. According to \u003ca href=\"https://visitorcenter.yale.edu/book/vanderbilt-hall\"\u003ethe university’s website\u003c/a\u003e, the bathrooms were outfitted with shelves and mirrors ahead of the women’s arrival—though as Joyce Majure, a classmate of Newman and Rice’s, recalls, many of the mirrors were mounted up too high to be of much use to some women. Because “it was really kind of a last-minute decision to go coed,” Majure told me, “there was not a huge amount of preparation.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNewman and another fellow 1969 freshman, Julia Preston, also recalled considerable hand-wringing over the fact that just one bathroom in Vanderbilt Hall had a bathtub. “There were some very apologetic messages from the administration about the lack of bathtubs,” Preston told me. It wasn’t clear why exactly officials thought this was such an inconvenience. “It kind of felt like they thought somehow women couldn’t adequately care for their hygiene in a shower,” she added with a laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRebecca Newman discovered—in somewhat jarring fashion—another way in which Yale was adapting when she showed up to take the famous Yale Swimming Test, where students had to demonstrate that they could swim the length of the pool at the Payne Whitney Gym. Newman had shown up to the gymnasium in a bathing suit and cover-up, and soon noticed a sign posted near the elevators that reminded gentlemen that “clothing must now be worn in all public places.” This is how Newman learned that historically, \u003ca href=\"https://yalealumnimagazine.com/blog_posts/2146-the-swimming-lesson\"\u003eYale men had completed the test in the nude\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"right\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Majure's Yale student ID card.\" height=\"235\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/09/Majure_ID/499b5d1e2.jpg\" width=\"340\"\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"caption\"\u003eJoyce Majure’s student ID card.

Newman and Majure both remembered the late Elga Wasserman, \u003ca href=\"https://yalealumnimagazine.com/articles/4031-elga-wasserman-76jd\"\u003ethe then-chair of Yale’s Committee on Coeducation\u003c/a\u003e, as a veritable godsend. “Elga was an absolute advocate for us. And if there was a problem, if she found out about it, she took care of it,” Majure remembered. When a few women living in Vanderbilt Hall discovered that men had been peering through an unsecured emergency exit into the women’s bathroom, “that got taken care of immediately,” Majure said. “Boys being bad, that did not last.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWomen’s particular health needs were addressed in thoughtful, helpful ways, too. Birth control, then relatively new, was made available through the Department of University Health, according to Rice, and Newman remembers that a Yale ob-gyn, Philip Sarrel, and his wife, Lorna (both of whom also \u003ca href=\"http://www.womenshealthsection.com/content/whec/sarrel.php3\"\u003efounded the Yale Sex Counseling Service\u003c/a\u003e), introduced themselves to students and told the young women to come to them with any questions or concerns about their sexual health. “It was very sensitive,” Newman recalls. “And it was stated so matter-of-factly.

Everyone had to adapt—including the faculty and the existing student body. When Yale went coed in 1969, administrators did not reduce the number of men admitted into the freshman class; rather, Yale admitted its usual 1,000 men (which many attributed to Kingman Brewster’s rumored \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1973/06/03/archives/yales-first-full-class-of-women-about-to-graduate-looks-back-with.html\"\u003evow to “produce 1,000 leaders per year”\u003c/a\u003e) \u003cem\u003eplus \u003c/em\u003ethe women, resulting in a freshman class of more than 1,200 where men outnumbered women at a rate of about four to one. At first, this was weird for everybody. “In the dining room, some of us were so self-conscious that we would make our roommates walk to the coffee machine across the room with us,” Newman told me. “Because, you know, otherwise, there were, like, 80 pairs of eyes watching you get coffee. It was like, \u003cem\u003eHey, let’s all five of us go get coffee\u003c/em\u003e.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut the novelty wore off, to some extent. Majure remembers being dazzled by the intellectually stimulating conversation that dependably arose in the dining halls among students of different genders and walks of life. “We would basically sit around after dinner and talk about politics and race relations and classes,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSome of the women I spoke with remembered classroom settings as similarly vibrant. “In general, everyone was quite happy that women were in the classrooms,” Newman remembered. (She does remember one biology teacher who taught a seminar class consisting of Newman, another woman, and 10 men, and could not tell Newman and the other woman apart. “She and I would look at each other and think, \u003cem\u003eIs there a problem here?\u003c/em\u003e” That was, of course, just one shell-shocked professor, Newman added.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"left\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Linda Bunch.\" height=\"308\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/09/Bunch/e43259974.jpg\" width=\"308\"\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"caption\"\u003eLinda Bunch, photographed in 1969, was one of 26 black women enrolled in Yale’s Class of 1973.

Linda Bunch remembers her seminar classes as particularly intimidating places—and not just because women were outnumbered by men, or because Bunch describes herself as “shy” at the time. “I didn’t feel like these people wanted me in the class,” she told me. Bunch, one of just 26 black women in Yale’s inaugural freshman class, recalls getting the impression that a number of her Yale classmates met black people for the first time when they arrived on campus; she remembers one male classmate once remarking to her that their conversation marked the first time he’d spent time alone with a woman of color. So when Bunch thinks back on her seminar classes, she told me, she suspects that some of the tension she felt in the room “was a racial thing.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSome of the women I spoke with remembered taking great care to ensure that they were not seen as simply wives in waiting, or girls who’d come to college for the social life. “I wore jeans, turtlenecks. Practical clothes,” Newman told me. Newman and her friends were wary of being seen as “coeds,” a term often used in a time when coeducational campuses were less common to \u003ca href=\"https://www.chronicle.com/blogs/linguafranca/2018/04/24/vanished-from-campus-language-the-coed/\"\u003edescribe\u003c/a\u003e female students who were not all that serious about college as an intellectual pursuit. “We wanted to be seen as women students, but we mostly wanted to be seen as\u003cem\u003e students\u003c/em\u003e,” Newman told me. “We wanted to be taken seriously.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“A lot of the women, to be honest, were very wary of getting romantically involved” with male students, Majure told me. “I think part of it was just the sense that everybody was watching you—you know, you’re this superwoman. \u003cem\u003eI’m here to get an education.\u003c/em\u003e Most of us didn’t want to be accused of going to Yale to get our ‘MRS degrees.’” (Perhaps this fear was justified: A popular joke on campus at the time was that Yale \u003ca href=\"https://celebratewomen.yale.edu/history/timeline-women-yale\"\u003ewould now produce\u003c/a\u003e 1,000 male leaders per year as well as 250 housewives.)

Yale’s first undergraduate women were, according to Newman and Majure, \u003ca href=\"https://celebratewomen.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/Timeline-of-Women-at-Yale.pdf\"\u003esomewhat dismayed\u003c/a\u003e to find that the “activities fee” that all students paid was partly helping to fund weekend mixer-style parties, for which students from all-women’s colleges nearby were brought to campus by the busload. Their activities fees, it seemed to them, were just helping Yale’s male students meet girls and find dates from other schools: “The guys were all our friends during the week, going to class. Then the parties would come, and all of a sudden they didn’t know us anymore,” Majure remembered with a chuckle.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStill, Julia Preston remembers that during her freshman year, she often had to avoid social advances from male students when she was trying to study—especially from upperclassmen, for whom the college experience as they knew it had been transformed. “Sometimes I had difficulty being able to study in the big libraries, the big reading rooms. Guys would come up to me and want to chat, and they would sit down,” she told me.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePreston eventually made her go-to study space the “stacks” in Sterling Memorial Library, where she could read and do homework in a quiet carrel, undisturbed. For some Yale men, she noted, “making the transition from socializing with women to studying with women was not automatic.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr class=\"c-section-divider\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eToday, when Preston thinks back on those days in Sterling Library and nights in Vanderbilt Hall, the bumbling ways in which the administration and the student body tried to acclimatize to the presence of female students strike her as trivial.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe women I spoke with for this story certainly have fond memories of their early years at Yale. Once, early in her freshman year, Linda Bunch bought a ticket for one to see the Paul Newman movie \u003cem\u003eButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\u003c/em\u003e and ended up at a premiere event \u003ca href=\"https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2008/09/29/paul-newman-legend-from-yale-drama-dies-at-83/\"\u003eheld by the Yale School of Drama\u003c/a\u003e, where Newman briefly studied. Bunch, who had a poster of Newman in her bedroom as a girl, excitedly chatted up the actor, right up until “he got tired of me.” Joyce Majure, meanwhile, remembers with amusement that she and her roommate used to meet up with some guy friends around a freshman counselor’s dorm-room television on Sunday evenings to watch \u003cem\u003eMission: Impossible \u003c/em\u003e(the TV series that predated the movie franchise of the same title). But every interview I did, at one point or another, eventually gravitated toward the Vietnam War and the inescapable tumult of the late 1960s.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat Preston—who told me her grandfather, father, uncle, cousin, and two older brothers all preceded her at Yale—now remembers most vividly from her freshman year is how the political upheaval that was playing out across the country affected New Haven. When people ask what it was like to be “a woman storming the ramparts at this backward, dyed-in-the-wool, conservative, male university,” she reminds them—and reminded me—that coeducation quickly became an afterthought for many students once they arrived at Yale. The activist groups on campus, she told me, never seemed to think twice about welcoming women students into their ranks, and “the fact that there hadn’t been undergraduate women on the Yale campus prior to our arrival just became evanescent so quickly.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBunch remembers the campus-activism scene a little differently. In her encounters with men from student groups like the Black Students Association of Yale, or the BSAY, she found them less than welcoming. “They were not about women being free thinkers or anything,” she told me. “I felt that I was supposed to act a certain way and think a certain way, and I didn’t always.” Today, Bunch lives in her hometown of Washington, D.C., and works as an administrative coordinator for the Potomac Electric Power Company.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"left\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Julia Preston participates in a campus performance of Jacques Brel Is Alive and Well and Living in Paris in 1972.\" height=\"341\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/09/19720201JDPBrelatYale_2/a181b9370.jpg\" width=\"323\"\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"caption\"\u003eJulia Preston participates in a campus performance of Jacques Brel Is Alive and Well and Living in Paris in 1972.

Later, toward the end of her freshman year, the Black Panther Bobby Seale was tried for murder at the courthouse across the street, and Yale students who supported the Black Panthers protested and housed other protesters in their dormitories. One of the people Preston remembers as a role model is Kurt Schmoke, later the dean of Howard University Law School and the Baltimore City mayor, a black student leader who effectively \u003ca href=\"https://www.aspeninstitute.org/our-people/kurt-l-schmoke/\"\u003eserved as a liaison\u003c/a\u003e between the student body and Yale administrators when unrest was at its most intense.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStudents were restless on other fronts, too: While men who were enrolled in college were generally granted deferments for the draft, in 1969, many Yale men were still technically eligible for it. Others had served already and returned to school. Rebecca Newman, who volunteered with a service on campus where she counseled men on what their rights were with regard to the draft, knew several people who had served; on campus, she said, “there was such a strong anti-war sentiment that the people who had served and come back were very slow to tell you about it.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNewman, who now lives in Los Angeles and works as an artist, remembers the war as a constant backdrop of every day of her first year at Yale. Before dinner every night, she and her dorm friends would gather around the common-room television to watch the evening news and its coverage of the war. At the time, \u003ca href=\"https://visitorcenter.yale.edu/book/memorial-hall\"\u003ea veterans’ memorial on campus\u003c/a\u003e was “covered on one side with names of young men who died in World War I. And on the other, World War II. And now Korea,” Newman remembers. “They hadn’t started to put the names from Vietnam up.

A lot was going on in 1969, she noted, but to her, “all of the issues sort of took a second place to ... what black people were going through in this country.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBunch remembers feeling somewhat isolated as a freshman at Yale—perhaps as a direct result of the Black Panther trial’s inescapable presence in New Haven that year. On the one hand, Yale’s support for the Black Panthers seemed somewhat hollow given the unfriendliness she’d experienced in class. On the other hand, Bunch also didn’t feel entirely at home among the more radical and politically active black students. “I had white friends all through college; I have white friends now,” she told me. “Some people would say to me, ‘How can you have friends in the BSAY if you have white friends?’ So there was always that tension.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJulia Preston remembers feeling both exhilarated by the political discourse on campus and overwhelmed by it. In addition to extensive reading and paper-writing and studying for exams, she felt like she had to \u003cem\u003ealso \u003c/em\u003eread Angela Davis, and \u003cem\u003ealso \u003c/em\u003ebe familiar with the details of the Vietnam War.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“I didn’t feel like I could just stand back. I felt like I needed to be engaged. But I also felt in some small way that I needed to know what I was talking about on some of these issues, that I didn’t feel that I knew enough about the world to come to a conclusion,” she added. “It was extremely, really exhausting for me.” Preston ultimately left Yale after her sophomore year; she went to Latin America and learned Spanish, traveling to Mexico and the mountains of Peru. “I did see quite a bit of the world, as you can imagine.” Preston largely attributes her now-decades-long career as a journalist to those years she spent traveling. In 1998, she and her \u003cem\u003eNew York Times \u003c/em\u003ecolleagues \u003ca href=\"https://www.pulitzer.org/prize-winners-by-year/1998\"\u003ewon a Pulitzer Prize\u003c/a\u003e for their reporting on drug corruption in Mexico.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePreston returned to Yale four years after she left, and finished her degree in 1976. By then, the war was over, and the Yale she returned to was “a totally different campus—the political activism had just subsided completely.” But Preston’s most vivid memories of Yale, she told me, will always be of her first two years, of a campus and a generation that were rapidly transforming in more ways than the obvious one. “Our arrival at Yale was a step into a vortex of social change,” she told me, “of which coeducation was just one piece.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/QkoV566lFHQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/QkoV566lFHQ/","published":"2019-09-22T12:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-598216"},{"title":"The Press Is Embracing False Equivalence—Again","content":"\u003cp\u003eIf you’ve paid any attention to press retrospectives on the 2016 election, you’ve seen the term \u003cem\u003efalse equivalence\u003c/em\u003e.

It has a less obvious but very important advantage for news organizations, that of sparing reporters the burden of having to say, “Actually, we think this particular side is right.” By definition, most reporters most of the time are covering subjects in which we’re not expert. Is the latest prime-rate move by the Fed a good idea? Or a bad one? I personally couldn’t tell you. So if I am covering the story, especially on a deadline, I’ll want to give you quotes from people “on both sides,” and leave it there.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor as long as the press has existed, people have pointed out the limits and loopholes of “let’s hear from both sides” structural thinking. Back in the 1970s, I read a parody somewhere of how stately D.C.-based discussion shows might have covered the 1930s: “And now, for a contrasting view, we turn to Heinrich Himmler.” (In \u003cem\u003eThe Washington Monthly\u003c/em\u003e of that era, Art Levine \u003ca href=\"https://washingtonmonthly.com/2009/11/01/arthur-levine-on-woodward-and-bernstein/\"\u003edid a famous parody\u003c/a\u003e of a \u003ca href=\"https://delong.typepad.com/egregious_moderation/2009/10/art-levine-woodward-and-bernstein-on-the-final-days-of-the-third-reich.html\"\u003eWoodward-and-Bernstein approach\u003c/a\u003e to that same story: “‘The Jews, Mein Fuhrer, what’s happened to all the Jews?’ Goering asked. ‘There used to be so many of them’… Himmler and Goering were beset with fresh doubts.

Is that the right way to present an imagined “controversy” over the fundamental science of climate change now? Obviously I’d say no on both counts. But my point for the moment is that the overlapping and always changing concepts of “balance,” “fairness,” and even “objectivity” are central, eternally debated issues within the news media. It’s like a debate among doctors on whether surgical or nonsurgical treatment is overall a “better” approach. The answer is: It depends. I did a whole book on the difficulties of “balance” back in the 1990s, \u003cem\u003eBreaking the News\u003c/em\u003e, with \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1996/02/why-americans-hate-the-media/305060/?utm_source=feed\"\u003ea long excerpt\u003c/a\u003e published as a cover story in \u003cem\u003eThe\u003c/em\u003e \u003cem\u003eAtlantic. \u003c/em\u003eThe debate has gone on forever, and it will continue.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut there is a very specific application of these principles to the era of Donald Trump. The problem with Trump is that he is not like anyone else who has ever held the office. He lies with abandon; he uses public office for private gain on a scale never before witnessed; and he seems to have no respect for, or even interest in, the institutions of self-government to which all of his predecessors have at least paid lip service.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThus any of the “normal” procedural rules, applied to such an abnormal figure, can lead to destructive results. To be “fair” in covering him is to be unfair—to the truth, to history, to the readers, to any concept of journalistic purpose. The stuffy way to put this problem is “false equivalence.” The casual way to put it is “But what about her emails?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr class=\"c-section-divider\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e“What about her emails” is the watchword, because so much of the press wanted to apply “normal” and “balanced” rules to the contest in 2016 between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. In reality, these two were starkly dissimilar:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eDonald Trump had defects that were \u003cem\u003eunlike\u003c/em\u003e those of any previous major-party nominee. As an \u003cem\u003eAtlantic\u003c/em\u003e editorial put it, in recommending a vote against Trump (only the third endorsement from the magazine since its founding in 1857): “He is a demagogue, a xenophobe, a sexist, a know-nothing, and a liar. He is spectacularly unfit for office, and voters—the statesmen and thinkers of the ballot box—should act in defense of American democracy and elect his opponent.”\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\t\u003cli\u003eHillary Clinton had defects that were \u003cem\u003elike\u003c/em\u003e those of other previous nominees. Naturally, they were different in detail, since every candidate is unique (all the more so for her, as the first female major-party nominee), but they were similar in scale. Some people liked her, some people didn’t. Some trusted and were inspired by her; others thought she was completely untrustworthy and insincere. She had two political problems entirely different in nature, connected only by the word \u003cem\u003eemail\u003c/em\u003e. One was the WikiLeaks-and-Russian-engineered hacking of Democratic Party emails, via her campaign chair John Podesta’s email account. The other was her own use of a private email server.\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese two specific failings of Clinton’s—with no connection in substance, but subsumed by “the email question”—will, in any historical reckoning, seem of the mundane, “every campaign has its problems” scale. I am aware of zero evidence, from anyone, that any of the private-server emails ever had a damaging impact on U.S. security or national interest. Every candidate has his or her flaws and mistakes; these were among hers. They could be handled by “normal” press means.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut because the instinct toward structural balance is so powerful in the press—and because several institutions, notably NPR and \u003cem\u003eThe\u003c/em\u003e \u003cem\u003eNew York Times\u003c/em\u003e, seem so hyperaware of the criticism they receive for having a “liberal bias”—much of the press presented \u003cem\u003ethings that were not similar\u003c/em\u003e as if they were. For instance, on the one hand, there were deals and donations that could “raise questions” about the Clinton Foundation and Hillary Clinton’s own business life. On the other hand, Donald Trump flat-out refused to release his tax returns or any honest information about his business deals, so the public was unable to even get to the “raise questions” stage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn the merits, Donald Trump’s finances were a hundred times as suspicious as those of other candidates, and his statements about anything were a hundred times as likely to be false. But it went against the nature of most news organizations to run a hundred times as many articles about his lies and shadiness as his opponents’. Or even twice as many. By the time of the general election, it seemed “fairest” and most comfortable to aim for something more like 50-50.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen it came to Hillary Clinton, the clearest manifestation of that was vast over-coverage of “her emails,” most famously exemplified in this front page of \u003cem\u003eThe\u003c/em\u003e \u003cem\u003eNew York Times\u003c/em\u003e, 10 days before the election:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" height=\"387\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2017/09/nytsat_1/d6776e67c.png\" width=\"409\"\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"caption\"\u003eThe front page of \u003cem\u003eThe New York Times\u003c/em\u003e the day after James Comey said he was looking into new evidence from Anthony Weiner’s cellphone.

As Tom Nichols laid out in his \u003cem\u003eAtlantic\u003c/em\u003e post on Saturday, “\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/09/trumps-ukraine-call-clear-impeachable-offense/598570/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eIf This Isn’t Impeachable, Nothing Is\u003c/a\u003e,” the evidence suggests that a sitting American president has used the power and resources of the U.S. government to apply extortion demands to foreign leaders, in hopes of pressuring them to interfere directly in a U.S. election.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\tWhether this is true, I don’t yet know.

To begin with, what has been alleged about his son Hunter in Ukraine may not be true at all. The details are extremely complicated, and (in an illustration of what reporters do when they’re not expert in a case themselves), I direct you to people who have gone into them. For instance, \u003ca href=\"https://www.balloon-juice.com/2019/09/21/ken-vogel-has-a-bullshit-story-to-tell-that-will-help-the-president-and-he-would-appreciate-it-if-the-president-and-rudy-giuliani-would-shut-up-because-they-are-screwing-up-his-work/\"\u003ethis analysis by Adam Silverman\u003c/a\u003e, in \u003cem\u003eBalloon Juice\u003c/em\u003e, and these three from Bloomberg: “\u003ca href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-16/ukraine-prosecutor-says-no-evidence-of-wrongdoing-by-bidens\"\u003eUkraine Prosecutor Says No Evidence of Wrongdoing by Bidens\u003c/a\u003e,” “\u003ca href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-07/timeline-in-ukraine-probe-casts-doubt-on-giuliani-s-biden-claim\"\u003eTimeline in Ukraine Probe Casts Doubt on Giuliani’s Biden Claim\u003c/a\u003e,” and “\u003ca href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-20/trump-giuliani-press-for-dirt-on-biden-despite-ukraine-rebuff\"\u003eTrump, Giuliani Press for Dirt on Biden Despite Ukraine Rebuff\u003c/a\u003e.”\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\tFrom these stories, it looks to me as if the Hunter Biden/Ukraine “scandal” is perhaps invented, and probably exaggerated. But let’s not even go that far. Let’s assume, for argument, that the very worst version of the story is true: that Joe Biden, as sitting vice president, did what he could to pressure a prosecutor in Ukraine who he thought might be interfering with Hunter Biden’s business deals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\tEven if that were true—and the evidence comes nowhere close to that—it would still be in an entirely different category from what Donald Trump appears to have done. Through modern history, relatives of presidents, vice presidents, and even senators have tried to turn their connections to profitable use. Search the family tree of virtually any president, and you will find black-sheep relatives—and cases roughly similar to this, even in its worst rendering. This is not even to mention the current president’s former campaign chair, now in federal prison for corruption charges involving (among others) the government of Ukraine.

But even if there were (again, I’m imagining this just for argument), it would be fundamentally like other abuse-of-power questions the press has tried to uncover over the years.

It\u0026#8217;s why she calls individual grassroots donors, often posting videos of the calls to social media after. It\u0026#8217;s why she engages with individual supporters online. And it\u0026#8217;s why she spends hours taking selfies after every event. Her campaign has prioritized building individual connections with specific voters, and\u0026mdash;more importantly\u0026mdash;creating tiny pieces of organic digital content that those grassroots supporters then blast to their own social media networks to express their support. On the day Roof stood in line to wait for her selfie with the Senator, Warren took her 60,000th selfie, according to the campaign.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv dir=\"auto\"\u003e\u0026#8220;The selfie lines are a chance for people to get in a question, talk about issues that matter to them, or pass her a note they really want her to read,\u0026#8221; says Warren spokeswoman Saloni Sharma. \u0026#8220;We\u0026rsquo;re building a grassroots movement, person to person, face to face.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv dir=\"auto\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv dir=\"auto\"\u003eWarren emerged at the top of the polls in Iowa for the first time in a new Des Moines Register/CNN \u003ca href=\"https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/iowa-poll/2019/09/22/iowa-poll-election-2020-iowa-caucus-elizabeth-warren-joe-biden-bernie-sanders-democrat-candidates/2370015001/\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003epoll Saturday night\u003c/a\u003e, which found that 22% of likely Democratic caucusgoers list her as their first choice, and 32% of voters who caucused for Bernie Sanders in 2016 plan to caucus for her.\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCandidates snapping selfies with voters is not new.

The Warren selfies are designed to be widely shared, and are particularly popular among younger voters who live most of their lives on social media. In interviews with supporters who waited in line to take selfies with Warren in Iowa on Thursday and Friday, most said they planned to post it on Instagram or Facebook, and a TIME review of their social media accounts suggests that they usually posted the photo almost immediately, where it quickly gained likes and comments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe strategy seems tailor-made to address one of the most vexing problems of Hillary Clinton\u0026#8217;s campaign.

And it\u0026#8217;s why she spends hours taking selfies after every event. Her campaign has prioritized building individual connections with specific voters, and\u0026mdash;more importantly\u0026mdash;creating tiny pieces of organic digital content that those grassroots supporters then blast to their own social media networks to express their support.

The move, says the outlet, \u0026#8220;would allow him to stay stay at the company he built into one of the country’s most valuable startups, but inject fresh leadership to pursue an IPO that would bring We the cash it needs to keep up its torrid growth.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe WSJ and Bloomberg are reporting that it is \u003ca class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/softbank\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"softbank\"\u003eSoftBank \u003cspan class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e specifically that wants Neumann to step down. Neither WeWork nor SoftBank is commenting publicly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#8217;s a fascinating development, the kind we saw when Uber\u0026#8217;s board successfully forced cofounder and longtime CEO \u003ca class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/person/travis-kalanick\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"travis-kalanick\"\u003eTravis Kalanick \u003cspan class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e to abandon his role as CEO. Still, we\u0026#8217;d caution against drawing too close a comparison. While the venture firm Benchmark, which spearheaded Kalanick\u0026#8217;s ouster, stood to lose billions of dollars if Kalanick dragged down Uber and continued to push off an IPO, Benchmark was not in a do-or-die situation because of its Uber investment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoftBank appears to be in more dire straights, making this standoff a particularly meaningful one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet\u0026#8217;s back up a minute first, though, and consider who is involved and which way this could potentially go. A few days ago,  Business Insider put together a useful \u003ca href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/meet-weworks-board-of-directors-thatll-advise-ceo-adam-neumann-2019-9#bruce-dunlevie-is-the-founding-partner-of-venture-capital-firm-benchmark-3\"\u003echeat sheet\u003c/a\u003e about WeWork\u0026#8217;s board members that may hint at their allegiance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1.) Ronald Fisher \u0026#8212; who is vice chairman at SoftBank Group after founding SoftBank Capital, a U.S. venture arm of SoftBank \u0026#8212; joined SoftBank\u0026#8217;s board last year.  He oversees 114 class A shares, each of which carries one vote. Obviously, he\u0026#8217;s going to side with SoftBank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2.) Lewis Frankfort \u0026#8212; the chairman of a fitness studio chain called Flywheel Sports \u0026#8212; has been a board member of WeWork for roughly five years, and BI says WeWork once loaned him $6.3 million, which he repaid in interest earlier this year. We have to think he\u0026#8217;d stick with Neumann out of loyalty. At the same time, he doesn\u0026#8217;t wield much power unless he has the right to \u003ca href=\"https://www.startuplawblog.com/2009/03/21/what-rights-come-with-preferred-stock/\"\u003eblock significant actions at the company\u003c/a\u003e (some shareholders get these blocking rights; some don\u0026#8217;t.)  What he know: he controls 2 million shares, and 750,000 of them are Class B shares that carry 10 votes each.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e3.) Benchmark, which first backed WeWork in 2012, is represented on the board by Bruce Dunlevie, the founding partner of the venture firm. Benchmark owns 32.6 million Class A shares, and could go either way, seemingly. On the one hand, Benchmark doesn\u0026#8217;t want to establish a \u003ca href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/11/what-was-benchmark-thinking/\"\u003ereputation for pushing out founders\u003c/a\u003e after the Kalanick debacle, and if it supports SoftBank over Neumann, it risks this exact thing happening. On the other hand, Benchmark might not want to battle with SoftBank if it thinks it has staying power or it\u0026#8217;s concerned (suddenly) that it allowed Neumann to amass too much control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e4.) Harvard Business School professor Frances Frei was brought in \u003ca href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/wework-adds-former-uber-executive-frances-frei-to-board-2019-9\"\u003eroughly a minute ago\u003c/a\u003e to add a much-need sprinkling of gender diversity to WeWork\u0026#8217;s all-male board. Frei\u0026#8217;s name first came to be more broadly recognized when she was hired to help address Uber\u0026#8217;s battered culture, so presumably she has ties to Benchmark. We\u0026#8217;d guess she\u0026#8217;ll side with Dunlevie, meaning that we have no idea whose side she will take.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e5.) Steven Langman, the cofounder of private equity firm Rhône Group, has ties that go back a ways with Neumann, and he has benefited richly from the association, seemingly. According to an \u003ca href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/investors-ties-to-wework-raise-conflict-of-interest-concerns-11566903601\"\u003eApril story\u003c/a\u003e in the WSJ, Langman met Neumann through a shared rabbi in its earlier days and joined the board in 2012. He also invested in the company (he owns 2.28 million shares in the company, according to a bond filing). Langman is on both the company\u0026#8217;s compensation committee and its succession committee. He also runs a real-estate investment vehicle in partnership with We that buys and develops buildings to then lease back to the co-working company, despite that it raises conflict-of-interest questions. We\u0026#8217;d guess he\u0026#8217;s on Team Neumann.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e6.) John Zhao is the chairman and CEO of Hony Capital, which partnered with SoftBank and WeWork to create a \u003ca href=\"https://venturebeat.com/2017/07/27/wework-grabs-500-million-investment-to-expand-its-shared-work-spaces-across-china/\"\u003estandalone entity\u003c/a\u003e called WeWork China back in 2017, and Hony has subsequently \u003ca href=\"https://therealdeal.com/2018/07/26/wework-raises-500m-for-chinese-subsidiary/\"\u003epoured more capital\u003c/a\u003e into that subsidiary. We\u0026#8217;re not sure how close Zhao is to SoftBank, but if SoftBank brought Hony into WeWork, we\u0026#8217;re guessing he\u0026#8217;ll back the Japanese conglomerate on this one.

There’s not just the death toll: Last year, nearly 11,000 pedestrians were injured by cars in the city, according to the \u003ca href=\"https://www1.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/bicycle-crash-data-report-2018.pdf\"\u003eDepartment of Transportation\u003c/a\u003e, and the number of bikers hurt was close to 5,000. That’s not even a full accounting, because it’s based on reports to the New York Police Department; lots of biker and pedestrian injuries go unreported, because why bother? A few years ago, after I had to jump out of the way of a bus that still grazed me as it illegally turned into a crosswalk, a police officer on the scene asked me to not file a report — I assume because he didn’t want the hassle of the paperwork. I filed a report.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you regularly ride a bike, you know all too well the bloody story that soulless mortality spreadsheets don\u0026#8217;t convey. During any ride, there will likely be a couple of occasions on which, if you did not quickly brake for a car that illegally crossed into your path at an intersection, or did not shout at the oblivious pedestrian walking into your bike lane, or pull aside to avoid a biker going the wrong way, or swerve to avoid a suddenly opening car door, or notice the 5-inch pothole just ahead, you would end up as another digit in the statistical category that the city describes as KSI — which stands for “Killed or Seriously Injured.” I never expected that a phrase I often whispered to myself at the end of a busy day in a war zone — \u0026#8220;I could have died today\u0026#8221; — is one I continue to whisper at the end of a two-wheeled journey home. And I\u0026#8217;ve got it easy, because I don\u0026#8217;t ride a bike for a living, all day long, as legions of low-wage workers must do in the messenger and food-delivery trades.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026#8217;s a particularly demented nightmare that haunts the cyclists of New York City (or at least me): getting doored. That\u0026#8217;s what happens when you\u0026#8217;re biking on one of de Blasio\u0026#8217;s unprotected lanes, and someone in a stationary car, just inches to your side, opens their door without bothering to check whether a cyclist is coming. You were riding along and following the rules and trusting de Blasio\u0026#8217;s encouragements to ride a bike in the great metropolis of New York when suddenly, like a flipper in a pinball machine — but this isn\u0026#8217;t a pinball machine, it\u0026#8217;s a street, and it\u0026#8217;s your life — a door opens and smacks into you. The injuries you suffer at that moment can be quite severe, but the worst may be just ahead. When cyclists are doored by parked cars, they tend to fall into the street, where they can get run over by a moving vehicle. In New York, \u003ca href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/what-is-nyc-doing-to-prevent-cyclists-from-getting-fatally-doored-basically-nothing\"\u003eeight cyclists\u003c/a\u003e have been doored to death since 2014.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cu\u003eThere’s a point\u003c/u\u003e of commonality between the chaos of New York biking and the mayhem of far-flung war zones. Chaos is not a condition that just happens like an act of God or magic. It must be created. Societies are not always or naturally at war – most are at peace most of the time, if not all the time. When war happens, it is largely the product of decisions and actions by powerful leaders who create the destabilization required for hostilities to break out. That is what is happening in the streets of New York under the neglectful and hypocritical rule of Mayor de Blasio.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen de Blasio was elected mayor in 2013, he inherited a city that was quickly moving to a future much more free of cars than its past, thanks to the surprisingly forward-looking policies of his predecessor, the billionaire Michael Bloomberg, who was terrible in most ways but was great on the issue of cars, pedestrians, and bikes. Bloomberg, who famously took the subway a fair amount (de Blasio \u003ca href=\"https://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/ny-de-blasio-green-new-deal-gym-trips-20190422-7gqhy4dqufdlbonxc57sasexyq-story.html\"\u003eprefers his city-provided SUV\u003c/a\u003e), infuriated drivers and businesses by speeding up the installation of bike lanes and, among other things, turning Times Square into a \u003ca href=\"https://www.amny.com/opinion/editorial/times-square-pedestrian-walkway-walkable-anniversary-1.32745180\"\u003epedestrian-friendly zone\u003c/a\u003e — a move that has ended up being immensely successful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBike lanes have expanded in de Blasio’s time but at a shameful pace and in a frankly dangerous way. Most new lanes are not protected. Instead of a firm barrier that moving cars are unable to cross, all that separates bike riders from their deaths is a painted line or a plastic stick every 20 or 30 yards. This has been referred to as a “paint and pray” policy: painting bike lanes and praying nobody will get hurt. It might be sufficient if several other things existed that do not.

Often the vehicles, rather than being stationary in the lane, are moving into it. Not long ago, I was riding in an unprotected lane near Union Square in Manhattan and a truck cut into it, forcing me to the curb to save my life. “This is a bike lane,” I shouted at the driver, to which he yelled back, “I don’t fucking care.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs an excellent \u003ca href=\"https://jalopnik.com/vision-zero-is-the-wrong-goal-1837376396\"\u003earticle by Aaron Gordon in Jalopnik\u003c/a\u003e noted about unprotected lanes, “Instead of directing cyclists to a few carefully designed, safe, protected routes, it spreads them out among dozens of lazy, dangerous, and haphazard ‘bike lanes’ inviting conflict.” Honestly, it feels like the de Blasio administration is luring us into a trap: \u003cem\u003e\u0026#8220;Here\u0026#8217;s a new bike lane, please come and use it, you\u0026#8217;re going to love it, ha ha ha.\u0026#8221; \u003c/em\u003eBut don’t take my word for it.

The moment I get off a bike I have to keep an eye out for cyclists – the ones who ride on the sidewalks, the ones who ride the wrong way on a street, the ones who speed through crosswalks. Bikers can be assholes. The nearest I came to an accident in recent months was when a guy on an electric bike came roaring at me going the wrong way in a protected lane. I swerved to avoid a crash and shouted at him, prompting him to turn around and threaten to punch me out. The guy was maybe 20 years old and totally high, but I found a way to shame him from actual violence. “I’m 59 years old,” I announced. “And you want to take me on? Really? Really?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut let’s remember a key thing: Asshole cyclists are not the main problem. Last year, car drivers killed 115 pedestrians in New York City, while bicycle riders killed zero.

The problem is the absence of an infrastructure that gives bikers, pedestrians, and even delivery trucks what they need so they don’t go to war against each other for the rat-infested crumbs of asphalt the city has them fighting over. Cyclists need protected lanes and prioritized lights all over the city. Give that to them and they won’t swarm the sidewalks, they won’t drive the wrong way all the time, and they won’t go through intersections when they shouldn’t. Give pedestrians the wide and safe sidewalks they need, the benches their weary legs desire, the trees that make shade in the summer, and calm streets in which the majority of space is devoted to the majority of people who are not in private cars. This has been proven to work — it\u0026#8217;s not a risky leap, it\u0026#8217;s been\u003ca href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90367664/these-are-the-20-best-cities-for-biking-in-the-world\"\u003e ridiculously successful \u003c/a\u003ein cities across the world, particularly in Europe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis isn’t happening, and instead we’re pitted against each other. Honestly, I don’t hate the truck drivers parking in bike lanes; they are victims too. They can’t afford to not park there. The city — meaning Mayor de Blasio — has given them no choice, because so much curb space is taken up by parked cars. And their bosses at UPS, FedEx, and Amazon haven’t given them a choice, either: How can low-wage drivers possibly meet an unrealistic quota of deliveries unless they break the law and park in bike lanes? It’s time to wake up and realize this is a new sort of class warfare on the streets of our city. Let’s unite against our political and corporate bosses, not squabble among ourselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet’s also remember that this should not be turned into a law enforcement problem addressed primarily by giving the NYPD yet more power over our lives. This is a design problem. The streets are chaotic and dangerous because they are badly configured, and there are too many cars, not because the NYPD isn\u0026#8217;t handing out enough tickets. If protected bike lanes are built and more streets are designed so that private cars cannot travel on them or are discouraged from doing so, there will be no need to pray that the NYPD will do the right thing (after all, they have shown little interest in doing much with the powers they have — just go on Twitter and perform a search using the phrase \u0026#8220;\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=police%20parked%20in%20bike%20lane\u0026amp;src=typed_query\"\u003epolice parked in bike lane\u003c/a\u003e\u0026#8220;).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cu\u003eAm I overreacting?\u003c/u\u003e Well, look at who’s doing the biking. About \u003ca href=\"https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170227/midtown/citibike-cycling-route-gender-age-demographics/\"\u003e75 percent\u003c/a\u003e of the riders of Citi Bike, the bike sharing program in New York, are male. A lot of women do not feel comfortable riding bikes in this city, and that’s fundamentally unfair. And look at the ages of the males who ride: Most are relatively young. I rarely see bikers who are old enough, as I am, to shame 20-somethings into not punching them. It’s \u0026#8220;Logan’s Run\u0026#8221; out there, and it’s a vast discrimination against anyone who is not a man in the physical prime of his life. This is a tragedy because New York City is ideal for short hops on bikes by people of all genders and ages, including children; it’s a flat and high-density city. Yet since 2014, the number of bike riders \u003ca href=\"https://www1.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/cycling-in-the-city.pdf\"\u003ehas fundamentally stalled\u003c/a\u003e; nobody new is showing up to the party, because the word is out that it\u0026#8217;s not a party, it\u0026#8217;s a death race.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA final word, if I may, for Mayor de Blasio and his central role in \u003cem\u003enot\u003c/em\u003e doing the one big thing that is within his power to save the planet.

He has made some helpful changes, like announcing new guidelines on pollution levels for buildings. But these are the easy things.

Afinal de contas, o ex-banqueiro João Amoêdo não fundou o Novo para combater a desigualdade social, racial e regional do país, mas para garantir as políticas liberais que mantenham seus privilégios históricos. O partido Novo não tem interesse em ser plural e representativo de outros setores da sociedade. Apesar do canto dessa sereia liberal ser diferente, não há nada de novo sob o sol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eO grande trunfo que o Novo gosta de ostentar é a \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/partidonovo30/status/1153688607498153984\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eredução de custos dos gabinetes\u003c/a\u003e dos seus políticos.

Os seus donos desprezam esse conceito. Não são os filiados que ajudam construir coletivamente o partido. A escolha dos candidatos, por exemplo, não passa por um debate amplo entre os seus membros. São os ex-banqueiros da cúpula partidária que escolhem através de um processo seletivo com critérios empresariais. É como se o partido fosse uma startup de Amoêdo, que introduziu essa lógica antidemocrática e a apresentou como um diferencial em relação à velha política. Mas é uma aberração que torna o partido ainda menos democrático em relação aos tradicionais. Em vez dos caciques partidários, teremos os CEOs do Novo decidindo o destino do partido.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePara ser candidato a prefeito ou a vereador pelo partido, por exemplo, os interessados são obrigados a pagar de \u003ca href=\"https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/09/novo-quer-escolher-candidato-a-dedo-e-cobra-ate-r-4000-para-processo-de-selecao.shtml\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eR$ 2 mil a R$ 4 mil\u003c/a\u003e para participar da seleção. Ou seja, o partido colocou uma barreira interna para evitar que gente pobre alcance voos mais altos na política. Que processo seletivo rigoroso, não é mesmo? A justificativa de Amoêdo para a cobrança da taxa é formidável: “É difícil imaginar que alguém com competência para ser prefeito de uma grande cidade não tenha R$ 4 mil. Espera-se experiência de vida e gestão de si próprio”. Segundo Amoedo, quem não tem R$ 4 mil para investir não tem capacidade de gerir a si próprio, quanto mais ser prefeito de uma cidade. Para o ex-banqueiro, o pobre falhou na gestão da sua vida e, por isso, não tem condição de entrar para o seu clubinho. É o mundo maravilhoso da meritocracia em que só gente refinada e competente como Ricardo Salles e Zema podem entrar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNão há nada de novo quando ricos se mobilizam para defender interesses dos ricos excluindo os mais pobres do processo. O que há é apenas um reposicionamento de marca. Na prática, o Novo age do mesmo modo que a velha elite financeira agiu na ditadura militar: fechando os olhos para as atrocidades da extrema direita contra o povo e a democracia em nome da defesa dos seus interesses econômicos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe post \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/09/22/o-partido-novo-que-nasceu-velho-e-tao-extremista-como-bolsonaro/\"\u003eO partido Novo que nasceu velho é tão extremista como Bolsonaro\u003c/a\u003e appeared first on \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com\"\u003eThe Intercept\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://theintercept.com/2019/09/22/o-partido-novo-que-nasceu-velho-e-tao-extremista-como-bolsonaro/","published":"2019-09-22T12:49:42Z","guid":"https://theintercept.com/?p=269238"},{"title":"For a Puerto Rican Community in a FEMA Flood Zone, Disaster Funds Promise Little Relief","content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cu\u003eColorful houses line\u003c/u\u003e the winding streets of the San Isidro neighborhood of Canóvanas, Puerto Rico, some missing walls or windows, others with roofs that are partially caved in.

Instead, the only option for relief will be to relocate. That’s because the HUD funds come attached to a new FEMA flood map that designates more than 250,000 homes across Puerto Rico as virtually ineligible for reconstruction because of their susceptibility to flooding. Another portion of the HUD money will go to flood mitigation, but those funds won’t be available until long after relocations have begun.

href=\"https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/un-climate-summit-2019.shtml\"\u003eUnited Nations Climate Action Summit\u003c/a\u003e this Monday, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has repeatedly warned countries that they need more than empty promises to fight climate change. “Don’t come to the summit with beautiful speeches,” Guterres said at a press conference last month. “Come with concrete plans ... and strategies for carbon neutrality by 2050.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"hQCsHc\"\u003eGuterres has convened the gathering of world leaders ahead of the United Nations General Assembly, which begins Tuesday, to secure more ambitious commitments to curb greenhouse gas emissions than those made in 2015 during the signing of the \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2017/6/1/15724162/trump-paris-climate-agreement-explained-briefly\"\u003eParis climate agreement\u003c/a\u003e. Already, several countries have said they will increase those commitments, known as Nationally Determined Contributions, according to the \u003ca href=\"https://www.climatewatchdata.org/ndcs-enhancements\"\u003e2020 NDC Tracker\u003c/a\u003e, just released by the World Resources Institute, an environmental think tank in Washington, DC.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"9bLzGp\"\u003eParis signatories knew that their NDCs would not be sufficient to meet the agreement’s goal: limiting temperature rise to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius and preferably to 1.5˚C. The expectation was that they would ramp up their commitments over time, with the next round of NDCs expected in 2020. Next year is also when countries are expected to release their frameworks for reaching carbon neutrality by 2050. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"11z6FK\"\u003eSince the Paris agreement, a few countries, including \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/7/17/17568190/costa-rica-renewable-energy-fossil-fuels-transportation\"\u003eCosta Rica\u003c/a\u003e, have begun to transition off of fossil fuels in earnest, and renewable energy has become \u003ca href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/solar-wind-power-cheap-outgrowing-100016234.html\"\u003edramatically cheaper\u003c/a\u003e.

But the UN is denying the spotlight to countries that are building or financing new fossil fuel power plants or are neglecting their emissions commitments. The US, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and Japan are among the countries excluded from speaking. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"XNgztc\"\u003e“Only the boldest and most transformative actions [will] make the stage,” Amina Mohammed, the UN deputy secretary-general, told the \u003ca href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1902158a-d994-11e9-8f9b-77216ebe1f17\"\u003eFinancial Times\u003c/a\u003e. “We will see on Monday who is stepping up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"dnPgxC\"\u003eIt may be difficult to raise the bar for fighting climate change when many countries are barely clearing the current benchmarks. But with time rapidly running out to curb emissions enough to stay within warming targets, the urgency is only growing. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Xwg9ii\"\u003eHere are three key questions to follow during the climate action summit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"RIHzUj\"\u003eHow much more money will wealthy countries commit to the Green Climate Fund and other funding partnerships?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"m62Mij\"\u003eThe fundamental injustice of climate change is that the many of the wealthiest countries in the world have historically emitted the most greenhouse gas emissions, but the poorest who contributed least to the problem stand to suffer the most. That includes island nations like the Bahamas facing rising seas and fiercer storms like Hurricane Dorian, or countries in Southeast Asia \u003ca href=\"http://blogs.edf.org/climate411/2019/01/24/heatwaves-to-become-more-deadly-and-increase-global-inequality/\"\u003esuffering from extreme heat waves\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"K1CIXl\"\u003eDeveloped countries may be able to transition toward clean energy on their own, but a problem like climate change demands action from every country, and emerging economies are a growing source of greenhouse gas emissions. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"OBInoG\"\u003eThe UN has created a number of mechanisms to help correct this discrepancy: The UN \u003ca href=\"https://www.greenclimate.fund/home\"\u003eGreen Climate Fund\u003c/a\u003e, the reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation program aka \u003ca href=\"https://redd.unfccc.int/\"\u003eREDD+\u003c/a\u003e, and the \u003ca href=\"https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-kyoto-protocol/mechanisms-under-the-kyoto-protocol/the-clean-development-mechanism\"\u003eClean Development Mechanism\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"9Lu35F\"\u003eThese programs take funding from one group of countries and use it to finance tactics that mitigate climate change in other parts of the world like renewable energy deployment, forest restoration, and sustainable agriculture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"1DhuQi\"\u003eThey’re critical to ensuring that climate change progress in one country isn’t overwhelmed by backsliding in others. So it’s worth paying attention to see how much more developed economies are willing to contribute to these programs. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"a6x4fV\"\u003e“At the summit there is some expectation that other countries will make announcements about their readiness to increase their contributions,” said David Waskow, director of the International Climate Initiative at the World Resources Institute.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"7upjT6\"\u003eThe Green Climate Fund is now in its second round of replenishment, and already countries like the United Kingdom and France have pledged to double their contributions. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"n6baUd\"\u003eWealthier countries have also recently used the threat of revoking funding from other countries that aren’t upholding their environmental commitments. Germany and Norway recently threatened to withhold their contributions to the \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/8/30/20835091/amazon-rainforest-fire-wildfire-bolsonaro\"\u003eAmazon Fund\u003c/a\u003e, which supports rainforest restoration projects, because of Brazil’s lax enforcement of environmental protections. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"rfnVFh\"\u003eThe summit could be an opportunity for laying the foundations of a broader international carbon trading market. This could drive more aggressive climate mitigation efforts around the world under the \u003ca href=\"https://www.wri.org/blog/2019/06/why-does-paris-climate-agreement-need-rulebook-7-questions-and-answers\"\u003eParis rulebook\u003c/a\u003e, which lays out the details of implementing the Paris agreement. But such a mechanism would require rigorous accounting to ensure progress and coordinating rules among countries, which requires even more diplomatic wrangling to sort out. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"f2s4WE\"\u003eWhat will China and India bring to the table?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"DxznAt\"\u003eChina is the number one greenhouse gas emitter in the world. The US is second, and India is third. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"xt4ooB\"\u003eIndian and Chinese leaders often bristle at being grouped with the US because they have much larger populations, so their per capita emissions are much lower. In fact, both countries are roughly on track with their NDCs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Au8yC0\"\u003eBut to limit global warming to safer levels, total emissions must go down. And that means China and India have to make massive changes to their energy systems, especially since both countries are growing in population and experiencing a rising standard of living.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"COzJ3g\"\u003eIndian and Chinese leaders are expected to speak at the summit, so it’s likely that they will be making some new commitments to limit their greenhouse gases. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ma5x4S\"\u003eUN special envoy on climate change Luis Alfonso de Alba told \u003ca href=\"https://www.climatechangenews.com/2019/09/11/un-confident-china-plans-raise-climate-ambition/?utm_campaign=Carbon%20Brief%20Daily%20Briefing\u0026amp;utm_medium=email\u0026amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter\"\u003eClimate Home News\u003c/a\u003e that he was “very confident that China will come to the summit with a clear commitment on a number of areas … with a much higher level of ambition.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"plULSO\"\u003eAnd according to \u003ca href=\"https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/india/\"\u003eClimate Action Tracker\u003c/a\u003e, India is one of the few countries in the world whose greenhouse gas goals are in line with the 2 degree Celsius warming limit in the Paris agreement. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"JrWZSH\"\u003eBut both countries are still deploying new fossil fuel power generators, and both countries are likely to ask for more \u003ca href=\"https://www.climatechangenews.com/2019/09/17/china-india-demand-cash-climate-action-eve-un-summit/\"\u003einternational financing\u003c/a\u003e to meet their climate change goals. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"Ch506r\"\u003eHow seriously are countries taking their own obligations under the Paris agreement?\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"TGjVqg\"\u003eAt the climate actions summit, major corporations, banks, cities, and local governments are also going to to announce their own plans to fight climate change. This will likely take the form of binding net-zero emissions targets, renewable energy deployments, divestment, and clean energy financing. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"nMpLRz\"\u003eSuch commitments can reduce a significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions, but the real action still has to come from heads of state. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Xv2Q7c\"\u003e“At the end of the day the UN summit has to fundamentally be about what national governments do. In the center ring is what leaders themselves are going to do,” Waskow said. “What we’re looking for is very strong signals that countries are ready to strengthen their actions.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"wRhfnT\"\u003eSome countries have drastically enhanced their climate goals in the last year beyond their own NDCs.

السياسيون يكسحون الانتخابات الرئاسيّة التونسيّة","content":"\u003cp\u003eBy Sharan Grewal\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eتوافد التونسيون إلى مراكز الاقتراع يوم الأحد للتصويت في ثاني انتخابات رئاسية حرّة وعادلة لهم. وكانت الانتخابات تنافسية للغاية، فلم يحظَ أيّ مرشّح من المرشحّين الكُثر البالغ عددهم 26 شخصاً بأكثر من 20 في المئة من الأصوات. وستُعلَن النتائج الرسمية يوم الثلاثاء، لكنّ استطلاعات رأي المقترعين التي أجرتها سيغما كونساي وأمرود كونسلتينغ تشير إلى فوزٍ مفاجئ لدخيلَين سياسيَّين هما قيس سعيّد ونبيل القروي. وعلى الأرجح أن يتنافس هذان الشخصان في جولة انتخابات ثانية لم يُحدَّد موعدها بعد.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eوشكّل الفوز (غير الرسمي) لسعيّد والقروي، وكلاهما جديد نوعاً ما على الساحة السياسية، صفعة للتحالف الحاكم، المُمثَّل برئيس الوزراء يوسف الشاهد ووزير الدفاع عبد الكريم الزبيدي ورئيس مجلس النوّاب عبد الفتّاح مورو. بيد أنّ الهزيمة السياسية للمؤسّسة السياسية كانت تلوح في الأفق منذ زمن. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eتصويت ضدّ النظام\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eكما قُلت في فبراير، كانت الظروف في تونس مؤاتية لبروز دخلاء شعبويّين. فبعد مرور ثماني سنوات على الربيع العربي، فشلت حكومات تونس المتعاقبة على تحقيق طلب الثورة الأساسي: الفرص الاقتصادية. فمن جميع النواحي تقريباً، غدا الوضع الاقتصادي أسوأ من الوضع الذي أدّى إلى ثورة العام 2011. فالبطالة التي بلغت 12-13 في المئة تقريباً قبل الثورة وصلت إلى 18 في المئة في العام 2011 وما زالت نسبتها 15 في المئة اليوم. كذلك، تضاعف التضخّم إلى 7 في المئة بعدما كان 3-4 في المئة قبل الثورة. أما معدّل النمو الاقتصادي الذي حقّق نسبة 5 في المئة تقريباً قبل الثورة فبالكاد يصل إلى 2 في المئة اليوم.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eوقد ساهمت هذه الظروف الاقتصادية الصعبة في زيادة الإحباط ليس حيال الأحزاب الحاكمة فحسب بل حيال النظام السياسي برمّته أيضاً. فقد وضع دستور العام 2014 نظاماً شبه رئاسي تتوزّع بموجبه السلطة بين الرئيس ورئيس الحكومة، فكان نظاماً منقسماً أفضى إلى خمس سنوات من الحوكمة البطيئة والحلول المرتكزة على المساومة. في غضون ذلك، ازدادت التصوّرات بالفساد وتقهقَر الدعم للديمقراطية.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eنوعان من الشعبوية\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eتمكّن قيس سعيّد ونبيل القروي كلاهما من الاستفادة من هذا الإحباط، لكن بطريقتَين مختلفتين شديد الاختلاف. وبحلول أبريل 2019، كانا كلاهما في الطليعة في الاستطلاعات قبل الانتخابات.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eحاول قيس سعيّد، البالغ من العمر 61 سنة، استعطاف الشباب عبر إطلاق وعد بنظام جديد، نظام تكون فيه السلطة ذات طابع مركزي أقلّ، \u0026#8220;لكي تصل إرادة اشعب إلى السلطة المركزية وتُنهي الفساد\u0026#8221;. ويقترح سعيّد، وهو أستاذ قانون دستوري في جامعة تونس، إجراء إصلاحات دستورية واسعة، من ضمنها منح القدرة للتونسيين على عزل نوّابهم. وادّعى أنّ \u0026#8220;عصر الديمقراطية البرلمانية قد ولّى\u0026#8221;، واقترح إلغاء الانتخابات البرلمانية لصالح مقاربة \u0026#8220;من أسفل إلى أعلى\u0026#8221; يتمّ فيها اختيار النواب من المجالس المحلّية المنتَخبة.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eمن خلال هذه الإصلاحيات البنيوية، يأمل سعيّد أن يعيد السلطة إلى الشعب. ويعوّل سعيّد على الإحباط الشعبي من أنّ ثورة العام 2010-2011 \u0026#8220;اختطفتها\u0026#8221; الأحزاب السياسية الفاسدة. في هذا المنحى، يُعتبر سعيّد \u0026#8220;شعبوياً\u0026#8221; لأنه يواجه النخبة السياسية لصالح الشعب. ولا شكّ في أنّه يتحلّى بالمصداقية اللازمة لإطلاق ادّعاء كهذا، فهو لم يتبوّأ منصباً سياسياً من قبل ولا ينتمي إلى أيّ حزب سياسي ولم يدلِ بصوته يوماً قبل يوم الأحد حتّى. وهو بالتالي دخيل سياسي بامتياز، مما يُكسبه النزاهة اللازمة لإطلاق تحدّ شعبوي.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eوبعيداً عن أجندة سعيّد، تكمن جاذبية هذا الرجل في شخصه. فقد لفت سعيّد المفكّر نظر الشعب في خلال وضع دستور العام 2014  بعدما ظهر مراراً على شاشة التلفزيون لتفسير جدالات قانونية معقدة بلغة فصحى رتيبة أشبه بالرجل الآلي، مما أكسبه كنية \u0026#8220;روبوكوب\u0026#8221; (الشرطي الروبوط). وتوحي شخصيّته التزهّدية (يتنقّل باستخدام النقل العام وتعهّد بالاستمرار بالعيش في منزله عوضاً عن الانتقال إلى القصر الرئاسي) بصورة رجل نزيه لن تفسده السلطة.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eفي المقابل، يلجأ نبيل القروي، الذي حلّ ثانياً في التصويت يوم الأحد، إلى شعبوية ذات صلة لكن من نوع مختلف. فالقروي، البالغ من العمر 55 سنة، هو رجل أعمال ناجح جداً في مجال الإعلام أسّس قناة نسمة مع سيلفيو بيرلوسكوني. ويصوّر القروي نفسه، على الرغم من ثروته، على أنّه مدافع عن التونسيين الفقراء و\u0026#8221;المَنسيّين\u0026#8221;، وهي سمعة اكتسبها من خلال استضافة برنامج خيري يدعى خليل تونس منذ العام 2017  (توقّف عن استضافته في يونيو تماشياً مع قانون الانتخابات). ووعد القروي بـ\u0026#8221;ثورة في صندوق الاقتراع\u0026#8221; لصالح \u0026#8220;تونس الأخرى\u0026#8221;، أي الملايين الذين أهملتهم المؤسّسة. وفي تباينٍ مع دولة اللامركزية التي ينادي بها سعيّد، يعد القروي ضمنياً بدولة قوية يمكنها استعادة النمو الاقتصادي وتأمين البضائع والخدمات للشعب.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eومع أنّ القروي وجه جديد في الترشّح للرئاسة، هو ليس بمبتدئ في السياسية. فقد انتهجت محطّته التلفزيونية، قناة نسمة، توجهاً سياسياً جداً في انتقاد حزب النهضة الإسلامي في خلال فترة حكومة الترويكا بين العامين 2011 و2013. بعد ذلك، أسّس القروي مع الرئيس الراحل باجي قايد السبسي حزب نداء تونس، ويُزعم أنّه استغلّ محطته التلفزيونية لمؤازرة ترشّح السبسي في انتخابات العام 2014. بالتالي، مع أنّه يتحلّى بالخبرة السياسية، ما زال قادراً على الظهور بصورة الدخيل السياسي الذي لم يتبوّأ منصباً سياسياً من قبل.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eومع بدء ازدياد الأصوات المؤيّدة للقروي في استطلاعات الرأي، بدا وكأنّ أحزاب المؤسّسة تتّحد لإضعاف ترشّحه. ففي يونيو، أقرّ البرلمان تعديلات في القانون الانتخابي كانت لتمنع القروي من الترشّح، لكنّ الرئيس الراحل السبسي لم يوقّعها. ومنذ تلك الآونة، تعرّض القروي للاعتقال والسجن بتهمتَي التهرّب الضريبي وتبييض الأموال، مما حَرمه من إجراء حملته أو الظهور في المناظرات الرئاسية المتلفزة الأولى في البلاد. ومع أنّ التهمتين بحقّه قد تكونان صحيحتَين، إذ أصدرتهما في العام 2016 مجموعة \u0026#8220;أنا يقظ\u0026#8221; التابعة لمنظمة الشفافية الدولية، سيّس توقيتُ الاعتقال التهمتَين وسمح لحملة القروي بالاستفادة منهما. فقد وصفت الحملة القروي كأوّل سجين سياسي في تونس منذ اندلاع الثورة وشبّهته بنلسون مانديلا واستغلّت عملية سجنه لكسب التعاطف وتعزيز فكرة أنّ القروي دخيلٌ جعلت منه المؤسّسة ضحية.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eباختصار، يمثّل سعيّد والقروي شكلَين هما على طرفَي نقيض من أشكال الشعبوية. فتَلقى طبيعةُ سعيّد الفكرية وأجندته الهادفة إلى \u0026#8220;منح السلطة للشعب\u0026#8221; تعاطفَ الحشود الشابّة المتعلّمة أكثر، ولا سيما الثورويين المخذولين. وبالفعل، تشير استطلاعات رأي المقترعين التي أجرتها سيغما كونساي إلى أنّه حقّق الأداء الأفضل في صفوف المقترعين الشباب من حملة الشهادات الجامعية الذي يصوّتون للمرّة الأولى. في المقابل، يحقّق القروي أداء جيداً في صفوف المصوّتين السابقين لحزب نداء تونس والمصوّتين الفقراء الريفيين، ولا سيّما أولئك الذين استفادوا من البرنامج الخيري. وتشير استطلاعات رأي المقترعين أنّ القروي فاز بقرابة 41 في المئة من أصوات المقترعين الذين لم يحظَوا بتعليم رسمي و30 في المئة من أصوات الذين حظَوا بتعليم ابتدائي فحسب.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eالمؤسّسة: خسارة معركة وليس الحرب\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eفيما شكّلت نتائج الانتخابات انتكاسة كبيرة للمؤسسة، هي تعطيها دروساً مهمّة في المستقبل. فقد كانت المؤسسة شديدة الانقسام بحلول فترة الانتخابات، مما أوجد فرصة للدخلاء بكسب كلا المركزين في الجولة الثانية من التصويت.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eما لا يقلّ عن ستّة مرشّحين أجروا حملات لما يمكننا تسميته \u0026#8220;مؤسسة علمانية\u0026#8221;، أي المجموعة التقديمة الحداثوية المرتبطة أساساً بحزب نداء تونس التابع للرئيس الراحل السبسي. وشمل هؤلاء المرشّحون رئيس الوزراء يوسف الشاهد ووزير الدفاع عبد الكريم الزبيدي والمديرة السابقة للديوان الرئاسي سلمى اللومي الرقيق ورئيس الوزراء السابق مهدي جمعة. وشكّل دعم محسن مرزوق وسليم الرياحي للزبيدي بداية، لكنّها لم تكن كافية أبداً لتوحيد هذا الصفّ. فكما لفت الشاهد بحدّ ذاته، على هذه الأحزاب أن توحّد قواها إن أرادت أن تبلي بلاء حسناً في الانتخابات النيابية في 6 أكتوبر.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eولعلّ المفاجأة الكبرى في هذه الانتخابات كانت الأداء الرديء لحزب النهضة، الحزب الإسلامي الذي أدّى دوراً في كلّ حكومة مُنتخَبة منذ ثورة العام 2011. وغالباً ما توقّع المراقبون أنّ ماكينة حزب النهضة الانتخابية يمكنها بشكل اعتيادي كسب 20-30 في المئة من الناخبين، بيد أنّ مرشح حزب النهضة عبد الفتاح مورو لم يفز سوى بنسبة 11 في المئة من الأصوات يوم الأحد. وإذا تكرّر أداء الحزب الضعيف في الانتخابات النيابية وإذا ارتأت القيادة أن تلقي اللوم على مساوماتها الكثيرة إزاء دور الدين وأهداف الثورة، سيكون لهذه الهزيمة تداعيات ضخمة على الطريقة التي يُموضِع فيها الحزب نفسه في المستقبل.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eفي المستقبل\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eستقام الجولة الثانية من التصويت بين قيس سعيّد ونبيل القروي في 29 سبتمبر أو 6 أكتوبر أو 13 أكتوبر، تبعاً لعدد الطعون الصادرة عن الجولة الأولى. لكنّ المستقبل ما زال غامض الملامح. فما زال القروي في السجن، وإذا تمّت إدانته قبل الجولة الثانية (أمر غير مرجّح لكن ممكن)، سيحلّ مكانه المرشّح في المرتبة الثالث، أي عبد الفتاح مورو من حزب النهضة. وإن لم تتمّ الإدانة، يمكن أن ينال القروي حصانة في حال فوزه بالانتخابات الرئاسية.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eوفي حال رست المنافسة على سعيّد والقروي في الجولة الثانية، ستشكّل الجهة التي تدعمها الأحزاب الخاسرة مؤشّراً مهمّاً للأداء الذي سيحقّقه كلّ مرشّح. فقد يستعطف سعيّد، المحافظ الاجتماعي والمؤيّد للثورة نسبياً، مقترعي حزب النهضة، فيما قد يستعطف القروي، المناهض للإسلامية والعضو السابق في حزب نداء تونس، المؤسسة العلمانية. فكلا سعيّد والقروي لم يكسب أكثر من 20 في المئة من الأصوات في الجولة الأولى، مما يجعل من مسألة كسب دعم الأحزاب والمرشّحين الآخرين أمراً غاية في الأهمّية للوصول إلى نسبة 50 في المئة.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eعلى الأقلّ بموجب الدستور الحالي، الانتخابات البرلمانية في 6 أكتوبر أهمّ بكثير من الانتخابات الرئاسية، لأنّ رئيس الوزراء، وهو الجهة الأقوى بين السلطتَين التنفيذيتين، يستقي سلطته من البرلمان. وقد سبق أن بدأت الحملة، لكنّ اللافت أنّ قيس سعيّد سيكون غائباً. فبدون حزب ينتمي إليه لن يحظى بتمثيل مباشر في البرلمان. أما قلب تونس، حزب القروي الذي تمّ تأسيسه حديثاً، فكان يتصدّر الاستطلاعات التي تسبق الانتخابات النيابية. ومع عمليّتَين انتخابيتين إضافيتين في الأسابيع القادمة، قد يكون زلزال تونس السياسي قد بدأ لتوّه.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2019/09/22/%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%af%d8%ae%d9%84%d8%a7%d8%a1-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b3%d9%8a%d8%a7%d8%b3%d9%8a%d9%88%d9%86-%d9%8a%d9%83%d8%b3%d8%ad%d9%88%d9%86-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%a7%d9%86%d8%aa%d8%ae%d8%a7%d8%a8%d8%a7%d8%aa/","published":"2019-09-22T08:16:16Z","guid":"https://www.brookings.edu/?p=613170"}]},{"url":"https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/world/rss","items":[]},{"url":"https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/world/feed","items":[{"title":"Hong

frontiers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The United States and the Israeli regime want to see discord among peoples in the Middle East region,” said the president at a parade of Armed Forces in the Iranian Capital, Tehran, marking the anniversary of the start of the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hegemonic powers led by the United States have always pursued the objective of creating insecurity, misery and problems, and looting the interests of the regional countries,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said Iran attaches great significance to security in the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We announce to the world that the presence of foreign forces is problematic for international waterways as well as shipping, oil and energy security,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“However, he noted, the Islamic Republic of Iran’s path is one of unity and coordination with regional countries,” said President

numerous efforts in the years following the 1979 Islamic Revolution of Iran to create insecurity, hatch plots to disintegrate the country, and assassinate top Iranian officials.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Enemies of the Revolution and the Iranian nation even didn’t settle for these acts, and conspired to undermine our security and defence foundations,” he added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The enemies’ first plot was to dissolve the Army, which was promoted by … mercenaries,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe then touched upon the 8-year Iraqi imposed war on Iran in the 1980s, which, he said, had Washington’s green light. He said the Iranian nation and military stood up to aggressors through unity and solidarity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe further touched upon accusations levelled by the enemies against Iran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“[The lies of] Those who want to attribute regional incidents to the Islamic Republic of Iran will be unmasked like all of their other lies which were exposed,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If they are really after peace and security, they should not send so much dangerous weapons to the region and not turn our region into an arms depot and [a place for] an arms race, and if they really want security for this region they should distance themselves from the region because the presence of all of them has amounted to hardship and disaster for the
