It quickly became apparent that there were huge advantages to allowing each person to do what they were naturally suited for and did best. (Imagine me doing payroll and Josh managing employee healthcare and it becomes obvious there is a better way). The idea of all of us doing everything quickly became each of us focusing on our individual strengths, with different areas of responsibility.

We understood the value of a basic indexing approach; we knew investor behavior and cognitive issues could be re-applied to help clients reach their goals; we understood the importance of integrating planning into asset management from day one. We pressed all of those forward to make managing client monies as simple and understandable as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe also were aware that our media footprint allowed us to spend less time and money marketing, enabling us to put more effort into client services.

It also helps when you have two pros (Erika \u0026amp; Patrick) running operations in ways that continually raise the bar.

There are trade errors, potential hires that didn’t work out, clients who might not be a great fit. Rather than dwell on mistakes, learn from them and get better. Build processes that have auto-correction built in – so errors are identified quickly, and your system learns (and the mistakes do not get repeated).

Mike and Kris took a chance with the two of us when we launched the firm; they became owners shortly afterwards. New employees have an opportunity to become equity owners after three years. We also built an automatic adjustment into employees\u0026#8217; compensation that increases as the firm\u0026#8217;s net revenue increases.

Forecasters generally have a terrible record at predicting recessions.  There are many reasons for this poor performance.  In 1987, economist Victor Zarnowitz wrote in \"\u003ca href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/w2099.pdf\"\u003eThe Record and Improvability of Economic Forecasting\u003c/a\u003e\" that there was too much reliance on trends, and\u0026nbsp;he also noted that\u0026nbsp;predictive failure was also due to forecasters' incentives. Zarnowitz wrote: \"predicting a general downturn is always unpopular and predicting it prematurely—ahead of others—may prove quite costly to the forecaster and his customers\".\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIncentives motivate \u003cb\u003eWall Street economic forecasters to always be optimistic\u003c/b\u003e about the future (just like stock analysts).  Of course, for the \u003cb\u003emedia and bloggers, there is an incentive to \u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003ealways be bearish,\u003c/b\u003e because bad news drives traffic (hence the prevalence of \u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_journalism\"\u003eyellow journalism\u003c/a\u003e).\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIn addition to paying attention to incentives, we also have to be careful not to rely \"heavily on the persistence of trends\".  One of the reasons I focus on residential investment (especially housing starts and new home sales) is residential investment is very cyclical and is frequently the best leading indicator for the economy.  UCLA's Ed Leamer went so far as to argue that: \"\u003ca href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/w13428\"\u003eHousing IS the Business Cycle\u003c/a\u003e\".  Usually residential investment leads the economy both into and out of recessions.  The most recent recovery was an exception, but it was fairly easy to predict a sluggish recovery without a contribution from housing.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSince I started this blog in January 2005, I've been pretty lucky on calling the business cycle.\u0026nbsp; I argued no recession in 2005 and 2006, then at the beginning of 2007 I predicted a recession would start that year (made it by one month with the Great Recession starting in December 2007).\u0026nbsp; And in 2009,\u0026nbsp;I argued the economy had bottomed and we'd see sluggish growth.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eFinally, over the last 18 months,\u0026nbsp;a number of forecasters (mostly online)\u0026nbsp;have argued a recession was imminent.\u0026nbsp; I responded that I wasn't even on \"recession watch\", primarily because I thought residential investment was bottoming.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e[\u003ci\u003eCR 2015 Update: this was written two years ago - I'm not sure if those calling for a recession then have acknowledged their incorrect forecasts and / or changed theirs views (like ECRI and various bloggers).

This might involve premature or too rapid fiscal or monetary tightening (like the US in 1937 or eurozone in 2012).\u0026nbsp; Two examples: not reaching a fiscal agreement and going off the \"fiscal cliff\" probably would have led to a recession, and Congress refusing to \"pay the bills\" would have been a policy error that\u0026nbsp;would have taken the economy into recession.\u0026nbsp; Both are off the table now, but there\u0026nbsp;remains some risk of future policy errors.\u0026nbsp; \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eNote: Usually the optimal path for reducing the deficit means avoiding a recession since a recession pushes up the deficit as revenues decline and automatic spending (unemployment insurance, etc) increases.\u0026nbsp; So usually one of the goals\u0026nbsp;for fiscal policymakers\u0026nbsp;is to avoid taking the economy into\u0026nbsp;recession.  Too much austerity too quickly is self defeating.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e[\u003ci\u003eCR 2019 Update: \u003cb\u003eWe are seeing policy mistakes from the Trump administration on taxes, immigrations, and trade.\u003c/b\u003e  See: \u003ca href=\"http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2018/03/when-story-changes-be-alert.html\"\u003eWhen the Story Change, Be Alert\u003c/a\u003e.

I think this is the most likely cause of the next recession.  Usually, when inflation starts to become a concern, the Fed tries to engineer a \"soft landing\", and frequently the result is a recession.  Since inflation is not an immediate concern, the Fed will probably stay accommodative for a few more years.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSo right now I expect further growth for the next few years (all the austerity in 2013 concerns me, especially over the next couple of quarters as people adjust to higher payroll taxes, but I think we will avoid contraction).

Enveloped in a bear hug, he’s spent this season of \u003cem\u003eSuccession\u003c/em\u003e trying to make his company too big to digest for the private equity raiders hoping to swallow him whole.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut he needs to do so quickly, which means that he’s willing to do whatever it takes to push his $25 billion acquisition of rival media conglomerate PMG over the line. When PMG starts picking nits over details like break fees, the usually obstinate Logan has no qualms about undermining his own position; keep pushing on it, he tells PMG CEO Rhea Jarrell, because Waystar Royco will eventually cave and they can all finally get things signed, sealed and delivered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMatters have been further complicated, however, by an impending pipebomb: a \u003cem\u003eNew York \u003c/em\u003emagazine expose of the unsavory practices, and subsequent coverup, at Waystar’s cruises division. Tom Wambsgans and Cousin Greg may have spent last Thanksgiving burying the bodies even deeper, but they’re finally starting to poke through the surface—and they could easily scupper the PMG deal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWaystar’s efforts to mitigate the fallout from the article and see the PMG acquisition through form the crux of this week’s episode. The setting is Argestes, an elite business summit-cum-retreat where all the relevant players are in attendance—yet it is Logan who sits in the eye of the storm, balancing public relations bombshells and highly sensitive takeover talks with his own declining health and the carnival that is his family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the story does drop, the Waystar braintrust finds itself in damage control. Shiv, previously relegated to an audit committee tutorial with Frank back in New York, is flown in to be the face of the company’s response. While she’s understandably reluctant at first, it is a conversation with Rhea—who’s been playing both sides of the takeover deal—that convinces her. After all, if the acquisition falls through as a result of the scandal and her dad ends up losing control of the company, where does that leave Shiv’s designs on succeeding him as Waystar CEO?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe result is an ill-conceived, three-headed panel discussion at Argestes that sees Shiv, Kendall, and Roman blunder their way through conflicting responses to the cruises debacle. Logan is not amused, and neither is PMG matriarch Nan Pierce, who’s sitting in the audience. It all comes to a head at the summit’s closing reception, when the Roys get thoroughly (and hilariously) skewered by the comedian providing the evening’s entertainment. Nan, realizing just how radioactive the Roys are now, has seen enough; she walks out of the dinner, only to be followed by a desperate Logan and his accomplice Rhea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s nothing Logan can say to change her mind, and it’s not long before he veers from last-gasp bargaining to full-on rage. Rhea is also done for; Nan is finally onto her tricks, and asks for her resignation. “Good riddance to bad rubbish,” Nan retorts as she departs Argestes—leaving Logan to seethe into the night, and the future of Waystar Royco very much in the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJuicy Morsels\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e— \u003cstrong\u003e“We’re Listening.” \u003c/strong\u003eTom’s designs for ATN’s new tagline are torn apart by Cousin Greg, who informs him that Waystar’s questionable data-collection practices mean that they actually are listening, quite literally and quite aggressively, to their customers. But fear not, because they put their heads together and brainstorm up the equally inspiring “We Hear For You”—or, as it was mistakenly displayed at Argestes, “We Here For You.” Priceless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e— \u003cstrong\u003e“Rockstar and the Mole Woman” \u003c/strong\u003eis Roman’s pitch to Gerri on a future in which they run Waystar as CEO and chairman (or chairman and CEO), respectively. It was a rough episode for Roman; his comments in the wake of the kids’ disastrous panel appearance hit too close to home for Logan, who literally hits him back in response. But it’s been a brilliant season for Roman as a character; we’ve learned so much about the fascinating emotional complexities that make him who he is, and it’s made the show that much more rewarding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e— \u003cstrong\u003eKendall and Stewy didn’t reconcile\u003c/strong\u003e over $75 Cobb salads at Argestes, but their brief exchange reminded us of the wonderful chemistry between Jeremy Strong and Arian Moayed.

The sneak attack forced Saudi Aramco to shut down 5.7 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude production, “equating to 7% of the current global crude and condensate production,” Rystad Energy said in a research note on Monday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The world is not even close to being able to replace more than 5 million bpd day of Saudi Arabian exports,” Bjørnar Tonhaugen, head of oil market research at Rystad Energy, told \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e. “This is an attack on the blood oil system of Saudi Arabia. It’s very significant.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRystad had calculated on Sunday that crude prices would spike as much as $10 a barrel—and sure enough, at one point, it did—as the world awaits how quickly Saudi Aramco can get back to full production. It’s this waiting game that’s unnerving markets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the start of the trading day in Asia, crude prices soared by an unprecedented clip, up nearly 20% at one point, before coming back down to earth. Brent crude topped $65 per barrel, its highest level in two months. Some analysts on Monday began to speculate that crude oil prices could rise to above $70-$80 per barrel if it takes Saudi Aramco weeks to get the operation running at normal capacity again. At that stage, consumers would feel the pain, and global economic growth, already in doubt, could falter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, if the saga were to erupt into open conflict, dragging Saudi Arabia and its allies into a series of retaliatory strikes with Saturday’s attackers, Yemen’s Houthi rebels, and/or with the Houthi’s principal ally, Iran, it could send crude prices climbing even higher, to above $90 per barrel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEither way, the oil market has entered a new phase. Oil prices were trending down in recent months as the focus was on the effects of the U.S.-China trade war, and the shrinking global demand from slowing economies. Now, like the flip of a switch, it’s all about geopolitical risks in the region, and dealing with a mammoth supply shock the magnitude of which the markets haven\u0026#8217;t seen since the era of Saddam Hussein sending tanks rolling into Kuwait in 1990.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Slower global growth was beginning to act as a drag on oil prices, but the risk premium goes the other way and that in turn is another drag on global growth,” \u003ca href=\"https://wholesale.banking.societegenerale.com/en/author-detail/author/kit-juckes/\"\u003esaid Kit Juckes\u003c/a\u003e, global fixed income strategist at Societe Generale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe impact on the currency and equities markets was acute.

The attacks highlight not just the rising tensions in the region, but serve as a timely reminder of the scale of Saudi\u0026#8217;s contribution to global oil markets—they knocked out about half the country\u0026#8217;s export capacity and around 5% of the world\u0026#8217;s crude supply. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlongside the geopolitical tensions—this is only the latest, but most severe, of several attacks on Saudi oil infrastructure in recent months—the fresh supply uncertainty sent oil prices bucking, rising as much as 20% earlier on Monday—the largest inter-day jump since the 1980s—before coming off slightly.

In June of this year, for example, the U.S. was the source of about 12% of global crude exports, according to the Joint Organizations Data Initiative—though still far less than Saudi Arabia, with 23% of crude exports that month. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0026#8220;The world is not even close to being able to replace more than 5 million [barrels per day] of Saudi Arabian exports,\u0026#8221; said Bjørnar Tonhaugen, head of oil market research at Rystad Energy in Oslo. \u0026#8220;The market’s reaction to Saudi Arabia’s importance, in the new era of U.S. shale, will now be put to the test.\u0026#8221; \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0026#8217;s, in part, a test of whether the U.S. can and will scale up exports in the short-term, if necessary. Tonhaugen notes that the U.S. is one of the only countries that can dramatically ramp up crude exports—even by as much as 1 million barrels per day, from around 3 million barrels per day at present—if needed to fill a gap in the market. (Russia, the UAE, Kuwait and Iraq could also increase output, Rystad estimates—but not at the same pace.) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, that\u0026#8217;s still not enough to completely take the bite out of a sudden drop in Saudi exports. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0026#8220;The impact and the next course of action will depend on the duration of the outage,\u0026#8221; said Vima Jayabalan, research director at consultancy Wood Mackenzie. \u0026#8220;Saudi Arabia has enough reserves to cover the shortfall over the next week, but if the outage extends, then filling the gap with the right type of crude quality could be a challenge.\u0026#8221; \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSaudi Arabia has assured customers—around three quarters of its exports go to Asia—that it will meet contracts, by relying on large stock cushions parked not just in the country, but in storage in the Netherlands, Egypt and Japan.

He tweeted on Sunday that the “Fake News is saying that I am willing to meet with Iran, ‘No Conditions’ That is an incorrect statement (as usual!).” But officials including Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin have told reporters publicly that Trump is willing to take a meeting with no conditions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e‘Maximum Pressure’\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe administration’s “maximum pressure” stance against Iran is focused on imposing sanctions and isolating the country over its nuclear ambitions and malign activities in the region. That approach has come under renewed scrutiny at a time the president’s foreign policy team is in flux, after Trump’s firing of hawkish National Security Adviser John Bolton last week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eU.S. and Saudi officials say they’re gathering more evidence that Iran was behind the attacks \u0026#8212; some of it on the ground in Saudi Arabia \u0026#8212; that will be released in due time. Iran’s Foreign Ministry described Pompeo’s comments blaming the Islamic Republic as “blind and fruitless accusations.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to U.S. government information, there were 19 points of attack at state-owned Saudi Aramco’s crude-processing facility at Abqaiq and the Khurais oil field, all on the north or northwest-facing sides \u0026#8212; suggesting that the weaponry used came from that direction. Iraq lies to the north, and the U.S. in the past has accused Iran of stashing explosives with affiliated militias in the country. Yemen, by contrast, is hundreds of miles to the south.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSaudi Aramco lost roughly 5.7 million barrels per day of output after the attacks, although officials cited progress in restoring production.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003ePompeo’s Tweet\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePompeo tweeted Saturday that there is “no evidence the attacks came from Yemen” and accused Iran of being behind “an unprecedented attack on the world’s energy supply.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“The United States will work with our partners and allies to ensure that energy markets remain well supplied and Iran is held accountable for its aggression,” he added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePaul Pillar, a former U.S. Central Intelligence Agency officer, said the one “policy option left is de-escalation \u0026#8212; of the Saudi air war against Yemen, and of the Trump administration’s economic war against Iran.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePillar, who’s now a non-resident senior fellow at Georgetown University in Washington, said “further attempts to escalate on either of those war fronts offers no reason to believe that they would be any more successful than the wars have been up to this point.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTrump would risk criticism from many of his Republican allies if he chose to meet with Iran’s leader barely a week after accusing the country of being responsible for a strike that caused a significant disruption to the world’s oil markets. Republican Senator Lindsay Graham of South Carolina has said the U.S. shouldn’t rule out a military strike on Iranian oil facilities in response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eGraham Tweet\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“Iran will not stop their misbehavior until the consequences become more real, like attacking their refineries, which will break the regime’s back,” Graham tweeted Saturday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOne Western diplomat, who asked not to be identified, said Trump sees what he wants to see in world events, so if he wanted to meet with Iran’s president, the strikes wouldn’t necessarily deter him. Trump has repeatedly brushed aside short-range missile tests by North Korea as he seeks to broker a historic nuclear pact with leader Kim Jong Un.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhite House Counselor Kellyanne Conway said on “Fox News Sunday” that the administration will continue its “maximum pressure campaign,” but she added that “the president will always consider his options,” including a meeting with Rouhani. That was hours before Trump seemed to rule out a meeting unless the Iranian president met unspecified conditions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eUN Meeting\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNor is it clear the Iranian leader would be willing to take such a meeting \u0026#8212; even an informal chat on the sidelines of the UN gathering \u0026#8212; without the U.S. making some gesture to ease its sanctions on his country. The strikes in Saudi Arabia may all but rule out such a move anytime soon despite pleas by Western leaders led by French President Emmanuel Macron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe attacks on Saudi Arabia also pose a major test for Pompeo, who has an opportunity to consolidate power after Bolton’s departure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePompeo and Brian Hook, the State Department’s special representative for Iran, have argued the U.S. could afford to ramp up sanctions and diplomatic pressure on Iran because there’s plenty of global oil supply. But there’s now little cushion in the market with the major disruption caused by the drone attacks, which could force the president and his team to look for ways to relieve the pressure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile analysts estimate Saudi Arabia may be able to restore half of the lost production as early as Monday, Trump said on Twitter Sunday that he’s authorized the release of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve if needed based on the attacks “in a to-be-determined amount sufficient to keep the markets well-supplied.” The stock of about 645 million barrels of crude and petroleum products could help meet demand during the time it would take for the Saudis to repair the facilities. Trump also told U.S. agencies to expedite approvals of oil pipelines in the permitting process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s also the question of the administration’s credibility. Some foreign policy analysts said it’s hard to take at face value the claim that Tehran is responsible, given the hard line against Iran advocated by Pompeo, Bolton and others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“The Trump administration appears to have evidence of Iranian responsibility but will face skepticism from others, both because of policy disagreements between the US and its allies, and because declining to attribute an attack provides an excuse not to respond,” tweeted Michael Singh, managing director for the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eMore must-read stories from \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—145 CEOs call on Senate to support \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/09/12/145-ceos-gun-control-letter-senate/\"\u003e‘common-sense gun laws’\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e—These are the \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/22/2020-senate-elections-arizona-texas-maine-colorado-alabama/\"\u003e2020 senate races to watch\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e—\u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/09/12/joe-biden-polls-kamala-harris/\"\u003eBlack women voters\u003c/a\u003e are key to the 2020 presidential race.

Andrew Cuomo and his administration have said will be plowed into helping victims of the opioid crisis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe idea was to punish pharmaceutical companies for their role in the opioid epidemic: Pay a tax on opioids you sell to the state, and we\u0026#8217;ll use that money to fund treatment and recovery programs. Sounds simple. But the reality has been much more complicated. The tax, which went into effect July 1, has already set off a ripple effect across the entire supply chain,\u0026nbsp;as manufacturers and distributors have either stopped shipping to the state altogether or passed the tax onto each other.\u0026nbsp;The law allows the cost to be passed on further, to pharmacies and even consumers. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then there are the feared social costs. Health officials worry the tax could drive patients to seek out opioids on the black market.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNew York\u0026#8217;s experiment is both a cautionary tale for other states—and a look at how difficult it is to make drugmakers pay for fueling the opioid crisis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe tax is based on the amount of opioid in each unit sold, as well as wholesale acquisition cost, and applies to whatever entity makes the first sale—the manufacturer or the wholesaler. But since the tax was announced in July, at least three manufacturers have discontinued opioid shipments to the state: Epic Pharma, AvKARE and Lupin Pharmaceuticals. Two others, Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals and Upsher-Smith Laboratories, are in deliberations over also exiting the state, they told\u0026nbsp;\u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMallinckrodt said in a statement its effort to provide affordable access to its products \u0026#8220;has been greatly challenged” by the tax, which it calculates to be “in excess of our net revenues on these products, making it cost prohibitive for either generic manufacturers or our wholesale/distribution partners to ship product into the state without a practical pass-through mechanism to recoup the tax.”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eManufacturers pulling out is no small matter. Without them, pharmacies are left scrambling to find replacements.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eXpress Lane Pharmacy in Manhattan confirmed it is having difficulties accessing opioids for its patients, said owner Lev Zavulunov. Its supplier \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/fortune500/cardinal-health-21/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCardinal Health\u003c/a\u003e, which offers pharmacies a database to order products from its partner manufacturers, now shows certain drugs as no longer available to ship to the state. Cardinal Health confirmed some manufacturers working with Cardinal are refusing to ship directly into New York themselves, or refuse to ship to Cardinal’s National Logistics Center in Ohio at an additional charge\u0026nbsp;to the drug makers.\u0026nbsp;For those that refuse, Cardinal has stopped supplying their products, the wholesaler told\u0026nbsp;\u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e. Cardinal also confirmed it has stopped shipping opioids to state ambulatory care centers altogether. For Xpress Lane Pharmacy, according to Zavulunov, out of 10 possible manufacturers, only one or two now ship to the state. Zavulunov explained as a result, certain doses may no longer be available, and doctors are having to change the dose or the prescription altogether.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs manufacturers exit the state, more market share falls on the remaining drug makers, who must comply with annual Drug Enforcement Administration production quotas. With an increase in demand, supply could fluctuate dangerously low, according to Tara Ryan, vice president of state government affairs at the Association for Accessible Medicines (AAM). \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf manufacturers choose to stay in the game despite the tax, they will, inevitably, raise their prices to offset the cost, perhaps even beyond just their opioid products, Ryan explained. Onisis Stefas, vice president and chief pharmacy officer of Northwell Health, agreed that over time, there will be price hikes. And if manufacturers sell to wholesalers (and more than 90% of all pharmaceuticals flow through these distributors, according to the Healthcare Distribution Alliance), the cost gets passed on to them.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“I get the politics of having to single out a bad guy,” said Assemblyman John McDonald III, who owns a pharmacy himself and has publicly opposed the tax. “You can tax these manufacturers as much as you want; the reality is, all they need to do is turn around and raise the prices, and they can overcome that.”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOpioid shortages\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWholesalers with facilities in the state are already seeing shortages, said Steve Moore, president of the Pharmacists Society of the State of New York. Some lack the infrastructure and technology to handle the nuances of processing the tax, so are disincentivized from shipping to the state at all, Moore said. Other wholesalers may choose to supply the state, but to pass on the cost.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePharmacies are in a much tougher spot, as raising out-of-pocket expenses for consumers is often not viable, and some contracts explicitly prevent pharmacies from passing on the cost to patients, McDonald explained. Since insurance companies are not required by law to match the rising costs, pharmacies are in a bind.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eDiamond Drugs II, a pharmacy on Long Island, says it is not able to order oxycodone or hydrocodone from suppliers out of state. It now relies on one manufacturer in New York, and thus, has limited opioid supply. Diamond Drugs is receiving calls from patients belonging to other pharmacies whose access has also waned, asking if Diamond Drugs will fill their prescriptions, owner Harvey Staub said. But since the independent pharmacy’s supply is limited, its priority is to fill prescriptions for long-time patients who have done business with the pharmacy before—new patients are being turned away. As a result, the pharmacy is losing business, Staub said, and turning away patients with legitimate needs for the medicine.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“For most pharmacies, dispensing narcotics—controlled substances in general, and opioids specifically—we do it. It’s not a profitable venture,” McDonald said. “[Pharmacy benefit managers] cut reimbursement drastically on these items.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt the time of Cuomo’s proposal, the HDA calculated for the administration the estimated tax of some products based on publicly reported wholesale acquisition costs and their morphine milligram equivalents. What it found was the tax can result in anywhere from a 60% to 100% markup on a regular drug price.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eGov. Cuomo\u0026#8217;s office did not respond to\u0026nbsp;\u003cem\u003eFortune\u0026#8217;\u003c/em\u003es requests for comment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to McDonald and Moore, the tax on opioids, especially generics, can cost more than the drug itself. Considering\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href=\"https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/7UnWCR6X6jhvDrPM2F9ss8D?domain=accessiblemeds.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003egeneric medications make up nearly 90% of the controlled substance market,\u003c/a\u003e\u0026nbsp;generics will be hit hardest by the tax, meaning huge ramifications for patients who rely on generics to afford their prescriptions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“With inventories of opioids dwindling in New York, and state policymakers ignoring the limitations of the national contracts and supply chain that dictate the distribution and reimbursement for medication across the country, patients with legitimate pain management needs are at risk of losing access to the affordable generic opioids that are most affected by this tax,” Mallinckodt told\u0026nbsp;\u003cem\u003eFortune.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe black market\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIndeed, one unintentional consequence of the new tax could be boosting the black market for opioids. “We made it clear, every which way, for two years in New York that there could be negative outcomes,” said Matthew DiLoreto, vice president of state government affairs at the Healthcare Distribution Alliance (HDA). DiLoreto said the HDA was told by policymakers they “did not believe the concerns we raised were significant enough or that they would ever actually occur.”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eKathryn Carroll, manager of government affairs at the Center for Disability Rights, who was also part of budget negotiations, said, “It seemed like of all the things the legislature had to fight for, this just fell to the bottom of the list.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eA\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href=\"https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/zn-cCVOWOnCxnljWGsz60e1?domain=crainsnewyork.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003e2018 study published by two professors\u0026nbsp;\u003c/a\u003eof economics at Union College predicted that not only will the tax cause restricted consumer access to opioids, but also will strengthen the black market, which offers cheaper illegal alternatives like heroin and fentanyl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/Y1aaCW616oh5LjwMJiKZJ5P?domain=drugabuse.gov\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eNational data shows\u003c/a\u003e\u0026nbsp;that of the patients prescribed opioids for chronic pain, between 8% and 12% develop an addiction. “Many have raised concerns that while the prescribing for FDA approved opioids has gone down and the death rate from the misuse and abuse of FDA approved opioids has fallen, the death rates from illegal opioid overdoses (fentanyl and other opioids) continues to rise,” said Ryan.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe HDA echoed her concerns, stating the law does not focus on the “very real, and growing” threat of illicit drugs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere is the tax going?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThough Cuomo promoted the tax on the idea that the revenue would be used to fund treatment and recovery programs, the money was ultimately not earmarked for any specific programs in\u0026nbsp;\u003ca rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/XlxeCXDPDpIXPn78wtkyzXQ?domain=budget.ny.gov\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethe final budget\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“The whole thing is ill-conceived,” Assemblymember Linda Rosenthal said. “I think it’s a talking point, rather than New York actually dealing with the overdose crisis.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs it now stands, the tax revenue can merely supplant the funding already set aside for agencies like the Office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Services (OASAS).

DFIs are also able to stomach more risk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA driving factor for this trend is that hotels rent their rooms in euros and U.S. dollars rather than in local currency which, from a financing perspective, reduces the risk to the lender and lowers the interest rate paid by the borrower, according to the report.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe post \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.hotelbusiness.com/jll-mixed-use-is-the-key-to-funding-hotel-development-in-africa/\"\u003eJLL: Mixed-Use is Key to Funding Hotel Development in Africa\u003c/a\u003e appeared first on \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.hotelbusiness.com\"\u003eHotel Business\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://www.hotelbusiness.com/jll-mixed-use-is-the-key-to-funding-hotel-development-in-africa/","published":"2019-09-16T13:58:28Z","guid":"https://www.hotelbusiness.com/?p=188267"},{"title":"IHG to Debut InterContinental and Hotel Indigo in Peru; More South America Happenings…","content":"\u003cp\u003eINTERNATIONAL REPORT—South America is seeing new hotel activity, including the coming debuts of the InterContinental and Hotel Indigo brands in Peru.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eInterContinental and Hotel Indigo Brands Coming to Peru\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIHG will debut both the InterContinental Hotels \u0026amp; Resorts and Hotel Indigo brands in Peru, with two new properties now under construction in the capital city of Lima.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hotel Indigo Lima Miraflores will also be the brand’s first property in South America.

It quickly became apparent that there were huge advantages to allowing each person to do what they were naturally suited for and did best. (Imagine me doing payroll and Josh managing employee healthcare and it becomes obvious there is a better way). The idea of all of us doing everything quickly became each of us focusing on our individual strengths, with different areas of responsibility.

We understood the value of a basic indexing approach; we knew investor behavior and cognitive issues could be re-applied to help clients reach their goals; we understood the importance of integrating planning into asset management from day one. We pressed all of those forward to make managing client monies as simple and understandable as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe also were aware that our media footprint allowed us to spend less time and money marketing, enabling us to put more effort into client services.

We brought on an outstanding CFO (\u003ca href=\"https://ritholtz.com/2018/01/introducing-bill-sweet-cfo/\"\u003eBill Sweet\u003c/a\u003e) who handles so much of the admin work, from budgeting, to payroll, to hiring new advisors, to financial projections. It also helps when you have two pros (Erika \u0026amp; Patrick) running operations in ways that continually raise the bar.

There are trade errors, potential hires that didn’t work out, clients who might not be a great fit. Rather than dwell on mistakes, learn from them and get better. Build processes that have auto-correction built in – so errors are identified quickly, and your system learns (and the mistakes do not get repeated).

Forecasters generally have a terrible record at predicting recessions.  There are many reasons for this poor performance.  In 1987, economist Victor Zarnowitz wrote in \"\u003ca href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/w2099.pdf\"\u003eThe Record and Improvability of Economic Forecasting\u003c/a\u003e\" that there was too much reliance on trends, and\u0026nbsp;he also noted that\u0026nbsp;predictive failure was also due to forecasters' incentives. Zarnowitz wrote: \"predicting a general downturn is always unpopular and predicting it prematurely—ahead of others—may prove quite costly to the forecaster and his customers\".\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIncentives motivate \u003cb\u003eWall Street economic forecasters to always be optimistic\u003c/b\u003e about the future (just like stock analysts).  Of course, for the \u003cb\u003emedia and bloggers, there is an incentive to \u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003ealways be bearish,\u003c/b\u003e because bad news drives traffic (hence the prevalence of \u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_journalism\"\u003eyellow journalism\u003c/a\u003e).\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIn addition to paying attention to incentives, we also have to be careful not to rely \"heavily on the persistence of trends\".  One of the reasons I focus on residential investment (especially housing starts and new home sales) is residential investment is very cyclical and is frequently the best leading indicator for the economy.  UCLA's Ed Leamer went so far as to argue that: \"\u003ca href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/w13428\"\u003eHousing IS the Business Cycle\u003c/a\u003e\".  Usually residential investment leads the economy both into and out of recessions.  The most recent recovery was an exception, but it was fairly easy to predict a sluggish recovery without a contribution from housing.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSince I started this blog in January 2005, I've been pretty lucky on calling the business cycle.\u0026nbsp; I argued no recession in 2005 and 2006, then at the beginning of 2007 I predicted a recession would start that year (made it by one month with the Great Recession starting in December 2007).\u0026nbsp; And in 2009,\u0026nbsp;I argued the economy had bottomed and we'd see sluggish growth.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eFinally, over the last 18 months,\u0026nbsp;a number of forecasters (mostly online)\u0026nbsp;have argued a recession was imminent.\u0026nbsp; I responded that I wasn't even on \"recession watch\", primarily because I thought residential investment was bottoming.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e[\u003ci\u003eCR 2015 Update: this was written two years ago - I'm not sure if those calling for a recession then have acknowledged their incorrect forecasts and / or changed theirs views (like ECRI and various bloggers).

This might involve premature or too rapid fiscal or monetary tightening (like the US in 1937 or eurozone in 2012).\u0026nbsp; Two examples: not reaching a fiscal agreement and going off the \"fiscal cliff\" probably would have led to a recession, and Congress refusing to \"pay the bills\" would have been a policy error that\u0026nbsp;would have taken the economy into recession.\u0026nbsp; Both are off the table now, but there\u0026nbsp;remains some risk of future policy errors.\u0026nbsp; \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eNote: Usually the optimal path for reducing the deficit means avoiding a recession since a recession pushes up the deficit as revenues decline and automatic spending (unemployment insurance, etc) increases.\u0026nbsp; So usually one of the goals\u0026nbsp;for fiscal policymakers\u0026nbsp;is to avoid taking the economy into\u0026nbsp;recession.  Too much austerity too quickly is self defeating.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e[\u003ci\u003eCR 2019 Update: \u003cb\u003eWe are seeing policy mistakes from the Trump administration on taxes, immigrations, and trade.\u003c/b\u003e  See: \u003ca href=\"http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2018/03/when-story-changes-be-alert.html\"\u003eWhen the Story Change, Be Alert\u003c/a\u003e.

I think this is the most likely cause of the next recession.  Usually, when inflation starts to become a concern, the Fed tries to engineer a \"soft landing\", and frequently the result is a recession.  Since inflation is not an immediate concern, the Fed will probably stay accommodative for a few more years.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSo right now I expect further growth for the next few years (all the austerity in 2013 concerns me, especially over the next couple of quarters as people adjust to higher payroll taxes, but I think we will avoid contraction). [\u003ci\u003eCR 2015 Update: We avoided contraction in 2013!\u003c/i\u003e]   I think the most likely cause of the next recession will be Fed tightening to combat inflation sometime in the future - and residential investment (housing starts, new home sales) will probably turn down well in advance of the recession.

Then there was news of an Asian release that had English options included. Even with that, I wasn\u0026#8217;t too sure these ports would be coming to the Switch in the West as the Nintendo 3DS and PlayStation 4 versions that were release some years back didn\u0026#8217;t. Well, here we go. The amazing Erdrick Trilogy will be available in the West on September 27th, just in time for the release of \u003cem\u003eDragon Quest XI S\u003c/em\u003e. The first game will be $4.99, the second $6.49, and the third $12.49. If you simply can\u0026#8217;t wait, these are\u0026#8230; well, they\u0026#8217;re pretty much the same as the mobile versions that came out on iOS four or five years ago.

The beloved \u003cem\u003eArland\u003c/em\u003e sub-series hit the platform earlier this year, and it must have met expectations because the Dusk sub-series is now set to join it.\u003cem\u003e Atelier Ayesha, Atelier Echa \u0026amp; Logy\u003c/em\u003e, and \u003cem\u003eAtelier Shallie\u003c/em\u003e will be coming to the Switch as a\u003cem\u003e Deluxe Trilogy\u003c/em\u003e, just as the \u003cem\u003eArland\u003c/em\u003e games did before.

Whether it\u0026#8217;s Stern, Williams, Gottlieb, or even Zaccaria, replicas of real pins abound. There\u0026#8217;s also a healthy supply of original pinball tables, with the very best coming from \u003cem\u003ePinball FX\u003c/em\u003e creators Zen Studios.\u003cem\u003e Pinball FX3\u003c/em\u003e has been available on the Switch for a while now, offering a large selection of wholly original tables and new creations based on various licenses. When it arrived, however, it came without some of the really big brands that it sported on previous platforms. One of those absentees has finally arrived on the system in the form of \u003cem\u003eStar Wars Pinball\u003c/em\u003e, a comprehensive collection of all of Zen\u0026#8217;s work with the iconic franchise with some cool extras thrown in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, the details. You get 19 tables covering a wide range of the \u003cem\u003eStar Wars\u003c/em\u003e universe. There are tables based on the Original Trilogy, the Disney-era movies, some of the TV shows, and a few that are simply inspired by the setting in general. Just on sheer numbers alone, this set is an incredible value. You\u0026#8217;re paying under a buck and a half per table, which is even less than those half-baked \u003cem\u003eDinosaur Pinball\u003c/em\u003e or \u003cem\u003ePirate Pinball\u003c/em\u003e games that you see in the sales list now and then. While they share a similar broad theme and the aesthetics all revolve around one media property, the variety of gameplay you\u0026#8217;ll find across these tables is rather large in pinball terms. Zen could have just tossed these together in a bare bones pack and it still would have been a good pick-up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-258385\" src=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/starwarspinball2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/starwarspinball2.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/starwarspinball2-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/starwarspinball2-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/starwarspinball2-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFortunately, they didn\u0026#8217;t stop there. In addition to the basic single player mode that allows you to pick a table and have at it, you also get the League Play mode where you take on other players online on selected tables, the Galactic Tournament mode which pits everyone against each other online in a massive tournament, and the Career Mode where you play on select tables trying to achieve certain goals. The latter mode is particularly neat, as you can unlock and use Force Powers that give you an edge. It also gives a guided experience with a fair difficulty progression for those who are a bit overwhelmed by the amount of content available from the get-go. There are different goals including timed challenges, achieving a certain score with a set number of flipper presses, and so on. There are also some mini-games that are, uh, well\u0026#8230; not that good, but I appreciate the effort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of this is powered by the\u003cem\u003e Pinball FX3\u003c/em\u003e engine, ensuring superb physics and reasonably good production values. Licensed music is in, but virtually all of the voice samples use sound-alikes of varying degrees of quality rather than the real actors. The interface and overall system for online modes will be quite familiar for anyone who has played one of Zen\u0026#8217;s previous pinball titles, and that means you can indeed flip the display to play in vertical orientation as the Force intended. Setting aside the quality of each individual table, Zen has created an excellent platform for pinball, and that\u0026#8217;s something that works greatly to \u003cem\u003eStar Wars Pinball\u003c/em\u003e\u0026#8216;s benefit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-258386\" src=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/starwarspinball3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/starwarspinball3.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/starwarspinball3-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/starwarspinball3-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/starwarspinball3-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn some ways, this is one of the easiest reviews I\u0026#8217;ve ever written. Do you like \u003cem\u003eStar Wars\u003c/em\u003e? Do you like pinball? If you said yes to both, buy this game right away. It\u0026#8217;s exceptionally well-done and packed with content. If you said yes to one or the other, you may still want to consider this. The\u003cem\u003e Star Wars\u003c/em\u003e fan service is strong enough that even those who don\u0026#8217;t love pinball may have a good time here. The Career Mode provides a natural jumping-on point for those unfamiliar with silver ball. The tables themselves are largely of such high quality that you similarly don\u0026#8217;t need to like \u003cem\u003eStar Wars\u003c/em\u003e to get your pinball thrills here. And if you answered \u003cem\u003eboth\u003c/em\u003e of those questions with no, then I\u0026#8217;m not exactly sure why you read all of this, but I suppose I must admit that \u003cem\u003eStar Wars\u003c/em\u003e \u003cem\u003ePinball\u003c/em\u003e may not be for you!

As you\u0026#8217;d expect, this puts some pressure on her to hook up with one of the many eligible elemental men and start producing some offspring so that her species doesn\u0026#8217;t die out. A heavy burden, and a responsibility she understands, but does she want it? This is a bit of a rarity for the genre as it was created by an American developer, and it certainly shakes out a bit differently from what you may be used to in the \u003cem\u003eotome\u003c/em\u003e genre. The broad strokes are, at least, familiar. Choose the dude you want to hook up with and make choices towards making that happen. There are multiple endings based on who you end up with, so you\u0026#8217;ll want to play through several times to see it all.

That price is the lowest it has ever been, and the game really is quite neat.

My expectations were pretty low for \u003cem\u003eCastlevania: Grimoire of Souls\u003c/em\u003e based on Konami\u0026#8217;s mobile history and their recent treatment of the brand, but after spending some time playing it, I think this game has potential. At the very least, it\u0026#8217;s going to bring back a gameplay style I never thought we would see again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were two versions of the game that players could choose to try at Konami\u0026#8217;s booth at the show. The single-player story mode has you bringing your character of choice through pre-built stages, battling enemies and bosses while also doing a little light platforming. The other mode is a multiplayer co-op campaign that is more or less a high-resolution version of \u003cem\u003eHarmony of Despair\u003c/em\u003e, the last \u003cem\u003eCastlevania\u003c/em\u003e game from the man who worked on \u003cem\u003eSymphony of the Night, Aria of Sorrow\u003c/em\u003e, and\u003cem\u003e Lament of Innocence\u003c/em\u003e.

You start off as Genya Arikado from \u003cem\u003eAria of Sorrow\u003c/em\u003e, who is (15-year-old spoiler) actually Alucard in disguise. He\u0026#8217;s more or less a tutorial character, and after a brief intro with him, we switch over to Alucard in his more familiar\u003cem\u003e Symphony of the Night\u003c/em\u003e look. The graphics are crisp and high-resolution, and it\u0026#8217;s great to see the character sporting that visual update. A combination of virtual buttons and swipes gives us access to a wide range of abilities and attacks, and you\u0026#8217;ll have to use them carefully to take out the variety of enemies you\u0026#8217;ll come across.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the game is free to play, there must be monetization somewhere. Indeed, extra characters, costumes (like the Arikado look), and equipment seem likely sources of income depending on how the final version is set up. As for the roster, it seems the game will launch with Alucard, Simon Belmont, Charlotte (from \u003cem\u003ePortrait of Ruin\u003c/em\u003e), Shanoa (from\u003cem\u003e Order of Ecclesia\u003c/em\u003e), and the child version of Maria (from \u003cem\u003eRondo of Blood\u003c/em\u003e). If nothing else, I appreciate that the game is faithful in some ways to many of the beloved classic games, even as the core gameplay itself has been adapted to the mobile gaming lifestyle. It\u0026#8217;s fun enough to play and provided nothing gets too messed up with its monetization, I\u0026#8217;ll definitely be there when the game launches.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://toucharcade.com/2019/09/16/tgs-2019-hands-on-with-castlevania-grimoire-of-souls/","published":"2019-09-16T18:00:29Z","guid":"https://toucharcade.com/?p=258330"},{"title":"TGS 2019: Hands-On With ‘Ys VIII Mobile’","content":"\u003cp\u003eWell, I\u0026#8217;ll level with you, friends. Although this year\u0026#8217;s Tokyo Game Show was as big as ever, mobile games weren\u0026#8217;t nearly as prominent as they have been in previous years. Even with that, there was one game I knew was going to be at the show in playable form that I really had to try, and that was Linekong\u0026#8217;s mobile version of Falcom\u0026#8217;s \u003cem\u003eYs VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana\u003c/em\u003e. Mobile versions of console games can really go in any direction, particularly when they\u0026#8217;re handled by an outside company, but I was hoping that \u003cem\u003eYs VIII\u003c/em\u003e would come through in good form.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter spending some time playing the demo version available on the show floor, I think we\u0026#8217;re in for a treat. Visually, the game is great. Now, this is a game that debuted on the PlayStation Vita, so it\u0026#8217;s perhaps not that surprising that modern mobile devices can make a good show of it, but it\u0026#8217;s reassuring to see that even though the game has been pushed back to 2020, it\u0026#8217;s looking to be on the right track on a technical level. As for the gameplay, the version on the floor had a few combat scenarios set up to play with. Series protagonist Adol was available, as was Rucol, a new character created for the mobile version.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"clear:both;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"video-responsive\"\u003e\n\t\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3_eJ97asWvs\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eActions were mapped to virtual controls and as such it was easy enough to play provided you have any experience with such set-ups.

What we weren\u0026#8217;t sure of until now is if all 100 or so of those games would be available right away or not, and it appears that in reality roughly half of them will be there on day one. Apple has also said new games will make their way into Apple Arcade on a weekly basis, so we\u0026#8217;ll probably be hitting that 100 mark and beyond before too long anyway. At the very least there is NO shortage of awesome stuff to play on day one, so if you\u0026#8217;re on the iOS 13 beta bandwagon definitely sign up for the free one month trial to check it all out, and if not be sure to update to iOS 13 when it officially launches on Thursday to see what Apple Arcade has to

umbrella-wielding fighter who joins Samurai Shodown’s roster today","content":"\u003cp\u003eHey guys, how\u0026#8217;s it going. I\u0026#8217;m KK, SNK\u0026#8217;s community manager, and today I\u0026#8217;d like to talk a bit about the basics of Samurai Shodown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpon first glance, many claim that Samurai Shodown seems difficult due to its weapon-based combat, but the underlying mechanics are actually quite simple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eFighting basics\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach character has a light, medium, and heavy slash attack as well as a kick. This is very similar to other fighting games out there, however what makes Samurai Shodown special is its Rage system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnlike other games where characters have a POW or Energy bar that goes up with every landed hit, the Rage Gauge only goes up when *you* take a hit (or preform a Just Defense). The Rage Gauge can only be used when it\u0026#8217;s at full capacity, and will empty itself at once after a short amount of time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring Max Rage, players earn a buff to their attack power, and they now have access to their Weapon Flipping Technique or WFT. The WFT disarms an opponent, which can greatly turn the tables in your favour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut say you\u0026#8217;re down a round and knocking on death\u0026#8217;s door. You\u0026#8217;re not just going lie down and die, are you? GET HEATED by performing a Rage Explosion (by pressing light, medium, and heavy slash at the same time or L2).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48724745977_03708379cf_o.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003e\u003cimg class=\"alignnone fullwidthelement size-full\" src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48724745977_92868d4850_h.jpg\" alt=\"Samurai Shodown\" aria-hidden=\"true\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis will put you instantly at Max Rage, and not only will you get the added attack bonus and unlocked WFT, but you can now perform a Lightning Blade attack. The Lightning Blade is a one-time use attack that scales according to your HP and remaining Rage Gauge. Claim victory in one fell swoop, just like in your favorite anime!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eIntroducing today\u0026#8217;s new challenger\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSamurai Shodown features a new character every month until February! Last month, Hell froze over when Rimururu took the stage.

I’m KK, SNK’s community manager, and today I’d like to talk a bit about the basics of \u003ca href=\"https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/samurai-shodown-ps4/?smcid=pssocial:blog:game:samurai_shodown_beginners_guide_shizumaru_enters_battle_monday:9_13_19\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eSamurai Shodown\u003c/a\u003e. Upon first glance, many claim that Samurai Shodown seems difficult due to its weapon-based combat, but the underlying mechanics are actually quite simple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach character has a light, medium, and heavy slash attack as well as a kick. This is very similar to other fighting games out there, however what makes Samurai Shodown special is its Rage system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnlike other games where characters have a POW or Energy bar that goes up with every landed hit, the Rage Gauge only goes up when \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e take a hit (or perform a Just Defense). The Rage Gauge can only be used when it’s at full capacity, and will empty itself at once after a short amount of time. During Max Rage, players earn a buff to their attack power, and they now have access to their Weapon Flipping Technique or WFT. The WFT disarms an opponent, which can greatly turn the tables in your favor. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48724745977_03708379cf_o.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48724745977_92868d4850_h.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Samurai Shodown\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut say you’re down a round and knocking on death’s door. You’re not just going to lie down and die, are you? GET HEATED by performing a Rage Explosion (by pressing light, medium, and heavy slash at the same time or L2). This will put you instantly at Max Rage, and not only will you get the added attack bonus and unlocked WFT, but you can now perform a Lightning Blade attack. The Lightning Blade is a one-time use attack that scales according to your HP and remaining Rage Gauge.

Reavers deployment, with Ishtars and support and no station to dock up in.  I had a couple of Guardians left over from past operations already correctly fit, so I put one on my main, one on my alt,

play, but apparently couldn\u0026#8217;t get enough people together for a stand up fight.  Instead they came out in bombers and interceptors to try and and interrupt the entosis ship.  That was mildly annoying, but not enough to get us to break orbit, and we ended up getting a couple of kills.  Ishtars racing in a circle with props on move pretty quickly so you have to anticipate where they\u0026#8217;ll be before you bomb.  The locals were not quite that good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThings were quiet enough that I put \u003cem\u003eEVE Online\u003c/em\u003e on my second

ended up with a couple of ihubs reinforced, after which we went back to where we were living, where we safed up, put on our cloaks, and logged out again.  I didn\u0026#8217;t do much with \u003cem\u003eEVE Online\u003c/em\u003e over the weekend.  I missed any ops we might have run.  But today things changed.  As CCP announced on Saturday, the blackout is over.  We\u0026#8217;re no longer invisible in space.  People can now see us in the local channel when we log in.  Our extra cloak is gone.  But we have always had to deal with that in the past.  And us being logged in and cloaked up can be a deterrent on its own.  And so it goes, living out in hostile space on another Reavers op.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://tagn.wordpress.com/2019/09/16/on-the-road-again-in-new-eden/","published":"2019-09-16T17:15:01Z","guid":"http://tagn.wordpress.com/?p=73351"}]},{"url":"https://www.eurogamer.net/?format=rss","items":[{"title":"Rayman's

show. Set in 1992 in an Orlando suburb, the pitch-black comedy about desperation, anxiety, and self-delusion is not afraid to be deeply weird: Its heroine, Krystal (Kirsten Dunst), is a scrappy single mom and waterpark employee who begrudgingly joins FAM, a cult-like multi-level-marketing company, after her late FAM-following husband leaves her in massive debt.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eSince the show began airing in August, Krystal has struggled to balance her distaste for the pyramid scheme and her need to pay her bills, while remaining optimistic that if she directly appeals to the system’s leaders, she’ll be able to succeed. During last night’s episode, she finally realizes how trapped she is within FAM when she meets with the company’s mastermind, the enigmatic Obie Garbeau II (Ted Levine).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eGarbeau prefers to be heard, not seen: He communicates with FAM members by recording “advice” onto cassette tapes, available for mandatory purchase. In the episode’s thoroughly unsettling opening scene, he is recording one of those tapes. With his Colonel Sanders–like mustache brushing against the microphone, he muses about his vision of success: “Oftentimes at night, I dream about America,” he begins. “I dream about a land so rich in opportunity it geysers up from the ground like oil bursting to touch the heavens.” As he speaks, a montage plays with shots of cowboys and rocky mountains, accompanied by the cry of a bald eagle.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe over-the-top monologue, of course, looks nothing like the America his FAM followers actually live in: Krystal, for instance, is punished for trying to sell FAM products her own way (through an exercise class at the waterpark where she works). The geyser of opportunity, it seems, comes with a set of rules and restrictions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eEpisode by episode, \u003cem\u003eOn Becoming a God\u003c/em\u003e has been skewering the concept of the American dream, observing it as a con the \u003cem\u003ehaves\u003c/em\u003e orchestrate to prey on the \u003cem\u003ehave-nots\u003c/em\u003e. But in this midseason entry, the show drives the knife in deeper: Krystal may be trying to rise through the ranks in order to earn bonuses, and get out of debt, but she realizes that there’s no way to do so without lying about her success and taking advantage of others—in other words, doing exactly what Garbeau does. In that regard, the series has reached its timely thesis: To pursue the American dream is, too often, to corrupt it, eventually tarnishing the idea of success itself.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eKrystal, after all, had been the paragon of anti-Garbeau-ism since the day her late husband bought his tapes home—yet by Episode 5, she’s expounding the virtues of the “system.” And though she tells herself she’s unmoved by FAM (she’s just trying to rise through the ranks, earn bonuses, and get out of debt), she’s become a poster child for the scheme, extraordinarily good at executing FAM’s ideas. She’s a self-starter: She recruits her neighbor when she realizes he’s at a vulnerable moment in his life. She’s her own boss: She overpowers Cody (Théodore Pellerin), her recruiter (or “upline”), and manipulates him into seeing her as a love interest. She’s a winner: At Garbeau’s McMansion, “Paradise Cay,” she orders Cody to propose to her onstage, a grotesque display of affection she concocts to impress Garbeau.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe latter stunt doesn’t work, and this only frustrates Krystal further. She began the series hoping to make enough money to raise her daughter. But midway through the season, she’s dreaming of never being poor again and going to greater lengths to attain her goal. Worse, her pursuits are taking her away from home; she spends most of her time in Paradise Cay determined to meet Garbeau. It’s as if her original intentions have been overshadowed by her new ambitions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr class=\"c-section-divider\"\u003e\u003cp class=\"dropcap\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eO\u003cspan class=\"smallcaps\"\u003en Becoming a God\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e isn’t the only comedy tackling this hypocrisy. \u003cem\u003eThe Righteous Gemstones\u003c/em\u003e, HBO’s provocative comedy about a televangelist family in the South, also complicates the American dream in its latest installment. Told mostly through flashbacks set in 1989, its fifth episode finds a young Eli (John Goodman), the Gemstone family patriarch, and his wife Aimee-Leigh (Jennifer Nettles, of the country music duo Sugarland) strolling across a picturesque plot of land in which they’re hoping to put down roots. The couple joke they’ll build houses for each of their children so they can keep them close forever. Then Eli proposes, “Maybe we’ll build our own amusement park with our own roller coasters.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e“You are getting out of hand now,” Aimee-Leigh warns. “We’ve already been so blessed.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e“We worked hard,” Eli counters. “And there’s much more blessings to come.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eFlash forward three decades, and it turns out they’re both right. The Gemstones have indeed been blessed—with wealth and power—but the plot of land they surveyed in 1989 hasn’t turned into an amusement park for the community; it’s become a gated complex with mansions for each of the Gemstone offspring.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" height=\"448\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/09/0a91a9b7590577174c5dcd6356ae017cc986388e48bb6a1bfabb24a6b8b3515d30fb5cb7d35cc2e1851d87998c8953ce/4d846e149.jpg\" width=\"672\"\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"caption\"\u003eBaby Billy (Walton Goggins) and Eli (John Goodman) are members of the Gemstones, a televangelist family fueled not by faith, but by power. (Ryan Green / HBO)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eDespite coming from a completely different background, Eli suffers a fate similar to Krystal’s. The flashbacks make clear that as a young man building a family, he’d meant well in expanding the Gemstones’ churchly influence. When he throws his daughter a birthday party complete with ponies, a clown, and a bouncy house, his father gives him some advice. “All a preacher needs is four walls and some willing souls, and a good book,” the elder Gemstone tells Eli. “All this excess is obscene.” So Eli tries to keep his children grounded: He refuses an obnoxious birthday gift—a toy Corvette—from his brother-in-law “Baby” Billy (Walton Goggins) and disciplines his son after he acts out at school.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eBut those efforts aren’t enough. Eli’s ambition, coupled with the fear of losing his wealth, motivates his need for that obscene excess. Only now, what’s left is a family with incompetent heirs fueled not by faith, but by power. The family church has turned into a capitalistic behemoth that travels abroad to ludicrously baptize people in wave pools. Jesse (Danny McBride), the eldest of Eli’s children, spends most of his time trying to cover up a video of him doing drugs with a topless woman. In fact, while the late Aimee-Leigh had asserted herself as an equal to Eli, the women of the Gemstones are now largely seen as accessories, casualties of the men’s overwhelming self-interest and desire to advertise family values without following them. (In an earlier episode, Jesse’s wife is about to defend the church against an accusation of sexism when she pauses to ask him if she’s allowed to speak.) The empire Eli built may be as large as the one he’d envisioned, but it’s been built on layers and layers of greed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eTo people like Baby Billy, though, the tragedy lies in having a vision in the first place. “People in America got it backwards,” Baby Billy whines in the episode, frustrated he can’t make his dream—to, as a washed-up musician, capitalize on his former success with Aimee-Leigh by going on tour—come true.

The first victim was my editor, whom I abruptly asked one morning to stop messaging me about story ideas on our office’s chat platform, Slack. Instead, I said, let’s talk the ideas out over the phone. I soon did the same thing to a friend who texted to discuss a job offer he’d just received. A few weeks later, when another friend texted me for New York City apartment-hunting tips, I asked her my new favorite question in return: Do you want to give me a call?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe phone call has lost its primacy in American communication. \u003ca href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/179288/new-era-communication-americans.aspx\"\u003eBy 2014\u003c/a\u003e, texting had become more common for Americans under 50. The popularity of text-based communication tools like WhatsApp and Instagram direct-messaging has exploded since. People currently in their 20s and 30s, in particular, have \u003ca href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/26/whatsapp-phone-calls-smartphone-messaging-millennials\"\u003edeveloped a reputation\u003c/a\u003e for being allergic to phone calls.

Instead of calling my hair salon to make an appointment, I’d simply let my roots grow for an extra six or eight weeks until they bothered me enough to dial the number. No matter the task, I’d always text or email first. Was there an app for that? Even better. If all options failed, I’d simply prefer to not get what I wanted rather than talk to a live human. Phone calls force you to contend with the messy reality of living in a world where other people might need your attention without warning you through a calendar invite two weeks in advance. Phone calls don’t let you ignore a message for four days, confident in its innocuousness.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eNevertheless, I’m here today to confess my sins and ask forgiveness from all those whose voicemails I have not listened to. To fully repent, I must make clear what I now know to be the truth: Phone calls are good, actually.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eOne of the best arguments in favor of phone calls will be obvious to anyone who’s ever gone back and forth for three days via email trying to pick a spot for Tuesday’s happy hour. Guhan Subramanian, the director of the Harvard Program on Negotiation, which teaches business- and law-school students the finer points of conflict resolution, argues that spoken conversation accomplishes far more in a shorter amount of time. In any discussion, “people are asking questions, probing, asking follow-up questions,” he says. “It’s obviously a lot easier to do when you’re over the phone or in person, compared to by email or text.\"\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThis difference is what first pushed me back to phone calls. I wanted to hear my editor’s reactions to my story ideas and work them out in real time, not watch a “Paul is typing…” graphic linger ominously for 30 seconds before I knew the verdict. (Hi, Paul.) With friends, too, I wanted to rekindle the energy of live conversation. I wanted to crack a joke and hear someone laugh. I wanted my thumbs to have the occasional night off.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWith so many digital avenues now available for reaching someone, the problem with phone calls is not that they’re inconvenient. It’s that they’re gauche. Especially for young people who tend to use their phones constantly, text messaging has become a roiling conversation that never really begins or ends. There’s often just as strong an expectation of an immediate answer to a text as there has traditionally been for a phone call—a phenomenon familiar to anyone whose significant other has fussed at them for Tweeting or posting to Instagram Stories while \u003ca href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/mar/17/i-know-theyve-seen-my-message-so-why-havent-they-replied\"\u003ebeing left on read\u003c/a\u003e. A phone call might still carry a more \u003cem\u003eexplicit\u003c/em\u003e demand for attention, but it’s actually far easier to explain being unable to answer a call than a text.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eI’m not advocating a wholesale rejection of text in favor of speaking. There are plenty of situations in which a text or email is plainly preferable, and for people with hearing impairments or other disabilities that make phone calls difficult, the development of real-time, text-based communication is a boon that shouldn’t be dismissed. For other people, a sense of anxiety can come from the on-the-spot nature of phone calls. Text communication allows anywhere from a moment to several days of self-editing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eBut that can come with some drawbacks itself, according to Subramanian. “Over email, the message that’s received may not be the same as the message that’s sent,” he says. It’s missing the back-and-forth contextualization and clearer tone that spoken conversation provides.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eChatting on the phone provides the bliss of unreviewable, unforwardable, unsearchable speech. If something comes out a little weird, there’s no record of it. (Unless your conversation partner is secretly recording it, in which case you have deeper problems.) If you misunderstand something, there’s no daylong email chain correcting your error. If a conversation has a tense moment, you can’t scroll back up to critique your performance until the heat death of the universe. Snapchat blew up a few years ago because pictures sent between users on the app disappeared 10 seconds after being viewed; talking to someone on the phone has provided the same freedom in verbal form since the days of Alexander Graham Bell.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eSmartphones \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/08/why-people-hate-making-phone-calls/401114/?utm_source=feed\"\u003efeel terrible\u003c/a\u003e to hold to your ear for more than a few minutes, but they make up for poor ergonomic design with one key feature: speakerphone. I often chat on the phone while lying on the couch, iPhone on my stomach, like I’m talking to a friend who’s excused herself to the kitchen to grab a seltzer—or a therapist sitting placidly outside of my field of vision. Afterward, I feel the same contented buzz I got from talking on the phone after school when I was 10, shortly before AOL Instant Messenger swept my generation onto the internet. It’s a feeling that text messages have never given me. (Although, it must be said: Don’t be the person who uses speakerphone in public. You live in a society.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIn hindsight, AIM might very well be the technology that sealed Millennials’ phone-call fates. For kids of that era, having a communication method that made after-school chats easier to conceal from parents provided a freedom that many people my age still ascribe to text-based messaging, long after the generation has taken the format’s convenience past its logical extreme. In place of the natural intimacy of verbal conversation, texters and technology companies have tried to retrofit emotional richness into messaging through \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/07/lel-nyahahaha-o-boy-the-creative-ways-we-laugh-online/374531/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eabbreviation\u003c/a\u003e (lmao) and \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/02/what-do-emojis-mean/385127/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eemoji\u003c/a\u003e. Those signifiers work to a certain extent, but there's an irony to so many people mimicking the touchstones of spoken conversation on their phones when they're just a button-press away from the real thing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eJonny Gerkin, a psychiatrist at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine, thinks misconceptions about the phone call’s intrusiveness and inconvenience have probably scared plenty of people who like to chat on the phone away from suggesting the format. “[People] maybe feel like, in the culture they’re in, bringing that up will not be received very well,” he says. “But I’d say the majority of us have these same intuitions” about the phone’s conversational advantages. Text-skeptical people do rear their heads occasionally. In 2017, \u003ca href=\"https://www.wired.com/2017/05/phone-call-renaissance/\"\u003eWired\u003c/a\u003e even predicted that the phone call was poised for a comeback. It has yet to materialize, but hope springs eternal.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eGerkin has taken up the same tactic I have to test the waters: simply asking people if they’d like to give him a call. “The assumption that convenience means written, quick communication is a thing that needs to be challenged,” he says, even though it’s sometimes true. The trick, according to Gerkin, is to be more actively thoughtful about which medium might be best suited to a particular interaction. He nods to the work of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Sherry Turkle, who \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/01/the-eavesdropper/355727/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eargues\u003c/a\u003e that texting and emailing are often useful for quick, logistical, or low-priority communications, but that for more complex matters, spoken conversations can’t be replaced.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e“Quick” communication and “complex” communication aren’t always distinct categories, though. In overlapping cases, the correct medium to use will have to be negotiated between conversation partners. Paul, my editor, is ambivalent about phone calls because his job requires much more multitasking than mine does, which means sometimes our priorities in the moment differ. \u003cem\u003e[Editor’s note: Hi, Amanda.]\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThankfully, solving that problem is simple: Instead of calling him, I just ask via Slack if he wants to call me. Asking also lets those with more severe phone-related anxiety opt out, and it helps identify people in your social circle who, like you, are secret chat-wanters.

The song’s guitar splatters conjured lineage stretching from Chuck Berry. But the cool blue tones of the keyboard and the precise ticktock of the percussion also signaled a new era.

Round and round they go, quietly weaving a web of technology that helps power the world. Sometimes they hit a snag. A satellite can find itself on a dangerous collision course with another object—usually a piece of space junk, sometimes another satellite.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThis is the scenario that played out between the European Space Agency and SpaceX earlier this month, on the Labor Day holiday in the United States. Orbital data showed a probability of collision that was becoming worrisomely high. Unless someone made a move, the satellites could smash into each other within days. A crash could be disastrous. So ESA sent SpaceX an email.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eEmail, believe it or not, is a common form of communication between satellite operators, whether they work for an intergovernmental agency of 22 nations or a company founded by Elon Musk. Sometimes they might use the phone. There is no international network of notifications for satellite traffic. When the data suggest trouble on the horizon, one satellite operator usually fires off an email and then waits for the other to reply.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eUsually, the operators discuss who will dodge whom, tweaking a satellite’s altitude just enough to avoid danger. But slow responses—or none at all—can make the looming encounter seem like a game of chicken.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eESA was the first to reach out. SpaceX responded, saying it had no plans to adjust the position of the satellite. The probability of a collision was about 1 in 50,000 then, and satellite operators usually don’t make moves until the likelihood reaches more than 1 in 10,000.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe satellites hit that threshold within a day of the email exchange.

And more risk means more emails and phone calls.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e“If you have to deal with one or two close approaches a month, picking up the phone might be fine,” says Brian Weeden, a space-policy expert at the Secure World Foundation, a nonprofit group that promotes peaceful uses of space. “But if you now have to deal with dozens or hundreds, it’s not going to scale.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eCollision avoidance is a knotty process from start to finish. ESA, SpaceX, and virtually every satellite operator rely on orbital data collected by \u003ca href=\"https://www.stratcom.mil/Portals/8/Documents/CSpOC_Factsheet_2018.pdf\"\u003ea unit of the U.S. military\u003c/a\u003e. The Air Force’s 18th Space Control Squadron tracks about 23,000 artificial objects bigger than a softball, a tiny slice of which are functioning satellites. If a collision starts looking possible, the unit issues warnings to the appropriate operators.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eBut the data are limited, which Weeden attributes to aging computer systems and information-sharing policies, aimed at protecting national-security interests, that can \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/19/17475940/trump-space-council-traffic-control-system-junk\"\u003eleave operators in the dark\u003c/a\u003e. In practice, that means satellite trackers don’t know exactly where something is in space, so they cannot say with certainty whether two objects will collide. When operators prepare for potential maneuvers, they combine the military data with their own knowledge of the satellite’s position, taking into account “uncertainties in orbit information,” as ESA \u003ca href=\"http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Safety/ESA_spacecraft_dodges_large_constellation\"\u003eput it\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/01/case-inbox-infinity/579673/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: The case for inbox infinity\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIn most cases, one half of the standoff is a piece of inactive junk, a dead satellite or a shard leftover from a previous collision. In these cases, satellite operators take unilateral action. Two working satellites, and things can get awkward. Earlier this year, Sarah Scoles at \u003cem\u003eWired\u003c/em\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/two-satellites-almost-crashed-heres-how-they-dodged-it/\"\u003edescribed\u003c/a\u003e the reactions of Spire and Capella, two commercial companies, to a collision warning. “Spire, which operates around 60 small satellites that track ships and weather, wasn’t that worried about this warning,” Scoles wrote. “Capella, which has just a single satellite, was.” Imagine that email chain.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIn the United States, satellite operators require approval from regulators to launch, but they aren’t required to take certain actions once in orbit. “There really aren’t any agreed-upon norms on collision avoidance between two active satellites, let alone legal rules,” Weeden says. “We’ve always relied on the assumption that satellite operators will be responsible and ‘do the right thing.’”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe satellite owners can communicate through the Air Force or initiate contact themselves. Sometimes, they’re neighbors who are used to making room for each other in their shared orbit. The conversation is simple, quick. “When you’re living in an orbital shell like ours, you start to develop the relationships with others that are in that area, whether that’s a constellation or single vehicles,” says Walt Everetts, vice president for satellite operations and ground development at Iridium, a U.S. company that has more than 70 communications satellites.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWhen facing down an unfamiliar satellite, operators can usually find contact information in the warnings from the U.S. military or online space-tracking databases.

Faced with silence from SpaceX, ESA officials decided they’d be the ones to back down. They had to trust that SpaceX wouldn’t budge; if both satellites shifted positions, they could end up smacking into each other anyway. Musk has said the Starlink satellites are designed to receive warning alerts and maneuver autonomously around other objects—a procedure it has\u003ca href=\"https://qz.com/1701070/spacex-missed-a-satellite-collision-warning/\"\u003e already tested\u003c/a\u003e more than a dozen times, according to \u003cem\u003eQuartz\u003c/em\u003e.

(ESA learned about the glitch in media reports, he said.) A SpaceX spokesperson says staff “implemented corrections” and reached out to ESA that week.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe Air Force’s 18th Space Control Squadron counted just over 100 dodge maneuvers in 2018, though since satellite operators aren’t required to report the dodges, the true number may be much higher. Most warnings about potential collisions don’t amount to real danger: Last year, the 18th Space Control Squadron generated nearly 9 million, according to an Air Force spokesperson, and only 1 percent met what the unit deemed “emergency criteria.” With so many notifications flying around, experts say the industry needs a more sophisticated system for managing space traffic, equipped with some automation and a bit more information-sharing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eAutomated space-traffic control is a nice idea, but probably unrealistic, says Lisa Ruth Rand, a historian who studies space debris.

But in a sense, I was prepared for that because I was coming to a foreign country—I knew that, as an immigrant, there would be some culture shock and some feelings of loneliness.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut I think what happens with some first-generation college students and others who come to college and experience that same sense of dislocation is that they might not have something to attribute it to—something that can frame their experience in a way where it’s clear that it’s not about them as individuals not belonging, but that they come from a different place, with perhaps different cultural norms. I, on the other hand, was ready to be an outsider.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePinsker: \u003c/strong\u003eWhat else would a more honest narrative of class mobility include?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMorton: \u003c/strong\u003eI think one feature that we often don’t acknowledge is the effect on the people on the other end, the people who are in a striver’s original community. I mean, there are things to be gained: Of course friends and family feel proud when one of their own goes on and achieves a certain measure of success. And there might even be financial rewards—I interviewed a few people who would send money back home. But I think the potential effect on these relationships, and how they might fray with distance, is often something that we don’t talk about.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePinsker: \u003c/strong\u003eIn the book, you argue that being upwardly mobile doesn’t in and of itself have to introduce trade-offs like this. What is it about the way American society is set up that makes this the case?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMorton: \u003c/strong\u003eThe way that American society is set up concentrates opportunities in some communities and concentrates disadvantages in others. And I think that’s what makes it hard for those who grew up in communities in which disadvantage is concentrated to find opportunities for advancement and retain a connection to their own communities—the opportunities for advancement are somewhere else.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMore and more, we’re becoming segregated, and not just in terms of what neighborhood you live in. When you’re upwardly mobile, you’re entering a different world, in which people are not just better off economically, but are friends with people who come from a similar economic class, are marrying people from a similar economic class, are sending their kids to school with people from a similar economic class. And that kind of segregation makes it so that finding opportunity often requires you to enter these communities that might seem very disconnected from your own.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePinsker: \u003c/strong\u003eIn the book, you make a bunch of references to a culture of college—a sort of code of behavior for being a successful student. This culture is often invisible to people born into affluence, but its existence is very apparent to those, like first-generation college students, who weren’t exposed to it growing up. How would you describe some of the features of this culture?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMorton: \u003c/strong\u003eSome of this has to do with the mechanisms by which a lot of academic opportunities are distributed. For example, to get a certain scholarship or to get into graduate school, often you have to ask for letters of recommendation. And getting good letters of recommendation really depends on developing a relationship with a professor over time. Writing good papers, raising your hand in class and making a comment—sure, that can help. But if you are coming into a professor’s office hours, if you’re emailing with them, that can really help establish the bond that will get you a good letter of recommendation. A lot of first-generation college students have no idea that that’s what they’re supposed to be doing—they didn’t grow up learning that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother example is being assertive in class—putting forward your own opinion, raising your hand. In college, that’s not a sign of not understanding, but something that professors look upon positively. So what participation means can be very opaque to students who are not familiar with college culture.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe give students a lot of autonomy in college, assuming that they know what choices they have to be making and where to seek advice. But for students who haven’t dealt with an institution like a college before, that can be quite daunting. I remember, my first year at Princeton, going to a math class that I got placed into based on a test I took. The professor never made eye contact and just wrote on the board. I was so confused, and I thought, \u003cem\u003eI can’t afford to screw this up—I’m just going to drop this class\u003c/em\u003e. I didn’t think to talk to the graduate assistant or go back to the adviser who put me in this class. And, of course, I couldn’t turn to my family to ask them for advice, because they had no idea either. In that situation, you just make the choice that seems the least risky.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePinsker: \u003c/strong\u003eWhat do you think it would look like in practice for this culture of college to change? You mention office hours and letters of recommendation—would you want a system where there aren’t as many rewards attached to being a regular attendee of office hours or where recommendation letters don’t carry so much sway?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMorton: \u003c/strong\u003eI like those suggestions—I think recommendation letters could play less of a role. One big [change I’d suggest], actually, is valuing good teaching. We talk a lot about good teaching in K–12, but we don’t really reward good teaching in higher ed. A lot of the system depends on either researchers who are rewarded for investing in their research or adjunct and temporary faculty who are scrambling to make ends meet and have to teach hundreds of students in order to do that. If we focused on good pedagogy, that would significantly alter some of the culture in the classroom. For instance, if there are only a handful of students who are always talking and are always getting your attention, it can be a sign you’re not doing something right as a teacher.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt can be difficult because professors tend to be the kind of people who have succeeded in higher education as it’s already structured. So I think that the dominant culture should be different, that it should be more inclusive. We need more people from marginalized backgrounds, from communities that have been historically disadvantaged, to be in positions of power on campus in order to see that change.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePinsker: \u003c/strong\u003eIn the context of your own teaching, how do you think about the influence you now have over that dominant culture?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMorton: \u003c/strong\u003eEducators are often in a fraught position because on the one hand, you want your students to succeed, particularly when you’re teaching students who, if they got a college degree and somewhat learned to “play the game,” it could really bring them financial stability. On the other hand, you’re thinking, \u003cem\u003eI wish the rules weren’t set up this way\u003c/em\u003e. And part of what you’re helping students do is to think critically about their environment and the ideologies that are around them. So as a teacher, you’re playing both sides, to some extent.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePersonally, I like the idea of pushing the boundaries from within your role. There’s a more radical argument that you should teach your students to dismantle the system, to take it all down. And the problem with taking that perspective is that for students who are in this vulnerable position, a lot depends on them succeeding. I admire the ones who protest and organize—I think that’s wonderful. But I don’t think that’s advice that I would offer to all of my students. Getting them to positions where they feel more secure can allow them to be a bit more revolutionary in a strategic way.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/UYrLGPcSVCc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/UYrLGPcSVCc/","published":"2019-09-16T15:30:29Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-598093"},{"title":"Seven Questions That Need Answers Before Any Attack on Iran","content":"\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003ePresident Donald Trump says the United States is “locked and loaded” to retaliate against whoever struck Saudi Arabia’s oil refineries on Saturday.

Roosevelt and King Abdul Aziz ibn Saud in February 1945. Yet the two countries have never quite bound themselves to an unconditional mutual-defense treaty in the way that, say, the United States and Japan have done. When Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in August 1990, the United States made clear that an attack on Saudi Arabia would draw a U.S. response—but that decision was based on the perception at the time that U.S. interests were at stake, not on any treaty duty.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHas Congress spoken?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003ePresident George W. Bush twice sought and obtained congressional authorization to use force, once against al-Qaeda, then against Iraq. President George H. W. Bush sought and got congressional authorization to expel Iraq from Kuwait. Where’s Trump’s authorization to attack Iran? An attack on Iran would not be a police action in a failed state, such as the U.S. intervention in Somalia in the early 1990s; it would not be low-risk in terms of American lives and money, such as President Bill Clinton’s operations in the former Yugoslavia in the mid-1990s. An attack on Iran in defense of Saudi Arabia could—and very likely would—rapidly escalate into a big war across a range of battlefields, including cyber, all over the world. Starting such a war obviously exceeds any historic or reasonable definition of inherent presidential power.

The attack on the Saudi refineries raised the price of oil, but it’s doubtful that the spike will endure—and anyway, it is not obvious that an ultralow oil price is in the U.S. national interest.

These cats have cultural links to the region dating back hundreds, if not thousands, of years: The word \u003cem\u003echeetah\u003c/em\u003e derives from the Sanskrit word \u003cem\u003ecitraka\u003c/em\u003e—“spotted one”—and in the 16th and early 17th centuries, the revered Mughal emperor Akbar kept more than 1,000 as his hunting companions. By the early 20th century, though, their numbers had shrunk, and in 1952 they were officially declared extinct on the subcontinent.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Indian government has spent decades trying to bring cheetahs back. At first, conservationists imagined either importing or cloning Asiatic cheetahs, the subspecies that once thrived in India. When that strategy failed, they turned their attention to a closely related subspecies, found across Africa in pockets of the south, west, and east.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBoth Asiatic and African cheetahs are sleek and elegant, with sand-colored coats covered in black spots, and black “teardrop” marks that run downward from their eyes. Asiatic cheetahs, however, are slightly smaller, and their coats a lighter shade. But those small distinctions mask fundamental questions about what defines a native species and whether one subspecies can be swapped in for another. In the past few years, a narrow scientific debate about cheetah genetics has become a question of legal import, reaching all the way up to India’s Supreme Court.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 2012, as the court was hearing a case about the protection of India’s native lions, it learned about a government plan to bring African cheetahs into India.

As the country’s grasslands were repurposed for agriculture, both the cheetah and its prey were pushed into suboptimal habitats, where they struggled to survive. Conservationists, including M. K. Ranjitsinh, India’s first director of wildlife preservation, saw this trade as the best chance to preserve not just the country’s cheetah legacy, but also the land where the cats once thrived. “In India, symbols are very important. In the name of the tiger, we saved something more valuable than the tiger: We saved the \u003cem\u003ehabitat\u003c/em\u003e of the tiger,” Ranjitsinh told me. “By that same token, I was hoping the cheetah could save our most productive ecosystems, the grasslands.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eConservationists began work to increase populations of prey such as the blackbuck (Indian antelope) and the chikara (Indian gazelle).\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eBut talks with Iran fell apart after the Islamic Revolution of 1979.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe idea of reinvigorating India’s Asiatic-cheetah population had a second life, though. Twenty-two years later, in 2001, Lalji Singh, the “\u003ca href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/lalji-singh-father-of-dna-fingerprinting-in-india-passes-away/article21389954.ece\"\u003efather of DNA fingerprinting in India\u003c/a\u003e,” came to Iran with a new proposition: Let his lab collect sperm and tissue samples from Asiatic cheetahs, in order to clone one. He planned to use an Indian leopard as a surrogate mother for the newly cloned cheetah cub. Iran rejected the approach, and the idea fizzled out.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith the Asiatic cheetah off the table, conservationists considered a new approach: introduce an African subspecies into India. Ranjitsinh and other experts believed that African cheetahs could sub in for the Asiatic as the top predator of the grassland’s food chain. In 2009, they organized an international conference in Rajasthan to discuss the idea with other influential conservationists. For that group, the prospect of redeveloping cheetah habitats in India was exciting; the species as a whole has lost approximately 90 percent of its former range and is classified as vulnerable.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the attendees was Stephen O’Brien, a geneticist who founded the Laboratory of Genomic Diversity at the National Cancer Institute. O’Brien had long been interested in animal genetics, and he was inclined to see African cheetahs as a suitable replacement for Asiatic ones. Since the 1980s, his research has advanced the theory that the cheetah genome, across subspecies, is remarkably uniform.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eO’Brien attributes that uniformity to two genetic “bottlenecks,” or brushes with extinction. A small number of cheetahs—which evolved first in North America—survived the first bottleneck by crossing the Bering Strait into Eurasia and Africa more than 100,000 years ago. Their population rebounded until hitting the second bottleneck toward the end of the last Ice Age, 10,000 to 12,000 years ago, which wiped out most of the world’s large mammals. The cheetah lived but, O’Brien argues, emerged genetically limited, having resorted to inbreeding to survive. In this version of events, some subspecies diverged from one another as little as 5,000 years ago, and today the minute genetic variation in cheetahs is “like the amount of distance between the people of Baltimore and the people of Philadelphia,” O’Brien says.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOther experts disagree. The work of the conservation geneticist Pamela Burger and a team of researchers from the University of Veterinary Medicine in Vienna revealed “significant divergences” among different subspecies of cheetah and showed both Asiatic and Northeast African cheetahs to be genetically distinct from South African cheetahs. The theory of a 12,000-year-old genetic bottleneck is “not written in stone,” Burger says, and the bottleneck could have happened 40,000 years ago, giving subspecies more time to differentiate.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis seemingly esoteric argument over bottlenecks and subspecies has real consequences for the future of the world’s cheetahs. Introducing African cheetahs to India, where they would have another habitat in which to reproduce, could aid the long-term survival of the whole species. But substituting one subspecies for another risks erasing valuable genetic adaptations. Burger suggests, for example, that Asiatic cheetahs developed specialized traits that made them adept at living in mountainous regions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe data produced by Burger and her fellow researchers \u003ca href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/01/110117082300.htm\"\u003eintensified the call\u003c/a\u003e to save the remaining Asiatic cheetahs in Iran, but the results were also used in India to convince the Supreme Court that African cheetahs could not be substituted for Asiatic cheetahs. O’Brien says he does not believe that his work and Burger’s are in conflict, but rather that they interpreted the data differently. However, in 2017, he co-authored an \u003ca href=\"https://academic.oup.com/jhered/article/108/6/671/3836924\"\u003eunofficial rebuttal\u003c/a\u003e in the \u003cem\u003eJournal of Heredity\u003c/em\u003e that said Burger’s research included “ambiguous and imprecise dating calculations,” which the Supreme Court relied on.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor her part, Burger believes her team’s data stand on their own and provide an “enlarged view” of the different cheetah subspecies. She’s not vehemently opposed to the introduction of African cheetahs in India, but explains, “It would be like having an African lion in a wild park in Europe. Of course, you can have that, but then it’s an African lion living in Europe.

Cheetahs with the best chance of success would be those that don’t have a history of attacking livestock, are savvy to threats from stronger predators, and fit within certain age parameters. Marker is optimistic about the effort, provided that it’s handled correctly. “Cheetahs,” she says, “are very adaptable.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/Fs-vabBit-w\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/Fs-vabBit-w/","published":"2019-09-16T13:29:49Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-598066"},{"title":"\u003cem\u003eDownton\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eDownton\u003c/em\u003e, Revolution","content":"\u003cp\u003eThe new \u003cem\u003eDownton Abbey\u003c/em\u003e movie is a drug, a delight, a palliative for the pain of being, a balm for battered emotions, a cure for cynicism. Well, almost. After two hours mainlining Carson’s beetling eyebrows, the Dowager Countess’s caustic comebacks, Mr. Molesley’s quivering histrionics every time aristocracy enters his airspace, and Lady Mary’s phlegmatic disdain, I left the movie as elated as Edith after a single driving lesson. But on the 10-minute walk back to the office, as the serotonin buzz began to wear off, I started to think about the totality of what I’d just seen.

There’s some sorcery in this stupid drama and the way it numbs and entrances in equal measure by doing the same things over and over again. Lord Grantham will make horrible decisions governed by arrogance and insecurity; his family (and servants) will endeavor to fix them. Lady Edith will have some kind of emotional crisis. (Just a lone utterance of the name Marigold at this point is enough to provoke shuddering flashbacks.) Violet and Cousin Isobel will have a loving conflict that allows for maximal verbal riposte and minimal tension.

The Eton-educated Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson is presiding over arguably the most ineffectual, least democratic government in British history, which even his own cabinet members keep scuttling away from as the water lines rise. The establishment isn’t exactly shining in this specific blip on the timeline. And yet here \u003cem\u003eDownton\u003c/em\u003e is, stuffed to the gills with good claret and Mrs. Patmore’s rissoles, ready to remind us that things worked better when everyone knew their place.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is, the series’ creator, Julian Fellowes, would probably say, an unfair assessment of what \u003cem\u003eDownton\u003c/em\u003e stands for. Over six seasons, the ITV drama (which aired on PBS in the United States) charted the changing fortunes of a British stately home and its residents. These included the members of the Crawley family, a genial, aristocratic clan cursed with three daughters, and their servants. \u003cem\u003eDownton, \u003c/em\u003eFellowes \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/11/magazine/julian-fellowes-the-creator-of-downton-abbey.html\"\u003etold \u003cem\u003eThe New York Times Magazine\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e in 2011, was actually very egalitarian, in that it refused to portray the landed gentry as superior beings and the working classes as scurrilous wretches—or vice versa. “We treat the characters of the servants and the family exactly the same,” Fellowes said. “Some of them are nice, some of them are not nice, some of them are funny, some of them are not, but there is no division between the servants and the family to mark that.” By the show’s final episode, \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/03/the-politics-of-downton-abbey/472608/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eI wrote in 2016\u003c/a\u003e, \u003cem\u003eDownton\u003c/em\u003e even seemed to be quietly signaling that it had been on the side of the proletariat all along.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDemocracy!

The \u003cem\u003eDownton Abbey\u003c/em\u003e movie sacrifices all the seeds of social mobility it planted in Season 6 for what amounts to an anesthetizing fever dream, a hearty reassurance from Fellowes that you can, in fact, go home again, and that home might have electricity now but the \u003ca href=\"https://janeaustensworld.wordpress.com/2012/01/27/the-green-baize-door-dividing-line-between-servant-and-master/\"\u003egreen-baize door\u003c/a\u003e is as felted and impermeable as it ever was. Mrs. Patmore’s B\u0026amp;B? Forgotten. Daisy leaving domestic service to help her father-in-law with his farm? Never happened. Even Mr. Carson’s retirement is rudely interrupted by his borderline-inappropriate infatuation with Lady Mary, who shows up to request his help (for which he naturally will not be compensated) when the king and queen of England decide to pay a visit to Downton.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat follows looks, on the surface, like a comedy of errors involving haughty interlopers, an absurd assassination story line, missing silver, and a royal marital crisis.

The initial thrill among the servants of being allowed the honor of waiting on the royal family is punctured when the king’s servants arrive. If Fellowes graciously allowed his Downton domestics a handful of human qualities such as intelligence and charm, he concedes none whatsoever to the royal staff, who cuckoo their way into the household and kick the disgruntled Downton loyalists out of their nests. “Excuse me, I am not a \u003cem\u003ebutler\u003c/em\u003e,” huffs the king’s butler. “I am the king’s page of the back stairs.” The revolution has been euphemized.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt says something about \u003cem\u003eDownton Abbey\u003c/em\u003e that when a lifetime of suppressed radical fervor finally boils over on the show (movie), its target isn’t the blessed Crawley family, the heads of the Commonwealth, or even the system itself. It’s … some rival servants who seem to have developed airs above their station. And with that, we’re off to the races. “Mr. Bates and I, we want to defend Downton’s honor,” Anna says. Mrs. Hughes sighs and tells everyone that they’ll probably all end up in Botany Bay. Thomas, infuriated by being deposed by Carson once again, abandons ship and goes to a gay bar, and honestly we should all be so lucky. There are the usual anachronistic turns of phrase (a reference to the daily grind of the “9 to 5”) and subplots (Edith’s husband is very worried about his paternity leave, as a man, in 1927). People doubt Tom’s allegiances to England, again. Daisy develops a crush on a strapping young man who comes to fix the boiler. The strings start soaring every time the camera lands on a single brick or hammer beam of Highclere Castle.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou love to see it, probably. Because \u003cem\u003eDownton\u003c/em\u003e as a product has always excelled at offering just the right amount of comfort. A little metaphorical rain falls on the Crawleys, as rain tends to do, but they’re largely insulated from the consequences of reality by the mythos of Downton itself, an institution that seems to mean something folkloric to everyone around them. Britain’s past greatness is continually being evoked as a totem of hope and glory. God, Lord Grantham sighs with relief, when the actual rain abates in time for a royal parade, “is a monarchist.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWatching the movie, I sighed, I laughed, I shook my fists, I made notes that had far too many exclamation marks, such as “Scandal!

It was the first day of school. Around a table sat 10 Iowans—nine women and one man—teachers, school administrators, education experts. Bennet set the box down and took a chair. Jacketless and tieless, medium height, medium build, slight hunch, blue shirt coming untucked, pale-brown shoes, red-brown hair conventionally combed and parted, low-wattage smile flickering across thin lips: He might have been the preschool director, except she was a woman named Celeste Kelling sitting to his right. Even the position of school superintendent—which Bennet once held in Denver—would have needed a little more flash. When he introduced himself as a senator from Colorado who was running for president, it sounded like a half-apologetic and slightly improbable aside. He wanted to get to his real business, which was listening to these people.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eJudy Russell, who runs Head Start at Drake University, said that she had recently seen a sharp rise in poor children enduring violence and abuse at home.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eBennet leaned forward. “Tell me more about that.

Starting pay for preschool teachers is $13 an hour. Juli Bretz, the school nurse, barely made minimum wage as a teacher’s associate before quitting, taking out student loans, and going to nursing school. State funding is miserly and bureaucratically tortured into different strands that need to be braided together. Kids attend class in half-day shifts because the money for each time period comes from separate sources. When you think of Des Moines, you don’t think first of poverty, but three-quarters of the city’s public-school students qualify for free or reduced lunch—a higher rate than Denver’s. Half of them don’t attend preschool, and the yearly wait list comes to a hundred children.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/08/michael-bennet-platform/596974/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: Michael Bennet, mad as hell\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e“If it were up to me, we’d be talking about free pre-K, not free college,” Bennet said. He had just that morning released an education plan calling for, among other things, increased teacher pay and free preschool for every American child through a combination of federal and state money. “My sense traveling around Iowa is that you have the same problems we have in Colorado, which is just a complete underinvestment in our public-education system. We’re not investing the way our parents and grandparents invested in us. It’s not even close.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThey sounded like equals talking about a subject of intense mutual interest: that most basic, perennial, ubiquitous, and all-American subject, our collective failure of poor children. Bennet didn’t ask for votes, or even mention politics. The visit, he said, would be the high point of his week.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e“Any other questions, Senator?” Kelling asked.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e“I’m just so grateful for the work you do,” Bennet said. “I wish that we were treating it with the dignity it deserves.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eNothing is nondescript—in some cases, more effort is needed to know a thing well enough to describe it. This is true of Des Moines; it’s also true of Bennet. His qualities are unspectacular, but in politics they’re unusual, even rare. He listens closely, and he talks like a human being who is trying to figure out what he thinks as he speaks. He reads Montesquieu, Douglass, Whitman, Baldwin, and Jill Lepore, and he writes well (in his book, \u003cem\u003eThe Land of Flickering Lights,\u003c/em\u003e he says of a Ted Cruz filibuster, “His hypocrisy had a papier-mache grandeur to it”). His moderation has nothing to do with political cowardice or softheadedness. He is passionate about education, equality, and self-government, and he’s devoted his political career to turning around the decline of all three. At the same time, he represents a purple state in the almost evenly split upper chamber of a deeply divided republic. “I just believe that we are at our strongest when we have the most—these aren’t political words—but when we have the most fulsome pluralism that we can have, the greatest diversity of opinion, the greatest opportunity for people to weigh in on what we’re doing,” he told me.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"dropcap\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIn another era, Bennet’s name would be attached to pieces of significant, maybe historic legislation.(For example, he has co-authored a bill with Senator Sherrod Brown that, if it ever becomes law, would greatly expand the child tax credit and could reduce child poverty by almost half.) But by his own measure of success, which is actual work done, his career has been a qualified failure. He was appointed to his seat in 2009, then elected the next year and reelected in 2016 (both terrible years for Democrats). During his decade in office, the U.S. Congress has been about the least productive legislature in the world. For eight years the Freedom Caucus held the Republican House majority in a death grip of legislative nihilism; Mitch McConnell used Senate rules and power politics to block the Democratic majority and president, then neuter the Democratic minority. All the while, dark money from wealthy interests has flooded the institution, stopping action on problems that large majorities of Americans want solved, including gun violence and climate change.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eBennet’s book describes five episodes from this dark decade. He avoids extreme partisan terminology and describes at length his effort to compromise with the other side on immigration reform in 2013. But his book is an implied argument for the impossibility of working with the Republican Party.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e“True,” he said. “That’s why I’m for winning races. You have to take a climate policy to Colorado, to Iowa, and you have to win an argument.” It’s still possible, he said, to work with Republicans in Colorado, though it’s becoming much harder—but not Republicans in Washington, D.C. “I don’t relish it. Barack Obama used to say after his election the fever would break. Now we know the fever didn’t break. I believe that if we are going to continue to live in a democracy, which I think is up for grabs, this is the big question for America right now: It is, can we build a coalition of Americans to make Washington do its job? And what issues we pick, what issues we decide to lead with and the way we design those issues, has a lot to do with whether we’ll succeed in that or not.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/10/when-the-culture-war-comes-for-the-kids/596668/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: When the culture war comes for the kids\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003eBennet’s analysis leads him not to a vision of progressive realignment, but to a wariness of Democrats who push for too much. In June, he was the only Democrat among 10 on a debate stage not to raise his hand in favor of decriminalizing illegal border crossings. He was surprised to see all the others with their hand up and thought that the pressure of the televised moment had driven them into an unnecessary and potentially destructive position. Bennet believes that a loud and small core of activists, greatly amplified by social media, is driving the party to potential defeat next November by demanding unpopular maximalist stands. “The Twitter universe has decided that Medicare for All is what we are about, and the Green New Deal,” he said. “The Twitter base of the Democratic Party decides what’s important, not the actual base. The actual base of the Democratic Party are a bunch of people that have never, ever, ever engaged with a politician on Twitter. They are the people we met with today who are teaching school. Those women are invisible to cable television. The children that are in that school are invisible to cable television, and invisible to the Twitter universe.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"dropcap\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThere are many reasons why Bennet stands almost no chance of winning the Democratic nomination. One is that few Americans have heard of him, and—since he failed to qualify for last Thursday night’s debate—few are likely to hear of him in the future. Another is that he only got into the race in May, later than almost all his opponents, including the one—Mayor Pete Buttigieg—who occupies the narrow strip of earnest, low-key, deliberative center-left political ground that Bennet might have claimed. A third is that he lacks what he called “sex appeal, or whatever it is if it’s not that,” and then amended to “star power—and I don’t have it in a way that some of these other candidates do.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e“It” is the power to attract attention, desire, devotion, on a vast impersonal level. Unpromising prospects can acquire star power, or have it conferred on them—Buttigieg is an example, and Andrew Yang is becoming another. Its opposite is a human being in politics who is most comfortable in direct connection with other individual human beings. The disastrous reign of a celebrity president who excites stadiums full of followers might have depressed Americans’ longing for the oceanic feeling in politics, but it continues to thrive.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eStrategically, Bennet has no obvious path to the nomination. The main obstacle is Joe Biden, who blocks the middle way with a candidacy at once large, soft, and potentially implosive. As long as Biden remains strong, no other moderate will gain enough oxygen to thrive. The questions that paralyze Democrats with anxiety—Could Biden survive a round with Trump? Would Warren or Sanders drive away enough swing voters to lose? Is there another candidate who could do better than the three leaders? Can anyone unite the party across lines of age, race, gender, and ideology, and still encompass independents and moderate Republicans?—leave a glimmer of hope for someone currently trapped in the low single digits.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eBennet’s decision to stay in the race despite failing to make the cut for the fall debates has an air of lonely quixotism. He has 20 paid staff and two field offices in Iowa. His highest-profile endorsement came last week from Gary Hart. During the hour-plus that we spent in a Des Moines coffee shop, no one approached our table. It was as if I were talking privately to someone I could have talked to for hours more. Afterward, as I watched Bennet cross the street with an aide and head off in their car to the next event, I had a strong though not really justifiable feeling that there’s something wrong with a political culture in which such a person barely stands a chance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/ORdPAxQ3B9M\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/ORdPAxQ3B9M/","published":"2019-09-16T10:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-598072"},{"title":"The Presidency’s Relentless Race to the Bottom","content":"\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eDonald Trump has changed the presidency—but has he changed it forever?

Beto O’Rourke courts the cameras by barking out the F-word—and selling T-shirts displaying his vulgar quote. At the August debate, Bill de Blasio and Tulsi Gabbard grasped for a boost in the polls by launching Trump-like demagogic attacks on the front-runners. Trump showed America that political experience doesn’t count for Republicans; Pete Buttigieg, Andrew Yang, and Marianne Williamson are trying to convince us that it doesn’t matter for Democrats either—or is even a liability.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eOthers, though, are betting that the public wants a return to normalcy, including a restoration of civility in our public life and dignity in the Oval Office.

One who isn’t unpresidential.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003ePresidents are, by definition, presidential. Clearly, however, Trump has scrambled, at least for now, what that word means. In the past few weeks alone, he’s called the Federal Reserve Board governors “boneheads,” cashiered his third national security adviser in as many years (with a tweet), and doctored a weather map on national TV. From the start of his campaign in 2015, it was evident that Trump would struggle to meet most traditional definitions of presidential behavior. As a candidate, he made fun of the idea that he couldn’t do so, although in the process he refuted his own point. “Presidential is easy,” he insisted at a Connecticut campaign rally in 2016, striding formally around the podium and affecting a stiff tone. “Ladies and gentlemen of Waterbury, it’s a great honor to be with you this morning.” But he looked like a clown.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eYet if Trump has lowered the bar for presidential decorum, the bar has never been fixed in place. From the outset, the very office of the presidency incorporated a contradiction: It was to be both like a monarchy and not a monarchy. Rebelling against the crown, the American colonists wanted a republican society shorn of aristocratic privilege and pretense. But the short-lived Articles of Confederation showed the need for a strong executive to whom a certain amount of deference would be due. Many political struggles in the ensuing decades have centered not just on presidential power and its limits, but also on the extent to which the chief executive should be seen as an exemplar of our finest ideals—or just an ordinary guy who can get the job done.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/01/how-teddy-roosevelt-invented-spin/426699/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eDavid Greenberg: How Teddy Roosevelt invented spin\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003ePresidents began revising standards of presidential comportment as early as 1801, when Thomas Jefferson took office.

Where John Adams had taken, at one point, to donning military regalia, Jefferson chose not to wear a sword at his inauguration or powder his hair. A generation later, Andrew Jackson, the first president to hail from humble stock, threw a wild inaugural that was compared to the barbarian invasion of Rome. At the White House party, drunks tracked muddy boot prints through the executive mansion and smashed the china, forcing the new president to escape through a window.

A half century ago, college students listening to a professor like me lecturing to them from a podium would have worn coats and ties; today they surf social media. The rest of public life, including the presidency, has undergone parallel transformations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStarting with newsreels and photography at the turn of the century, Americans began to labor under the illusion that they knew their presidents. Theodore Roosevelt, whose outsize personality and boisterous brood of children attracted incessant press coverage, personalized the presidency as no one had before. With his toothy grin and ubiquitous pince-nez, his face became iconic. The mass-communications media of radio and then TV furthered the false sense of intimacy between citizens and public figures, and encouraged more informal styles of speaking and acting in public. Franklin D. Roosevelt famously began his first fireside chat, “My friends, I want to talk for a few minutes with the people of the United States about banking.” It began a revolution in presidential communication, killing off the grand, flowery stem-winders of men such as William Jennings Bryan and ushering in a more direct, unpretentious mode.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIn the following decades, presidential candidates came to use \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eI\u003c/em\u003e in their speeches far more than had the orators of yesteryear. Harry Truman, far from a natural rhetorician, struggled with speechmaking until a broadcast coach taught him to use a semi-ad-libbed style, in which he spoke from notes instead of a fixed script. The looser, freer technique—on display at the 1948 Democratic convention—won credit for his political renaissance. Dwight Eisenhower, too, submitted to the tutelage of the actor Robert Montgomery and began delivering his White House speeches resting casually against his desk or wearing powder-blue suits, the better to affect an easygoing, relatable manner. And if Ike’s casual wear toned down the formality of the office, it was nothing next to John F. Kennedy’s being photographed sailing without a shirt on.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eBut especially after the society-wide revolt against established authority that began in the 1960s, presidents struggled to adjust. At the height of the Vietnam War, with his approval ratings falling, Lyndon Johnson agreed to try something different for a November 1967 press conference. With a lavaliere microphone clipped to his lapel, Johnson at one point removed his eyeglasses, stepped from the podium, and began to stride around: The funny, spontaneous Johnson reporters knew in private emerged. “He waved his arms, chopped the air … scowled, laughed, and ran his voice through a range of sound from high-volume anger to quiet, self-deprecating gentleness,” reported \u003cem\u003eThe\u003c/em\u003e \u003cem\u003eNew York Times\u003c/em\u003e, in one of many positive reviews Johnson won for the performance. White House aides were euphoric and urged him to do it more often. “God damn it,” Johnson replied with a growl, “I’m not in show business.” He refused to wear the lavaliere mic again, calling it unpresidential.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/12/the-front-runner-fallacy/413173/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eDavid Greenberg: The front-runner fallacy\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eRichard Nixon offered a different sort of unpresidential conduct: Tapes caught him cursing, fuming, trashing his enemies, and plotting petty acts of revenge. This behavior, when disclosed, helped turn even some conservative supporters against him. Indeed, as Nixon’s experience showed, a certain concealment of the president’s backstage operations was necessary for the presidency to maintain its mystique and its attendant air of authority. Efforts to prove oneself a regular American by showing off one’s family or private habits could backfire by stripping the president of whatever remained of his aura of greatness. Jimmy Carter won the presidency with Jeffersonian gestures of ordinariness, sleeping in voters’ guest rooms and living rooms while on the campaign trail, and acknowledging to \u003cem\u003ePlayboy\u003c/em\u003e magazine the “lust” he felt for women besides his wife. He routinely said things like “I don’t claim to know all the answers.” But eventually, he found, the public judged him feckless and didn’t take him seriously enough. The absence of formality around his presidency eroded the gravitas he needed to govern with credibility.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIn the ensuing decades, the idea of “the incredible shrinking presidency”—originally coined by \u003cem\u003eTime\u003c/em\u003e magazine in 1992, to apply to George H. W. Bush—became a cliché. We’ve gotten used to presidents wearing jeans and windbreakers, jogging around the National Mall, appearing on comedy shows, talking about sex, using foul language, and otherwise behaving in purportedly undignified ways. What may be most shocking about Trump’s continued violations of behavioral norms is the revelation of just how many norms were still standing in 2017 when he took office.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eBut should candidates surrender to society’s seemingly relentless race to the bottom? Or is it to trust that comporting oneself with dignity and appealing to our higher selves will always have a place in politics as well?

On the other hand, there are surely also a lot of Americans who, like O’Rourke, really don’t give a … damn.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/Gp4L_D9WFX0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/Gp4L_D9WFX0/","published":"2019-09-16T10:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-598057"},{"title":"Trapped in Juárez: Life in the Migrant Limbo","content":"\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eCIUDAD JUÁREZ, Mexico—I met Dana outside the Little Habana restaurant, where she was hunched over a cellphone, struggling to understand a series of prompts in English, directions from a U.S. immigration detention contractor, on how to deposit enough money to call her husband.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eDana and her husband left Ciego de Ávila, Cuba, in March and crossed the Mexico-U.S. border in June.

The ruling would force migrants to first apply for asylum in one of the countries they passed through, otherwise they will be denied U.S. protection.

But in truth, there is a third. Some migrants are deciding to cross illegally in the desert, where they travel for days through remote, harsh terrain in 100-degree heat in part because of Mexico’s National Guard. Mexico’s leftist president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, hastily created the force in February to combat drug traffickers, mostly drawing from other branches of the military. But in July, \u003ca href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/07/13/741391138/a-look-at-mexicos-new-national-guard\"\u003eMexico deployed thousands of soldiers\u003c/a\u003e to the northern border after Trump threatened Mexico with tariffs unless the government reduced the flow of migrants to the United States. Now every 50 yards or so a soldier with a rifle stood, often in the shade of a tree if one existed. Behind them was a sloping canal. A trickle of the Rio Grande. Then the rusted U.S. border fence.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eMexico says the soldiers have reduced migration to the \u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/mexicos-crackdown-on-migrants-is-stalling-us-officials-say-ahead-of-talks-next-week/2019/09/06/b46296a6-d0b3-11e9-8c1c-7c8ee785b855_story.html\"\u003eU.S. by 56 percent\u003c/a\u003e. And while some migrants are riding the free buses provided by the government back to their homes in Central America, the overwhelming majority remain in Juárez. Yet the longer they stay here, the more a desert crossing seems like a good option.

The result was not a decrease in overall migration, but more deaths as smugglers adjusted their routes. Now about 70 percent of migrants are families, and it’s easy to imagine the outcome, says Isacson, who’s already studying these effects. “You’re going to see more children crossing in the desert, and that means \u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/06/26/father-daughter-who-drowned-border-dove-into-river-desperation/\"\u003eyou’ll see more of their bodies in the desert\u003c/a\u003e,” he told me. “It’s going to be horrible, and it all seems pretty predictable.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eLike a wall, MPP and the latest Supreme Court ruling, function as a deterrent to migration.

Members in the Iowa chapters have been clear from the get-go about their 2020 plans: “We don’t talk about Bernie,” Caroline Schoonover, a co-chair of the Central Iowa group, \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/04/democratic-socialism-surging-iowa-ahead-2020/586441/?utm_source=feed\"\u003etold me back in April\u003c/a\u003e. “He’s not a factor in our organizing at all.” Individual members would be welcome to volunteer for Sanders on their own time, she said, but campaigning for him as a chapter would distract from their local efforts, which include advocating for tenants’ rights and raising the alarm about so-called \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/03/nifla-becerra-crisis-pregnancy-centers-supreme-court/555887/?utm_source=feed\"\u003ecrisis pregnancy centers\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBack in March, the DSA’s National Political Committee leadership team voted to endorse Sanders, after a \u003ca href=\"http://inthesetimes.com/article/21803/inside-the-democratic-socialists-of-americas-big-decision-to-endorse-bernie\"\u003econtroversial\u003c/a\u003e vote in which only about a quarter of DSA’s membership weighed in. The committee then established an independent campaign for Sanders called DSA for Bernie, which operates separately from the official Sanders campaign and which individual chapters can join.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut as the February 3 caucuses creep closer, Iowa DSA members will be focused on local efforts, including organizing local tenants’ unions. Three Iowa DSA leaders told me that while members are allowed to volunteer for Sanders on their own time, the chapter won’t formally campaign for him. “Iowa DSA chapters don’t have as many resources compared to other larger cities,” said Alex Loehrer, 32, who co-chairs the DSA chapter in Iowa City. “As much as many of our members love Bernie, we see our importance more so in building class consciousness and working-class power in our communities, because that will ultimately last longer.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s “a lot bigger than a few back-and-forths on Twitter,” Javier Miranda, the 25-year-old leader of the DSA chapter in Ames, Iowa, told me. “There’s a fear that if we engage in too much electoral organizing we are losing our capacity to imagine outside the system that we are currently living in,” he said. People criticizing Iowa’s DSA chapters tend to live in larger cities with active labor movements, Miranda told me. “In Ames, Iowa, that is not the case,” he said. “It makes more sense for us to focus on building that movement, to make that longer-lasting change.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother part of the Iowa members’ aversion to formally participating in electoral politics is their disdain for their state’s biggest claim to fame: the caucuses, which every four years help determine the rest of the presidential race. “The caucus is not an accessible process,” Joe Ellerbroek, who co-chairs the Des Moines DSA alongside Schoonover, told me. The state Democratic Party has been \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/08/j-ann-selzer-dncs-virtual-caucus-decision/597184/?utm_source=feed\"\u003efielding complaints\u003c/a\u003e to this effect for years from Iowans with inflexible work or personal schedules. (This cycle, the caucuses will take place on a Monday.) It’s both an undemocratic and a “deliberately confusing” process,” Ellerbroek said—a process neither he nor members of his chapter want to prop up with their time or funds. He and other Iowa DSA leaders want their groups to provide a consistent force for socialist change in the state long after Sanders campaign staffers have packed up and left.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“That’s what Bernie Sanders is asking people to do when he talks about a movement that needs to be bigger than just getting him into office,” Ellerbroeck said. “If you’ve ever been here in March after a caucus, all the serotonin has left the state,” he added. “There’s vacuum of energy and purpose—but there are still people getting evicted.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOther DSA members, though, fundamentally disagree with the Iowa chapters’ approach. They argue that the state’s first-in-the-nation contest makes local chapters uniquely positioned to help Sanders win the Democratic nomination. After all, the Vermont senator only lost by \u003ca href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2016/02/iowa-sanders-clinton-audit-218905\"\u003e0.25 percent\u003c/a\u003e to Hillary Clinton in 2016—the closest margin in the history of the Iowa Caucus. Support from local DSAers, members argue, will be crucial.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“People are more tuned into politics during presidential elections than at any other point in their lives,” Michael Esealuka, the 26-year-old co-chair of the New Orleans DSA chapter, told me. She respects that individual chapters can make their own decisions, she said, but not joining DSA for Bernie is the wrong one. “We have a rare opportunity to have an out-and-proud socialist front-runner. We need to be running with this opportunity.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBy not campaigning for Sanders, some said, Iowa chapters are missing an opportunity to attract new members to the group. “If they could take some credit for flipping [Iowa] to Bernie, they would get so many Bernie Sanders supporters calling them up,” says John, a DSA member from a chapter in a metropolitan area who asked not to be further identified in order to speak candidly. John told me that “the majority of DSA” is frustrated with Iowa chapters’ approach to the presidential election. He also doesn’t understand their reluctance to participate in the caucus system; all electoral politics is “unfair” and “corrupted by money,” he told me, echoing Sanders’s own language on the stump. “We’ve got to fight on that terrain, though. If we don’t, we risk becoming irrelevant.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCampaigning for Sanders, by definition, means campaigning for everything he stands for—from Medicare for All to building working-class power, members said. “Bernie connects all of these other things,” Megan Svoboda, the chair of the DSA for Bernie campaign and a member of the DSA’s National Political Committee, told me. The national organization would never tell local chapters what to do, she added, but “we’re hopeful people will be working on Bernie.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlthough Sanders has been a top candidate since he entered the Democratic presidential primary in March, he still \u003ca href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/2020_democratic_presidential_nomination-6730.html\"\u003ehasn’t managed to pull ahead\u003c/a\u003e of former Vice President Joe Biden nationally.

The movie portrays life gleefully through the eyes of a child named Jojo (Roman Griffin Davis), who is so devoted to Hitler that the dictator appears to the boy as an imaginary friend played by Waititi. The writer and director (who is Jewish) uses that sitcommy tone to underline the foolishness of Jojo’s beliefs, which disintegrate when he meets a Jewish refugee whom his mother (Scarlett Johansson) is hiding in the attic.

Frustratingly, it ladles in retrograde stock characters like a concerned wife (Caitriona Balfe) and plucky son (Noah Jupe) that serve mostly to pad an already hefty running time. But the movie succeeds because it never loses sight of the fact that Ford, the ostensible hero of the story, was even more venal and ruthless than its Italian rival in pursuit of victory.

This means that many homosexuals are forced to live underground lifestyles in order to avoid the harsh judgment of society.

They requested anonymity for their own privacy. \u0026#8220;This is crazy. I don\u0026#8217;t understand why he thinks this is normal,\u0026#8221; said one friend, shaking his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother friend, a man who attends the same church as Nabonibo, said he was in a state of \u0026#8220;agony\u0026#8221; since the rest of his family knows he used to hang out with Nabonibo.

In many cases most of the anti-gay laws are left over from the colonial era, one reason gay rights activists have fought vigorously to have the laws jettisoned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn June, the gay rights movement in Africa scored a victory when a court in Botswana, upholding the rights of LGBT people, overturned laws criminalizing consensual same-sex relations. But there have been some setbacks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2017, Chad enacted legislation criminalizing same-sex relations for the first time in the country\u0026#8217;s history. In May, a court in Kenya ruled against overturning a colonial-era law criminalizing homosexual acts between consenting adults. Activists there who had challenged the law in court said they faced discrimination and threats to their dignity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd in neighboring Uganda, a government minister in charge of ethics is threatening to introduce another version of an anti-gay law passed in 2014, and subsequently voided by the country\u0026#8217;s constitutional court, that provided for jail terms of up to life for those convicted of engaging in gay sex. The original version of that bill, first introduced in 2009, had included the death penalty for what it called aggravated acts of homosexuality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Rwanda, the way ahead can be challenging, Nabonibo said. Some neighborhoods in Kigali are filled with gossip about how a certain gay man might spoil other citizens, he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;Criticism and sadness.

These relations are an invaluable and irreplaceable asset that Israel cherishes deeply. A formal \u0026ldquo;defense pact\u0026rdquo;, however, would be an entirely different story \u0026mdash; and the reasons for and against it bear some thinking about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the past, Israel refrained from raising the issue of a formal treaty, since the U.S. demanded two prerequisites that Israel could not deliver: Permanent and recognized borders, and signing the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Additionally, a defense pact would require approval by the U.S. Senate. This is not necessarily a process Israel wants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose in Israel who supported such a pact argued it would amplify Israel\u0026rsquo;s deterrence, that it would formalize the existing defense relationship and elevate Israel\u0026#8217;s stature in U.S. foreign policy, and that it would enhance regional stability. A\u003cspan style=\"font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\"\u003e U.S.-Israel defense treaty, the thinking went, would also conceivably serve as a component of a regional security system, under U.S. auspices, in a foreseeable future.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese arguments are undoubtedly not without merit and substance. But in 2019 they are flawed in one major way: They were predicated on a different Middle East, in a totally different regional and global reality. In its 72nd year of independence Israel is under no existential threat and enjoys an unrivaled military advantage and technological superiority. The military threats Israel does face are from non-state actors, not amenable to conventional deterrence. U.S. support of Israel, both diplomatically and militarily, is already factored into their behavior and calculus. In short, a treaty would not deter anyone or anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe arguments against a defense pact, shared by a majority in the Israeli defense and diplomatic establishment, were more compelling in our view.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe main argument against a pact was that it would not be realistically practicable, at a time when some form of a \u0026#8220;peace process\u0026#8221; still existed: that in exchange for a pact, Israel would be asked to make major concessions and take such security risks that a pact would not adequately address.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA full defense pact would also run contrary to Israel\u0026rsquo;s idea of self-reliance, the principle that Israel would never ask another to physically defend it. Material support, state-of-the-art-military systems, yes. Soldiers, no. Never. Conversely, the public in Israel would not endure casualties of IDF soldiers in a distant U.S. war mission, say, in Afghanistan, South America or Saudi Arabia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuch a pact would invariably require coordination, cooperation, pre-approval and U.S. effective veto power over Israeli military actions. Let\u0026#8217;s say there was a U.S.-Israel defense pact in place on June 5, 1967 or June 7, 1981 or Sept. 6, 2007. Israel could not have carried out the preemptive strike against Egypt (the Six-day War), the destruction of the Iraqi nuclear reactor in Osiraq, or the demolition of the nascent Syrian nuclear reactor in Al Kibar, respectively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe most compelling argument, finally, was that a pact, notwithstanding the legal requirements and complications in the U.S. regarding pacts and treaties, would do little more than formalize what already exists. And that would poke adversaries in the eye, after Israel has gone out of its way to impose operational limitations upon itself to avoid infringing on U.S. interests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday, there is a yet more pressing argument against such a pact \u0026mdash; that it would significantly narrow and constrict Israel\u0026rsquo;s maneuvering room and operational flexibility, at a time when the U.S. is disengaging from the Middle East, when Iran and Russia are entrenched in Syria, and when Iran\u0026#8217;s Hezbollah proxy is present in Lebanon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet these arguments are redundant, when all is said and done. Because there is no \u0026ldquo;Defense Pact\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Mutual Defense Treaty.\u0026#8221; What lies behind the tweets, the headlines and the frantic Washington-Jerusalem consultations is a political gimmick, designed to attain meaningless public relations points ahead of a difficult election. A defense treaty concocted by Prime Minister Netanyahu for political benefits and possibly entertained by President Trump or his staff is not a treaty. It\u0026rsquo;s nothing more than a hollow stunt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/time/topstories/~4/mQx5mOexkMo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/mQx5mOexkMo/","published":"2019-09-16T16:25:15Z","guid":"http://time.com/?p=5678222"},{"title":"A State Lawmaker Visited Chicago’s ‘Pigeon Poop Station’ to Discuss Fixes for the Bird Waste Problem.

The researchers focused on a survey question that asked during in-person interviews if women\u0026#8217;s first vaginal intercourse experience with a man \u0026#8220;was voluntary or not voluntary, that is, did you did you choose to have sex of your own free will or not?\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe results suggest that for 1 in 16 American women \u0026mdash; or 3 million \u0026mdash; the first sexual encounter was not voluntary.

As scrutiny of these allegations increased, a small group of swing senators, including Flake, Collins, and fellow Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski, were no longer seen as solid votes in favor of Kavanaugh. At this juncture, an FBI investigation was viewed as one way to put outstanding worries about the allegations to rest and maintain Kavanaugh’s Republican support. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"0IZ02T\"\u003eFor Flake, especially, it was a review that appeared to provide much-needed political cover, while allaying questions he still had about Kavanaugh.

I would love to see Judge Kavanaugh confirmed. And I hope to be able to do that, but I want a better process,” he said. The contents of the report were seen as a make-or-break update for a handful of undecided lawmakers, himself included. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"5fNQmk\"\u003eRoughly a week later, Flake decided that he was satisfied with what the completed report had found. Collins and Manchin, both of whom voted in favor of Kavanaugh, also wound up making the same decision, while Murkowski and two Democrats, Heidi Heitkamp and Joe Donnelly, leaned the other way. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"hVtWzm\"\u003e“Based on all of the information I have available to me, including the recently completed FBI report, I have found Judge Kavanaugh to be a qualified jurist who will follow the Constitution and determine cases based on the legal findings before him,” Manchin noted in a statement backing Kavanaugh. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"qBwV53\"\u003eThe New York Times report renews questions about whether the FBI review can be trusted \u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Zd2wrw\"\u003eThe New York Times report now casts even more doubt on the FBI report as a deciding piece of evidence in senators’ votes on Kavanaugh. It also raises the question of whether some of these pivotal swing Senators would have voted the same way if they had known how incomplete it was.

Mr. Stier, who runs a nonprofit organization in Washington, notified senators and the F.B.I. about this account, but the F.B.I. did not investigate and Mr. Stier has declined to discuss it publicly.

But while the story has resulted in fresh calls for Kavanaugh’s impeachment, controversy has also swirled around at least three aspects of the Times’s presentation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"cO8TBg\"\u003eThe piece, authored by Times reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly and adapted from their forthcoming book about the Kavanaugh allegations, describes a “previously unreported story” about how Kavanaugh allegedly “pushed his penis into the hand of a female student” during a “drunken dorm party” when he was a student at Yale. Although said to be a separate incident, this story mirrors the account of Deborah Ramirez, who came forward during Kavanaugh’s SCOTUS confirmation process to accuse him of sexual misconduct while they were students at Yale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"NAh19b\"\u003eThe new allegation was brought to the Times’ attention by one of Kavanaugh’s classmates, Max Stier, who runs a nonprofit in Washington, DC. The story also indicates that Stier “notified senators and the FBI about this account, but the FBI did not investigate and Mr. Stier has declined to discuss it publicly.” Similarly, the FBI declined to interview witnesses Ramirez offered to provide to corroborate her story.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"XFXghY\"\u003eIn short, Pogrebin and Kelly’s reporting provides new evidence not only that Kavanaugh may have engaged in a pattern of sexual misconduct that \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/9/15/20866829/brett-kavanaugh-perjury-confirmation-hearing-deborah-ramirez-new-allegations\"\u003ehe wasn’t truthful about during his confirmation hearings\u003c/a\u003e, but also that the FBI did little investigative work — just enough to give Republicans who supported the justice cover from their critics to ensure Kavanaugh’s confirmation. But the way the Times presented the story distracted from these revelations, and instead put some of the scrutiny on itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nvMvwNUMJS4QOE2G7iO9JH6jn2E=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19204679/GettyImages_1050380462.jpg\"\u003e\n      \u003ccite\u003eChip Somodevilla/Getty Images\u003c/cite\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003eCapitol Police arrest hundreds of protesters against the confirmation of Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh on October 6, 2018.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"JTvIaz\"\u003eThe way the New York Times presented the new allegations was questionable at best\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"N6knip\"\u003eThe Times’s rollout of Pogrebin and Kelly’s got off to a disastrous start.

And the story was published in the Sunday Review section — one that includes both news analysis and opinion pieces. While Ramirez’s account certainly serves to both highlight and explain a culture in which sexual misconduct goes unpunished, considering that the new misconduct allegation is a big revelation in its own right, it would have made sense for the Times to highlight it in a separate news piece.

Carroll’s allegation was initially covered in the Times’ online Books section, and later buried in the 23rd page of the front section of the print edition.

President Donald Trump quickly took to Twitter and \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/9/15/20866863/brett-kavanaugh-new-sexual-misconduct-allegation-deborah-ramirez-max-stier\"\u003etried to discredit the story\u003c/a\u003e, urging Kavanaugh to “start suing people for libel, or the Justice Department should come to his rescue.

According to the editors’ note, friends of the woman who was the alleged victim of Kavanaugh’s misconduct at the dorm party claim she doesn’t remember the incident, and the woman herself wouldn’t speak to the reporters — details that weren’t included in the original version of the story.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"YjAvel\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEditors’ Note:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e Sept. 15, 2019\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"H55YqS\"\u003eAn earlier version of this article, which was adapted from a forthcoming book, did not include one element of the book’s account regarding an assertion by a Yale classmate that friends of Brett Kavanaugh pushed his penis into the hand of a female student at a drunken dorm party.

Ezra Klein caught her on a campaign swing through California to ask her about that meta-plan. The plan behind her plans. Warren’s easy fluency with policy is on full display here, but it’s her systematic thinking about the nature of power, and what it takes to redistribute it, that really sets her apart from the field.

His character is opposed, in the movie, to Ted Knight’s character, Judge Smails, who is the stick-up-his-ass, uptight rich guy who runs the country club and cannot stand him. This all came to mind, I think, during the 2016 debates, when I’m watching Donald Trump in action in the debates and seeing him go up against Jeb Bush.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"nsB5OF\"\u003eDonald Trump is a pop culture figure. He has lived in pop culture all of his life. I’m not saying that he sat down with a notebook and he plotted all this out. But these archetypes come to him because archetypes are how leaders and candidates in politics tell stories. He’s like the \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwzaxUF0k18\"\u003eClampetts against Mister Drysdale\u003c/a\u003e. He’s Rodney Dangerfield against Ted Knight.

I think what a lot of the people who were attacking him within the Republican party, and a lot of the people, including people in journalism, as well as politics, thought, “Well surely, Donald Trump may be leading the polls, but he’ll never actually win.” I think what they didn’t see was that there were these powerful pop cultural archetypes that he was playing into that put this audience on his side, precisely because of the things that outraged them. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"ToTpAp\"\u003ePeter Kafka\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"KPkR2m\"\u003eThey/we were all identifying him as Ben Carson, or any other Republican fringe candidate that had become popular briefly in the past and then eventually flamed out. We didn’t see that this is a really deep popular American archetype.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"OAO7xl\"\u003eJames Poniewozik\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"AUWdGa\"\u003eYes. One thing that I really try to avoid doing as a critic, and even before I wrote this book, is ... I try to avoid the simplistic thinking that pop culture brainwashes people. You know, “violent culture makes people violent,” etc. Or, “reality TV makes people conservative; \u003cem\u003eThe Apprentice\u003c/em\u003e made people vote for Donald Trump,” etc. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"GHzLjw\"\u003eI think these facts are all complex. But, what this is here, and what I think is extremely powerful — and all politicians work in this system, whether they know it or not — is that these archetypes exist there. These stories are powerful because they’re metaphorical, and metaphors are more powerful than literal speech because they say more than literal speech in a smaller amount of time. You can use these types once they’re created, once they’re out there in the culture, to tell your story. \u003c/p\u003e","url":"https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/9/16/20868497/caddyshack-rodney-dangerfield-trump-james-poniewozki-recode-media-peter-kafka","published":"2019-09-16T16:20:00Z","guid":"https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/9/16/20868497/caddyshack-rodney-dangerfield-trump-james-poniewozki-recode-media-peter-kafka"},{"title":"This painting explains a surprising amount about about your political views","content":"\u003cimg alt=\"An image of a poll question on a modernist painting with many colored crayon strokes.\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W1e5zzxPOnDH1eLGOpK7tuevk5Q=/0x20:1025x789/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/65254419/Screen_Shot_2019_09_16_at_10.52.25_AM.0.png\" /\u003e\n\n  \u003csmall\u003eYouGov; “Coffee Thyme” by Sam Gilliam, crayon, 1980.\u003c/small\u003e\n\n  \u003cp\u003eThe link between modern art and modern politics.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp id=\"zFrbFP\"\u003eSimple polling reveals Americans’ views of President Donald Trump are split by variables like race, ethnicity, age, and increasingly by whether or not you earned a college degree.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"H8cDvT\"\u003eSome other more unusual questions also reveal strong correlations, and those correlations may do more to reveal what’s really going on than basic demographic questions. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Dvxz4k\"\u003eConsider, for example, Sam Gilliam’s 1980 drawing “Coffee Thyme.” Data for Progress, a progressive think tank, partnered with YouGov Blue in a recent poll that showed this image (without any further identifying information) to respondents and asked them whether or not they consider it art. \u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\"An image of a poll question on a modernist painting with many colored crayon strokes.\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GjW7srPJ-oj2aZGHg20U_0iXwqI=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19204401/Screen_Shot_2019_09_16_at_10.52.25_AM.png\"\u003e\n      \u003ccite\u003eYouGov; “Coffee Thyme” by Sam Gilliam, crayon, 1980.\u003c/cite\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003eYouGov and Data for Progress asked survey respondents a seemingly simple question: Is this art?\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"jeRa6Q\"\u003eIf it looks like art to you, then odds are you disapprove of Trump’s job performance.

To really draw any strong conclusions about the connection between modern art and partisan politics, you’d want to do repeated surveys with a range of different examples. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"52RAhH\"\u003eBut while the “Coffee Thyme” result might seem novel to a lay person, it wasn’t unexpected to the people who put the poll together. That’s because it’s in line with a well-known finding in political psychology that people who score high in a personality attribute known as “openness to experience” tend to have more left-wing political opinions (see \u003ca href=\"https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2012/05/21/the-big-sort\"\u003eWill Wilkinson’s overview for the Economist\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/liberals-and-conservatives-dont-just-vote-differently-they-think-differently/2012/04/12/gIQAzb1kDT_story.html\"\u003eChris Mooney’s for the Washington Post\u003c/a\u003e). And while of course partisan politics differs from country to country, the link between openness and left-wing views pops up in studies of lots of places including \u003ca href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/223342382_The_Relationship_between_Openness_to_Experience_and_Political_Ideology\"\u003ePoland and Belgium\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/populist-personalities-the-big-five-personality-traits-and-party-choice-in-the-2015-uk-general-election/\"\u003eas well as the UK\u003c/a\u003e along with the United States.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"rLyoBM\"\u003eIndeed, this link between personality and politics is arguably why almost everyone (including the people directly involved) intuitively sees a kinship between Donald Trump and Brexit enthusiasts, even though the policy issues in play are different. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"W2Ke0K\"\u003eAnother thing that correlates with openness to experience is educational attainment. \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/5/24/11723182/iq-test-intelligence\"\u003eHigh-openness people have higher IQs\u003c/a\u003e, so they tend to do better in school. And high-openness people are more interested in school, especially the less practical aspects of it, so they’re more motivated to earn degrees. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"yFY5nH\"\u003eIn other words, the political correlation between college degrees and disliking Trump is probably mediated by underlying personality differences. As an intuitive example, take my father. He’s an older white man who’s economically comfortable and has no college degree, which in broad demographic terms sounds like a hard-core Trump fan. But when I tell you he’s a novelist who lives on the Upper West Side with his wife, who is also a novelist, a very different picture emerges. People with artistic temperaments are prototypically “high openness,” and it’s no surprise at all that my dad hates Trump. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"7S25DE\"\u003eThe problem, of course, is that pollsters can't really give people elaborate personality tests on surveys. Questions about educational attainment are much easier to ask. And unlike taste in art, the Census Bureau tracks educational attainment, so it’s easy to say that Minnesota has a larger share of college graduates than Wisconsin but difficult to quantify how open to experience Minnesotans are compared to Wisconsinites. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"lzhToD\"\u003eBut it really would be in candidates’ interest to directly target personality rather than broad demographic correlates of personality. And it would be interesting for everyday pollsters to do more work with personality alongside their various normal questions. What’s cool about the “Coffee Thyme” test is — at least through one run — it seems to be pretty powerful despite its simplicity. \u003c/p\u003e","url":"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/9/16/20856316/poll-yougov-painting-ideology-trump","published":"2019-09-16T15:50:00Z","guid":"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/9/16/20856316/poll-yougov-painting-ideology-trump"},{"title":"Purdue Pharma, maker of OxyContin, files for bankruptcy","content":"\u003cimg alt=\"OxyContin, the opioid painkiller.\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-lgzM_KRDiyKqqcWspnW2LG_3io=/319x0:2682x1772/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/65254283/165314034.jpg.0.jpg\" /\u003e\n\n  \u003csmall\u003eSteve Russell/Toronto Star via Getty Images\u003c/small\u003e\n\n  \u003cp\u003eThe move is the first step of an agreement to settle thousands of lawsuits related to the opioid epidemic.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp id=\"QiwbQG\"\u003ePurdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin, filed for bankruptcy on Sunday — the first expected step of a \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/9/11/20861226/purdue-oxycontin-settlement-opioid-epidemic\"\u003etentative agreement\u003c/a\u003e that the company reached last week to settle \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/6/7/15724054/opioid-epidemic-lawsuits-purdue-oxycontin\"\u003ethousands of lawsuits\u003c/a\u003e related to its alleged involvement in the \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/8/3/16079772/opioid-epidemic-drug-overdoses\"\u003eopioid epidemic\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"EMRNYn\"\u003eAs part of the settlement, Purdue agreed to file for bankruptcy and effectively dissolve.

In the first wave, starting in the late 1990s and early 2000s, doctors prescribed a lot of opioid painkillers.

And in recent years, the US has seen a third wave, as fentanyl offers an even more potent, cheaper — and deadlier — alternative to heroin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"quPF0f\"\u003eIt’s the first wave that really kicked off the opioid crisis — and it’s where marketing for opioid painkillers is likely most relevant. \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/1/25/18188542/opioid-epidemic-marketing-overdose-death-purdue\"\u003eMultiple\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/5/15/17355722/opioid-epidemic-doctor-pharma-insys\"\u003estudies\u003c/a\u003e have now linked marketing for opioid painkillers to addiction and overdoses, particularly direct marketing to doctors that encouraged them to prescribe more of the drugs.

In the US, some 270,000 new cases of invasive breast cancer will be diagnosed in 2019, and nearly 42,000 women are likely to die from the disease, according to the \u003ca href=\"https://www.cancer.org/cancer/breast-cancer/about/how-common-is-breast-cancer.html\"\u003eAmerican Cancer Society\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"CNQsYD\"\u003eThe researchers started to tinker with the gene using CRISPR and found they couldn’t reproduce many of the previous findings about MELK that had been uncovered using older gene-analyzing technologies, such as RNA interference. Namely, even when MELK was cut out, the breast cancer cells proliferated. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ekTCND\"\u003eWhen a drug that was supposed to target MELK for breast cancer entered clinical studies, the researchers decided to use CRISPR again, this time to edit out the gene to see whether the drug still worked. “We found the drug continued to kill breast cancer cells,” regardless of whether the MELK it was targeting was present in the breast cancer genome, said Sheltzer. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"la11xC\"\u003eThis led Sheltzer and his colleagues to a big question: Had they just studied “a uniquely bad cancer drug or did we stumble upon a bigger problem?” he recalled. “The extremely high failure rate [in cancer clinical trials] made us suspect there might be other instances of poorly designed drugs and poorly researched drug targets being tested in human patients.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"1Mc8zr\"\u003eWe need more reproducibility research in cancer medicine\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"A37QxQ\"\u003eEnter the \u003ca href=\"https://stm.sciencemag.org/content/11/509/eaaw8412\"\u003enew study\u003c/a\u003e. Sheltzer and his co-authors chose 10 drugs and drug targets that, like MELK, were at various stages of clinical development. They focused mainly on targets that had been discovered using RNA interference, again, a once-popular gene-analyzing technology that predated CRISPR. And they suspected that — like MELK — maybe it’d been leading researchers down the wrong path.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Gfv5vR\"\u003eIn each case, they used CRISPR to cut out genes from the genomes of the cancer cells they were looking at — genes thought to be essential for cancer growth. And they found that in every case, the drugs killed the cancer cells even though the gene that was supposed to be driving the cancer had been removed. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"CQIvDW\"\u003e“We wound up with 10 drugs that are potent anti-cancer agents. So we think that if we can figure out what these drugs actually do, we might be able to discover new cancer targets or we might be able to find patients who are more likely to respond,” Sheltzer said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"PnsB9F\"\u003eIt’s also possible this kind of mistaken target helps explain why drugs fall short as they make their way through more and more rigorous stages of clinical studies. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"o7oz4S\"\u003eBut there could also be other explanations for the misfired targets. Sheltzer acknowledged that they chose medicines primarily discovered with RNA interference technology. And, “Technology is always improving. So a lot of the drugs that are being tested in patients now were discovered and characterized five to 10 years ago.” It’s possible that targeted therapies, discovered more recently using newer genetic technologies, are more precise. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"IKezC0\"\u003eBoth Kaelin and Gray shared a word of caution about the study: The researchers focused on targeted drugs that were already known to be problematic. As Kaelin put it, “[They] picked drugs against targets where there was never, in my opinion, strong genetic data to support them.” So, perhaps, cancer drugs with better-established targets would work as projected. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ZHQrpn\"\u003eBut Sheltzer says honing in on poor performers was part of the point of the study. “A lot of cancer drugs get into clinical trials based on very weak genetic evidence, and when you carefully evaluate them, the rationale for targeting particular genes evaporates.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"QzjwnS\"\u003eEither way, he and his colleagues hope the research inspires more analyses into why so many cancer drugs don’t help patients. “Research funding agencies are very interested in finding the next cure,” Sheltzer argued, “and they aren’t excited about this research into reproducibility and why some drugs fail.” If we want to accelerate the quest for effective, new treatments, maybe they should be. \u003c/p\u003e","url":"https://www.vox.com/2019/9/16/20864066/cancer-studies-fail","published":"2019-09-16T14:55:00Z","guid":"https://www.vox.com/2019/9/16/20864066/cancer-studies-fail"},{"title":"The new Kavanaugh allegation is important because of what it says about the FBI","content":"\u003cimg alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ao3-h_gRjJ_IvMdH98sz8ywa7cU=/261x0:4770x3382/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/65256685/GettyImages_1046063626.7.jpg\" /\u003e\n\n  \u003csmall\u003eSen.

But for now a big part of the streaming business revolves around old TV shows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"zObzof\"\u003eLatest case in point: Netflix is paying a lot of money for the rights to show \u003cem\u003eSeinfeld\u003c/em\u003e to its 150 million subscribers around the world, starting in 2021.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"GOmJPv\"\u003eThat means the show, which originally ran on NBC from 1989 to 1998, will be moving from its current streaming homes — Hulu in the US and Amazon in most of the rest of the world — for a five-year run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Qarlda\"\u003eNetflix isn’t saying how much it’s paying for \u003cem\u003eSeinfeld’s\u003c/em\u003e 180 episodes.

Hulu’s current deal has it paying $130 million for six years of \u003cem\u003eSeinfeld\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"gDOREO\"\u003eThe theory underscoring the price hike: The price for TV shows that people have heard of, that also have big, bingeable back catalogs of 100 episodes or more, continues to rise in the US as more streaming competitors come online. Netflix is also streaming this stuff around the world, as opposed to the US-centric focus some other services have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"wVGcyg\"\u003eSo the cost for \u003cem\u003eSeinfeld\u003c/em\u003e is going to be a big number, which will certainly grab your attention when it comes out, sooner or later. But the bigger story is that Netflix is buying someone else’s high-profile programming instead of seeing high-profile programming that it currently streams leaving for a competitor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"yRfsAZ\"\u003eEven if you don’t pay attention to the business of the streaming wars, you may have some idea that Netflix Is Losing Its Shows To Disney And Other People because that’s true: Would-be Netflix competitors including Disney, Comcast’s NBC, and AT\u0026amp;T’s WarnerMedia are taking programming that used to run on Netflix and bringing it back to their own, yet-to-launch streaming services.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"dBjxCT\"\u003eThat narrative isn’t completely true, since those Netflix competitors still sell some of their programming to Netflix, and may continue to do so in the future.

But while Sony, which made \u003cem\u003eSeinfeld\u003c/em\u003e for NBC, has its own streaming service, you probably don’t spend much time on ... \u003ca href=\"https://www.sonycrackle.com/\"\u003eCrackle\u003c/a\u003e.

It\u0026#8217;s a fair instinct. One study of Wikipedia entries, published in the journal \u003ca href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-019-0541-6\"\u003eNature Human Behavior\u003c/a\u003e, suggested that political diversity can lead to stronger overall performance, finding that \u0026#8220;ideologically polarized teams engage in longer, more constructive, competitive and substantively focused but linguistically diverse debates than teams of ideological moderates.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there\u0026#8217;s an important caveat to that finding: The study\u0026#8217;s authors note in an article for \u003ca href=\"https://hbr.org/2019/07/are-politically-diverse-teams-more-effective\"\u003eHarvard Business Review\u003c/a\u003e that Wikipedia\u0026#8217;s well-known and rigorous editorial policies \u0026#8220;constitute a culture by stipulating appropriate social conduct, such as how editors treat one another in talk-page debates, and even how we, as researchers, needed to engage with the community.\u0026#8221; In other words, the researchers suggest that ideologically polarized teams on Wikipedia were able to work together productively because their exchanges were grounded in respect and governed by shared guidelines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs there any path forward in which Gillis\u0026#8217; \u003cem\u003eSNL\u003c/em\u003e co-workers can engage with him productively?

But it\u0026#8217;s unfair for \u003cem\u003eSNL\u003c/em\u003e, or for any organization, to put any of its employees in a position where they would feel that their own humanity is either up for debate or fodder for feeble \u0026#8220;comedy.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://qz.com/work/1709695/why-snl-hired-shane-gillis-despite-his-racist-jokes/","published":"2019-09-16T18:24:31Z","guid":"https://qz.com/1709695/auto-draft/"},{"title":"Watch: Our call with Don Tapscott on taking back your online identity","content":"\u003cimg width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/online_ID_conference.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;w=1024\" class=\"attachment-medium_10 size-medium_10 wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/online_ID_conference.jpg 2300w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/online_ID_conference.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/online_ID_conference.jpg?resize=50,28 50w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/online_ID_conference.jpg?resize=160,90 160w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/online_ID_conference.jpg?resize=320,180 320w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/online_ID_conference.jpg?resize=640,360 640w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/online_ID_conference.jpg?resize=940,529 940w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/online_ID_conference.jpg?resize=1600,900 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /\u003eBlockchain Revolution co-author Don Tapscott and Quartz ideas editor Georgia Frances King discuss the perils of providing Big Tech with unfettered access to your personal\u0026hellip;","url":"https://qz.com/1709865/watch-our-call-with-don-tapscott-on-taking-back-your-online-identity/","published":"2019-09-16T17:58:57Z","guid":"https://qz.com/1709865/auto-draft/"},{"title":"Why J.J.

That\u0026#8217;s quite the payday for the \u003cem\u003eStar Wars: The Rise of Skywalker\u003c/em\u003e director, and yet it\u0026#8217;s just half of what he reportedly turned down from Apple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHollywood\u0026#8217;s \u003ca href=\"https://qz.com/quartzy/1526962/j-j-abrams-has-disney-universal-apple-and-netflix-bidding-on-him/\"\u003ebiggest bidding war\u003c/a\u003e in the past year has been over Abrams\u0026#8217; services; Bad Robot is behind hits from the \u003cem\u003eMission: Impossible\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eStar Trek\u003c/em\u003e franchises in film to \u003cem\u003eWestworld\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eCastle Rock\u003c/em\u003e on TV. When word got around that the prolific filmmaker wouldn\u0026#8217;t re-up his expiring deal with Paramount Pictures, every talent-hungry content distributor in town lined up to pitch themselves as Abrams\u0026#8217; future home. Among his suitors were Disney, Netflix, Sony, and Comcast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the two favorites to land Abrams were always WarnerMedia, with which he\u0026#8217;s long had a relationship, and Apple, which will debut original films and TV series alongside its ambitious streaming service, Apple TV+, in November. Abrams elected to go with WarnerMedia \u003ca href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/jj-abrams-bad-robot-warnermedia-deal-analysis-1239406\"\u003edespite its lower offer\u003c/a\u003e. The five-year deal puts all of Bad Robot\u0026#8217;s divisions (film, TV, video games, and digital content) under the same roof for the first time. Abrams will direct and produce films and TV series for both theatrical distribution and also the company\u0026#8217;s own upcoming streaming service, HBO Max.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, why WarnerMedia? Or rather, why \u003cem\u003enot\u003c/em\u003e Apple?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eApple reportedly didn\u0026#8217;t want to share him\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to the Hollywood Reporter, Apple wanted Abrams to make new projects only for Apple and no other third-party distributor. (Such exclusivity would have prevented Abrams from directing the Star Wars movies for Disney, for instance.) The ability to sell content to other companies, which WarnerMedia will allow him, was \u0026#8220;of the utmost importance to Abrams,\u0026#8221; the Hollywood Reported noted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApple is in a weird position. Until recently, it has only ever sold devices. It\u0026#8217;s completely unproven as an entertainment incubator and distributor, but needs creators to ink deals to supply all the content for Apple TV+. The only guarantee that the company can offer talent seeking overall deals right now is that of money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, that\u0026#8217;s more than enough to get started. But in order to land mega-producers like Abrams, Apple will need to either prove it can compete in the increasingly crowded marketplace, or ease up on demanding exclusivity. Already, Apple\u0026#8217;s content deal with Oprah Winfrey—by far the biggest Hollywood name to partner up with the company—is \u003ca href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/oprah-winfrey-inks-content-deal-apple-1120552\"\u003enot exclusive\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eAbrams wants to make movies released in theaters\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWarnerMedia owns the Warner Bros. film studio, which is home to some of the world\u0026#8217;s most lucrative franchises (the Harry Potter-verse, DC Comics, etc.). Apple, on the other hand, doesn\u0026#8217;t have a theatrical business model—and it\u0026#8217;s unclear if they ever will.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Abrams values TV and streaming, he doesn\u0026#8217;t want to risk not being able to make blockbusters that get shown in theaters. That\u0026#8217;s why you\u0026#8217;re highly unlikely to see film purists like Christopher Nolan make deals with Apple any time soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eApple doesn\u0026#8217;t own any ideas\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnlike WarnerMedia, Apple doesn\u0026#8217;t own any intellectual property that filmmakers can turn into lucrative shows and movies. It\u0026#8217;s starting from scratch, while Warner has \u003ca href=\"https://qz.com/1651446/hollywood-has-exhausted-the-franchise-whats-next/\"\u003edecades worth of distribution rights\u003c/a\u003e (Quartz member exclusive) that it can offer filmmaking partners. As someone involved in the Star Wars, Star Trek, and Mission: Impossible franchises (among others), Abrams wants to have the option to produce and help develop the next big movie franchise. Apple simply can\u0026#8217;t offer that yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eAbrams reportedly likes WarnerMedia\u0026#8217;s new management\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps the most surprising part of the Hollywood Reporter\u0026#8217;s account of the Abrams bidding war is that the director was \u0026#8220;impressed\u0026#8221; with new WarnerMedia CEO John Stankey. There were real concerns about the former AT\u0026amp;T chief strategy officer\u0026#8217;s ability to woo talent like Abrams, and a number of WarnerMedia executives, including HBO CEO and famous talent magnet Richard Plepler, left the company not long after it was purchased by AT\u0026amp;T.

Before he could get on the plane, federal agents arrested the 33-year-old Chinese national.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAuthorities say Li thought the bag of export-controlled electronics he had in his possession had come from rogue US brokers. The transaction was instead part of an elaborate undercover sting operation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLi’s arrest was the culmination of a two-year investigation into an effort to smuggle sensitive components used in spacecraft and missiles out of the US and into China, according to a sealed criminal complaint obtained by Quartz.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2017, Department of Homeland Security investigators offered radiation-hardened microchips and advanced aerospace sensors to an unnamed Hong Kong-based company in exchange for more than $150,000, according to the complaint. The parts in question require export licenses to ship abroad, and many are specifically banned from sale in China because they can be used in missiles and advanced satellites with military applications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe theft of US technology by Chinese companies, many state-backed, is among the key drivers of the trade war between the two nations that is roiling the global economy.

Are you comfortable with that situation? If yes, let’s complete the deal.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLi allegedly demanded that the undercover agents reimburse his travel expenses and pay him a $10,000 fee for carrying the prohibited parts back to Hong Kong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Our boss said that we already paid 70% for the total payment, And half for the shipping, Right now you want us to pay for the fined money, that is ridiculous,” Li said in a text message to the undercover agents, referring to a penalty imposed after the initial shipment was seized. “If not we will sue you.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sue us for what,” the agents replied. “We shipped a highly restricted part and we are lucky we are not in jail.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUltimately, the undercover agents paid for Li’s flight from Shenzhen, China, to Honolulu on Aug. 20. Li was in handcuffs the next day. A federal judge ordered him held without bail. The criminal complaint against Li was filed under seal and inadvertently posted publicly before being taken down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBureau of Prisons records indicate that Li was released on Sept. 4, the day Quartz contacted the Department of Homeland Security about the investigation. While the prosecutors and investigators leading in the case refused to comment on a sealed matter, another source expects further indictments to be issued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Li complaint also discusses an unnamed and possibly complicit US company. “Individual 1” purchased microchips designed to survive in high-radiation environments like outer space from the US company, which refused to ship them abroad. Then she asked the undercover agents to accept the chips and include them in their shipment of controlled parts to China.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe agents agreed, and received a package from the US company, complete with an invoice showing the firm was aware the customers for its export-prohibited parts were based in Hong Kong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThe hunt for smugglers\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuartz reviewed nine prosecutions the Department of Justice has brought against similar aerospace smuggling operations in the last decade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost follow the same storyline: A US company reports suspicious customers to the government, and then undercover agents pose as unscrupulous brokers.

Companies that train their people to use—and be augmented by—technology will perform better\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLarge companies like Walmart, AT\u0026amp;T, JPMorgan Chase, and Amazon are equipping  their employees by the thousands with new skills for a new era filled with artificial intelligence, blockchain, quantum computing, robots, and XR and 5G. As they \u003ca href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-to-retrain-a-third-of-its-u-s-workforce-11562841120\"\u003eundertake this new important retraining work\u003c/a\u003e, they will soon do so with a new advantage: 5G, and XR in particular, will make it possible to train workers anywhere, anytime, on a global scale, and with a degree of realism that will be indistinguishable from experiential learning on the job at the job site. With such reskilling made easier by the technology itself, companies will find an important value proposition: If they equip their people to leverage all the new tech—and be augmented by it—they will ultimately perform better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e5. Companies will have to figure out how to maintain virtual cultures\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs fixed places for work diminish in importance, maintaining a desired culture will become increasingly difficult. Global companies have longed faced a version of this challenge across borders, but in the future it will become pervasive, even the smallest units of an enterprise, as flesh-and-blood encounters become increasingly rare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e6.

How should compensation and benefits packages be structured? What about retention strategies? The reality is, companies that understand how to leverage new technologies to create the best value propositions for people, including perhaps letting them work for other employers simultaneously, will be the ones with the best people and therefore will win. The challenge then becomes how to structure employment contracts to get the most out of these high-performing employees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e7. Burnout and abusive work environments could multiply\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause 5G and XR will enable many employees to perform almost any of their duties anywhere, any time, they may be tempted—or expected—to be on the job around the clock. Those who work for more than one employer could be doubly squeezed, taking on too much and serving two or more highly demanding masters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday, the 5G/XR world seems to lie over a distant horizon. But when the availability and power of both technologies reach the tipping point and converge, the way we work will change radically. Companies will race to build business and operating models that use 5G’s capacity and XR’s immersiveness to create competitive advantage. As they do so, they will inevitably transform the workplace in ways that will challenge our concepts of work and place—and our remote-work capabilities will be utterly transformed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eOmar Abbosh is group executive for Accenture\u0026#8217;s communications, media \u0026amp; technology business. \u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003ePaul Nunes is managing director of thought leadership at Accenture Research.

These plants are under-used, though, which means any future increase in the state\u0026#8217;s power demand could be easily met.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe state-owned National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) is building a 1,600 MW coal-fired power plant in Raigarh district, where half the capacity is committed to meet Chhattisgarh\u0026#8217;s needs. Shukla said this would be the last such plant to be built in the state.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecond, falling costs of solar power and the state\u0026#8217;s responsibility to contribute to the ambitious national goal to build renewable power plants mean that Chhattisgarh is likely to rely on using solar to fill up any excess demand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, after accounting for the state\u0026#8217;s long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs), Shukla found that the state some times faces an excess demand of about 50 MW. To meet this shortage, Chhattisgarh is commissioning a solar farm that can generate 100 MW of power, along with batteries that can store 150 MWh of energy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbout 400 hectares of land has been allocated for the solar project and its future extensions in Rajnandgaon district. The state has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Solar Energy Corporation of India, which auctions renewable projects for developers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChhattisgarh can likely fill up any shortfall in supply through short-term PPAs or an electricity exchange, said Ankur Agarwal, associate director at India Ratings and Research. \u0026#8220;With renewable energy costs falling, no state will want to sign long-term agreements with [coal power] plants,\u0026#8221; he added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eTwo is a trend?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChhattisgarh’s decision will likely hit the coal industry harder than Gujarat\u0026#8217;s move because the former has \u003ca href=\"http://chhattisgarhmines.gov.in/en/coal\"\u003e16% of India’s total coal reserves\u003c/a\u003e.

The country\u0026#8217;s public-sector banks have been saddled with huge debts after they provided cheap financing to build tens of coal power plants, expecting demand for electricity to grow.

This policy allows rooftop panel owners to supply excess power back into the power grid and earn money.

While there have always been mild differences in approach between them, the law has sown real cleavages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2016-17, two Muslim feminist groups facilitated the abolition of \u003cem\u003etalaq-i-biddat\u003c/em\u003e by acting as co-petitioners in the ongoing court case. One was \u003ca href=\"https://feminisminindia.com/2017/05/30/interview-bebaak-collective/\"\u003eBebaak Collective\u003c/a\u003e, a prominent women’s campaign alliance led by \u003ca href=\"https://www.ashoka.org/en-IN/fellow/hasina-khan\"\u003eHasina Khan\u003c/a\u003e. The other was the \u003ca href=\"https://bmmaindia.com/\"\u003eBharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan\u003c/a\u003e (BMMA), a national, grassroots organisation of Muslim women. Both demanded the abolition of \u003cem\u003etalaq-i-biddat\u003c/em\u003e, and both welcomed the court ruling that invalidated it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince then, however, their approaches have diverged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Bebaak Collective, along with many other activists, signed a \u003ca href=\"https://thewire.in/communalism/triple-talaq-bill-muslim-women\"\u003epetition in late July condemning the new law\u003c/a\u003e for setting punishments for husbands. The collective argues that rather than empowering women, this law will make them vulnerable in other ways. If former husbands are jailed it could prevent them from paying post-divorce maintenance and divest wives and children of financial security. In turn, it could leave women at the mercy of hostile, vengeful matrimonial families. Questioning the government’s motives, they declared the law “not pro-women but anti-minority”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other side, the \u003ca href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2019/07/31/india/triple-talaq-criminalized-india-intl-scli/index.html\"\u003eBMMA welcomed the law\u003c/a\u003e arguing that criminal measures alone can cease \u003cem\u003etalaq-i-biddat\u003c/em\u003e. Its leaders argue their perspective is informed by their grassroots work offering legal guidance to ordinary Muslim women. They claim that in the past two years, since triple-talaq was declared invalid, dozens of recent victims of the practice have nevertheless approached their offices each year for help. Some husbands, declaring themselves subject to shari\u0026#8217;ah laws rather than court judges, have continued the practice regardless. Vulnerable, uninformed wives have hardly been in a position to confute them. Newspapers have also continued to report \u003ca href=\"https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/up-woman-claims-husband-gave-her-triple-talaq-over-phone-1592150-2019-08-27\"\u003einfringements of the court’s judgment\u003c/a\u003e since 2017.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a law to be a real deterrent, say the BMMA’s leaders, it needs to carry penalties. They point out that other matters of personal laws, such as not paying post-divorce maintenance, already come with punishments regardless of religious community, and that \u003cem\u003etalaq-i-biddat\u003c/em\u003e is already \u003ca href=\"https://www.firstpost.com/india/triple-talaq-verdict-pakistan-egypt-are-among-19-countries-that-have-abolished-muslim-divorce-law-3962093.html\"\u003ecriminalised in more than 20 Muslim-majority countries\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eClaims coming in\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe BMMA’s stance has earned them criticism from their opponents. During my recent research into Muslim women’s rights in India, two BMMA activists told me that the substance of the law shouldn’t be conflated with the government that implemented it. They accused liberal feminists, who simply “say their piece on Facebook” and do not handle the everyday traumas of ordinary women, of political point scoring. “I question their feminism,” one told me, saying that liberal feminists “have achieved nothing for Muslim women” in decades.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe staff of one BMMA office in Mumbai told me in late August that since the Act passed, five women had already come to them for advice on using the new law. All plan to file retrospective claims against their former husbands for \u003cem\u003etalaq-i-biddat\u003c/em\u003e offences since last September. It’s likely these numbers are merely a fraction of the women who may now use this new law to redress past abuses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOrdinary Muslim women, argue the BMMA, often pass unheard in elite debates, but may find new empowerment in this law. By lifting the perpetual threat of instant divorce, this law may empower women and embolden them against perpetual threats from their husbands. For the law’s supporters, if not for everyone, this possibility overrides the ongoing disputes about its origins and intentions.\u003c!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

The 66-year-old spends the next several minutes demonstrating how he uses audio commands on his device—sending a test SMS to his wife, making a call to his daughter—on a daily basis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext, he takes me through the Kaizala app, which an internal tech team at his multispeciality hospital chain, Narayana Health, has customised for themselves in partnership with Microsoft. \u0026#8220;While I am sitting with you here, I can do the rounds in my ICU,\u0026#8221; he says. \u0026#8220;When you see a name in red, it means that the patient is in the ICU. On the app, I can see his post-operative status, including things like urine output, level of consciousness, etc. A lot of these updates come automatically and directly from the machines.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNarayana Health, which Shetty is the founder and chairman of, has 23 hospitals across India that are considered to the \u003ca href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-03-26/the-world-s-cheapest-hospital-has-to-get-even-cheaper\"\u003echeapest full-service health-care providers\u003c/a\u003e in the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs we talk about the future of jobs and how data is changing the way doctors in India work, the savvy Padma Bhushan awardee explains why robots performing surgeries is a \u0026#8220;minor thing\u0026#8221; and technology has a much larger role to play in healthcare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdited excerpts:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is that one job that will be most critical at hospitals in the future?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven the way Indian healthcare is structured, doctors will continue to be the most important people in a hospital. You need to have a licence to practice, so doctors will always remain an integral part of the healthcare delivery model. The nurses and technicians are also extremely important. But once you have all this, if you want healthcare to reach out to everyone, you need outstanding administrators with the force to run the business. It\u0026#8217;s not really a one-man show.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIs there a particular specialisation for doctors that you feel will be very critical in India going forward?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA doctor\u0026#8217;s MBBS degree has lost its relevance now. He has to be a specialist in some area or the other. Unlike in other industries, where finance or marketing professionals can become CEOs, in the healthcare industry, it doesn\u0026#8217;t work like that. I am licensed to do cardiac surgery, if I do something else, I can lose my licence. So, we need a large number of specialists mainly because the type of diseases has also changed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAround the time of India\u0026#8217;s Independence (in 1947), infectious diseases were the main problem to which the entire government budgets were allocated. Malaria, tuberculosis and HIV were the priorities at the time. But now, across the world, these three diseases kill about 4 million people each year, whereas the lack of access to safe surgery kills 70 million people. You scan the healthcare strategies of any developing country and you will see how they do not talk about surgery even by mistake. I am not even talking about heart surgery or brain operation, I am talking about three basic bellwether procedures: emergency caesarean section for obstructed delivery, laparotomy for a burst appendix, and surgery for compound fractures (when the bone is exposed).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf these three surgeries are done, 90% of the country\u0026#8217;s healthcare problems will be taken care of. But that is not the priority of the government.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTechnologies such as data analytics can play a big role in the healthcare industry. How far have you and Narayana Health adopted technology?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=\"pull-quote\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"quote-line\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe disruption caused by Airbnb and Uber is nothing compared to how technology will disrupt the healthcare industry.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"quote-line\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003eThe disruption caused by Airbnb and Uber is nothing compared to how technology will disrupt the healthcare industry. People talk about the use of data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI). But all these technologies need data. Now, how do you get the data when 95% of the hospitals in India don\u0026#8217;t have electronic medical records (EMR). If you don\u0026#8217;t have EMR, you are looking at manually typing in the data, which will not be 100% accurate. So the big game of data analytics making a big difference in healthcare will only happen if every hospital is using EMR and every patient has his own personal health record in a digital format.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe have been working on this for the last 20 years. Five years ago, we brought in a team of about 150 software engineers in Bengaluru to build out EMR and hospital management system, etc. We realised that the existing custom made products for other industries won\u0026#8217;t suit our requirements so we have to do it ourselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAre you using data you have collected for preventive healthcare?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe are using data for predictions. Around 15% of all the heart surgeries done in India are done by us. That\u0026#8217;s a huge volume of data, and based on that we can predict what are the chances of a patient who has had one surgery having future problems. The predictions are based on machine learning. We are using this data to consult with our patients.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHas this investment in technology started showing results for you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh yes, it is amazing. While I am sitting with you here, I can do the rounds in my ICU on the Kaizala app. It\u0026#8217;s like a WhatsApp group. We will soon be starting live streaming of the cardiac monitor in the app as well. So if I am not happy with something, I can add my comments. And this is all HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) compliant, so the data is safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the last few months, we have also started using apps that use data analytics to keep a check on our financials and give us quick access to data on how much amount is outstanding with insurers or another company. We have another app that shows us data on how much money we spend on each heart operation, how much antibiotic we used, etc. It also shows data on how much money each doctor spent. Whenever I am free, I see it. So I don\u0026#8217;t have to wait for the end of the month to see what\u0026#8217;s the financial situation. Essentially, we believe that everything we do in healthcare will undergo a dramatic change.\u003cspan class=\"pull-quote\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"quote-line\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThere is no need for robots to operate on people right now.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"quote-line\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow far are we from robots operating on people?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is no need for robots to operate on people right now. The need right now is to address primary care, secondary care, and tertiary care. Once these things are done, getting robots to do a surgery is a minor thing. Of course, it can be done, but we should not get distracted by those things without building the foundation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDo you think \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003edoctors will need to learn maths and statistics in the future?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat is natural.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe are now launching a campaign asking people to quit the keyboard. We believe that keyboard is the biggest deterrent in accessing data and information. If you don\u0026#8217;t have a keyboard, and you are using your voice to communicate with your phone, it is amazing. Especially in the future when celebrating 90th or 100th birthday is going to be a norm, and loneliness will become the biggest problem. You need a phone that knows you very well, it wakes you up on time, reminds you to take the medicines on time, and if you don\u0026#8217;t wake up after some reminders, it calls your family to inform that you haven\u0026#8217;t woken up. It can check your physical activities, it knows exactly what your pulse rate is, etc and you can be constantly monitored. This will protect your life, and it is going to disrupt the industry completely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDo you think technology is a threat to a medical professional\u0026#8217;s job?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. So, the radiology profession is often considered under threat because of AI. There was a very interesting statement by a radiologist made: \u0026#8220;Radiologists who use AI will replace the radiologists who don\u0026#8217;t use AI.\u0026#8221; The technology to fly a plane without a pilot was there 25 years ago, but how many of you want to get on to a plane that does not have a pilot?\u003cspan class=\"pull-quote\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"quote-line\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI believe that India will become the first country in the world to disassociate healthcare from affluence.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"quote-line\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDo you think healthcare education has caught up with the changes happening in the industry?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe education system still needs to evolve.

People who could never dream of going into a private hospital are now walking into these places just by flashing a card. There are some flaws just like it is at the start of everything. But it\u0026#8217;s a matter of time when things will get streamlined. The biggest challenge to its execution is the shortage of skilled doctors. For example, we do about 26 million surgeries a year in India, and we need to do 65 million. To do that we need at least a few lakh surgeons, which we don\u0026#8217;t have right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI believe that India will become the first country in the world to disassociate healthcare from affluence. All over the world, people always thought that if the country becomes rich, everyone can afford healthcare. But that did not happen anywhere because the cost of healthcare is like a mirage.

Extrapolating this out to the whole US population would mean more than 3.3 million women between the ages of 18 and 44 experience this type of coercion. The study’s authors note that this is a relatively understudied area and that most information about “forced sexual initiation,” as they label rape and assault in this study, in the United States is outdated, based on a \u003ca href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2991518?origin=crossref\u0026seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents\" target=\"_blank\"\u003esimilar analysis\u003c/a\u003e from 1995 that showed an even higher percentage of forced sexual initiation (9.1 percent to the current study’s 6.5 percent), but differences in wording and a younger age range among participants make direct comparisons difficult.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e Researchers reached updated numbers via the \u003ca href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nsfg/index.htm\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eNational Survey of Family Growth\u003c/a\u003e, a questionnaire administered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Using data collected between September 2011 to September 2017, they analyzed answers from 13,310 American women about whether their first vaginal intercourse with a man was voluntary. Those who said they were forced were asked follow-up questions about the types of coercion, including physical force, verbal pressure, and the influence of alcohol or drugs. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e In the survey, more than half of those who were forced reported that they were verbally pressured, while just over 46 percent said they were held down. Half of those who were forced said their rapist or assaulter was larger or older—and those coerced tended to be younger when it happened than those who weren’t. Assailants also tended to be older than the partners of women who had voluntary sexual initiations. About a quarter of respondents, respectively, reported being given a drug, threatened with physical harm, and/or actually physically harmed.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e The results suggest a problem that cuts across class and geography, though women who were forced were less likely to be white and slightly less likely to have been born outside the United States. They were also more likely to live below the poverty level and less likely to have a college education.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e Women who experienced forced sexual initiation tended to have higher rates of unwanted first pregnancy or abortion, pelvic inflammatory disease, and problems with ovulation or menstruation. They also more frequently reported illicit drug use and fair or poor health. While the survey was limited in analyzing the mental health effects of forced sexual initiation, those who experienced it were likelier to report difficulty completing tasks due to physical or mental health conditions.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e The results point to underlying, toxic power dynamics, the authors note: The men forcing sex tend to be older, and the women were likelier to be younger than 18 at the time of their experience. They suggest that sexual education that emphasizes affirmative consent could help mitigate power imbalances—but, ultimately, there’s a lot more work to be done.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e If you need someone to talk to about an experience with sexual assault or abuse, you can call the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 1-800-656-HOPE (4673), where trained staff can provide you with support, information, advice, or a referral.

Yet the reaction he has received, from family and friends to strangers, has been mostly \u0026#8220;horrible,\u0026#8221; underscoring the intolerance faced by LGBT people in many parts of Africa. \u0026#8220;But there is no going back, because I have to live my real life,\u0026#8221; Nabonibo said in an interview in the capital, Kigali. \u0026#8220;It\u0026#8217;s so sad to see people you know abusing you.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNabonibo, who is 35 and also a qualified accountant, said he had become an outcast at his workplace as friends isolate him.

They requested anonymity for their own privacy. \u0026#8220;This is crazy. I don\u0026#8217;t understand why he thinks this is normal,\u0026#8221; said one friend, shaking his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother friend, a man who attends the same church as Nabonibo, said he was in a state of \u0026#8220;agony\u0026#8221; since the rest of his family knows he used to hang out with Nabonibo.

In many cases most of the anti-gay laws are left over from the colonial era, one reason gay rights activists have fought vigorously to have the laws jettisoned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn June, the gay rights movement in Africa scored a victory when a court in Botswana, upholding the rights of LGBT people, overturned laws criminalizing consensual same-sex relations. But there have been some setbacks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2017, Chad enacted legislation criminalizing same-sex relations for the first time in the country\u0026#8217;s history. In May, a court in Kenya ruled against overturning a colonial-era law criminalizing homosexual acts between consenting adults. Activists there who had challenged the law in court said they faced discrimination and threats to their dignity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd in neighboring Uganda, a government minister in charge of ethics is threatening to introduce another version of an anti-gay law passed in 2014, and subsequently voided by the country\u0026#8217;s constitutional court, that provided for jail terms of up to life for those convicted of engaging in gay sex. The original version of that bill, first introduced in 2009, had included the death penalty for what it called aggravated acts of homosexuality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Rwanda, the way ahead can be challenging, Nabonibo said. Some neighborhoods in Kigali are filled with gossip about how a certain gay man might spoil other citizens, he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;Criticism and sadness.

These relations are an invaluable and irreplaceable asset that Israel cherishes deeply. A formal \u0026ldquo;defense pact\u0026rdquo;, however, would be an entirely different story \u0026mdash; and the reasons for and against it bear some thinking about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the past, Israel refrained from raising the issue of a formal treaty, since the U.S. demanded two prerequisites that Israel could not deliver: Permanent and recognized borders, and signing the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Additionally, a defense pact would require approval by the U.S. Senate. This is not necessarily a process Israel wants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose in Israel who supported such a pact argued it would amplify Israel\u0026rsquo;s deterrence, that it would formalize the existing defense relationship and elevate Israel\u0026#8217;s stature in U.S. foreign policy, and that it would enhance regional stability. A\u003cspan style=\"font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\"\u003e U.S.-Israel defense treaty, the thinking went, would also conceivably serve as a component of a regional security system, under U.S. auspices, in a foreseeable future.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese arguments are undoubtedly not without merit and substance. But in 2019 they are flawed in one major way: They were predicated on a different Middle East, in a totally different regional and global reality. In its 72nd year of independence Israel is under no existential threat and enjoys an unrivaled military advantage and technological superiority. The military threats Israel does face are from non-state actors, not amenable to conventional deterrence. U.S. support of Israel, both diplomatically and militarily, is already factored into their behavior and calculus. In short, a treaty would not deter anyone or anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe arguments against a defense pact, shared by a majority in the Israeli defense and diplomatic establishment, were more compelling in our view.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe main argument against a pact was that it would not be realistically practicable, at a time when some form of a \u0026#8220;peace process\u0026#8221; still existed: that in exchange for a pact, Israel would be asked to make major concessions and take such security risks that a pact would not adequately address.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA full defense pact would also run contrary to Israel\u0026rsquo;s idea of self-reliance, the principle that Israel would never ask another to physically defend it. Material support, state-of-the-art-military systems, yes. Soldiers, no. Never. Conversely, the public in Israel would not endure casualties of IDF soldiers in a distant U.S. war mission, say, in Afghanistan, South America or Saudi Arabia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuch a pact would invariably require coordination, cooperation, pre-approval and U.S. effective veto power over Israeli military actions. Let\u0026#8217;s say there was a U.S.-Israel defense pact in place on June 5, 1967 or June 7, 1981 or Sept. 6, 2007. Israel could not have carried out the preemptive strike against Egypt (the Six-day War), the destruction of the Iraqi nuclear reactor in Osiraq, or the demolition of the nascent Syrian nuclear reactor in Al Kibar, respectively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe most compelling argument, finally, was that a pact, notwithstanding the legal requirements and complications in the U.S. regarding pacts and treaties, would do little more than formalize what already exists.

Because there is no \u0026ldquo;Defense Pact\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Mutual Defense Treaty.\u0026#8221; What lies behind the tweets, the headlines and the frantic Washington-Jerusalem consultations is a political gimmick, designed to attain meaningless public relations points ahead of a difficult election.

The researchers focused on a survey question that asked during in-person interviews if women\u0026#8217;s first vaginal intercourse experience with a man \u0026#8220;was voluntary or not voluntary, that is, did you did you choose to have sex of your own free will or not?\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe results suggest that for 1 in 16 American women \u0026mdash; or 3 million \u0026mdash; the first sexual encounter was not voluntary.

It impacts North Carolina, impacts the whole country and tens of thousands of jobs, so one of the things they talked about was that. And always health care and some of the other things, as far as what Republicans are doing, even in the minority, to make sure. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI think Vice President Mike Pence said it really well: “In the majority, you legislate. In the minority, you communicate, and sometimes you try to figure out a way to do both.”\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBluey: And you’re certainly in a position, and in the House, where that is a priority, communication. I know that in your previous role [as chairman] with the Republican Study Committee, it was as well. So tell us about what you expect to happen this fall.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are the priorities that Republicans have? In some cases, you’ve been able to outmaneuver Democrats, it seems … using a motion to recommit and other rules to make sure your issues do stand at the forefront.\u003cbr\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWalker:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, I appreciate that you’re paying that close attention to the process, because it is important. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIs there any way that we can do that? One of the things that we did try to win, something that’s very important to the American people, that the majority of the American people support, is allowing a baby to survive if he or she goes [through] a botched abortion. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI was one of the people that spoke firmly and consistently, as most people I think with any kind of heart would do so. Yet, once again, the Democrats have blocked any kind of floor vote. The reason, the strategy behind that is, that Speaker Pelosi and her leadership team, they know that the majority of the American people are horrified. The fact that we are in a First World country [and] claim any kind of moral high ground. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTake the abortion argument out of it. We\u0026#8217;re just talking about a born-alive amendment. That’s one of the things that we’re going to continue to talk about. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTrade is another [priority], and why the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Act is an important trade agreement to move forward. Mexico is now our No. 1 trade partner, so those things are important to us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHopefully, we’ll get a chance to talk more about those in the fall as well.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBluey: Well, I’m glad you brought up communication, because it is so critical for conservatives to make sure that\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003ethey’re on the forefront. … Because it\u0026#8217;s so critical that conservatives talk not just to our base about those issues, but also reach out to new audiences, and that’s been a priority of ours at The Heritage Foundation under the leadership of Kay Coles James. And I wanted to ask you about a recent article that was in The Charlotte Observer, talking about your efforts to reach new communities, particularly those of color. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eShare with us why it is important for you to take your message [of] conservative values to this audience.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWalker:\u003c/strong\u003e There is probably nothing that I’m more passionate about in my time in the U.S. Congress, whatever time God allows us to serve in this capacity, than to build some of those bridges. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe [it\u0026#8217;s] the background as a pastor for 16 years working in the inner cities of places like Cleveland and New York and Baltimore. I have met so many wonderful people, yet sadly on the behalf of Republicans or conservative ideology as a whole, it has not permeated in to many of these communities. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Democrats have beat us to it, and they have used arts and entertainment, education, politics, pretty much any kind of medium, to be able to propagate a false message that has created a victimhood to the point that you’ve put limitations [on ourselves].\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow, forgive me for using a Scripture reference, but Psalms 139. I understand that every person that God creates [is] fearfully and wonderfully made with unique abilities and talents and skill sets.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eSo part of my job, and you just said it, Rob, [is going beyond] just taking the message to the base. What I say is, we can\u0026#8217;t survive just simply preaching to the choir. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSorry for the other church reference, but how do we augment our message? How do we take it to new places and new communities that have never heard about individual liberty and opportunity in fulfilling the very giftedness that you’re created with? \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s my passion, and we’ve been able to have, I guess, some marginal success. But as long as I get a chance to serve, as I said, we’re going to continue to make that the forefront of our message.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAllen: Congressman, how are you going about encouraging your colleagues on the Hill to reach out to those communities of color and begin to build and strengthen those relationships?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWalker:\u003c/strong\u003e Well, there’s a lot of good intentions by Republicans and my colleagues and some who are working very hard. But I think the biggest flaw that we’ve had over the last decade or so is the idea that there’s a secret policy that builds the conduit to all of our communities. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePolicy, we have to understand, comes second. It is the relationship that comes first, because with healthy relationships, you build trust. And with trust then you have the pathway or the asphalt to be able to drive home some of this wonderful freedom ideology that liberates all of us economically and what have you. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow, the president gets some wonderful props in some of the numbers that we have seen, but in order to build this long term, we have to—to your question, Virginia—be disciplined enough to go into the communities even when you’re not the keynote speaker.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eThis past Sunday, I had a chance to speak at a 95% to 97% predominantly African-American church. In fact, this one, many of the parishioners were immigrants from Kenya, Nigeria, and some other African nations, and I was just so humbled to be there. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI called my wife. She was at our home church. I called my wife afterwards, [about] just the way they treated me with such class, and they made me feel worthy of that. But it is months and years of investment, building those relationships. Genuine, not faking it with some kind of “Hey, like us because we can do this for you,” but earning the trust to be able to talk about things that we believe are best for all of our communities.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBluey: Congressman, our president [at Heritage] Kay Coles James, who I\u0026#8217;ve mentioned already, and our [Daily Signal] editor-in-chief, Katrina Trinko, both wrote about how troubling it was to use the chants [of] “send them back” or “go back.” Kay herself has heard that as an African-American woman in her own experience, and shared how hurtful it was to her personally. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou also came out and were critical of the chant that was heard, “Send them back,” directed at people like [Rep.] Ilhan Omar, a colleague of yours in the House. Why did you feel it so important to speak out on this issue?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWalker:\u003c/strong\u003e Because Republicans must take the lead when it comes to calling some of this out. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s\nnothing more advantageous that the left likes to use than the stereotype that\nRepublicans do not care about communities of color. The second part of that is,\nthere just should be something internally that if we know there are certain\nphrases or certain things that are tropes or phrases that have hurt our\nbrothers and sisters … that shouldn’t be something we have to think about. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat shouldn’t be about politics. That should be about our moral fiber and the content of our character to immediately call that out, even if it’s some people that identify with certain ideology that we may agree with. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s an easy call. It should be. And I felt like it was important for me, being there live at that event, to speak about that. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, the next day, I was having breakfast with the vice president, a handful of the members of leadership, about seven or eight of us. The last thing I said to the vice president [was], “Please communicate to the president that this is something that does not help us.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI was glad to see that President Trump, not just because of my encouragement, later on that day condemned that [chanting], and we haven’t had to worry about that since.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eBut that’s what Republicans have to do. Historically, we are the party that has tried to care about and really lift up the lives of all our communities. But we’ve got to be very, very vocal about it, because we’re pushing back against the narrative that we\u0026#8217;re not.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBluey: The Republican Party certainly has such a rich history. It’s something that I think oftentimes doesn’t get discussed enough or taught in schools, or we just seem to forget. But it is the party of Lincoln, after all. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWalker:\u003c/strong\u003e Absolutely, and we need to continue to build on that.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAllen: You speak openly about how conservative policies, such as criminal justice reform and tax cuts, have really helped low-income communities, including African-American communities. But how should those on the right go about messaging these successes to communities of color?\u003cbr\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWalker:\u003c/strong\u003e Virginia, that\u0026#8217;s a great question. The approach is crucial. If your attitude is you coming in from a condescending standpoint or spike the football, no matter how good the policy might be there’s a defensive reaction, as we all would have. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you’re on\nthe receiving end, and somebody\u0026#8217;s like, “I told you so” or “You should do this,”\nour first human reaction is to resist it a little bit. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI think if we’re disciplined enough to do it, really, from a genuine place of loving the communities that we’re privileged to represent, I think it has a chance to resonate not only quicker, but even augment it to a place where it impacts many more Americans.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBluey: You know, Congressman, last week on “The Daily Signal Podcast,” we featured an interview with CJ Pearson. He’s a 17-year-old high school senior who talked about … how his own family, his parents, are registered Democrats. But the values that they taught him and then continued to teach him in his own house, are what he would consider to be traditional American values or conservative values. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo it sounds like sometimes with the policies, there just might be a disconnect. Because really, in many of these families, they might from a value system be with us, and in many cases, across the board, as CJ talked about.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eWalker:\u003c/strong\u003e There’s no question. I have a friend of mine, his name is Odell Cleveland. He is the CEO, executive pastor of the second-largest African-American church in North Carolina. When he came out five years ago when I first decided to run and not only supported us, but publicly endorsed me, he took a lot of heat over it. There’s a narrative there that you don’t do that. But he was willing to really put his neck on the line to be able to say, “I believe in this guy. I trust his heart in this.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBecause of\nheroes like that, it opens up certain pathways to begin to talk about hard\nissues. That’s to your point, Rob. That’s what I discovered is, there’s a ton\nof similarities there when it comes to pro-life issues, when it comes to what\nwe believe in as far as the best way to rear children in traditional homes. There’s so much there, but there’s been such a false narrative.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eListen, we have to own some of that. When I had a chance to be invited to Alabama with [Rep.] John Lewis to be able to return to the civil rights pilgrimage, I think there were 50 of us on Saturday, 48 Democrats and two Republicans. And sometimes I wonder, with my voting record, why I would be invited, because it’s pretty staunch conservative, but I believe it’s about the heart. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eEven today, earlier, getting a chance to be invited \u0026#8230; by the [Congressional Black Caucus] of all people, even though they know my record is without blemish when it comes to holding up the conservative values that we believe in. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut I believe if you get to the place where you understand that it’s not so much about winning the argument as it is about making a difference, I believe that puts you at a good place to be able to share, really, in a much broader way than maybe even you thought you originally could do.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBluey: Well, I imagine that when you get together with members of the [Congressional Black Caucus] or other Democratic congressmen, you probably both recognize that there is a problem. Maybe you have different solutions for how you would go about addressing it, but fundamentally you all do want to make a difference.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWalker:\u003c/strong\u003e Absolutely, and listen, I don’t shy away from the fact that I believe some of these policies from the left have damaged these communities, entrapped people into poverty, and we’ve seen 50, 60 years of it. So there are big differences, but I’d use this quote: “It’s harder to hate up close.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo if you’re willing to go in and try to build a genuine relationship, but talk about these differences, I’m not under some kind of pie-in-the-sky mentality that once you do that, everything goes away. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut sometimes, as much as I have relationships with those leaders, I would rather go to the communities and say, “Well, here’s the truth about the situation.” Because that’s where the pressure comes up on their leaders to make some changes, as opposed to the other way around.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBluey: You’ve talked about how you attempt to bring people together, and a couple years ago, you were able to bring some conservative congressmen together with leaders of historically black colleges and universities. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTalk about some of the efforts that you’ve attempted \u0026#8230; where you get people together in the same room where they otherwise might not have an opportunity to even have this conversation.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWalker:\u003c/strong\u003e It’s personal for me. One, I represent the largest historical black college and university in the country in North Carolina, A\u0026amp;T, with 12,000 wonderful students. Aggie pride, as we like to say. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMy wife, 25 miles away, went to Winston-Salem State University. She’s got two degrees. And for some of your listeners, you may understand the history of the football rivalry, whether you’re a Ram or Aggie. But once again going and understanding a little bit of where the different cultures have prospered, where they\u0026#8217;ve struggled. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI remember being here and really not even having a title at the time. I wasn\u0026#8217;t vice chair [of the House Republican Conference] like I am now, or even chair of the Republican Study Committee. But I believed it was important for Republicans to hear from these chancellors. The first year, we were able to bring over 80 chancellors from the, I guess, nearly 100 historical black colleges and universities and said, \u0026#8220;Tell us what it is that you see. How can we help?\u0026#8221; \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI think out of that stemmed a year-round Pell Grant that eventually became law, something that impacted their university. Sometimes, just the little things of being able to work a little bit on behalf of the different universities, or different people in general, is something that I believe goes a long way when it comes back to what I said earlier: building that genuine relationship.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAllen: Congressman, for those who are thinking, \u0026#8220;I want to be a part of building those bridges in my community between conservatives and communities of color,\u0026#8221; what advice would you give to them?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWalker:\u003c/strong\u003e Well, I think it starts, I know this isn\u0026#8217;t necessarily a religious broadcast, but I think it starts from your faith. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026#8217;s what\nwe\u0026#8217;re compelled to do in the Ten Commandments. Love your neighbor as yourself.\nIt doesn’t say whether Republican or Democrat, or black or white, or whatever.\nIf you truly do, what happens is, people have a chance to see your heart. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe know, and we’ve been blessed to see that conservative, traditional values put people in the best category\u0026#8211;from anti-poverty, from an education standpoint, and historically from a best prosperity standpoint. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe know\nthat, but how we share those principles is crucial as far as to the next\ngeneration. Listen, as a former pastor for 16 years, I get the divide. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFifty, 60 years ago, when some of the minority communities couldn\u0026#8217;t drink out of the same water fountain or sit at the same lunch counter, like in my hometown of Greensboro, at Woolworth, or that took place, the conservatives and the church, we were slow to react.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow, none of us were around back then, but who was immediately reacting was the progressive movement, the actors, the entertainers of the world, the people that didn’t believe in the same ideology. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere were\nsome relationships forged that we have to go back and say, “Listen, I\nappreciate it historically, but where we have been led astray is thinking that\nmore government has been the solution for all these communities, and we know\nthat nothing could be further from the truth.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe goal is to earn the right and the opportunity to share what we believe.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBluey: Congressman, to wrap up here, a couple of final questions. You’ve mentioned your role as a pastor prior to coming to Congress. Of course, you’ve ascended into a leadership position. Tell us about the vice chair [of the House Republican Conference], what exactly it is that you do, and how people can learn more about you and the work that you have going on.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWalker:\u003c/strong\u003e Well, you’ve been very gracious with your time today. Yeah, I get to serve as what they call the No. 4 [Republican] position in the House. It was a little bit of surprise to me that they would vote for a conservative to be able to do that. … But go back to the relational side, it\u0026#8217;s your colleagues that vote. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eComing out of [being] the chairman for the Republican Study Committee, which was 150 members, it is great to be able to talk about our values, and about budget, deficits, and fiscal responsibility. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s something that’s very important to me, so I guess we combined those two and our colleagues honored us be able to vote us in as vice chair.\u003cbr\u003eA lot of that does have to do with communication and messaging, as you referred to a little bit earlier, Rob. That is something that I am passionate about, and that’s why I feel like it’s so important. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eYes, let’s continue to talk to our base, to be able to lock arms and stand and fight when we need to, and be strong when we need to. But let’s not forget about those who have been robbed of the opportunity to hear about our message as well.

The bill is awaiting a signature of approval by California Gov. Gavin Newsom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAuthored by Assemblyperson Robert Bonta, the bill seeks to address the data gaps in criminal history records that \u0026#8220;undermine their accuracy and reliability,\u0026#8221; according to an AB 1331 fact sheet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, the Department of Justice estimates that 60% of arrest records are missing disposition information, such as the judge\u0026#8217;s ruling or sentencing. This can lead to criminalizing people who may be innocent. In addition, because pretrial risk assessment tools require timely and accurate information, any missing data could result in low-risk people being detained or high-risk individuals being released.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are very few data collection standards In California, a state in which the criminal justice landscape is \u0026#8220;highly decentralized\u0026#8221; and each entity is responsible for its own data collection, Mikaela Rabinowitz, director of national engagement and field operations at non-partisan criminal justice data analysis organization Measures for Justice told TechCrunch. This makes it hard for the California Department of Justice to accurately track people across those systems, she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo address this, AB 1331 aims to establish clear collecting and reporting requirements for law enforcement agencies and courts. The legislation is designed to help law enforcement agencies to make better decisions about defendants and enable courts to share data with organizations like Measures for Justice, which aims to change the way we measure and understand criminal justice data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2016, California passed the OpenJustice Data Act, \u003ca href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/02/17/california-dojs-openjustice-platform-makes-local-law-enforcement-data-more-transparent/\"\u003ewhich led to the creation of a criminal justice data platform available to the public\u003c/a\u003e. The interactive platform, spearheaded by the California Department of Justice, features data from California’s 1,000-plus law enforcement agencies to allow for side-by-side comparison of agencies, like the San Francisco Police Department versus the Los Angeles Police Department.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the OpenJustice platform represented a major step in the right direction, it wasn\u0026#8217;t enough.

This round brings the total raised by Trigo to $29 million.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe company is not disclosing its valuation, but says that it has a number of deals in place already with grocery chains, including an unspecified European chain and Shufersal, the largest grocer in Israel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShufersal already has plans to implement Trigo\u0026#8217;s solution in 280 stores in the next five years, which speaks to the company\u0026#8217;s ambitions and traction to date, even at this early stage in its development: The company says that it\u0026#8217;s already piloting its camera and sensor technology in stores that are 5,000 square feet, or twice the size of a typical Amazon Go store. It\u0026#8217;s, however, still fairly small \u003ca href=\"http://money.com/money/136330/why-your-grocery-store-may-soon-be-cut-in-half/\"\u003ecompared to the size\u003c/a\u003e of a large supermarket (35,000-45,000 square feet) or even smaller challenger markets like a Trader Joe\u0026#8217;s or a Lidl (20,000 square feet).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs with Amazon Go, Trigo works by implementing a series of cameras throughout a store to monitor shoppers and record what they are placing into their baskets. This is not just about being able to identify items: it\u0026#8217;s also a triangulation system to ensure that people are not charged twice for items, and that items are removed from the total if they are discarded before a person leaves the store.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it\u0026#8217;s not just to speed things up, either.

What would happen if a store could have an entirely new OS that is based on computer vision?\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnlike Amazon Go, Trigo is not tied to any specific company that might potentially compete with the retailers that it is targeting, and the product can be implemented to work with loyalty cards, or without them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, given that Amazon has built one of the world\u0026#8217;s most valuable companies by being both a simultaneous competitor and partner to businesses, I\u0026#8217;m not sure that its competitor status will be a gating factor to the growth of Amazon Go, if it decides to productise it and sell the technology to other retailers\u0026#8230; and neither does Trigo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;The technology behind Amazon Go existed in the industry for about a decade before Amazon Go,\u0026#8221; Peled said (Trigo was founded in 2018 by brothers Michael and Daniel Gabay). \u0026#8220;But after it launched, it was a moment of realising, \u0026#8216;Ah, this is really happening!\u0026#8217; \u0026#8221; Meaning, he knew now would be a fruitful period because other grocery retailers would want to get on board, and even if Amazon did roll Go out as its own service, and a service used by other retailers, there will be others who will never work with it, presenting a market opportunity to his startup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the endgame is bringing the time spent in the check-out phase down to zero, there are other startups working on alternative ways to reach that. Just last week, \u003ca href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/10/caper-shopping-cart/\"\u003eCaper\u003c/a\u003e raised a round of funding for a system that is based on \u0026#8220;smart\u0026#8221; trolleys, with sensors attached to grocery carts to take note of items and add them to your shopping bill. While the shopping cart might have the advantage of being able to more closely monitor an individual\u0026#8217;s own shopping cart, store-wide systems like Trigo\u0026#8217;s will potentially cost less to operate and the software might even be something that can be used on existing in-store cameras.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInterestingly, at a time when patents form one of the key ways that a company defends its intellectual property, Trigo is taking another approach. \u0026#8220;We don\u0026#8217;t file patents because we don\u0026#8217;t want our technology to be public,\u0026#8221; said Peled. \u0026#8220;We have things that we don\u0026#8217;t want anyone to see.\u0026#8221; It\u0026#8217;s an ironic, if perhaps telling, stance for a computer vision company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the rush to build tech solutions to all the world\u0026#8217;s problems (and if not problems, at least all the world\u0026#8217;s processes), there are bound to be others building further technology to bring grocery stores into the twenty-first century. Trigo presents one route to getting there, making it as much a coveted company for grocery businesses as it is for the companies that provide other services to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We believe that Trigo’s world-leading computer-vision team will be the first to scale this technology globally and unlock the full potential of a true grocery-wide revolution,” said Barak Salomon, managing partner of Red Dot Capital. “The process of manually scanning barcodes for each separate item at check out is outdated and time-consuming.

Today\u0026#8217;s round brings the total raised to $11 million, according to the company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCompany founder and CEO Kevin Wang says that over the last 18 months, the startup has concentrated on building tools to help enterprises comply with their growing use of open source in a safe and legal way. He says that overall this increasing use of open source is great news for developers, and for these bigger companies in general. While it enables them to take advantage of all the innovation going on in the open-source community, they need to make sure they are in compliance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;The enterprise is really early on this journey, and that\u0026#8217;s where we come in. We provide a platform to help the enterprise manage open-source usage at scale,\u0026#8221; Wang explained. That involves three main pieces. First it tracks all of the open-source and third-party code being used inside a company. Next, it enforces licensing and security policy, and, finally, it has a reporting component. \u0026#8220;We automate the mass reporting and compliance for all of the housekeeping that comes from using open source at scale,\u0026#8221; he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe enterprise focus is relatively new for the company. It originally launched in 2017 as a tool for developers to track individual use of open source inside their programs. Wang saw a huge opportunity inside the enterprise to apply this same kind of capability inside larger organizations, which were hungry for tools to help them comply with the myriad open-source licenses out there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;We found that there was no tooling out there that can manage the scale and breadth across all the different enterprise use cases and all the really complex mission-critical code bases,\u0026#8221; he said. What\u0026#8217;s more, he found that where there were existing tools, they were vastly underutilized or didn\u0026#8217;t provide broad enough coverage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe company announced a \u003ca href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/23/fossa-scores-2-2-m-seed-round-to-automate-open-source-license-management-for-developers/\"\u003e$2.2 million seed round\u003c/a\u003e in 2017, and since then has grown from 10 to 40 employees.

The look and feel is more reminiscent of the Tab S5e, which was released after the S4 earlier this year and which acts as a more economical alternative to Samsung\u0026#8217;s flagship lineup. The S6 manages to feel just a touch more premium than the S5e, though both are class-leading in terms of their industrial design.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe brushed finish of the back looks great, and feels nice in the hand, and if you have larger hands you can even one-hand this device when reading for limited periods of time. Samsung has also shrunk the bezels, giving you a more front face-filling screen than on any previous tablet, which does a very good job of putting the gorgeous sAMOLED display in focus. More than ever, this feels like one big sleek, metallic hand-held display \u0026#8212; the future, in your hand, reduced to the essentials in an awesome way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[gallery ids=\"1881813,1881812,1881811\"]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eDisplay and cameras\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe display on the Tab S6 isn\u0026#8217;t much changed from the one used on the Tab S5e and the Tab S4 \u0026#8212; but that\u0026#8217;s actually great news, because Samsung has the best tablet display in the business when it comes to watching media. The 10.5-inch 2560 x 1600 pixel Super AMOLED display gives you true blacks that are outstanding, and impossible to replicate on any LED-based display, and Samsung offers a range of color options from which to choose, including \u0026#8220;natural\u0026#8221; settings for photo-accurate editing, and enhanced saturation modes for getting the most out of eye-popping movies and videos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat display now comes with a neat new trick on the Tab S6: an integrated fingerprint reader. This authentication and unlock method is new for this generation, and replaces iris/face scanning as the only biometric unlock option on the Tab S4. It performs very well in my testing, and has the added cool factor of being just an amazing bit of whiz-bang tech magic, especially if this is your first time encountering an in-display fingerprint reader.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/tab-s6-screen-fingerprint-unlock.gif\"\u003e\u003cimg class=\"breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-1881816\" title=\"tab-s6-screen-fingerprint-unlock\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/tab-s6-screen-fingerprint-unlock.gif\" alt=\"tab s6 screen fingerprint unlock\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe great display makes a fantastic editing surface for photos and videos, and that\u0026#8217;s why it\u0026#8217;s super interesting that Samsung went out of their way to upgrade the cameras on the Tab S6 \u0026#8212; adding dual camera options, in fact. There\u0026#8217;s now a super-wide-angle lens in addition to the standard one, which gives you a lot of creative options when it comes to both still photography and videos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the Tab S6 is great for editing, I still wouldn\u0026#8217;t lean too heavily on the built-in cameras for actually capturing content. They\u0026#8217;re fine cameras, augmented by Samsung\u0026#8217;s built-in software, but the super-wide has a fair amount of distortion and not the best resolution, and in general I still think you should avoid shooting too much with tablet cameras.

For pressure-sensitive applications, including sketching and painting, it\u0026#8217;s fantastic, but where it really shines in my usage is in editing photos using software like Lightroom from Adobe. Stylus input means you can get super specific and accurate with your edits. This applies to editing video, too, where the stylus works well for making concise trims to video timelines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou also can easily create handwritten notes with the S Pen, and if you do so using Samsung\u0026#8217;s built-in Notes application, you get automatic OCR and search indexing. In my testing, I found that this worked really, really well \u0026#8212; surprisingly so, considering how bad my handwriting is. For printed characters, the Samsung Notes app had no trouble at all identifying words accurately in my scrawl and retrieving the right results when searching by keyword.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause this S Pen uses Bluetooth, it now has a built-in rechargeable battery. Like Apple\u0026#8217;s Pencil, it charges wirelessly, attaching magnetically to the tablet to power up. Samsung has designed a groove in the back of the tablet to receive the S Pen for charging, and while this isn\u0026#8217;t sturdy enough for you to trust it to hold the stylus when you throw them in your bag unprotected, the Tab S6 cover accessory nicely wraps the S Pen with a fold-down flap for easy storage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-S6-6.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg class=\"breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-1881810\" title=\"Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 (6)\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-S6-6.jpg\" alt=\"Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 6\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-S6-6.jpg 2400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-S6-6.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-S6-6.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-S6-6.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-S6-6.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-S6-6.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eA true workhorse\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSamsung\u0026#8217;s official case options include a back panel protector/detachable keyboard combo that are probably the best accessory of this style available on the market for any tablet.

When it works well, the DeX experience truly makes the Tab S6 feel like a mini desktop, giving you the power to tackle tasks in multiple windows \u0026#8212; including in multiple windows for the same apps. It\u0026#8217;s great for things like seeing Slack open and working in multiple browser windows, along with your email client, for instance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat said, there are definite limitations to DeX, including the need to re-open all your windows when switching back from standard Android mode, for instance. Not every app behaves well in this novel mode, either, as third-party ones especially aren\u0026#8217;t designed for it, and there are quirks to the windowing (like overflowing and weird-sized windows) that make it occasionally a little strange to work with. Still, all in all, it\u0026#8217;s great to have the option, and can really increase your ability to do work on the road in the right circumstances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eBottom line\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-S6-5.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg class=\"breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-1881811\" title=\"Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 (5)\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-S6-5.jpg\" alt=\"Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 5\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-S6-5.jpg 2400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-S6-5.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-S6-5.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-S6-5.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-S6-5.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-S6-5.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 is, without a doubt, the best Android tablet available.

The CRM giant has been doubling down on building specialised solutions for individual industry verticals, and today, it is unveiling new business units dedicated to not one but two of them: manufacturing and consumer goods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Manufacturing Cloud and Consumer Goods Cloud, as the two new products are called, are the latest in a list of other vertical-specific products the \u003ca href=\"https://www.salesforce.com/uk/solutions/industries/#\"\u003ecompany has created\u003c/a\u003e. Other verticals targeted to date include finance, healthcare, media, nonprofits and retail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe idea behind \u003ca class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/salesforce\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"salesforce\"\u003eSalesforce\u0026#8217;s \u003cspan class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e strategy to build industry-specific solutions is that while the CRM and sales processes that go into manufacturing and consumer goods do have some aspects in common with other industries, both also have relatively specific requirements, too, around how sales are agreed and clients are managed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the case of manufacturing and consumer goods, both are capital-intensive businesses where those working on the physical products might be very removed from those working on sales (not just in terms of job functions, but in terms of the software that\u0026#8217;s used to manage each operation), or those who are in the field who are helping to distribute those goods to the people ultimately selling them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In the manufacturing industry, changing customer and market demands can have a devastating effect on the bottom line, so being able to understand what is happening on the ground is imperative for success,” said Cindy Bolt, SVP and GM, Salesforce Manufacturing, in a statement. “Manufacturing Cloud bridges the gap between sales and operations teams while ensuring more predictive and transparent business, so they can build deeper and more trusted relationships with their customers.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn both the cases of manufacturing and consumer goods, Salesforce is not creating these services out of thin air: the company had already been touting solutions for both sectors as \u003ca href=\"https://www.salesforce.com/uk/solutions/industries/#\"\u003epart of its bigger push into specific industries\u003c/a\u003e. Past acquisitions of companies like \u003ca href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2015/12/23/salesforce-grabs-quote-to-cash-vendor-steelbrick-for-360-million/\"\u003eSteelbrick\u003c/a\u003e \u0026#8212; a specialist in quote-to-cash solutions, a cornerstone of how manufacturing sales are made \u0026#8212; are likely to have played a contributing role in how the new clouds were built.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the Manufacturing Cloud, Salesforce says that it has included a feature for sales agreements that link up with a company\u0026#8217;s ERP and forecasting software to be able to better predict demand from individual customers as well as the wider market. The services are also coming with more analytical insights by way of Einstein Analytics, and more functionality to work with channel partners. Third parties working with Salesforce on joint solutions using Marketing Cloud include Acumen Solutions, Deloitte and Rootstock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Consumer Goods Cloud has some parallel with the Manufacturing Cloud, in that both are targeting businesses that are by their nature and by legacy very rooted in physical goods and are therefore not easily \u0026#8220;disrupted\u0026#8221; by digital innovation. Indeed, despite all that we hear about the might of Amazon and e-commerce, a full 95% of products are still sold in physical stores. That system has a lot of drawbacks, not least of them being challenges with consumer goods brands having accurate control over how products are distributed and ultimately sold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Retail execution remains one of the most important pieces of a consumer goods brands strategy, but so much opportunity is wasted if the field rep doesn’t have the data and technology needed to make smart decisions,” said John Strain, GM and SVP, Retail and Consumer Goods at Salesforce, in a statement. “Consumer Goods Cloud provides these field reps with the tools they need to be successful on the ground while helping build both business opportunities and stronger relationships with their retail partners.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe company, citing research from PwC, claims that of the $200 billion that\u0026#8217;s spent in the U.S. by consumer goods companies each year on merchandising, marketing and sales efforts for in-store sales, some $100 billion of that spend is never used in the way it was originally intended. (That\u0026#8217;s one reason so many consumer goods companies have jumped into social media: it\u0026#8217;s a way of connecting better and more directly, at least with the customers.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat represents a huge area to tackle for a company likes Salesforce, and the Consumer Goods Cloud is the start of that effort. The product covers software that addresses areas optimising visits to stores, improving relationships with retailers, using Einstein insights for analytics and ordering software. Partners in the effort include Accenture and PwC.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother important thing to note here is that Salesforce\u0026#8217;s move into the area comes as a competitive strike: Not only are there companies out there that have built products specifically for these markets \u0026#8212; Sysco for consumer goods, and Atlatl Software for manufacturing, for example \u0026#8212; but Salesforce has to contend with general rivals such as Microsoft and SAP also targeting the same potential customers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs of last quarter, Sales Cloud now accounts for \u003ca href=\"https://www.salesforce.com/company/news-press/press-releases/2019/08/192208-g/\"\u003emore than one-quarter\u003c/a\u003e of Salesforce\u0026#8217;s revenues, but today\u0026#8217;s news underscores how \u0026#8220;sales\u0026#8221; is becoming a more complex and nuanced topic for the company as its business continues to grow, and as cloud-based digital processes become ever more ubiquitous across all sectors beyond simply knowledge workers. As Salesforce builds out more solutions to meet every kind of enterprise\u0026#8217;s needs, it\u0026#8217;s likely there will be more vertical-specific tools making their way to the platform.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"feedflare\"\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=bk0oCnB6nE8:UTQgy_9jRMY:2mJPEYqXBVI\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=bk0oCnB6nE8:UTQgy_9jRMY:7Q72WNTAKBA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=bk0oCnB6nE8:UTQgy_9jRMY:yIl2AUoC8zA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=bk0oCnB6nE8:UTQgy_9jRMY:-BTjWOF_DHI\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=bk0oCnB6nE8:UTQgy_9jRMY:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=bk0oCnB6nE8:UTQgy_9jRMY:D7DqB2pKExk\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=bk0oCnB6nE8:UTQgy_9jRMY:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=bk0oCnB6nE8:UTQgy_9jRMY:qj6IDK7rITs\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/bk0oCnB6nE8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/bk0oCnB6nE8/","published":"2019-09-16T12:39:49Z","guid":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=1881767"},{"title":"Plaid announces strategic investment from Mastercard and Visa","content":"\u003cp id=\"speakable-summary\"\u003eWhen \u003ca class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/plaid\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"plaid\"\u003ePlaid \u003cspan class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e announced its \u003ca href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/11/fintech-startup-plaid-raises-250m-at-a-2-65b-valuation/\"\u003e$250 million Series C\u003c/a\u003e investment last year, it left out a couple of key investors.

The AR component of the app seems like it will be a better party game than solo experience, but the effects used here are great and it really plays with distance and perspective in a way that an AR game should. A good totem for the genre going forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eI was able to play several of the games across all three platforms including Apple TV with an Xbox controller, iPhone and iPad. While some favored controller (Skate City) and others touch controls (Super Impossible Road), all felt like I could play them either way without much difficulty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eThere are also some surprises in the initial batch of games like Lego Brawls — a Smash Brothers clone that will be a big hit for car rides and get togethers I think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eMy hope is that the Apple Arcade advantage, an agressive $4.99 price and prime placement in the App Store, may help to create an umbrella of sorts for games that don’t fit the ‘big opening weekend’ revenue mold and I hope Apple leans into that. I know that there may be action-oriented and big name titles in the package now and in the future, and that’s fine. But there are many kinds of games out there that are fantastic but “minor” in the grand scheme of things and having a place that could create sustainability in the market for these gems is a great thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eThe financial terms were not disclosed by Apple but many of the developers appear to have gotten up front money to make games for the platform and, doubtless, there is a rev share on some sort of basis, probably usage or installs. Whatever it is, I hope the focus is on sustainability, but the people responsible for Arcade inside Apple are making all the right noises about that so I have hopes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eI am especially glad that Apple is being aggressive with the pricing and with the restrictions it has set for the store, including no in-app purchases or ads. This creates an environment where a parent (ratings permitting) can be confident that a kid playing games from the Arcade tab will not be besieged with casino ads in the middle of their puzzle game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eThere is, however, a general irony in the fact that Apple had to create Apple Arcade because of the proliferation of loot box/currency/in-app purchase revenue models. An economy driven by the App Store’s overall depressive effect on the price of games and the decade long acclimation people have had to spending less and less, down to free, for games and apps on the store.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eBy bundling them into a subscription, Apple sidesteps the individual purchase barrier that it has had a big hand in creating in the first place. While I don’t think it is fully to blame — plenty of other platforms aggressively promote loot box mechanics — a big chunk of the responsibility to fix this distortion does rest on Apple. Apple Arcade is a great stab at that and I hope that the early titles are an indicator of the overall variety and quality that we can expect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"feedflare\"\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=jm-oH_8-yl8:saX4D6AuPO0:2mJPEYqXBVI\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=jm-oH_8-yl8:saX4D6AuPO0:7Q72WNTAKBA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=jm-oH_8-yl8:saX4D6AuPO0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=jm-oH_8-yl8:saX4D6AuPO0:-BTjWOF_DHI\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=jm-oH_8-yl8:saX4D6AuPO0:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=jm-oH_8-yl8:saX4D6AuPO0:D7DqB2pKExk\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=jm-oH_8-yl8:saX4D6AuPO0:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=jm-oH_8-yl8:saX4D6AuPO0:qj6IDK7rITs\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/jm-oH_8-yl8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/jm-oH_8-yl8/","published":"2019-09-16T19:04:43Z","guid":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=1882151"}]},{"url":"https://www.theverge.com/rss/full.xml","items":[{"title":"Apple Arcade goes live for iOS 13 beta testers","content":"\u003cimg alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AxESVtLgL9YuBnkMFg1x-dzv-Bs=/21x0:1611x1060/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/65256204/Apple_apple_arcade_launches_on_app_store_sept_19_091619.0.jpg\" /\u003e\n\n  \u003csmall\u003eImage: Apple\u003c/small\u003e\n\n  \u003cp id=\"hIbnDw\"\u003eA few days ahead of its scheduled September 19th launch, Apple Arcade is now live and accepting subscriptions from those participating in Apple’s iOS 13 beta program. \u003cem\u003eBloomberg’s\u003c/em\u003e Mark Gurman \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1173657144379498496\"\u003etweeted\u003c/a\u003e that Apple’s gaming service, which unlocks access to dozens of ad-free games for a monthly fee, was up and running.

While at NASA’s Space Operations Center in Washington DC, Pitt chatted with astronaut Nick Hague who has been living on the ISS since March. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Pgz1vB\"\u003eISS astronauts are fairly accustomed to doing interviews with journalists and schoolchildren while in space, but it’s a rare occasion when a movie actor is the voice on the line. Pitt started his line of questioning firmly in the entertainment sphere, asking Hague how realistic his new movie is when it comes to physics. (While the movie comes out on September 20th here on Earth, Hague and his fellow astronauts got to see it in advance.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-float-right\"\u003e\u003caside id=\"KzV1NS\"\u003e\u003cq\u003e“How did we do?

How was our zero-g?” Hague had only good things to say about the depiction, but he noted that he probably enjoyed real microgravity more than Pitt did. “I got to imagine it was a lot easier for me to kind of enjoy the zero-g,” said Hague, noting that while he was free-floating, Pitt would have had to be hooked to strings or acting against CGI.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"GbUjya\"\u003ePitt asked Hague a lot of questions about what experiments he was working on, what spacewalking is like, and how the astronauts manage to have a normal sleeping schedule when they see 16 sunrises and 16 sunsets every day. The key: having the right color of light to wake them up in the morning and the right one to put them to sleep. The actor also wanted to know how one handles living in space for up to 200 days at a time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"pb5Wgn\"\u003e“What is that like on the psyche?” asked Pitt. “I’m sure you’re always busy, but at the same time missing family and loved ones at home. How do you keep your mental state at peace?” Hague’s answer: “One of the luxuries I think we have of working in low Earth orbit close to the Earth is the amount of connectivity that we have.” He pointed out that he can easily do video calls with his family and check in with them on a regular basis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"PjpzpI\"\u003eOf course, the discussion eventually turned to much more serious matters, as Pitt wanted to know “who controls the jam box?” Apparently, the astronauts have a rotating playlist that they all take turns contributing to. “It’s nice because we have the international flair as well,” said Hague. “So we have an Italian astronaut on board, along with the US astronauts and then two cosmonauts. And so getting to hear some traditional music from Russia over dinner is... a nice change exposure and helps us really appreciate that international feel that the crew has.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"fanyFH\"\u003eThe entire interview took about 20 minutes; you can watch the full video above.

It’s not uncommon for your local retailer to stock several cheaper phone options from both reputable and comparatively unknown brands, all of which have cribbed the popular design of the moment to blend in with the others. Finding a low-cost phone that’s worth buying is harder than it should be, and it’s easy to take the fall on the wrong device. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"wP0aKV\"\u003eWe’ve spent some time with a handful of sub-$300 phones, which you’re likely to encounter if you go shopping online or at your local store. Out of that pool of candidates, only one gets you a tremendous amount of bang for your buck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"wNYvwV\"\u003eThe best inexpensive phone right now: Moto G7\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-wide-block\"\u003e  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yBk6bovg_rdO50pS-t5c8aMjwfA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19194744/akrales_190912_3656_0035.jpg\"\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"IfLEcv\"\u003eWhen someone asks me to recommend a phone, I want to suggest the option that costs the least amount of money and has the fewest compromises. A phone that meets all of my personal qualifications does exist. It has a nice screen, it works with every US carrier, and its software is fun and easy to use. I’m talking about the Moto G7.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"dTikqP\"\u003eThe best thing about Motorola’s budget phone is that it doesn’t look or feel cheap. You can purchase the phone in black or white, and it’s covered on its front and back with shiny Gorilla Glass. It has a large 6.2-inch 2270 x 1080 LCD screen, and thanks to slim bezels and a small teardrop notch, it has a sizable amount of screen real estate. Colors and details pop with sharpness and accuracy, and although this screen lacks HDR, video still looks great on the screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"hKy7Fe\"\u003e\u003cdiv data-anthem-component=\"scorecard:8848451\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"1sLwMF\"\u003eThe Moto G7 has Qualcomm’s midrange Snapdragon 636 processor, and it’s snappy in day-to-day use for things like browsing Twitter, switching between portrait and horizontal modes in YouTube, and handling video calls via Google Duo. It has 4GB of RAM (which is an impressive count for a budget-minded phone), and doing more intensive tasks, like playing some games and multitasking with multiple apps, doesn’t slow down this phone. Of course, the most demanding games, like \u003cem\u003ePUBG\u003c/em\u003e, demand a better processor to run at fast frame rates, but I think most people will be happy with what the G7 is capable of in the performance department.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"yMgqnw\"\u003eThe Moto G7 is no slouch when it comes to the little details. It has ambient sensors that wake up the screen if you pick it up or even just move your hand near the phone. This makes it easy to check the time without pushing any buttons, and you can tap into notifications or skip songs with media controls from within this view. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003caside id=\"ofSo3x\"\u003e\u003cdiv data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Motorola Moto G7 and G7 Power review: still the budget phones to beat\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/10/18304664/motorola-moto-g7-power-play-review-budget-affordable-android-phones\"}]}'\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003cp id=\"Q18fAB\"\u003eIt has a microSD card slot to easily expand the storage, which is handy if you’re someone who wants to install a bunch of games, download countless videos from Netflix, or both. This phone has a headphone jack if you want to connect some wired headphones (I’m one of those people), and it charges via USB-C. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"9k5P8W\"\u003eSomething that Motorola has been good about for a while is making phones that work with every US carrier (Sprint, Verizon, AT\u0026amp;T, T-Mobile) and MVNO (Cricket Wireless, Mint Mobile, Google Fi, to name a few popular ones). The Moto G7 is no exception. And aside from the other Moto G7 phones mentioned in this guide, you won’t find this feature in most inexpensive phones from other brands. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-wide-block\"\u003e  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4me9SHHa7oA_ogwvFxrgNyw7KJ8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/15990548/akrales_190326_3320_0072.jpg\"\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"q34Zkb\"\u003eThe software the G7 runs is close to pure Android 9 Pie, like what you can find on a Google Pixel. That’s a good thing, though it’s not \u003cem\u003eexactly\u003c/em\u003e the same. Moto’s interface tweaks look a little dated by comparison, though, notably, you won’t find any bloatware here. And what little Moto has added to the suite of preinstalled apps, which includes a small list of gestures, are actually helpful. To name a few, you can switch on the ability to take a screengrab by tapping three fingers to the screen, or there’s a setting that lets the volume keys change the song when the phone’s screen is off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"0JEAHH\"\u003eLike all of the phones that I tested out, the G7 makes sacrifices to reach a low price. The cameras aren’t superb, but I think they’re better than what many users might expect from a phone at this price point. In my colleague Chris Welch’s \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/10/18304664/motorola-moto-g7-power-play-review-budget-affordable-android-phones\"\u003emore extensive review of the Moto G7\u003c/a\u003e, he noted that it takes respectable photos in well-lit environments, and I agree. It can even do portrait shots with its second 5MP sensor, which is there to collect depth-sensing data, and those look decent, too. The Moto G7 gets edged out by the more expensive Samsung Galaxy A50 when it comes to nighttime shooting, though neither is particularly good at it. Despite the A50’s three-lens camera system, which suggests better quality, I like the look of the photos taken by the G7 more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"BWhdtU\"\u003eThe rest\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"SCvftu\"\u003eThe Moto G7 is the best inexpensive phone for the vast majority of people, and there currently isn’t another low-cost phone that’s as well-designed or packs as much functionality and value. If you don’t like our top choice, there are other options to consider below. Some are a bit cheaper than the G7 and have features like USB-C charging, decent battery life, a good screen, and a fingerprint sensor. But for one reason or another, detailed below, they’re not as good of a value as the G7.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"OWVQnA\"\u003e\u003cdiv data-anthem-component=\"scorecard:8848484\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"i8nqFr\"\u003e\u003cdiv data-anthem-component=\"scorecard:8848499\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"0euzxF\"\u003e\u003cdiv data-anthem-component=\"scorecard:8848479\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"ejsLvG\"\u003e\u003cdiv data-anthem-component=\"scorecard:8848488\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"BKmO3l\"\u003e\u003cdiv data-anthem-component=\"scorecard:8848503\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"kEMkDN\"\u003e\u003cdiv data-anthem-component=\"scorecard:8848494\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"5rYtbh\"\u003e\u003csmall\u003e\u003cem\u003eVox Media has affiliate partnerships.

Not every business owner started as a procurement expert. You may be a master when it comes to sales or product development, but procurement presents a wide range of challenges and opportunities. When you’re not sure what to do, a procurement expert can provide impartial judgment to help make the right decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA procurement expert could put your business on the right track when:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cb\u003e1. You’re considering a GPO.\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://whatisagpo.com/what-gpo-group-purchasing-organization-una/\"\u003eGroup purchasing organizations\u003c/a\u003e, or GPOs, allow groups of businesses to access bulk procurement pricing. These organizations hold a ton of sway in vendors\u0026#8217; eyes, especially when multiple companies within the same industry band together. If you aren\u0026#8217;t in a GPO but would like to explore your options, a procurement expert can help you sift through the noise to figure out which GPO would be the best fit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile all GPOs seek to get members access to better prices, you shouldn’t join the most popular GPO in your industry without researching your options. Your company might differentiate itself in the market through higher-quality products or services. The wrong GPO could bring the wrong products into your business — and give customers the wrong impression of your priorities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cb\u003e2. You’re entering a new market.\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen your business enters a new arena, you need new supplies and products to make the leap. Often, your existing vendors can\u0026#8217;t meet your new needs, so you have to look elsewhere. A procurement expert can ensure you get started on the right foot in new territory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven if your existing vendors have what you need to make the move, new markets provide new opportunities. Perhaps another vendor or group of vendors could provide better products at cheaper prices. You won’t know unless you look — and if you don’t know where to look, a procurement expert can help unearth the best potential partners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cb\u003e3. Your margins are thinner than they should be.\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou probably don’t have direct access to your competitors’ books, but you should have an idea of \u003ca href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/041415/what-considered-healthy-operating-profit-margin.asp\"\u003estandard profit margins\u003c/a\u003e for your industry. If your margins are low, you may be paying more money for the same products your competitors get for less.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConsult with a procurement expert in your field to make sure you’re not missing out on potential savings. A difference of a single percentage point could make a massive difference in your company’s profitability. As global competition increases, you can\u0026#8217;t afford to waste money when others source the same (or better) products at cheaper prices. A procurement expert can help you identify areas of opportunity and, if necessary, switch to new providers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cb\u003e4. Your customer retention rates are low.\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe your margins are good, but your customers don’t stick around after the first purchase. Customer retention and lifetime value (LTV) connect to several factors, such as customer experience, but research from \u003ca href=\"https://wikibuy.com/blog/brand-loyalty-survey-2019-98cc73acc509\"\u003eCapital One’s Wikibuy\u003c/a\u003e found product quality to be the most important factor in brand loyalty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen your customers try your brand once and keep looking for better options, your products may be the problem. You can test that theory by offering a new premium product or by upgrading your existing product line with better supplies. Even if your margins go down, you\u0026#8217;ll more than make up the difference if you create a significant increase in customer LTV. A procurement expert can help you discover and evaluate your options.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cb\u003e5. You’re not happy with your current vendors.\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat happens when your margins and customer satisfaction statistics look good, but you don’t like working with your current suppliers? You don’t have to put up with bad customer service, weak communication, or shipment delays. By consulting with a procurement expert, you can weed out bad suppliers and start working with people who keep their word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteadier supplier relations can create a chain reaction within your company. Supply-side reliability means your logistics crew can provide more accurate estimates to sales and service teams, who can turn around and provide customers with good news more often. Procurement experts know your options and can share data and stories about which providers have the best reputations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven if you have plenty of time to research your procurement strategy, you can save time and money in the long run by consulting a procurement professional. The next time you find yourself facing one of these tough situations, turn to an expert so you can spend less time sifting through marketing materials and more time building better relationships for your business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe post \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/09/16/need-procurement-expert-5-signs/\"\u003eDo You Need a Procurement Expert? 5 Signs It’s Time to Seek Help\u003c/a\u003e appeared first on \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\"\u003eReadWrite\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"feedflare\"\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=X6VTDkaLZuU:Jku65I38Pqc:qj6IDK7rITs\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=X6VTDkaLZuU:Jku65I38Pqc:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?i=X6VTDkaLZuU:Jku65I38Pqc:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=X6VTDkaLZuU:Jku65I38Pqc:yIl2AUoC8zA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=X6VTDkaLZuU:Jku65I38Pqc:Ij26kaj3iuU\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=Ij26kaj3iuU\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=X6VTDkaLZuU:Jku65I38Pqc:C2pbw5bZMiI\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=C2pbw5bZMiI\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=X6VTDkaLZuU:Jku65I38Pqc:HaYztYP2wyo\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=HaYztYP2wyo\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=X6VTDkaLZuU:Jku65I38Pqc:fvyXWMd9xfE\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=fvyXWMd9xfE\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=X6VTDkaLZuU:Jku65I38Pqc:OqabYuBsmOY\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=OqabYuBsmOY\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/readwriteweb/~4/X6VTDkaLZuU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/readwriteweb/~3/X6VTDkaLZuU/","published":"2019-09-16T07:00:58Z","guid":"https://readwrite.com/?p=159192"},{"title":"How Mobile Apps Can Enhance Real-World Experiences","content":"\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cimg width=\"300\" height=\"185\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Mobile-Apps-Can-Enhance-Real-World-Experiences-300x185.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"mobile app experiences\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Mobile-Apps-Can-Enhance-Real-World-Experiences-300x185.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Mobile-Apps-Can-Enhance-Real-World-Experiences-260x160.jpg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Mobile-Apps-Can-Enhance-Real-World-Experiences.jpg 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eMost mobile apps seek to be the center of attention. They are created by owners and product managers who \u003ca href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/05/08/top-14-iot-mobile-app-development-trends-to-expect-in-2019-and-beyond/\"\u003eobsess\u003c/a\u003e over extending as many user sessions as possible. Unfortunately, they don\u0026#8217;t place a high consideration on the impacts of their customers\u0026#8217; well-being. Meanwhile, many users are increasingly aware of how much time they are spending staring and tapping at their favorite apps. Apple has even made users more aware of just how much\u003ca href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2018/06/ios-12-introduces-new-features-to-reduce-interruptions-and-manage-screen-time/\"\u003e time they are spending on their phones\u003c/a\u003e with their iOS 12 update. In the face of these \u003ca href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/07/05/personalization-of-mobile-apps-and-ways-to-do-it/\"\u003eemerging trends\u003c/a\u003e, it seems like the perfect time to ask how mobile apps should focus on enhancing and supplementing existing real-world experiences, rather than replacing them. How is it possible that mobile apps can enhance real-world experiences?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cb\u003eStart with Good Intentions\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMobile apps can \u003ca href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/07/03/8-tech-trends-to-watch-out-for-in-2019/\"\u003estreamline and facilitate real-world experiences\u003c/a\u003e to the benefit of customers and businesses. For example, a theme park could create an app that enables guests to view ride line times and closures. Such an app would increase the number of rides each guest is able to enjoy in a visit, reduce the undesired time each visitor wastes in line, and drive guests to previously under-explored attractions. In turn, this will improve customer satisfaction. It could also possibly increase the number of guests the park can entertain on any given day. It’s a complete win-win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePay attention to how this example app is able to maximize the best parts (riding rides) and minimize the worst parts (standing in line) of existing experiences. This app solves a particular problem, while not necessarily playing a role in every aspect of the overall guest experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cb\u003eContinue by Going too Far\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter seeing the app\u0026#8217;s remarkable success, managers of this amusement park might want to see how they can further facilitate guest interactions. They know that more guests fit into the park when they are evenly distributed across the many available rides. As a result, app owners might seek to motivate guests to explore less popular attractions. Their product managers might come up with a “game” whereby guests have a passbook that gets stamped for each coaster ridden. In this game, guests are able to experience the thrill of going from ride to ride completing their collection of digital marks. They might even get achievements for experiencing entire sections of the park!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere, app creators are overstepping their bounds and unnaturally manipulating the way users interact with a place. In this example, the app has become the ends and not the means of this experience. This process removes any consideration for the end customer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cb\u003eCreating an App that Enhances Real-World Experiences\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a counterpoint to the previous section, consider a second type of checkpoint app. Perhaps one for a nature trail. This app might offer additional information about particular points of interest along a trail. It might also notify hikers when they enter a geofenced area, provide them with additional information, and call out particular nearby sights. It might even highlight places not yet visited along the current trail. Is this app guilty of the same sins as the amusement park app?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo answer this question, consider this: without the passport feature, the amusement park app would still have shown guests the locations and times for each coaster, but would have left it up to their own motivations whether or not to ride. The passbook in this case served solely to modify guest behavior for the perceived benefit of the park, but not the actual benefit of its guests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, the nature trail app is not trying to motivate visitors to alter their exploration unless they choose to. If the trail app alerts visitors of a waterfall half a mile to the East, they do not feel obliged to go that direction unless they have a desire to see that waterfall. It is hard to imagine such a visitor feeling frustrated or manipulated by the knowledge of the waterfall. Such a feature can only improve their experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cb\u003eAssist, Accompany, and Augment the Experiences\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is also helpful to explore the various roles that apps can play in enhancing real world experiences. The following fairly generic examples can be applied to many interactions or points of interest:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e\u003cb\u003ePreparation \u0026#8211;\u003c/b\u003e An app could let users view a list of potential attractions, allow them to indicate which they are interested in, and then provide them with a programmatically generated itinerary. Apps might also help with guests register and complete any required paperwork or payment prior to arriving at a location. These example features allow guests to maximize their time spent enjoying the space.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eOn Location \u0026#8211; \u003c/b\u003eReaders who grew up playing the N64 Zelda games might remember the character of\u003ca href=\"http://zelda.wikia.com/wiki/Navi\"\u003e Navi\u003c/a\u003e, who was a small fairy that followed the player around for the entire game. This fairy-guide would emerge occasionally when players had wandered into new areas or discovered new tools. She would provide additional context and tips for players only at these key points or when specifically asked for help. Apps can serve a similar role in pointing out and building upon key places within a space. They can do this without being overly interruptive or distracting.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eUpon Reflection \u0026#8211; \u003c/b\u003eSome visitors might want to recommend a particular path or attraction to their friends. An app that enables for quick recall and tracks previous interactions can help guests describe their adventures. It can also make more meaningful recommendations to their friends.

They are created by owners and product managers who \u003ca href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/05/08/top-14-iot-mobile-app-development-trends-to-expect-in-2019-and-beyond/\"\u003eobsess\u003c/a\u003e over extending as many user sessions as possible. Unfortunately, they don\u0026#8217;t place a high consideration on the impacts of their customers\u0026#8217; well-being. Meanwhile, many users are increasingly aware of how much time they are spending staring and tapping at their favorite apps. Apple has even made users more aware of just how much\u003ca href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2018/06/ios-12-introduces-new-features-to-reduce-interruptions-and-manage-screen-time/\"\u003e time they are spending on their phones\u003c/a\u003e with their iOS 12 update. In the face of these \u003ca href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/07/05/personalization-of-mobile-apps-and-ways-to-do-it/\"\u003eemerging trends\u003c/a\u003e, it seems like the perfect time to ask how mobile apps should focus on enhancing and supplementing existing real-world experiences, rather than replacing them. How is it possible that mobile apps can enhance real-world experiences?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cb\u003eStart with Good Intentions\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMobile apps can \u003ca href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/07/03/8-tech-trends-to-watch-out-for-in-2019/\"\u003estreamline and facilitate real-world experiences\u003c/a\u003e to the benefit of customers and businesses. For example, a theme park could create an app that enables guests to view ride line times and closures. Such an app would increase the number of rides each guest is able to enjoy in a visit, reduce the undesired time each visitor wastes in line, and drive guests to previously under-explored attractions. In turn, this will improve customer satisfaction. It could also possibly increase the number of guests the park can entertain on any given day. It’s a complete win-win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePay attention to how this example app is able to maximize the best parts (riding rides) and minimize the worst parts (standing in line) of existing experiences. This app solves a particular problem, while not necessarily playing a role in every aspect of the overall guest experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cb\u003eContinue by Going too Far\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter seeing the app\u0026#8217;s remarkable success, managers of this amusement park might want to see how they can further facilitate guest interactions. They know that more guests fit into the park when they are evenly distributed across the many available rides. As a result, app owners might seek to motivate guests to explore less popular attractions. Their product managers might come up with a “game” whereby guests have a passbook that gets stamped for each coaster ridden. In this game, guests are able to experience the thrill of going from ride to ride completing their collection of digital marks. They might even get achievements for experiencing entire sections of the park!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere, app creators are overstepping their bounds and unnaturally manipulating the way users interact with a place. In this example, the app has become the ends and not the means of this experience. This process removes any consideration for the end customer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cb\u003eCreating an App that Enhances Real-World Experiences\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a counterpoint to the previous section, consider a second type of checkpoint app. Perhaps one for a nature trail. This app might offer additional information about particular points of interest along a trail. It might also notify hikers when they enter a geofenced area, provide them with additional information, and call out particular nearby sights. It might even highlight places not yet visited along the current trail. Is this app guilty of the same sins as the amusement park app?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo answer this question, consider this: without the passport feature, the amusement park app would still have shown guests the locations and times for each coaster, but would have left it up to their own motivations whether or not to ride. The passbook in this case served solely to modify guest behavior for the perceived benefit of the park, but not the actual benefit of its guests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, the nature trail app is not trying to motivate visitors to alter their exploration unless they choose to. If the trail app alerts visitors of a waterfall half a mile to the East, they do not feel obliged to go that direction unless they have a desire to see that waterfall. It is hard to imagine such a visitor feeling frustrated or manipulated by the knowledge of the waterfall. Such a feature can only improve their experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cb\u003eAssist, Accompany, and Augment the Experiences\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is also helpful to explore the various roles that apps can play in enhancing real world experiences. The following fairly generic examples can be applied to many interactions or points of interest:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e\u003cb\u003ePreparation \u0026#8211;\u003c/b\u003e An app could let users view a list of potential attractions, allow them to indicate which they are interested in, and then provide them with a programmatically generated itinerary. Apps might also help with guests register and complete any required paperwork or payment prior to arriving at a location. These example features allow guests to maximize their time spent enjoying the space.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eOn Location \u0026#8211; \u003c/b\u003eReaders who grew up playing the N64 Zelda games might remember the character of\u003ca href=\"http://zelda.wikia.com/wiki/Navi\"\u003e Navi\u003c/a\u003e, who was a small fairy that followed the player around for the entire game. This fairy-guide would emerge occasionally when players had wandered into new areas or discovered new tools. She would provide additional context and tips for players only at these key points or when specifically asked for help. Apps can serve a similar role in pointing out and building upon key places within a space. They can do this without being overly interruptive or distracting.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eUpon Reflection \u0026#8211; \u003c/b\u003eSome visitors might want to recommend a particular path or attraction to their friends. An app that enables for quick recall and tracks previous interactions can help guests describe their adventures. It can also make more meaningful recommendations to their friends.

O FBI identificou 16 pessoas que tinham acessado um dos 27 documentos divulgados pelo site de notícias. Eles vasculharam os computadores de trabalho de todas essas 16 pessoas, incluindo o de Albury, e descobriram que seu computador também tinha acessado “mais de dois terços” dos documentos que vieram a público.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSegundo os autos, o FBI utilizou uma série de atividades identificadas no computador de Albury como evidências contra ele: quais foram os documentos que ele acessou e quando isso ocorreu, quando ele tirou print das telas, quando copiou e colou esses prints em documentos que não foram salvos, e quando os imprimiu. Por exemplo, no dia 10 de maio de 2016, entre as 12h34 e as 12h50, Albury buscou dois documentos confidenciais. Dezenove minutos depois, ele copiou dois prints de tela em um arquivo do Word que não foi salvo e, ao longo dos 45 minutos seguintes, adicionou outros 11 prints em um arquivo de Excel que também não foi salvo. Ao longo do dia, ele viu mais documentos secretos e continuou a fazer prints da tela, copiando as imagens para o arquivo no Excel.

(Isso não é verdade quando são utilizadas opções que não criptografam as mensagens, tais como Skype e Slack, serviços de mensagem direta no Twitter e no Facebook, ou mensagens normais de texto e chamadas telefônicas). Ainda assim, a criptografia não protege as mensagens quando o telefone é examinado fisicamente e o usuário não apagou seu histórico de mensagens. Isso ficou absolutamente claro em 7 de junho de 2018, quando o Departamento de Justiça acusou James Wolfe, ex assistente do Comitê de Inteligência do Senado, de fazer declarações falsas ao FBI.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConforme documentos judiciais, Wolfe disse aos agentes que investigavam o vazamento que não tinha entrado em contato com jornalistas. Mas a acusação cita o conteúdo de conversas que ele travou com jornalistas por meio do serviço Signal.

As evidências contra ele incluíam trechos de supostas mensagens que ele teria enviado para seus amigos, além de textos e conversas por email com um jornalista, que alguns veículos identificaram como sendo Jeremy Scahill, de The Intercept. O material descreve metadados relativos às chamadas telefônicas de Hale. Alega-se que ele foi a um evento numa livraria e sentou ao lado do jornalista.

E, assim como nos casos de Winner e Albury, o FBI sabia exatamente que documentos Hale teria mandado imprimir e quando.

Fontes distintas se deparam com riscos extremamente diferentes. Se você trabalha para uma companhia como Google, Facebook ou Goldman Sachs, você pode se ver sob intensa vigilância em relação a seus dispositivos de trabalho, enquanto seus equipamentos pessoais permanecem fora do alcance do seu empregador (desde que você não confie nos serviços que ele controla para se comunicar com jornalistas). E algumas fontes do governo podem dispor de caminhos que dão acesso a documentos secretos cuja divulgação é de interesse público, porém não geram um registro com horário carimbado, associado ao nome do usuário.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEstá cada vez mais claro que a primeira evidência a ser usada contra whistleblowers vem de eventos que aconteceram antes de eles entrarem em contato com a mídia, ou mesmo antes de eles tomarem a decisão de divulgar qualquer coisa. Mas ainda é crucial que os jornalistas estejam preparados para proteger suas fontes da melhor forma possível sempre que um whistleblower procurar por eles. Isso inclui usar sistemas como SecureDrop, que oferece às fontes caminhos seguros, livres de metadados, para entrar em contato com a mídia, e minimiza os rastros de contato entre os aparelhos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOs jornalistas também devem adotar medidas para reduzir, em sua comunicação com a fonte, a quantidade de informação que é acessível a empresas de tecnologia, usando sempre apps de mensagens criptografadas em vez de mensagens de texto inseguras e sempre apagando o conteúdo. Eles também devem encorajar suas fontes a não adicioná-los na lista de contato do telefone, já que isso pode ser sincronizado com servidores como Google ou Apple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eO processo jornalístico de verificação da autenticidade dos documentos também traz risco para as fontes anônimas, mas esse processo é fundamental para assegurar que o material não foi falsificado ou alterado, e para manter sua credibilidade junto aos leitores. O processo de autenticação, que frequentemente envolve compartilhar parte do conteúdo de uma futura matéria com o governo, é uma prática jornalística comum que dá ao governo a chance de ponderar os riscos envolvidos na publicação daquele material, riscos estes dos quais o jornalista pode não estar ciente. Ao transformar esse processo numa armadilha para jornalistas e fontes, o governo está prejudicando a oportunidade que tem de proteger seus interesses legítimos e contar seu lado da história.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs organizações jornalísticas também precisam tomar decisões difíceis acerca do que publicar. Às vezes, elas podem decidir que é mais seguro não divulgar documentos se a história puder ser contada só com a descrição do conteúdo, deixando em aberto de onde aquelas informações provêm. Entretanto, essas abordagens diminuem a transparência junto aos leitores e também podem limitar o impacto da história, o que é importante tanto para jornalistas como para whistleblowers. Em uma era em que o rótulo “fake news” é usado para tirar o crédito de jornalismo investigativo sério, documentos de fonte original servem como uma evidência poderosa para refutar essas acusações.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c!-- INLINE(dropcap)[15](%7B%7D)(%7B%22text%22%3A%22A%22%7D) --\u003e\u003cspan data-shortcode-type='dropcap' class='dropcap'\u003eA\u003c/span\u003e\u003c!-- END-INLINE(dropcap)[15] --\u003e\u003cu\u003epps de mensagens criptografadas\u003c/u\u003e trouxeram um grande avanço na segurança de conversas online, mas ainda apresentam grandes problemas quando se trata da proteção de fontes. Muitos, incluindo WhatsApp e Signal, incentivam os usuários a adicionar o número das pessoas com quem trocam mensagens, o que frequentemente é sincronizado com a nuvem, e WhatsApp encoraja os usuários a fazer o backup de seu histórico de mensagens. Embora o Facebook, que detém o WhatsApp, não tenha acesso ao conteúdo dessas mensagens cujo backup foi feito, o Google e a Apple têm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNão é suficiente que esses apps criptografem as mensagens. Eles também precisam ser mais ágeis para apagar dados que não sejam mais necessários. Criptografar as mensagens de ponta a ponta protege as mensagens enquanto elas vão de um telefone para outro, mas cada aparelho ainda tem uma cópia do texto de todas essas mensagens, deixando-os vulneráveis em caso de apreensões. Funcionalidades que apagam as mensagens são um ótimo ponto de partida, mas elas precisam ser aperfeiçoadas. Os usuários deveriam ter a opção de ver todas suas conversas automaticamente apagadas, sem precisar se lembrar de ajustar isso a cada vez que começam uma conversa, e eles deveriam se solicitados a ativar essa opção quando entram no app pela primeira vez. E quando todas as mensagens numa conversa desaparecem, todos os rastros de que uma conversa com aquela pessoa ocorreu deveriam desaparecer também.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHá ainda muito trabalho a ser feito em relação à proteção de metadados. A opção “\u003ca href=\"https://signal.org/blog/sealed-sender/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003esealed sender\u003c/a\u003e” do Signal, que criptografa boa parte dos metadados aos quais o serviço tem acesso, vai além do que qualquer outro dentre os app de mensagem mais populares oferece, mas ainda não é perfeito. Apps de mensagem precisam ajustar seus serviços de modo a não ter acesso aos metadados dos usuários, incluindo endereço de IP. Se os serviços não puderem acessar essas informações, então eles não poderão ser obrigados a entregá-las para o FBI durante a investigação em torno de um vazamento.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDe modo padrão, navegadores retêm um histórico detalhado de cada site que você já visitou. Eles precisam parar de fazer isso. Por que não reter apenas um mês do histórico como procedimento padrão, e permitir que os usuários mudem esse prazo se quiserem reter por mais tempo?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePor hora, Tor Browser é o melhor navegador no que diz respeito a proteger a privacidade do usuário. Não só ele nunca retém um histórico de nada do que acontece ali, como também encaminha todo o tráfego por meio de uma rede anônima, além de usar a tecnologia para combater uma técnica de rastreamento chamada “browser fingerprinting,” de modo que os sites que você visita não sabem nada sobre você. Infelizmente, o simples fato de ter o Tor ou outras ferramentas específicas para preservação da privacidade instaladas num computador tem sido usado como evidência contra supostos whistleblowers. Esse é um dos motivos pelos quais estou animado com o \u003ca href=\"https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3075448/firefox-tor-super-private-browsing-mode\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eplano do Mozilla\u003c/a\u003e de integrar o Tor diretamente ao Firefox como um modo de “navegação superprivada”. No futuro, em vez de ter de fazer o download do Tor, as fontes poderão simplesmente usar um dispositivo que integra o Firefox para obter o mesmo nível de proteção. Talvez Google Chrome, Apple Safari e Microsoft Edge devessem seguir Mozilla nesse caminho.

Algumas companhias fazem isso para certo tipo de dados  — a Apple não tem acesso às senhas armazenadas no seu iCloud Keychain, e Google não pode acessar seus perfis sincronizados de Chrome — mas isso está longe de ser o suficiente.

IT’S NOT URANUS!).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy 1 p.m., about 2,000 kids had made their way into Cathedral Square, at the city center, where they gathered around a makeshift stage and donated sound system to listen to speeches and music.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were students of all ages there, and an entire Maori school had walked out together. “I was so proud of the whole of Christchurch,” one of the organizers, 17-year-old Mia Sutherland, told me. “All of these people had been so brave.

After six minutes of carnage, he calmly left Al Noor, drove to another mosque, and continued his rampage. By the end, 50 people were dead, including a 3-year-old child.

One was the extent to which the killer planned and executed his massacre as a made-for-the-internet spectacle. Before beginning his rampage, he announced on the message board 8chan that “it’s time to stop shitposting and time to make a real life effort post,” as if a mass killing were merely a particularly shocking meme waiting to be shared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hypermediated nature of the Christchurch massacre, with the killer’s obvious bid to game-ify his “real life effort post,” made for an unbearable contrast with the searing reality of his horrific crime — of bullets tearing through flesh, of families stricken by grief, and of a global Muslim community sent a terrorizing message that its members were safe nowhere, not even in the sanctity of prayer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt also made for a wrenching contrast with the youth climate strikers who had gathered at the exact same time for such a different purpose. Where the killer gleefully toyed with the lines between fact, fiction, and conspiracy, as if the very idea of truth were #FakeNews, the strikers painstakingly insisted that hard realities like accumulated greenhouse gases and carbon footprints and spiraling extinctions really did matter, and demanded that politicians close the yawning gap between their words and their actions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I spoke to her six weeks after that terrible day, Mia Sutherland was still having trouble prying the strike and the massacre apart; they had somehow fused together in her memory. “In no one’s mind are they separate,” she told me, her voice just above a whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c!-- BLOCK(promote-related-post)[3](%7B%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22relatedPostNumber%22%3A1%7D) --\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"promote-embed\" data-related-post-number=\"1\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c!-- END-BLOCK(promote-related-post)[3] --\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen intense events happen in close proximity to one another, the human mind often tries to draw connections that are not there, a phenomenon known as apophenia.

And this relates to the other way that the Christchurch killer is distinct from the white supremacist mass murderers from whom he openly drew inspiration. Unlike them, he identifies explicitly as an “ethno-nationalist eco-fascist.” In his rambling manifesto, he framed his actions as a twisted kind of environmentalism, railing against population growth and asserting that “Continued immigration into Europe is environmental warfare.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo be clear, the killer was not driven by environmental concern — his motivation was unadulterated racist hate — but ecological breakdown was one of the forces that seemed to be stoking that hatred, much as we are seeing it act as an accelerant for hatred and violence in armed conflicts around the world. My fear is that, unless something significant changes in how our societies rise to the ecological crisis, we are going to see this kind of white power eco-fascism emerge with much greater frequency, as a ferocious rationalization for refusing to live up to our collective climate responsibilities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMuch of this is due to the hard calculus of global warming. This is a crisis overwhelmingly created by the wealthiest strata of society: Almost 50 percent of global emissions are produced by the richest 10 percent of the world’s population; the wealthiest 20 percent are responsible for 70 percent. But the impacts of those emissions are hurting the poorest first and worst, forcing growing numbers of people to move, with many more on the way. A 2018 World Bank study estimates that by 2050, more than 140 million people in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Latin America will be displaced because of climate stresses, an estimate many consider conservative. Most will stay in their own countries, crowding into already overstressed cities and slums; many will try for a better life elsewhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn any moral universe, guided by basic human rights principles, these victims of a crisis of other people’s making would be owed justice. That justice would and should take many forms. First and foremost, justice requires that the wealthiest 10-20 percent stop the underlying cause of this deepening crisis by lowering emissions as rapidly as technology allows (the premise of the Green New Deal). Justice also demands that we heed the call for a “Marshall Plan for the Earth” that Bolivia’s climate negotiator called for a decade ago: to roll out resources in the global south so communities can fortify themselves against extreme weather, pull themselves out of poverty with clean tech, and protect their ways of life wherever possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen protection is not possible — when the land is simply too parched to grow crops and when the seas are rising too fast to hold them back — then justice demands that we clearly recognize that all people have the human right to move and seek safety. That means they are owed asylum and status on arrival. In truth, amid so much loss and suffering, they are owed much more than that: They are owed kindness, compensation, and a heartfelt apology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn other words, climate disruption demands a reckoning on the terrain most repellent to conservative minds: wealth redistribution, resource sharing, and reparations. And a growing number of people on the hard right realize this all too well, which is why they are developing various twisted rationales for why none of this can take place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first phase is to scream “socialist conspiracy” and flat out deny reality. We’ve been in that phase for quite some time now. That was the tack taken by Anders Breivik, the sociopath who opened fire at the Norwegian summer camp in 2011. Breivik was convinced that in addition to immigration, one of the ways that white Western culture was being weakened was through calls for Europe and the Anglosphere to pay its “climate debt.” In a section of his manifesto titled “Green Is the New Red — Stop EnviroCommunism!,” in which he cites several prominent climate change deniers, he casts demands for climate financing as an attempt to “‘punish’ European countries (US included) for capitalism and success.” Climate action, he asserts, “is the new Redistribution of Wealth.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut if straight-up denial seemed a viable strategy then, nine years later (with six of those years among the 10 hottest ever recorded) it is less so today. That does not mean, however, that onetime deniers are suddenly going to embrace a response to the climate crisis based on agreed-upon international frameworks. It is far more likely that many who currently claim to deny climate change will simply switch abruptly to the sinister worldview espoused by the Christchurch killer, a recognition that we are indeed facing a convulsive future and that is all the more reason for wealthy, majority-white countries to fortress their borders, as well as their identities as white Christians, and wage war on any and all “invaders.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[4](%7B%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22left%22%7D) --\u003e\u003cblockquote class=\"stylized pull-left\" data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"left\"\u003e\u003c!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[4] --\u003eThe goal of this fortification around Europe and the Anglosphere is all too clear: Convince people to stay where they are, no matter how miserable it is, no matter how deadly. \u003c!-- END-CONTENT(pullquote)[4] --\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c!-- END-BLOCK(pullquote)[4] --\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe climate science will no longer be denied; what \u003cem\u003ewill\u003c/em\u003e be denied is the idea that the nations that are the largest historical emitters of carbon owe anything to the black and brown people impacted by that pollution. This will be denied based on the only rationale possible: that those non-white and non-Christian people are lesser than, are the other, are dangerous invaders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn much of Europe and the Anglosphere, this hardening is already well under way. The European Union, Australia, and the United States have all embraced immigration policies that are variations on “prevention through deterrence.” The brutal logic is to treat migrants with so much callousness and cruelty that desperate people will be deterred from seeking safety by crossing borders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith this in mind, migrants are left to drown in the Mediterranean, or to die of dehydration in the rugged Arizona desert. And if they survive, they are put in conditions tantamount to torture: in the Libyan camps where European countries now send the migrants who try to reach their shores; in Australia’s offshore island detention camps; in a cavernous Walmart turned child jail in Texas. In Italy, if migrants do make it to a port, they are now regularly prevented from disembarking, held captive in rescue boats under conditions a court has ruled to be tantamount to kidnapping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCanada’s prime minister, meanwhile, tweets pictures of himself welcoming refugees and visiting mosques — even as his government makes massive new investments in militarizing the border and tightening the noose of the Safe Third Country Agreement, which bars asylum-seekers from requesting protection at official Canadian border crossings if they are coming from the supposedly “safe” country of Trump’s United States.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe goal of this fortification around Europe and the Anglosphere is all too clear: Convince people to stay where they are, no matter how miserable it is, no matter how deadly. In this worldview, the emergency is not people’s suffering; it is their inconvenient desire to escape that suffering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat is why, just hours after the Christchurch massacre, Trump could shrug off the surge of far-right violence and immediately change the subject to the “invasion” of migrants at the United States’s southern border and his recent declaration of a “national emergency,” a move meant to free up billions for a border wall. Three weeks later, Trump tweeted, “Our Country is FULL!” This followed Italy’s interior minister, Matteo Salvini, responding to the arrival of a small group of migrants rescued at sea by tweeting, “Our ports were and remain CLOSED.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMurtaza Hussain, an investigative reporter who \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/03/18/new-zealand-mosque-shooter-manifesto/\"\u003estudied the Christchurch killer’s manifesto closely\u003c/a\u003e, stresses that it is filled with ideas that are anything but marginal. His words, Hussain writes, are “both lucid and chillingly familiar. His references to immigrants as invaders find echoes in the language used by the president of the United States and far-right leaders across Europe. For those wondering where [he] was radicalized, the answer is right out in the open.

When impoverished and debt-ridden Mozambique was pummeled by Cyclone Idai, the International Monetary Fund offered the country $118 million, a loan (not a grant) it would somehow have to pay back; the Jubilee Debt Campaign described the move as “a shocking indictment of the international community.” Worse, in March 2019, Trump announced that he intended to cut $700 million in current aid to Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, some of which was earmarked for programs that help farmers cope with drought. In an equally explicit expression of its priorities, in June 2018, at the start of hurricane season, the Department of Homeland Security diverted $10 million from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which is tasked with responding to natural disasters at home, and moved it over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, to pay for migrant detention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[6](%7B%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22right%22%7D) --\u003e\u003cblockquote class=\"stylized pull-right\" data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"right\"\u003e\u003c!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[6] --\u003eWill we share what’s left and try to look after one another?

And what starts as brutality at the border will most certainly infect societies as a whole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese supremacist ideas are not new; nor have they ever gone away. For those of us in North America, they are deeply embedded in the legal basis for our nations’ very existence (from the Doctrine of Christian Discovery to terra nullius). Their power has ebbed and flowed throughout our histories, depending on what immoral behaviors demanded ideological justification. And just as these toxic ideas surged when they were required to rationalize slavery, land theft, and segregation, they are surging once more now that they are needed to justify climate recalcitrance and the barbarism at our borders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rapidly escalating cruelty of our present moment cannot be overstated; nor can the long-term damage to the collective psyche should this go unchallenged. Beneath the theater of some governments denying climate change and others claiming to be doing something about it while they fortress their borders from its effects, there is one overarching question facing us. In the rough and rocky future that has already begun, what kind of people are we going to be? Will we share what’s left and try to look after one another? Or are we instead going to attempt to hoard what’s left, look after “our own,” and lock everyone else out?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this time of rising seas and rising fascism, these are the stark choices before us. There are options besides full-blown climate barbarism, but given how far down that road we are, there is no point pretending that they are easy.

as a gay man, do not want their names revealed. It is too shameful, one says. Another says he is anguished because his family knows he often used to socialize with Nabonibo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe singer shocked many Rwandans in August when he revealed in an interview with a Christian YouTube channel that he is gay, in a country where such a public assertion of homosexuality is unheard of. Although the central African nation has been relatively free of the anti-gay rhetoric commonly heard in some other parts of sub-Saharan Africa, homosexuality is still widely despised, and LGBT people keep a low profile.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNabonibo told The Associated Press that he came out in order to live normally. Yet the reaction he has received, from family and friends to strangers, has been mostly \u0026#8220;horrible,\u0026#8221; underscoring the intolerance faced by LGBT people in many parts of Africa. \u0026#8220;But there is no going back, because I have to live my real life,\u0026#8221; Nabonibo said in an interview in the capital, Kigali. \u0026#8220;It\u0026#8217;s so sad to see people you know abusing you.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNabonibo, who is 35 and also a qualified accountant, said he had become an outcast at his workplace as friends isolate him. He is worried he could lose his job. Even at home, news of his homosexuality shocked many relatives, although some have been acting tolerant, he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough Rwanda\u0026#8217;s penal code does not explicitly proscribe gay sex, same-sex marriage is banned. This means that many homosexuals are forced to live underground lifestyles in order to avoid the harsh judgment of society. Nabonibo said he was compelled to come out because he could no longer \u0026#8220;live in denial.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;There is a long list of them (gays) in your midst and they include pastors or churchgoers,\u0026#8221; he said. \u0026#8220;This pretense encouraged me to speak out.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWilliam Ntwali, a Rwandan human rights activist, said society in the country still stigmatizes gay people even when they are safe under the law. \u0026#8220;If you are gay, members of your community ostracize you,\u0026#8221; he said. \u0026#8220;People think you are not normal, and they look at it as an abomination.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of Nabonibo\u0026#8217;s best friends who spoke to the AP said they were too embarrassed even to talk about him. They requested anonymity for their own privacy. \u0026#8220;This is crazy. I don\u0026#8217;t understand why he thinks this is normal,\u0026#8221; said one friend, shaking his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother friend, a man who attends the same church as Nabonibo, said he was in a state of \u0026#8220;agony\u0026#8221; since the rest of his family knows he used to hang out with Nabonibo. Now he has blocked Nabonibo from all phone contact, saying he wants to \u0026#8220;keep safe.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere has been a similar reaction on social media, with many Rwandans questioning Nabonibo\u0026#8217;s intentions and others condemning him. One wondered on Twitter: \u0026#8220;How can a gospel singer be gay?\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA senior government official, however, expressed support for Nabonibo, saying he is protected under the law and urging the singer to continue his worship ministry. \u0026#8220;All Rwandans are born and remain equal in rights and freedoms,\u0026#8221; Olivier Nduhungirehe, Rwanda\u0026#8217;s state minister for foreign affairs, said on Twitter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Human Rights Watch, 32 African nations have varying laws criminalizing homosexuality. In many cases most of the anti-gay laws are left over from the colonial era, one reason gay rights activists have fought vigorously to have the laws jettisoned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn June, the gay rights movement in Africa scored a victory when a court in Botswana, upholding the rights of LGBT people, overturned laws criminalizing consensual same-sex relations. But there have been some setbacks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2017, Chad enacted legislation criminalizing same-sex relations for the first time in the country\u0026#8217;s history. In May, a court in Kenya ruled against overturning a colonial-era law criminalizing homosexual acts between consenting adults. Activists there who had challenged the law in court said they faced discrimination and threats to their dignity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd in neighboring Uganda, a government minister in charge of ethics is threatening to introduce another version of an anti-gay law passed in 2014, and subsequently voided by the country\u0026#8217;s constitutional court, that provided for jail terms of up to life for those convicted of engaging in gay sex. The original version of that bill, first introduced in 2009, had included the death penalty for what it called aggravated acts of homosexuality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Rwanda, the way ahead can be challenging, Nabonibo said. Some neighborhoods in Kigali are filled with gossip about how a certain gay man might spoil other citizens, he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;Criticism and sadness.

Police quoted the owner as saying the North Korea-themed decorations were intended to attract attention and make the restaurant more profitable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePolice said they are looking at the possibility that the owner violated South Korea\u0026#8217;s security law, under which praising North Korea can be punished by up to seven years in prison.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFull enforcement of the National Security Law has been rare in recent years as relations with North Korea have improved greatly since the Cold War era.

President Donald Trump, seeking re-election next year, will be happy to oblige.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIsrael\u0026rsquo;s relations and effective alliance with the U.S. are the central tenet of its national security, a diplomatic shield and a military force multiplier. These relations are an invaluable and irreplaceable asset that Israel cherishes deeply. A formal \u0026ldquo;defense pact\u0026rdquo;, however, would be an entirely different story \u0026mdash; and the reasons for and against it bear some thinking about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the past, Israel refrained from raising the issue of a formal treaty, since the U.S. demanded two prerequisites that Israel could not deliver: Permanent and recognized borders, and signing the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Additionally, a defense pact would require approval by the U.S. Senate. This is not necessarily a process Israel wants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose in Israel who supported such a pact argued it would amplify Israel\u0026rsquo;s deterrence, that it would formalize the existing defense relationship and elevate Israel\u0026#8217;s stature in U.S. foreign policy, and that it would enhance regional stability. A\u003cspan style=\"font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\"\u003e U.S.-Israel defense treaty, the thinking went, would also conceivably serve as a component of a regional security system, under U.S. auspices, in a foreseeable future.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese arguments are undoubtedly not without merit and substance. But in 2019 they are flawed in one major way: They were predicated on a different Middle East, in a totally different regional and global reality. In its 72nd year of independence Israel is under no existential threat and enjoys an unrivaled military advantage and technological superiority. The military threats Israel does face are from non-state actors, not amenable to conventional deterrence. U.S. support of Israel, both diplomatically and militarily, is already factored into their behavior and calculus. In short, a treaty would not deter anyone or anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe arguments against a defense pact, shared by a majority in the Israeli defense and diplomatic establishment, were more compelling in our view.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe main argument against a pact was that it would not be realistically practicable, at a time when some form of a \u0026#8220;peace process\u0026#8221; still existed: that in exchange for a pact, Israel would be asked to make major concessions and take such security risks that a pact would not adequately address.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA full defense pact would also run contrary to Israel\u0026rsquo;s idea of self-reliance, the principle that Israel would never ask another to physically defend it. Material support, state-of-the-art-military systems, yes. Soldiers, no. Never. Conversely, the public in Israel would not endure casualties of IDF soldiers in a distant U.S. war mission, say, in Afghanistan, South America or Saudi Arabia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuch a pact would invariably require coordination, cooperation, pre-approval and U.S. effective veto power over Israeli military actions. Let\u0026#8217;s say there was a U.S.-Israel defense pact in place on June 5, 1967 or June 7, 1981 or Sept. 6, 2007. Israel could not have carried out the preemptive strike against Egypt (the Six-day War), the destruction of the Iraqi nuclear reactor in Osiraq, or the demolition of the nascent Syrian nuclear reactor in Al Kibar, respectively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe most compelling argument, finally, was that a pact, notwithstanding the legal requirements and complications in the U.S. regarding pacts and treaties, would do little more than formalize what already exists. And that would poke adversaries in the eye, after Israel has gone out of its way to impose operational limitations upon itself to avoid infringing on U.S. interests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday, there is a yet more pressing argument against such a pact \u0026mdash; that it would significantly narrow and constrict Israel\u0026rsquo;s maneuvering room and operational flexibility, at a time when the U.S. is disengaging from the Middle East, when Iran and Russia are entrenched in Syria, and when Iran\u0026#8217;s Hezbollah proxy is present in Lebanon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet these arguments are redundant, when all is said and done. Because there is no \u0026ldquo;Defense Pact\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Mutual Defense Treaty.\u0026#8221; What lies behind the tweets, the headlines and the frantic Washington-Jerusalem consultations is a political gimmick, designed to attain meaningless public relations points ahead of a difficult election. A defense treaty concocted by Prime Minister Netanyahu for political benefits and possibly entertained by President Trump or his staff is not a treaty. It\u0026rsquo;s nothing more than a hollow stunt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/time/world/~4/mQx5mOexkMo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/world/~3/mQx5mOexkMo/","published":"2019-09-16T16:25:15Z","guid":"http://time.com/?p=5678222"},{"title":"‘Locked and Loaded,’ the U.S. Blames Iran for a Drone Attack Against Saudi Arabia.

What is unfolding is a Shakespearean tragedy in five acts. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAct 1: \u003c/strong\u003eThe United Kingdom creates a fantastically dynamic, business-friendly economy based on rule of law, respect for basic rights and property, and proximity to China. Chinese migrants from Guangdong province and Shanghai build it from empty rocks into one of the world’s most dynamic and prosperous cities. But the British prevent any political development or democracy to take hold, and allow the city’s \u003cem\u003etaipans\u003c/em\u003e (tycoons), along with the governor, to run the colony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAct 2:\u003c/strong\u003e The People’s Republic of China takes over in 1997, and decides they are comfortable with the way the British ran the place for the previous 50 years. But, they don’t like what the last governor, Chris Patten, tried to do by introducing democratic reforms. The Chinese preserve the structure of the city, run by a chief executive with the help of the \u003cem\u003etaipans\u003c/em\u003e, and constrain indigenous political development while maintaining the fundamental elements of Hong Kong’s autonomy. They accept the British notion that Hong Kong’s people care about economics, not politics, and they like it that way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAct 3:\u003c/strong\u003e As China becomes richer, Chinese officials, businessman, and tourists begin to penetrate and influence Hong Kong in ways large and small. Non-\u003cem\u003etaipan\u003c/em\u003e Hong Kongers start to get uncomfortable with the realization that their high degree of autonomy doesn’t keep mainlanders — and mainland habits — out. The cozy relationships the \u003cem\u003etaipans\u003c/em\u003e enjoyed with the British government are transferred to a Chinese government less shy about corruption and nepotism. The Communist Party begins to move slowly toward absorbing Hong Kong in 2047 by taking incremental steps that evade or infringe on Hong Kong law.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAct 4:\u003c/strong\u003e Ordinary Hong Kong residents, especially young people, feel trapped in an economy where housing is too expensive, jobs are fewer and of lower quality, and future prospects are dim. The freezing of the political system in 1997 ensures there is no popular confidence that concerns and grievances will be addressed by an effective or responsible Hong Kong government, seen widely as a proxy for Beijing. Mass protests of staggering dimensions ensue, ostensibly over a proposed extradition law that would allow Chinese courts jurisdiction over violators of People’s Republic of China (PRC) law but more deeply over generalized unease over Beijing’s creeping domination of Hong Kong. The Hong Kong government lacks the capacity, will, or trust to respond effectively to the demonstrations. Beijing moves from passive brooding to threats and targeted measures against companies seen as helping the protesters and aimed at punishing, on their own or through the Hong Kong government, the more radical and violent protesters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAct 5:\u003c/strong\u003e Richard Bush has outlined the kinds of compromises sensible people should undertake in Act Five. But remember, Shakespearean tragedies do not end well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat should the United States do as this great world city implodes before our eyes? The U.S. objective should be to urge Beijing, the Hong Kong government, and Hong Kong people to accept that a properly implemented “one country, two systems” approach — under which Hong Kong operates with a high degree of autonomy — will provide the best outcome for Hong Kong. This means, among other things, that the jurisdiction of Hong Kong — not PRC — law, Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong, an independent judiciary, a separate currency, vigorous protection of civil rights, and independent immigration and customs control. It means adopting a competitive system for electing a chief executive by universal suffrage after the kind of vetting process for candidates that Richard Bush described, and a short timetable for direct election of all members of the Legislative Council. It also means that Hong Kongers accept that Hong Kong is part of the People’s Republic of China and they do not seek a different status.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the short run, it means chief executive Carrie Lam should resign. A commission should be convened to hear from representatives of the protesters, the business community (rich and less so), professionals, and others on the way forward in terms of political governance, economic, and social issues. To help restore public confidence in a badly overstretched police force, a few outsiders could be added to the internal police commission to review the performance of the police over the last several months. There should not be amnesty for protesters who committed violent acts, but the targets of prosecution should be kept to a bare minimum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe U.S. government should publicly voice support for the “one country, two systems” model, for the high degree of autonomy promised to Hong Kong, and for Hong Kong’s democratic development within the PRC. When leaders of the protesters visit the United States or U.S. officials meet with them in Hong Kong, we should make crystal clear that the U.S. supports the right of peaceful protest, opposes violence, and believes the protesters need to find an exit ramp that allows their just demands a chance of being implemented. If they go too far and provoke a violent response by Beijing, there will be lots of sympathy for them in the United States but no action that effectively shields them from Beijing or advances their cause. To lead protesters to believe otherwise would be an error increasing the chances of a tragic outcome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe need to speak frankly with Hong Kong’s political democratic parties, conveying that they need to show leadership in finding a realistic solution instead of making the perfect the enemy of the good. We should tell Hong Kong’s business elite that they cannot live like Louis XIV’s court while young people no longer enjoy economic benefits in their system, and that the erosion of Hong Kong’s special and separate status will ultimately hurt their ability to do business in the West. We should tell Beijing that it should encourage the Hong Kong government and people to work this out themselves, and that a heavy-handed Beijing intervention will profoundly affect the West’s relations with China and do untold damage to the Hong Kong that so benefits China and the international community.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe U.S. Congress should reinforce these messages. It should avoid the temptation to posture in ways that oversimplify Hong Kong’s complexities, feed the Communist Party’s incorrect perception that the United States is the “black hand” behind the unrest, or encourage heightening a crisis where Hong Kongers, not Americans, stand to pay the price in case of escalation.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2019/09/16/the-story-of-hong-kong-is-a-shakespearean-tragedy/","published":"2019-09-16T18:08:21Z","guid":"https://www.brookings.edu/?p=612083"},{"title":"Political outsiders sweep Tunisia’s presidential elections","content":"\u003cp\u003eBy Sharan Grewal\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTunisians headed to the polls on Sunday in their second free and fair presidential election. The election was exceptionally competitive, with no candidate in a crowded field of 26 garnering more than 20% of the vote. Official results will be released on Tuesday, but exit polls by both Sigma Conseil and Emrhod Consulting point to a shocking victory for two political outsiders: Kaïs Saïed and Nabil Karoui. The two will likely face off in a still-to-be-scheduled second round.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe (still unofficial) victory of Saïed and Karoui, both relative newcomers, handed a sharp rebuke to the ruling coalition, represented by Prime Minister Youssef Chahed, Defense Minister Abdelkrim Zbidi, and parliamentary speaker Abdelfattah Mourou. But the electoral defeat of the political establishment was a long time coming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAn anti-system vote\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I \u003ca href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/research/tunisian-democracy-at-a-crossroads/\"\u003eargued\u003c/a\u003e in February, the conditions in Tunisia were ripe for the emergence of populist outsiders. Eight years into the Arab Spring, Tunisia’s successive governments had failed to deliver on the primary demand of the revolution: economic opportunity. By almost every metric, the economic situation was even worse than that which led to the 2011 revolution. Unemployment, roughly 12-13% pre-revolution, had jumped to 18% in 2011 and remains at 15% today. Inflation, 3-4% pre-revolution, has doubled to 7%. The rate of economic growth, around 5% pre-revolution, \u003ca href=\"https://tradingeconomics.com/tunisia/gdp-growth-annual\"\u003estruggles\u003c/a\u003e to reach 2% today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese difficult economic conditions have contributed to frustration with not just the ruling parties but the entire political system. The 2014 constitution established a semi-presidential system where executive power is shared between the president and the head of government, a divided system that has produced five years of slow governance and compromise solutions. Meanwhile, perceptions of corruption have \u003ca href=\"https://carnegieendowment.org/2017/10/25/tunisia-s-corruption-contagion-transition-at-risk-pub-73522\"\u003erisen\u003c/a\u003e, and support for democracy has \u003ca href=\"http://afrobarometer.org/sites/default/files/publications/Dispatches/ab_r7_dispatchno232_support_for_democracy_dwindles_in_tunisia_1.pdf\"\u003edeclined\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVarieties of populism\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth Kaïs Saïed and Nabil Karoui were able to capitalize on this frustration, though in very different ways. By April 2019, both were leading in the pre-election polls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaïs Saïed, 61, appeals to disillusioned youth by promising a new system: one in which power will be more \u003ca href=\"https://fr.theepochtimes.com/kais-saied-invite-surprise-de-la-course-presidentielle-en-tunisie-1027161.html\"\u003edecentralized\u003c/a\u003e, “so that the will of the people reaches the central power and puts an end to corruption.” Saïed, a constitutional law professor at the University of Tunis, is proposing sweeping constitutional reforms, including empowering Tunisians to \u003ca href=\"https://pomed.org/2019-tunisia-presidential-election-guide/\"\u003erecall\u003c/a\u003e their parliamentarians. \u003ca href=\"https://annaharnews.tn/2019/06/13/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%84-%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%B0-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%88%D8%B1/\"\u003eClaiming\u003c/a\u003e that the “era of parliamentary democracy is over,” he has also proposed \u003ca href=\"https://www.mosaiquefm.net/fr/actualite-politique-tunisie/559201/kais-said-pour-la-suppression-des-legislatives\"\u003eabolishing\u003c/a\u003e parliamentary elections in favor of a “bottom-up” approach where parliamentarians will be chosen from elected local councils.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough these structural reforms, Saïed hopes to bring power back to the people. Saïed taps into popular frustration that the 2010-11 revolution was “hijacked” by corrupt political parties. In that sense, he is a “populist,” railing against the political elite in favor of the people. And he has the credibility to make such a claim: He has never held political office, has no political party, and had \u003ca href=\"https://www.jeuneafrique.com/mag/762621/politique/presidentielle-en-tunisie-dix-choses-a-savoir-sur-kais-saied-deuxieme-dans-les-sondages/\"\u003enever\u003c/a\u003e even voted before Sunday.

An intellectual, Saïed first caught the public eye during the drafting of the 2014 constitution, when he repeatedly appeared on state TV explaining complex legal debates in a monotone, classical Arabic — a robotic delivery that earned him the nickname “Robocop.” His \u003ca href=\"https://www.lepoint.fr/afrique/tunisie-kais-saied-un-robespierre-en-campagne-11-09-2019-2335234_3826.php#xtor=CS2-239\"\u003eascetic\u003c/a\u003e personality — taking public transportation, \u003ca href=\"https://pomed.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Tunisia-2019-Presidential-Election-Guide.pdf#page=17\"\u003epledging\u003c/a\u003e to continue living at home instead of the presidential palace — also evokes an image of an honest man, one that will not be corrupted by power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNabil Karoui, by contrast, who came in second in Sunday’s vote, taps into a related yet distinct strain of populism. Karoui, 55, is a media mogul who co-founded Nessma TV alongside Silvio Berlusconi. Despite his wealth, Karoui pitches himself as a champion of the poor and “forgotten” Tunisians, a reputation he has cultivated by hosting a charity show, Khalil Tounes, since 2017 (he \u003ca href=\"https://www.mosaiquefm.net/fr/communiques-de-presse-tunisie/559041/mouna-noureddine-presentera-khalil-tounes\"\u003estopped\u003c/a\u003e hosting it in June in accordance with electoral regulations). Karoui promised a “revolution at the ballot box” in favor of the “other Tunisia” — the millions neglected by the establishment. In \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/MedDhiaH/status/1173494287130124288\"\u003econtrast\u003c/a\u003e to Saïed’s decentralized state, Karoui implicitly promises a strong state that can restore economic growth and deliver goods and services to the people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile a newcomer in running for office, Karoui is no political novice. His TV station, Nessma TV, took a very political tone in criticizing the Islamist party Ennahda during the 2011-13 troika government. Karoui then co-founded the Nidaa Tounes party alongside the late president Beji Caid Essebsi, and allegedly used his TV channel to aid Essebi’s candidacy in the 2014 elections. While he therefore has political experience, he is still able to present an image of a political outsider having never held political office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Karoui began to rise in the polls, the establishment parties seemed to band together to weaken his candidacy. In June, the parliament approved amendments to the electoral law that would have barred Karoui from running, but these were never signed by the late president Essebsi. Karoui has since been arrested and imprisoned on charges of tax evasion and money laundering, preventing him from campaigning or appearing in the country’s first televised presidential debates. While the charges against him may be valid—  they were \u003ca href=\"https://www.iwatch.tn/ar/article/60\"\u003efiled\u003c/a\u003e back in 2016 by the Transparency International-linked group I-Watch—  the timing of his arrest has politicized the charges, and allowed the Karoui campaign to capitalize on them. Describing Karoui as Tunisia’s first political prisoner since the revolution and likening him to Nelson Mandela, the Karoui campaign used his imprisonment to garner sympathy and feed into a broader narrative of Karoui being an outsider victimized by the establishment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"right-pullquote\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eSaïed and Karoui represent two almost diametrically opposed forms of populism.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn short, Saïed and Karoui represent two almost diametrically opposed forms of populism. Saïed’s intellectual nature and “power to the people” agenda appeals to a younger, more educated crowd, especially disillusioned revolutionaries.

The establishment had been considerably divided heading into the polls, creating an opportunity for outsiders to claim both spots in the run-off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo fewer than six candidates campaigned for what we can term the “secular establishment” — the progressive, modernist camp originally affiliated with the late president Essebsi’s Nidaa Tounes party. These candidates included Prime Minister Youssef Chahed, Defense Minister Abdelkrim Zbidi, former presidential chief of staff Salma Elloumi Rekik, and former prime minister Mehdi Jomaa. The endorsement of Zbidi by Mohsen Marzouk and Slim Riahi was a start, but nowhere near enough to unite this camp. As Chahed himself as \u003ca href=\"https://www.mosaiquefm.net/fr/presidentielles/606844/chahed-la-dispersion-a-donne-ce-resultat\"\u003enoted\u003c/a\u003e, these parties will need to join forces if they hope to perform well in the October 6 parliamentary elections.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps the largest surprise in this election was the poor performance of Ennahda, the Islamist party that has played a role in every elected government since the 2011 revolution. Observers regularly speculated that Ennahda’s electoral machine could routinely churn out 20-30% of the electorate, yet Ennahda’s candidate Abdelfattah Mourou won only 11% on Sunday. If their poor performance is repeated in the parliamentary elections, and if their leadership decides that its many compromises on the role of religion and on the goals of the revolution are to blame, this defeat could have major implications for how the party positions itself moving forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe road ahead\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe run-off election between Kais Saied and Nabil Karoui will be \u003ca href=\"https://www.mosaiquefm.net/fr/presidentielles/607054/presidentielle-les-3-alternatives-pour-le-delai-du-2eme-tour\"\u003escheduled\u003c/a\u003e for either September 29, October 6, or October 13, depending on the number of appeals from the first round. But the road ahead is uncertain: Karoui remains in prison, and if he is found guilty before the second round (unlikely, but possible), he would be replaced by the third-place candidate, Ennahda’s Abdelfattah Mourou. If not, Karoui could gain immunity if he were to win the presidential election.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the run-off features Saïed and Karoui, a critical predictor of how each will perform will be who the losing parties endorse. Saïed, socially conservative and relatively pro-revolution, may appeal to Ennahda voters, while Karoui, anti-Islamist and ex-Nidaa Tounes, may appeal to the secular establishment. With neither Saïed nor Karoui gaining more than 20% of the vote in the first round, gaining the support of other parties and candidates will be crucial for getting to 50%.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least under the current constitution, the October 6 parliamentary elections are ultimately more important than the presidential ones, as the prime minister — the stronger of the two executives — derives his or her power from the parliament. That campaign has already begun, but notably Kais Saïed will be absent. Without a party, he will have no direct representation in the parliament. Karoui’s newly-formed party, Qalb Tounes (Heart of Tunisia), by contrast, had been leading the pre-election polls for parliament.

And the signals from the natural world are more and more dire, both the rising crescendo of extreme events – killing heat waves, massive storms, rising seas, brutal wildfires, droughts, floods – and the steady march of new studies, such as last year’s U.N. report “Global Warming of 1.5°C” or its report last month on “Climate Change and Land,” warning of serious risks to the world’s food supply. Its upcoming report on climate change and oceans is sure to deliver more deeply troubling news.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgainst this backdrop, the climate community is looking for results in the 16-month sequence from the Secretary General’s Climate Summit this month to COP 25 in Chile this December and COP 26 next year in the U.K. Unless countries around the world significantly ramp up their NDCs, many observers are likely to conclude that the Paris Agreement is failing to live up to its promise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"pullquote\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe concern of the international climate community is now focused principally on the challenge of rapidly increasing the ambition of country efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet me make a few comments both on how we should and should not understand the role of the Paris regime and on the essential ingredient for spurring the ambitious action we need to meet the climate threat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Paris regime has a crucial role to play in helping to drive the action needed to contain climate change. The act of reaching agreement itself, in December 2015, sent a powerful signal to governments, boardrooms, and civil society that leaders had finally made a pivotal decision to tackle climate change for real. The Paris Agreement articulated essential temperature goals, established a structure for escalating commitments to cut emissions, put in place a robust transparency system, and provided for five-year review cycles so we can track individual and aggregate progress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoreover, if the regime can evolve in a constructive manner, toward a spirit marked by common endeavor rather than rancor and division, it can become what it was intended to be – the heart of the global climate effort, where countries regularly come together, hold each other to account, take stock of the dangers we face, work with each other in large groups and small, and collaborate with civil society and the private sector. Historically, climate negotiators have reflexively sought to prove to their counterparts in the arena how much their country \u003cem\u003edoesn’t\u003c/em\u003e or \u003cem\u003eshouldn’t\u003c/em\u003e have to do. Old habits die hard, but one of the challenges of the Paris regime will be for countries on all sides to move beyond this counter-productive mindset.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut for all that, the Paris regime cannot “solve” climate change. It is a robust, well-constructed mechanism through which motivated countries can do what is needed. It can certainly help inspire and encourage that motivation, but it cannot supply it. The ongoing success of Paris depends on the power of rising norms and expectations among leaders and citizens everywhere regarding the imperative of full-throttle climate action. If we are falling seriously short on ambition – and we are – the problem isn’t fundamentally a defect in the Paris architecture, it is a shortcoming of national commitment around the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"right-pullquote\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Paris regime cannot “solve” climate change.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that shortcoming is the heart of the matter. That’s what needs to be overcome. Of course, the technology challenges of decarbonizing the global economy are real, especially given the immense, embedded nature of the fossil fuel incumbency as well as our global forestry and land-use practices. But there is no question that, from the viewpoint of innovation, policy, and financing, we can do what is needed to rapidly transform our energy and our land-use system. We have an extraordinary innovation culture in the world today, nowhere more so than in the United States; we know what policies and incentives to put in place; and we can more than afford the required investment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut all of these elements depend crucially upon human will, resolve, and motivation. And not nearly enough of our political and societal leaders or our citizens have that motivation – yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn one extreme we have President Trump, seeking to reverse every strong domestic measure President Obama took on climate change, committed to \u003ca href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/leaving-the-paris-agreement-is-a-bad-deal-for-the-united-states/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003ewithdrawing from the Paris Agreement\u003c/a\u003e, and ridiculing even the premise that climate change is a global concern, much less an existential threat. Or we have President Bolsonaro in Brazil, who, in his belligerent carelessness, seems bent on allowing the Amazon to be put to the torch and chain saw – a global ecological calamity that must be stopped. They are two latter day Neros, fiddling while the Earth burns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut even if we turn to the much larger group of political leaders who recognize that climate change is real and important, very few among them grasp the speed and scale of the action needed. And we see a similar lack of genuine understanding in business, among economists, in the national security community, among people of good will and intentions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat we need to do is reverse the mindset of leaders and policymakers regarding climate change. What they do now, in effect, is ask: “What can we do on climate change given the political, social, and economic challenges we confront?” But that question is backwards. What they need to ask is: “How can we maximize good political, social, and economic outcomes given what we \u003cem\u003emust \u003c/em\u003edo to confront climate change?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChange in attitudes and expectations is starting to happen. Look at the current Democratic presidential primary in the United States, where climate change has become a top concern of voters in a way that wasn’t remotely the case even in 2016. Look at the worldwide student strikes inspired by the Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg. Look at the examples of exceptional leadership at the state level in the United States in places like California and New York, among others. And U.N. Secretary General Guterres is using his office and authority to make clear what leaders around the world need to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut more has to happen. We need to hasten the coming of that tipping point when business-as-usual politicians and corporate leaders understand they will fail, lose office, lose their standing, or be left behind unless they meet the climate challenge head on. These kinds of things can happen. These kinds of things have happened. In a recent \u003cem\u003eNew Yorker\u003c/em\u003e interview with Elizabeth Kolbert and Bill McKibben, McKibben recalled that on the original Earth Day, April 22, 1970, 20 million people took to the streets to demand change. In the aftermath of that mobilization and all that led to it came, in short order, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The future is in our hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/planetpolicy/2019/09/16/the-fight-to-contain-climate-change-implementing-paris-mobilizing-action/","published":"2019-09-16T13:00:50Z","guid":"https://www.brookings.edu/?p=611490"}]},{"url":"https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/world/rss","items":[]},{"url":"https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/world/feed","items":[{"title":"Porn Company up in Arms Over NZ Government's Proposed Porn Bans Designed to Protect Kids","content":"","url":"http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/world/2019/september/porn-company-up-in-arms-over-nz-governments-proposed-porn-bans","published":"2019-09-16T15:26:37Z","guid":"http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/world/2019/september/porn-company-up-in-arms-over-nz-governments-proposed-porn-bans"}]},{"url":"https://www.pri.org/stories/feed/everything","items":[{"title":"Uptick in church burnings raises alarm in Ethiopia","content":"","url":"https://www.pri.org/stories/2019-09-16/uptick-church-burnings-raises-alarm-ethiopia","published":"2019-09-16T16:00:00Z","guid":"https://www.pri.org/stories/2019-09-16/uptick-church-burnings-raises-alarm-ethiopia"},{"title":"Ahead of Tuesday's Israeli national election, would-be voters express hope, fear and apathy","content":"","url":"https://www.pri.org/stories/2019-09-16/ahead-tuesdays-israeli-national-election-would-be-voters-express-hope-fear-and","published":"2019-09-16T19:00:00Z","guid":"https://www.pri.org/stories/2019-09-16/ahead-tuesdays-israeli-national-election-would-be-voters-express-hope-fear-and"},{"title":"A North Dakota law gives school districts a chance to experiment","content":"","url":"https://www.pri.org/stories/2019-09-16/north-dakota-law-gives-school-districts-chance-experiment","published":"2019-09-16T18:00:00Z","guid":"https://www.pri.org/stories/2019-09-16/north-dakota-law-gives-school-districts-chance-experiment"},{"title":"There's a way for modern medicine to cure diseases even when the treatments aren't profitable","content":"","url":"https://www.pri.org/stories/2019-09-16/theres-way-modern-medicine-cure-diseases-even-when-treatments-arent-profitable","published":"2019-09-16T17:00:00Z","guid":"https://www.pri.org/stories/2019-09-16/theres-way-modern-medicine-cure-diseases-even-when-treatments-arent-profitable"}]},{"url":"https://rss.csmonitor.com/feeds/world","items":[{"title":"As basketball fandom rises in China, NBA looks for opportunity","content":"","url":"https://www.csmonitor.com/World/2019/0916/As-basketball-fandom-rises-in-China-NBA-looks-for-opportunity","published":"2019-09-16T15:55:53Z","guid":"d55762e74129ec0621686dae694aaca5"},{"title":"UN mission finds evidence of 'genocidal acts' in Myanmar","content":"","url":"https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Asia-South-Central/2019/0916/UN-mission-finds-evidence-of-genocidal-acts-in-Myanmar","published":"2019-09-16T15:46:25Z","guid":"48872503a869f11b25cdfdad05026209"},{"title":"Monday Sunrise Briefs: Drones attack Saudis, UAW strikes","content":"","url":"https://www.csmonitor.com/World/2019/0916/Monday-Sunrise-Briefs-Drones-attack-Saudis-UAW-strikes","published":"2019-09-16T10:16:00Z","guid":"003e1cf52834d9c2e7d6e0ce8e834d95"},{"title":"Tensions, and oil prices, rise after attack on Saudi oil fields","content":"","url":"https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2019/0916/Tensions-and-oil-prices-rise-after-attack-on-Saudi-oil-fields","published":"2019-09-16T10:07:21Z","guid":"5b30bbcfb491219aebb14864dee0246e"},{"title":"Who will win in Israel Tuesday?

with the Syrian people’s involvement in the peace process.\u003cbr /\u003e\n“The Islamic Republic of Iran has always emphasized on the futility of military solution for ending the crisis (in Syria),” he noted, adding, “Preserving Syria’s territorial integrity, respecting its national sovereignty and independence, and non-interference of foreigners in that country’s internal affairs –on which we have always emphasize—must be seriously observed, and all necessary grounds for the return of stability, security and calm to this country should be prepared.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe also

Ankara on Monday evening, ahead of a trilateral summit of Iran, Russian and Turkey on Syria peace efforts.\u003cbr /\u003e\nIn the gathering, the two sides discussed the approaches to the implementation of bilateral agreements between Tehran and Ankara.\u003cbr /\u003e\nHailing the “cordial and brotherly” ties between Iran and Turkey and the alliance of the two nations in all circumstance, President Rouhani praised Turkey for its clear stances on the US’ cruel sanctions against Iran.\u003cbr /\u003e\n“Despite the problems, Iran and Turkey will maintain economic relations in all fields,” he added.\u003cbr /\u003e\nRouhani also emphasized that using the Iranian and Turkish currencies for bilateral trade will lead to a stride in their economic ties, noting that Iran welcomes the Turkish investors and private sector companies willing to carry out joint projects.\u003cbr /\u003e\nThe Iranian president then touched on the mutual cooperation in the defense industry and the suitable grounds for cooperation and sharing experiences, noting that Iran and Turkey hold common views on the war against terrorism.\u003cbr /\u003e\n“The cooperation between Iran and Turkey for ensuring the security of common border and the region has continued, and will be enhanced,” he stated.\u003cbr /\u003e\nRouhani also proposed that the cooperation among Iran, Turkey and Russia for ensuring regional security could grow into trilateral or even multilateral economic interaction among the neighbors and contribute to regional development and stability.\u003cbr /\u003e\nIran feels duty-bound to ensure the security of regional maritime routes and attaches great significance to the security of the Persian Gulf, the Sea of Oman and the Strait of Hormuz, he added.\u003cbr /\u003e\n“Security of the region’s maritime routes must be ensured by the littoral states alone, and the presence of American forces and the invitations from the other countries asking them (the US) to come to the region will only add to the existing problems and tensions,” President Rouhani warned.\u003cbr /\u003e\nHe further slammed the war on Yemen as a result of US miscalculation, adding, “We should all try to restore stability and calm to Yemen in collaboration with the United Nations.”\u003cbr /\u003e\nRouhani finally pointed to the improved security in Syria after the cooperation among the three guarantors of the Astana Peace Process, urging that the supports for the Syrian government in the fight against the remaining terrorists in Idlib and east of the Euphrates should continue until terrorism will be uprooted in the Arab country.\u003cbr /\u003e\nFor his part, the Turkish president said Ankara is determined to keep taking big strides in the expansion of the brotherly and friendly ties with Iran.\u003cbr /\u003e\nLauding the remarkable rise in the trade ties between the two neighbors after the use of national currencies, Erdogan said, “The US sanctions against Iran are unconstructive, and from the Turkish government’s viewpoint, saving the JCPOA as the major symbol of success of dialogue and diplomacy has fundamental importance.”\u003cbr /\u003e\nHe also said the Astana Peace Process and the tripartite agreements among Turkey, Iran and Russia prevented a “human tragedy” in different parts of Syria, expressing the hope that the Monday’s summit in Ankara would

kingdom ends its deadly war.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe unprecedented attack knocked out more than half of Saudi crude output, or 5% of global supply, prompting Saudi and US officials to claim without any evidence that it probably originated from Iraq or Iran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBukhaiti told Iran\u0026#8217;s Tasnim news agency that blaming the attacks on other countries shows \u0026#8220;cowardice\u0026#8221; in facing up to the reality of Yemen\u0026#8217;s military power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;Saudi Arabia declared war against Yemen on the grounds that
