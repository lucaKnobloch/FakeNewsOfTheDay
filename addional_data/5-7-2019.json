While the Jaguar I-Pace SUV, its first all-electric car, is being made in Austria, the company is retooling part of its Solihull plant to make electric versions of Land Rover’s top-end Range Rover models.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMore basic autos are being moved to a lower-cost site in Slovakia, which\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href=\"https://mercury.bloomberg.com/news/PA66UG6KLVR4\"\u003etook over\u003c/a\u003e\u0026nbsp;production of the Land Rover Discovery last year and will also make the revived version of the brand’s original Defender model. JLR is showcasing that car at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in camouflage disguise and without revealing whether it will come as a hybrid as standard or feature an all-electric variant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eU.K. Business Secretary Greg Clark called the decision a “vote of confidence” in the U.K. auto sector that would put Britain at the forefront of electric-vehicle technology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWork will commence this month at the Castle Bromwich plant on facilities and technology that will allow diesel and gasoline vehicles to be produced alongside full electric and hybrid models.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eJLR in January confirmed plans to locate a new battery assembly center at Hams Hall, also in the English Midlands. The site will become operational in 2020 with annual capacity for 150,000 units. The company also has an engine plant in nearby Wolverhampton that it says will power the next generation of Jaguar and Land Rover models.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://fortune.com/2019/07/05/jlr-range-rover-jaguar-electric-cars/","published":"2019-07-05T10:02:50Z","guid":"https://fortune.com/?p=2663663"},{"title":"Are Gamers Ready to Buy New Consoles?

Neither system is really showing its age, which raises questions on whether gamers are ready to plunk down $400, $500 or more for the latest and greatest hardware. (Nintendo rolled out its new hardware—the Switch—in 2017 and isn\u0026#8217;t expected to announce radically new hardware in the near future.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eUltimately, of course, the answer to that will lie with the games. Software sells hardware. And, so far, there\u0026#8217;s not a lot of hard information about what the new titles the consoles will launch with (though Microsoft has already made it clear it intends to come out strong). But some leaders of the industry\u0026#8217;s biggest game publishers are stopping short of giving the upcoming consoles their full-throated support.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;I think it will come down to what the next generation consoles are able to show, what they\u0026#8217;re they able to provide,\u0026#8221; Yosuke Matsuda, CEO of Square Enix told \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e. \u0026#8220;The PS4 and the Xbox One—there are already a lot of them out there and they offer a very stable playing environment. There\u0026#8217;s lots of fun games to play on them. So from the customer\u0026#8217;s perspective, if they don’t offer anything special then there\u0026#8217;d be no reason to go out of your way to switch.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eStrauss Zelnick, CEO of Take-Two Interactive Software, also seems a bit skeptical.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;It\u0026#8217;s very early,\u0026#8221; he says. \u0026#8220;The announcement was just made\u0026#8230;. [But] in a world where [digital distribution service] Steam can represent 40% of a so-called console\u0026#8217;s retail, it\u0026#8217;s going to be hard to get the same level of consumer excitement.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOthers, though, are much more optimistic about the next generation of consoles. New hardware, they say, encourages creativity among developers and it generates excitement among consumers—even those who wait a while to buy the new systems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePublishers, at this point, have been briefed on many of the features of the new systems, including some that haven\u0026#8217;t been revealed to the general public. And while he, of course, doesn\u0026#8217;t reveal any additional features, Yves Guillemot, CEO of Ubisoft, says he\u0026#8217;s confident the next generation of game systems will excite players just as much as the current one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;They are both good consoles,\u0026#8221; he says. \u0026#8220;A lot of work has been put into both machines.

I sat down with Sethi to find out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eQ: Many things have stormed the financial scene since your last edition, such as roboadvisors \u0026#8212; what’s your take on them?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eA: That’s one of the most popular questions I get. If your decision is choosing between roboadvisors or a discount brokerage like Vanguard, you’re already in the right ballpark. Yes, roboadvisors are convenient with beautiful apps, but sometimes they charge more and won’t get you better returns. And many of their marketing claims are overhyped. Personally, I chose to put all my money in Vanguard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eQ: The ‘FIRE’ movement (financial independence, retire early) is also big now. Are they on the right track?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eA: Anything that gets Americans to raise their abysmal savings rates is a good thing. I love that people in the FIRE community laughed at the traditional 10% savings rate and said, ‘How about 70%?’ It stretched the imagination of what is possible. But if your reason for retiring early is ‘To escape,’ or ‘I hate my job,’ or ‘Sleep,’ that’s not a psychologically healthy reason. You need to think consciously about what you want to do with the rest of your life. It’s great that you want to save more, but life is lived outside a spreadsheet, and money is only a small part of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eQ: You recently got married, so how has that shaped your understanding of money?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eA: At first my wife felt like things weren’t fair, because she had opened up about her money life, but didn’t know anything about mine. That was a big mistake on my part. I violated my own rules about money and love, which is that you should be completely open about it, and that things shouldn’t be unbalanced.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe second mistake I made is that I wanted to jump right into spreadsheets. A lot of men are more comfortable with numbers. But what I really needed to do was step back, and start speaking a different language – what money means to us, and how we were raised. I realized a lot of things had been unspoken, and there were many differences in how we thought about money. Now I realize why so many couples fight about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eQ: You have been dragged into the debates about coffee spending again – why does that seem to strike a chord with so many people?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eA: People know where I stand on lattes. I’ve said everything I want to say about it. The point is, if you’re getting the ‘Big Wins’ right, then you never need to worry about the cost of lattes or appetizers. Most people are asking $3 questions, when they need to be asking the $30,000 questions.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eQ: Recently you have been talking about ‘turning the dial up’ on the things you love – what does that mean?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eA: It’s one of the most popular questions I ask. Most people are told to think about where they can cut back. So I ask, where do you love spending money? Their eyes light up – it’s usually things like food or travel. But like a radio dial, you can turn that up. So then I ask, what could you do if you quadruple your spending? Then the room just loses it. Most people have never even considered that option. Then they start thinking about ways to make that happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eQ: Have your views on real estate changed over 10 years?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eA: I’m a renter by choice, and have been in the same apartment for 10 years. Yes, I could have bought, but I’ve made more by investing. I don’t say real estate is a bad decision for everyone. In fact I have already saved a down payment, and I will buy at some point. But young people especially have started to question the value of real estate, and that’s a good thing. We should question those big purchases, and decide whether they are truly right for us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eQ: How was your approach to money different this time around?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eA: I’ve become more accepting of different ways that a ‘Rich Life’ might look. There are so many paths to get there. So while before I said you should be investing this much, or saving this much, or getting this or that interest rate, now I know that are many different routes to wealth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve also realized the importance of the psychology of money. You can give people all the perfect tactics and charts in the world, but if they don’t master their own psychology and understand why they do what they do – then none of it matters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://fortune.com/2019/07/05/ramit-sethi-updates-i-will-teach-you-to-be-rich-but-some-advice-stays-the-same-buy-the-latte/","published":"2019-07-05T12:00:04Z","guid":"https://fortune.com/?p=2662799"}]},{"url":"https://www.hotelbusiness.com/feed","items":[]},{"url":"https://rss.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Business.xml","items":[{"title":"‘Wolf of Wall Street’ Producer, Riza Aziz, Is Charged in Malaysia Fund Scandal","content":"","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/04/world/asia/wolf-wall-street-malaysia.html?emc=rss\u0026partner=rss","published":"2019-07-05T02:26:52Z","guid":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/04/world/asia/wolf-wall-street-malaysia.html"},{"title":"When Santa Goes on Vacation","content":"","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/03/arts/when-santa-goes-on-vacation.html?emc=rss\u0026partner=rss","published":"2019-07-05T03:56:59Z","guid":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/03/arts/when-santa-goes-on-vacation.html"},{"title":"Beverage Companies Embrace Recycling, Until It Costs Them","content":"","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/04/business/plastic-recycling-bottle-bills.html?emc=rss\u0026partner=rss","published":"2019-07-05T04:19:09Z","guid":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/04/business/plastic-recycling-bottle-bills.html"},{"title":"Chris Cline, Coal Mining Entrepreneur, Is Killed in Helicopter Crash, Reports Say","content":"","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/05/us/chris-cline-dead.html?emc=rss\u0026partner=rss","published":"2019-07-05T04:43:56Z","guid":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/05/us/chris-cline-dead.html"},{"title":"Consumers Are Spending.

Responding in April to the women who accused him of unwelcome physical contact, Biden acknowledged that he’d come up in a different era, and that he knew he’d need to change with the changing times. He snaps sometimes. He can ramble. The references can be dated, as when shortly after he launched his campaign, he mixed up Theresa May and Margaret Thatcher. When he has these gaffes, rivals and pundits ascribe added significance. He is deft with selfies, but also defends himself by pointing out things like being the deciding vote on the Gurney Amendment (which happened in 1974). Since he entered the race this spring, he’s spent more days off the trail than on (though, notably, he often meets with supporters for longer than his rivals, and on the day of that big fish-fry event in South Carolina two Fridays ago, he was the last candidate to leave).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThen there was his exchange with Senator Kamala Harris of California at last week’s debate, when she went after him for his opposition to public-school busing in the 1970s.

Biden’s initial answer struck some in the audience as patronizing, given who would be in the crowd at a Planned Parenthood primary event. In short, he made the issue about him: “First of all, a lot of you women, maybe a lot of the men out here don’t realize what incredible courage it took to stand up and say that—because the fact of the matter is that when you recall … The reason I wrote the Violence Against Women Act in the first place, and I wrote it, was because of what I’ve seen, what I understand happening, going into neighborhoods and communities and it knows no color, it knows no bounds, it knows no ethnicity. For you to stand and recall that, brings it all back immediately.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWhat he said after that, though, went further. Biden spoke passionately about how he thought that the woman’s ex-husband should be in jail. He cited statistics about transgender women being killed. He stumbled a little bit—much like he stumbled at the debate last Thursday, still trying to keep up with staff who have been pushing him to squeeze his senatorial answers into 30 seconds—but told the woman he wanted to talk with her in person backstage and learn from her about what he didn’t know.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIn a pre-debate briefing last week, a person who, by the rules reporters had to agree to as a condition of attending, could only be named as a “Biden campaign official,” responded to one question about age by noting that Sanders is a year older and insisting no one ever talks about that. Swatting back arguments about making room for a new generation, the campaign official said, “It is the rare Democratic campaign where there isn’t a candidate calling for a new generation or someone to pick up the torch,” adding, “This is a process, and it’s an open process for a reason.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eAbout six hours later, Representative Eric Swalwell of California, who was still in diapers through Biden’s second term in the Senate, called for Biden to pass the torch (it’s printed on his campaign merchandise)—by citing a speech that Biden gave in 1986 calling for the torch to be passed to the next generation. “I’m still holding on to that torch,” Biden said, and a mini-melee erupted onstage. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who has been talking for more than a year about how he doesn’t think Democrats can win by saying “back” or “again,” tried to get in with, “As the youngest guy on the stage, I feel like I probably ought to contribute …” before being cut off by Sanders saying, “As part of Joe’s generation, let me respond.” The moderators gave the time to Sanders, who argued that the question was about ideas, not age.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eBiden’s team feels confident that his greatest strength in the campaign is that people know him to be a decent man.

This isn’t very subtle: Biden supported the war, and Moulton is a decorated Marine who served four tours, but it’s an attack that Moulton is making after a few years of being a favorite of Biden, who included him in the group of young veterans in Democratic politics who reminded him of his late son Beau.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e“What I’m really saying is not specific to him—it’s a generational argument.

He recalled how confused senators were last year about how Facebook works when they called Mark Zuckerberg in for a regulatory hearing last April—and those senators were, for the most part, younger than Biden. “I think he’s a very sensitive guy, but our national-security challenges right now are drones and artificial intelligence and space warfare; I don’t think people look to the Vietnam generation as the generation that’s going to figure that out.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eAmong the people who are voters, that hasn’t been the case.

It’s one of the worst thing to happen to the church.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCoppock mentioned to me the powerful example of \u003ca href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Saint-Ambrose\"\u003eSt. Ambrose, Bishop of Milan\u003c/a\u003e, who was willing to rebuke the Roman \u003ca href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Theodosius-I\"\u003eEmperor Theodosius\u003c/a\u003e for the latter’s role in massacring civilians as punishment for the murder of one of his generals. Ambrose refused to allow the church to become a political prop, despite concerns that doing so may endanger him. Ambrose spoke truth to power. (Theodosius ended up seeking penance and Ambrose went on to teach, convert and baptize St. Augustine.) Proximity to power is fine for Christians, Karel told me, but only so long as it does not corrupt their moral sense, only so long as they don’t allow their faith to become politically weaponized. Yet that is precisely what’s happening today.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"dropcap\"\u003eEvangelical Christians need another model for cultural and political engagement, and one of the best I am aware of has been articulated by the artist Makoto Fujimura, who speaks about “culture care” instead of “culture war.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.imb.org/2017/09/25/conversation-artist-makoto-fujimura-beauty-mission-culture-care/\"\u003eAccording to Fujimura\u003c/a\u003e, “Culture care is an act of generosity to our neighbors and culture. Culture care is to see our world not as a battle zone in which we’re all vying for limited resources, but to see the world of abundant possibilities and promise.” What Fujimura is talking about is a fundamentally different set of sensibilities and dispositions from what we see embodied in many white evangelical leaders who frequently speak out on culture and politics. The sensibilities and dispositions Fujimura is describing are characterized by a commitment to grace, beauty, and creativity, not antipathy, disdain, and pulsating anger. It’s the difference between an open hand and a mailed fist.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBuilding on this theme, Mark Labberton, a colleague of Fujimura’s and president of Fuller Theological Seminary, the largest multi-denominational seminary in the world, has \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGUf5cuRWoU\"\u003espoken\u003c/a\u003e about a distinct way for Christians to conceive of their calling, from people who see themselves as living in a Promised Land and “demanding it back” to living a “faithful, exilic life.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLabberton speaks about what it means to live as people in exile, trying to find the capacity to love in unexpected ways; to see the enemy, the foreigner, the stranger, and the alien and to go toward rather than away from them. He asks what a life of faithfulness looks like while living in a world of fear.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe adds, “The church is in one of its deepest moments of crisis—not because of some election result or not, but because of what has been exposed to be the poverty of the American church in its capacity to be able to see and love and serve and engage in ways in which we simply fail to do. And that vocation is the vocation that must be recovered and must be made real in tangible action.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are countless examples of how such tangible action can be manifest. But as a starting point, evangelical Christians should acknowledge the profound damage that’s being done to their movement by its braided political relationship—its love affair, to bring us back to the words of Ralph Reed—with a president who is an ethical and moral wreck. Until that is undone—until followers of Jesus are once again willing to speak truth to power rather than act like court pastors—the crisis in American Christianity will only deepen, its public testimony only dim, its effort to be a healing agent in a broken world only weaken.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt this point, I can’t help but wonder if that really matters to many of Donald Trump’s besotted evangelical supporters.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/2dBEwJo48FA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/2dBEwJo48FA/","published":"2019-07-05T10:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-593353"},{"title":"Europe Has Turned Its Back on Its ISIS Suspects","content":"\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eSamir Bougana, a 24-year-old Italian, \u003ca href=\"https://thesoufancenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Beyond-the-Caliphate-Foreign-Fighters-and-the-Threat-of-Returnees-TSC-Report-October-2017-v3.pdf\"\u003ewas one\u003c/a\u003e of thousands of western European recruits who traveled to fight alongside the Islamic State after 2014.

Summer holidays are approaching in Europe; in northeastern Syria, Tayler points out, the season also means triple-digit temperatures where prisoners—and, at separate camps, their family members—languish in poor conditions. The Islamic State was America’s top national-security priority for years; now that the group has lost its territory, it’s hard to focus on what’s happening in its former lands. Besides, it’s always easier to draw attention to a threat than to what looks like a humanitarian problem.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThere’s also a limit to how much the Trump administration itself is willing to focus on the issue, given its other priorities. “If this was truly a Trump administration priority, then the signals that were coming out didn’t demonstrate that to our partners,” Elizabeth Dent, a nonresident scholar at the Middle East Institute who previously served as a special assistant to the special presidential envoy to the global coalition to defeat ISIS, told me. And it’s difficult to predict the outcome, given the seemingly ever-shifting policy on the U.S. presence in Syria. If Bashar al-Assad’s forces attempt to retake the territory held by America’s Kurdish partners, for example, “this could go very badly,” Dent said—not least because it would stretch the Syrian regime even more thinly to regain control of more than a third of the country and take custody of thousands of detained fighters and their families.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eAnd it may not stay a humanitarian problem.

This role wasn’t unimportant, and his fate was sweeter than those of Khrushchev’s other party rivals—Georgy Malenkov was made to manage a power station in Kazakhstan and Lazar Kaganovich a potash factory in the Urals.

The 10-day period from June 20—when Trump reversed himself on Iran strikes—to the DMZ visit was among the most significant of his presidency, as he was forced to come to terms with the consequences and contradictions of his own decisions. Over the course of three decades, Trump has carefully nurtured two images of himself—as a deal maker, and as a militarist. Bolton did all he could to encourage the latter. But even from faraway Ulaanbaatar this past weekend, it was clear that, when made to choose, Trump would opt for the former.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"dropcap\"\u003eTo understand where we are and where we are going, we must first understand where we have been. Trump became president with a set of deeply rooted visceral instincts about the world—hostility to alliances, skepticism of free trade, and support for authoritarian strongmen—but little idea about how to convert these beliefs into policy. He had few advisers qualified for high office who believed what he believed. He was insecure. And so he turned to a number of highly experienced businessmen and former military officers to fill key national security and foreign policy positions—John Kelly, James Mattis, H.R. McMaster, Gary Cohn, and Rex Tillerson. These men saw their role as constraining the president, not empowering him. The measured their success by what they prevented from happening, rather than by what they made happen. In the Trump epoch, this was the age of constraint.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe president did not always listen to the “axis of adults.” In fact, he took pleasure in defying them on occasion, but he usually returned to the fold under pressure. In delivering a speech at the new NATO headquarters in May 2017, Trump raised doubts about his commitment to the alliance when he took out a sentence endorsing Article 5, the mutual defense clause of the NATO charter. After the ensuing uproar, he was persuaded to state his support for Article 5 at a press conference with the Romanian president and in a subsequent speech in Poland. Under the leadership of the axis of adults, the administration produced strategic documents reflecting the views of the establishment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe president grew weary of the adult supervision and he gradually realized he was the president. He could order his Cabinet members to do what he wished, even if they all objected. We can identify precisely when the age of constraint reached its peak and when it ended. The peak \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/17/us/politics/trump-iran-nuclear-deal-recertify.html\"\u003ecame\u003c/a\u003e on July 17, 2017, when the president sat in an interagency meeting to discuss the Iran nuclear deal—specifically the question of whether to recertify Iran’s compliance, an assessment that the United States was required to make every six months. Trump’s team presented him with three options, none of which involved leaving the deal. Trump was furious—he approved a recertification but promised that it would be the last one. By the next deadline, he wanted the option to leave. Bolton immediately began auditioning for the job as Trump’s top security adviser, writing an \u003ca href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/2017/08/iran-nuclear-deal-exit-strategy-john-bolton-memo-trump/\"\u003earticle\u003c/a\u003e in \u003cem\u003eNational Review\u003c/em\u003e with a plan to leave the Iran deal.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor the next few months, it was clear that Trump was intent on a change. He forced out the axis of adults, replacing Tillerson, Cohn, and McMaster with individuals who placed loyalty to the president over their own independent judgment. This ushered in the second phase of his presidency—the age of action. Trump now acted more freely, pursuing his instincts, even when they conflicted with the advice of his officials. He announced talks with Kim Jong Un without consulting his Cabinet. He moved the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. He pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal. He imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum. He had a summit with Vladimir Putin in Helsinki. He started a trade war with China. His national security adviser, Bolton, effectively abolished the interagency process through which the Pentagon, State Department, CIA and other entities have formal seats at the table where the decisions are made. The removal of constraints was complete when Mattis resigned in December 2018 following Trump’s promise to withdraw troops from Syria.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor Trump, the age of action was exhilarating. It fulfilled his expectations of what it meant to be president. But it couldn’t last forever. His actions were always focused on the short term. They were frequently riven with contradictions. There never was an end goal or a strategy for how to get there. The United States is a very powerful country. It can make mistakes for some time without incurring the costs that normal powers would experience if they pursued the same path. But it cannot do so indefinitely.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe age of reckoning finally arrived on June 21, when Trump ordered air strikes on Iran and then changed his mind. At this moment, the contradictions in his Iran policy were laid bare. Trump wanted to shred the Iran nuclear deal and impose maximum pressure on the Iranian regime. He also wanted to avoid embroiling America in a new conflict in the Middle East. He could not have both. But for over a year, he pretended as if these two goals were not in conflict. Perhaps he believed the Iranians would surrender without a fight. Or that they would come to the negotiating table from a position of weakness. Or perhaps he did not think about the endgame at all until he had to.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"dropcap\"\u003eFor all his own flaws, Trump was not well served by his national security team. The axis of adults manipulated Trump by delaying, blocking, or blunting his requests. Bolton manipulated him by advocating for the most extreme options—such as imposing secondary sanctions on European countries to truly destroy the Iran nuclear deal or pulling out of the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty—when more modest ones would have sufficed. Bolton’s priority has always been to advance his unilateralist theory of international law and he seems unable to think strategically about America’s interests.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt has been obvious for months that Trump did not want war with Iran, but Bolton kept the president from hearing from officials who would offer a contrary view to the hawks. Never one for protocol, Trump decided to go outside normal channels and started talking to Carlson, who now appears to be a confidant. It says a lot about Bolton’s own insecurity that he would prefer to put his boss in the position of relying on a talk show host rather than allow an interagency meeting where a diversity of views might be raised.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the reckoning, there is some clarity. It is now clear that Trump wants talks with Iran, just like with North Korea. Calling off the strikes was the right judgment call, but things should never have gotten to that point. Foreign governments now know what makes Trump tick. Pyongyang, Moscow, Beijing, Tehran, and others are no doubt taking copious notes. Trump’s team will be tempted to correct course—as they did by imposing tough new sanctions the days after the Iran strike decision, but the damage is done.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe contradictions are catching up with Trump elsewhere. The DMZ summit confirmed that, if forced to choose between denuclearization and a good relationship with Kim Jong Un, he will choose Kim. In Venezuela, he was told that forcing Nicolas Maduro out of power would be an easy win. It was not. Faced with the choice between escalation and intervention on the one hand and disengagement on the other, he admonished his hawkish aides and chose the latter course. He was right not to intervene, but once again a crisis had reached a point it shouldn’t have.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn China, Trump embraced foreign policy hawks to create leverage that would compel Beijing to reach a trade deal. However, it looks like he has to choose between an agreement and efforts to counterbalance Chinese power. In Osaka, he chose to keep the deal alive and reversed his decision to ban American companies from providing Huawei with technology. As time goes on, he may continue to prioritize economic gains over strategic concerns.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe era of action ultimately forced Trump to choose deal-making over militarism. He could change his mind in the future—particularly if he thinks he will look weak for not responding to new provocations, real or perceived—but the frame for the next 18 months appears to be set. A former senior official in the Bush administration who is sympathetic to Bolton on some issues told me that Trump is so wrapped up in the image of a deal maker yet so ignorant of the issues that he will “sign on to half-assed deals that he does not understand.” Referring to Iran, he said, “does anyone think Pompeo’s strict conditions and objectives for negotiations will remain in place” once Trump gets involved? When a business deal that Trump made as a developer turned sour, he would go to court for a do-over. But taking a foreign-policy risk is different. As the former Bush official points out, the president has “no option of taking the country into chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings if it doesn’t work out.” By the time the bill comes due, the 2020 election will probably be over so he’s unlikely to care.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTrump will still act freely in accordance with his own instincts on other fronts. It was obvious in Osaka that his heart is with other authoritarian leaders. He embraced Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and joked with Vladimir Putin about Russian election interference. He did not know what Putin meant by his comment that Western liberalism is obsolete and didn’t care to find out. Meanwhile U.S. relations with the United Kingdom, Germany, and Japan are at post-Cold War lows. It is often, and rightly, said of Trump that he is undisciplined and loses interest in subjects quickly. But he has slowly and steadily chipped away at the pillars of the free world and used the rubble to lay the foundations of an illiberal alternative.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"dropcap\"\u003eAs during the previous twist in the narrative, Trump now finds himself with a national security team out of sync with his preferences. Changes are inevitable. Pompeo will likely survive. He is nothing if not adaptable. After the Iran decision, he and Mike Pence let it be known that although they supported military action they were equally enthusiastic about the president’s U-turn. It’s hard to see how Bolton can stay. Trump has long known that Bolton wanted war more than he does. He sidelined him on North Korea and overruled him on Iran. For his part, Bolton has privately attacked Pompeo, long a Trump favorite, as falling captive to the State Department bureaucracy and has predicted that the North Korea policy will fail.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBolton has given an unusually large number of interviews to reporters and has been rewarded with positive profiles lauding his influence and bureaucratic prowess. Those of us who predicted that he would cling to the post of national security adviser, as it would be the last job he’d ever get, may have been wrong. In fact, Bolton looks and sounds as if he is preparing to exit on his own terms. Better that than being sent on a never-ending tour of the world’s most obscure places. For Bolton, leaving because he’s too tough for Trump is the perfect way to save face. Otherwise, he may be remembered as the man who presided over one of the weakest national security teams in modern American history and someone whose myopic obsessions—like international treaties or communism in Venezuela—meant the United States lost precious time in preparing for the national security challenges of the future.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWho will replace Bolton is unclear. The best-case scenario would be Biegun, the North Korea envoy. He was rumored to be the runner up to Bolton for the post in 2018. (Mattis and Kelly, pushed for him, although at that point he had not spent time with Trump. Now he has.) Trump may see him as the man to oversee his various negotiations, as he has on North Korea. But will Trump go for a mainstream figure who would not be out of place in a traditional Republican presidency?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf the past is prelude, Trump may turn instead to his favorite source of information, Fox News, just as he did for Bolton. One of Tucker Carlson’s frequent guests on his show is a retired Army colonel by the name of Douglas McGregor. McGregor served in the first Gulf War and appears to be ideologically aligned with Carlson, favoring retrenchment from the Middle East and good relations with authoritarian states. His appointment would be treated as a calamity by the Republican foreign policy establishment—which is one reason it may appeal to the president. Appointing a cheerleading cable news commentator to one of the nation’s most senior posts sounds ludicrous, but—as Carlson’s recent role demonstrates—it is way we live now.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne way or another, Trump seems determined to present an image of himself in 2020 as a deal maker who is getting tough with allies who have taken advantage of the United States and making peace with the country’s enemies. The risks are enormous. Trump may strike bad deals. He could permanently weaken America’s influence and encourage aggression against America’s allies. But it may work for him politically, throwing the Democrats off balance and setting the stage for a second term in which he will be empowered to follow his instincts to their logical conclusion. The bullets Trump never fired in his first term— such as withdrawal from NATO and the World Trade Organization—may be put back in the chamber. The 75-year-old American led international order will be back in his firing line. Men like Pompeo may tell themselves they can steer him in a different direction. But if they finally stand up to him, they may find themselves with urgent business to attend to in Ulaanbaatar or, worse still, at a potash factory in the Urals.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/uQUFRs9R3lo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/uQUFRs9R3lo/","published":"2019-07-05T10:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-593284"},{"title":"Where John Roberts Is Taking the Court","content":"\u003cp\u003eLast year’s Supreme Court term ended with a vivid display of willed gullibility by Chief Justice John Roberts. In \u003ci\u003eHawaii v. Trump, \u003c/i\u003ethe “travel ban” case, Roberts announced he would pay no attention to that Islamophobia behind the curtain and instead treat the ban as a “facially neutral policy denying certain foreign nationals the privilege of admission.” This year’s term ended with the same man stating in \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/department-of-commerce-v-new-york/\"\u003eDepartment of Commerce v.

Until last week, the response of the Supreme Court’s conservative majority has been to put its fingers in its ears and proclaim, like Miracle Max in \u003ci\u003eThe Princess Bride\u003c/i\u003e,\u003ci\u003e \u003c/i\u003e“Nobody’s hearing nothing!”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe fact that Roberts decided, in at least one case, that he would no longer play rubber-stamp judge is a huge development; much of the future of our democracy depends on whether this was a cosmetic move by a reluctant Trump supporter or a genuine renaissance of Roberts’s judicial conscience.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMovement conservatives certainly found Roberts’s vote—against the administration in its quest to put a citizenship question on the census—alarming. Matt Schlapp, the chair of the American Conservative Union, tweeted, “I’m for impeaching the chief justice for lying to all of us about his support of the Constitution.” The conservative radio host Laura Ingraham called for his resignation. The Fox TV presenter Lou Dobbs suggested that Trump simply refuse to obey the Court’s order.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s easy to understand their worry. The administration has repeatedly treated the Court—newly “enhanced” with Trump’s appointees, Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh—as an outpost of the executive branch, with the task of taming lower courts. Judicial skepticism might affect the administration’s legal strategy the way water affected the Wicked Witch of the West.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFollowing the \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/07/citizenship-questions-are-not-historically-normal/593014/?utm_source=feed\"\u003ecensus decision\u003c/a\u003e, some SCOTUS nerds thought the opinion was a meaningless feint. The redoubtable Joshua Matz, for instance, suggested that Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross “need only issue a new memorandum explaining why he wants to include a citizenship question.” But as administrative lawyers know, a new memo requires a new rationale with an “administrative record” to back it up, which requires, in turn, a bit more than a Mylar balloon and a greeting card. The logistics of a new record would be dauntingly difficult.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis doesn’t mean that Trump won’t try to scare one up. The Commerce Department on Tuesday notified counsel that it had given up the fight for the citizenship question. Then on Wednesday, Trump tweeted that the administration was “absolutely going forward” with the question. In \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/07/trumps-reversal-census-citizenship-question/593335/?utm_source=feed\"\u003ea hearing that afternoon\u003c/a\u003e, Joseph Hunt, the head of the Justice Department’s Civil Division, admitted uncertainty, but told the judge that the current plan is apparently to go back to the Supreme Court and ask for an order “to simplify and expedite the remaining litigation and provide clarity to the process going forward.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNo one seems to know exactly what will happen next, but it’s possible this case will end up back at the high court. Maryland District Judge George Hazel asked the government to give him a definite answer about its plans by Friday.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo should we believe that Roberts secretly had some cockamamie plan to sneak the question through after pretending to reject it? If so, it was an odd strategy. All he had to do was vote the other way, and the case was over. Instead he issued a stinging rebuke. (Matz did note, “This is the first time an agency action has ever been set aside by the Court as pretextual.”)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI suspect that Roberts voted as he did because at some point he grew tired of being lied to by Solicitor General Noel Francisco and treated contemptuously by President Trump. In the year since Roberts played dead for the travel ban, Trump has blasted a federal judge in California as an “Obama judge” because he blocked new asylum rules. In a move unprecedented in American history, the chief justice directly and publicly reprimand a sitting president: “We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges,” Roberts said in an official statement from the Court.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTrump, never one to take a hint, responded with an attack on Roberts by name, insisting that the chief’s cherished ideal of judicial independence is a joke. “Sorry Chief Justice John Roberts, but you do indeed have ‘Obama judges,’ and they have a much different point of view than the people who are charged with the safety of our country.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI understand that Roberts is not a secret moderate. He’s a lifelong conservative with far-reaching legal goals of rolling back civil-rights, economic, and environmental gains. But if the chief justice is sick and tired of being treated like Francisco’s idiot intern, the possible ramifications are huge. If he were to begin taking account of facts—taking this administration at its word when it tells the world of its plans to punish Muslims, torment immigrants, disfranchise its opponents, cripple Congress, and silence its critics—then there may be more times when the chief says, in so many words: \u003ci\u003eStop lying. Do the job right or give it to someone who can\u003c/i\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat in itself would constitute a major change. As the recent term-end summaries make clear, this Court has not yet attained a stable 5–4 conservative equilibrium. The two moderate justices, Elena Kagan and Stephen Breyer, seem to want to wheel and deal. Both of the new justices are feeling their way. Both have crossed the partisan aisle in surprising ways. Certainly Kavanaugh has adopted the chief as a kind of mentor and model. Though Gorsuch seems to prefer Clarence Thomas, he too may not be locked into that pose. Perhaps this most polarized Court could grow a center.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s just possible that Roberts’s vote was not pure pique, but a genuine willingness to question the administration’s lies. Of course, that may be a delusive hope. But “live in hope,” the old Barbadian proverb bids, “though you die in despair.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/D06QaGXrlAo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/D06QaGXrlAo/","published":"2019-07-05T10:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-593188"},{"title":"\u003cem\u003eSpider-Man: Far From Home\u003c/em\u003e Satirizes the Way Marvel Movies Are Made","content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis article contains major spoilers for \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSpider-Man: Far From Home.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSpider-Man, transformed from the page into a live-action hero, has become a cartoon again.

But it’s also a fact that popped into my head when \u003cem\u003eFar From Home \u003c/em\u003erevealed its ultimate twist: that Mysterio (played by Jake Gyllenhaal), who introduced himself as a high-flying hero from another dimension, is merely the computerized creation of Quentin Beck (also Gyllenhaal), a disgruntled scientist once employed by Tony Stark, who died in\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/04/avengers-endgame-review-marvel/587821/?utm_source=feed\"\u003e \u003cem\u003eAvengers: Endgame\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. In hopes of gaining control of Stark’s high-end technology, Beck has concocted this superhero fantasy to bamboozle the public—and Spider-Man—into thinking Mysterio is a deserving successor to Iron Man. In other words, any time Spider-Man goes into battle alongside (or against) Mysterio, he’s really fighting with a light show made by an army of invisible flying drones.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s a clever update of \u003ca href=\"https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Mysterio-Origin-Story-Marvel-Spider-Man-Comics-46337201\"\u003eMysterio’s comic-book origins\u003c/a\u003e\u003cu\u003e.\u003c/u\u003e Stan Lee and Steve Ditko introduced the character in 1964 as a stuntman-turned-supervillain who used his skill with theatrics and makeup to create frightening illusions. \u003cem\u003eFar From Home\u003c/em\u003e, written by Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers, tweaks Mysterio to slyly mock the increasing unreality of moviegoers’ favorite superheroes. Indeed, for his climactic battle with Spider-Man in \u003cem\u003eFar From Home\u003c/em\u003e, Beck is shown donning the skin-tight, strangely patterned spandex uniform that any Marvel actor would instantly recognize as a motion-capture suit. In an age of “\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/video/index/593170/deepfake/?utm_source=feed\"\u003edeepfakes\u003c/a\u003e” and untrustworthy news outlets, this Mysterio is an apt villain, a representation of the \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/06/fake-news-republicans-democrats/591211/?utm_source=feed\"\u003epervasive anxiety\u003c/a\u003e that it’s getting harder and harder to believe what one sees. But I also took the character as a joking prod at Marvel movies themselves, which are assembled through post-production processes so complicated that actors \u003ca href=\"https://ew.com/movies/2019/04/11/don-cheadle-avengers-endgame/\"\u003esometimes can barely understand the plot\u003c/a\u003e of the movie they’re making.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBeck invents Mysterio, who wears a flamboyant caped outfit with golden armor and a crystal-ball helmet, not because he’s always aspired to be a superhero but because he knows that people respond to heroism. He’s after Stark’s tech, which would allow him to harness even more drones, launch weapon strikes, and essentially surveil the world. And he knows the world will be happy to put that power in the hands of a costumed do-gooder. The plan works on Peter Parker, at least: Still a teenager in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and mourning the death of his mentor, he hands over a high-tech Stark device to Beck because the older man seems more settled in his superhero identity. The ultimate lesson, of course, is that Peter’s deep sense of \u003ca href=\"https://www.cbr.com/when-we-first-met-when-did-uncle-ben-first-say-with-great-power-comes-great-responsibility/\"\u003eresponsibility\u003c/a\u003e makes him far more worthy of the technology than he believed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut I couldn’t help but wonder if, besides mocking manipulative fakery, the \u003cem\u003eFar From Home \u003c/em\u003edirector Jon Watts was also poking fun at the supposed infallibility of the caped crusaders who dominate box offices year after year.

Gyllenhaal almost played the role of Spider-Man many years ago, as I noted in my \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/06/spider-man-far-home-movie-review/592708/?utm_source=feed\"\u003ereview\u003c/a\u003e, but he’s far better suited to this exaggerated parody of heroism, with bluff and bluster covering for egomania. A bizarre twist late in the film also finds that the shapeshifting alien Talos (Ben Mendelsohn) was impersonating Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) for the entire runtime, revealing even this supporting role as an exaggerated performance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Marvel honcho Kevin Feige \u003ca href=\"https://comicbook.com/marvel/2019/06/24/spider-man-far-from-home-infinity-saga-ending-marvel-kevin-feige/\"\u003ehas said\u003c/a\u003e that \u003cem\u003eFar From Home \u003c/em\u003emarks the end of Marvel’s third “phase,” a story cycle that included 11 films.

As with other carcinogens, it\u0026rsquo;s likely people mostly have to worry about long-term or very high amounts of benzene exposure. But spending time in a poorly ventilated and newly painted room could expose people to elevated benzene levels, the ACS states.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBenzene is one of a class of chemicals known as volatile organic compounds, or VOCs.

But \u003ca href=\"https://neuro.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.neuropsych.270101\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003eresearch\u003c/a\u003e has found that some of them can be absorbed into the blood through contact with the skin or through inhalation, and that they can accumulate in the brain or organs of those who are exposed. The liver also breaks down some of these chemicals into byproducts that can bind to and potentially interfere with a cell\u0026rsquo;s genetic material.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe take-home message from all this research is that paint is potentially toxic\u0026mdash;\u003ca href=\"https://toxtown.nlm.nih.gov/chemicals-and-contaminants/volatile-organic-compounds-vocs\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003eespecially for \u0026ldquo;vulnerable\u0026rdquo; groups\u003c/a\u003e such as pregnant women, young children and the elderly. VOC levels are usually much higher indoors than out, especially if those indoor areas are not well ventilated. And wet or drying paint\u0026mdash;particularly oil-based paints\u0026mdash;tend to emit a lot of VOCs, says Clifford Weisel, a professor at the Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences Institute of Rutgers University.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErin McCanlies, co-author of the recent autism study and an epidemiologist at the CDC\u0026rsquo;s National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, says water-based low- or zero-VOC paints\u0026mdash;which are now easy to find\u0026mdash;may be safer than older generations of pain. \u0026ldquo;However, paints may contain other chemicals such as binders, corrosion inhibitors and preservatives that may contribute to their toxicological properties,\u0026rdquo; she says. And \u003ca href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132314004120#!\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003eresearch\u003c/a\u003e has found that even zero-VOC paints still emit chemical gasses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, even if you\u0026rsquo;re using these, Weisel says it\u0026rsquo;s a good idea to open windows and doors and turn on a fan.

Grandstanding and finger-pointing at each other won\u0026rsquo;t solve problems. To accept that they are part of the problem might just make them better leaders. The mark of true leadership is whether it can transform a crisis into an opportunity that serves a wider cause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYoung activists are going to be tested.

For the first few months, our stock photos didn’t get a lot of traction because we were going after easy stuff, like photos of job interviews. There were already a bunch of photos covering job interviews. So covering trendy or even ugly topics was [profitable] for us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"tRIjCf\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eChelsea: \u003c/strong\u003eI really perfected the thumbs-up pose. If you’re a stock model, you’re giving a thumbs-up all the time. I don’t know if you understand how challenging that enthusiasm is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"KwZ4fP\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat were some of the main poses you’d run through when you’re taking stock photos of, say, an argument or a doctor’s appointment?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"0vMy8h\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTony: \u003c/strong\u003eI think you go through every iteration. Job interview where both people are happy. Job interview where one person is nervous. Job interview where one person is angry and one person is concerned. Job interview with thumbs-up toward the camera. Job interview with two thumbs-up toward the camera. You set up the whole set and run through it with one model, and then swap out the models. Or, like, “Put the jacket on, take the jacket off.” You want to get the most out of one particular setting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"6W1kTc\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIs that just maximizing the chance that one of those photos might be useful to someone? Is that the strategy?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"O4DK0p\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eChelsea: \u003c/strong\u003eIt’s about storytelling. If we set up a shoot that’s supposed to look like a job interview, we don’t want to do one part of the story and then have to go back and shoot again so you can do the other part of the story. We’re trying to set up a situation where multiple stories can happen, and then you’re trying to show every possible story. When you put the photos on the stock site, then you have multiple versions people can buy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"XrdrcX\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow much money is there in stock photos? Were you guys doing well off that business?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"X66Bh9\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTony: \u003c/strong\u003eIt trickles in really slow. When I go back and account for a day of shooting and post-processing, over time we’d end up making $1,500, $2,000, for a couple days’ work. It could be a decent living as long as you could go a couple of years without actually gathering up the money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"npHLRt\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhen you guys wanted to put a prop in a photo shoot, were you on the hook for everything you were posing with? Did you have to go out and buy those bracelets?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"vhWnkN\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eChelsea: \u003c/strong\u003eAbsolutely. In some of our business pictures it looks like we’re behind a desk, but it’s actually a door. It’s all smoke and mirrors. You’re shooting from different angles so it looks like you have a higher budget than you really do. That’s the fun of it for me. You’re hacking together a whole set and really believing that you’re in an office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"8AXJAh\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo it’s almost like MacGyver. “Okay, what do we have to make this work?”\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ynrsoR\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTony: \u003c/strong\u003eSimilar to the way we work around the props we have, you work around the models you have. Every stock photographer ends up using themselves as models. So, “Oh, Tony is a guy with gray hair, we’ll put him in a lab coat and now he’s a doctor.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Vh0rYI\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere are some of the most memorable places you’ve seen yourselves pop up?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"B6zlbi\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eChelsea: \u003c/strong\u003eMy favorite was when Tony was the face of French Cialis, because that was a joke I very carefully crafted and it came through for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Npjs3Z\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTony: \u003c/strong\u003eMy concept of the shot was just, “Oh, this couple is having a fight.” I’m posed in bed and Chelsea’s turned away, and we did 10 different variations on that. I’m mad at her, she’s mad at me. And in this photo, she decided to tag it in the tagging section as “erectile dysfunction.” It ended up as one of our top 10 photos. \u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4ptYlA7EfZhgh7LGh6JqGHlf0KI=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16501909/shutterstock_64487626.jpg\"\u003e\n      \u003ccite\u003eTony Northrup/Shutterstock\u003c/cite\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003eChelsea and Tony Northrup, in an image tagged “erectile dysfunction.”\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"7VWhLA\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eChelsea: \u003c/strong\u003e[I went to a gym] and saw myself on the cover of a pamphlet [of the gym membership brochure]. But they didn’t believe me. I was like, “Oh, that’s me!” And they were like, “Oh, yeah, sure it is.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Y7tOBQ\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTony: \u003c/strong\u003eI went to a Target and saw Chelsea on the cover of Yoga Magazine. I took a photo of it and put it on Facebook. And a bunch of people are saying, “Oh, man, can you teach me yoga?” And, like, Chelsea doesn’t know yoga. She literally just made up a pose. She stuck her arm out and said, “Is this something?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"kPrZH1\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou guys shot most of your stock stuff eight years ago.

It’s a lot of really cheesy stuff. People send me packaging that I’m on, billboards in other countries. The only thing I ever regret is that I’m on the [packaging for] weight loss pills. I feel bad because people might think they actually work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"JPqycC\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe think of stock photos as fairly sterile.

Because first of all, in order to have your photos submitted, they have to meet a certain technical threshold. They’ll get rejected if they’re not up to snuff. Secondly, storytelling is a huge part of any successful photograph. And having to break it down to its simplest parts over and over again, I think it really strengthened me as a photographer. Even when I was being goofy, I found it really rewarding and challenging. I’d recommend any photographer trying it for that alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"5J7uNe\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTony: \u003c/strong\u003eWhen people pay for your photos with dollars, that’s true validation.

You play as Kay, whose backstory is mysterious, and whose intense loneliness has transformed her physical appearance. It’s a gorgeous game, with much to love, but its dense, episodic narrative and repetitive gameplay occasionally obscure its core message. You begin the game sitting in a boat on troubled waters. You paddle your small dinghy towards the singular light source in the distance, the falling rain creating a pensive atmosphere. As the lighthouse appears, you're able to lower the water line—making it glassy and clear—and lighting the entire region.

To do so you traverse atmospheric seascapes and broken cities in a nearly empty environment filled with otherworldly creatures that the game refers to as \"monsters.\" These monsters are often massive in scale, covered in black gnarls not dissimilar to yours. And as the narrative unravels, you learn they're each somehow connected to Kay—either as people in her life, or as surreal manifestations of emotions that can be interpreted in a more open-ended way.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThough \u003ci\u003e Sea of Solitude\u003c/i\u003e lasts around four hours, the world was captivating enough to make me spend additional hours simply running around in it. Fluctuations in lighting and water level effectively communicate tone and mindset in a way rarely seen in games. When well lit, it has the expansive freedom and awe of \u003ci\u003e Journey\u003c/i\u003e. At its darkest, the game calls to mind favorable comparisons to \u003ci\u003e Limbo\u003c/i\u003e or \u003ci\u003e Inside\u003c/i\u003e. It's cinematic, it begs to be traversed, and it’s marked by extreme vicissitudes in fortune. All life and energy can be sucked away at a moment's notice thanks to a giant monster or Kay interacting with an area of \"corruption.\" \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThis is \u003ci\u003e Sea of Solitude\u003c/i\u003e's primary gameplay mechanic. Kay has a backpack that she uses to collect swirling black substances, known as \"corruption,\" that infect balls of light that would otherwise light the region. She has a flare that acts as a very well-calibrated wayfinder, guiding her through cityscapes and seas by boat and foot. The game predominantly sticks to a basic formula of region exploration and corruption clearing, though each chapter plays with a different core puzzle mechanic—with varied levels of success. There's evasive swimming, enemy luring, mild maze running, and basic platforming. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"article__media\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1562303208445-Screenshot-2019-07-04-220628.png\" alt=\"Kay clearing away an area of corruption\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"article__image-caption\"\u003eImage by Jo-Mei Games\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese chapters are where the game deviates substantially from what I'd anticipated based off of trailers and early demos. Previews implied an ethos of solitary self-improvement or focused introspection with an ancillary cast of lovable NPCs—something that might live alongside \u003ci\u003e Celeste\u003c/i\u003e, the beautiful, challenging platformer about a young woman climbing a mountain that makes her depression and anxiety manifest in a bodily form. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInstead, chapters center around specific people Kay cares about who are experiencing forms of grief, estrangement, and suffering. Every few chapters focuses on their lives, and each of these sections resolves into a kind of parable. As a result, the game's focus can be more accurately characterized as Kay's difficulties with \"caregiver syndrome\"—learning how to be a more effective caretaker and support system, while realizing the toll it can personally take. In that sense, it's still centered on the personal experience of mental unwellness—a substitution I use here, because the game doesn't precisely label whether Kay has depression, anxiety, or another diagnosis, though she visibly struggles with feelings of worthlessness. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eNone of this alone is a value judgment. But the varied narrative focuses and individual episodes mean that \u003ci\u003e Sea of Solitude\u003c/i\u003e has to work harder to communicate a cohesive message than it would have, had these stories all been \u003ci\u003e about\u003c/i\u003e Kay, rather than people in her life. There's a chapter about childhood bullying and suicidal ideation, and a chapter about marital challenges. Each story is fairly robust on its own, and could plausibly all be tied together through Kay acting as a nexus—but they don't always cohere. With certain narratives imploring Kay to listen closer, while others tell her to let go, it can be a little difficult to track.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"article__media\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1562302708166-SOS_ScreenShot1.png\" alt=\"Kay sitting in her boat, looking at a giant bird-monster\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"article__image-caption\"\u003eImage by Jo-Mei Games\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e \u003cp\u003eThis is further complicated by the subtext of \"monstrosity\"—what constitutes monstrosity and what it means for \"monsters\" to be resolved back into human form. It would be easy to read the game as a metaphor about \"mental unwellness\" turning people into monsters, especially considering Kay herself is animated in the same style as these imposing enemies. But the deeper you get into the game, the more apparent it becomes that the conceit of monstrosity is meant to evoke the way mental illness can make us \u003ci\u003e feel \u003c/i\u003eas if we are monsters—can make us unrecognizable, even to ourselves. It's about the self-loathing, anger, and grief that can manifest at any moment, injecting sorrow into times you thought you felt fine, taking flight in intimidating forms. In \u003ci\u003e Sea of Solitude\u003c/i\u003e's strongest moments, it communicates this core emotional takeaway with lacerating, startling efficacy. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn an early level, after Kay has reached one of her first checkpoints and lit a region for the first time, a mountainous sea creature wearing a giant shell blocks her path, screaming \"You worthless piece of shit. You have no idea what you're doing, do you, as usual.\"\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn my playthrough, I cried. I wasn't expecting to. These are words I have told myself, profoundly disturbing as they are. They dredge up closely guarded kernels of self-loathing, in the same vein as \u003ci\u003e Celeste\u003c/i\u003e's main antagonist, who looks nearly identical to Madeline and taunts her in the moments she is most vulnerable. My depression both is and isn't me—it's not how I identify, but it's also not something I can separate from who I am. I do not know where it ends and I begin, nor do I think the distinction is healthy or helpful, because it would suggest I could depart from a part of myself or consider it impermanent. \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBut I do know that self-loathing can feel like a massive creature blocking my path. Sometimes it feels like the creature screaming these words at me is larger than I am, sometimes I cannot tell whether this creature is protecting or inhibiting me.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e Sea of Solitude\u003c/i\u003e's asserted commonality between the character I am playing as and the creature that is blocking my path, really gets at this deeply buried fear. Pair this with the studio’s deft hand at visual horror and the game produces goosebumps. These moments are incredibly effective, and these images will stay etched in my mind's eye for some time—a giggling girl in a yellow raincoat, morphed into devilish assailants with heads subsumed by large mouths of sharpened teeth. Exorcist-style floating humanoid forms with glowing eyes. A majestic, white wolf cracking into ice-y fragments. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBut I wanted the game to focus on these moments more, give them more breathing space, rather than focusing so much on dialogue and world building for episodic narratives that felt, at times, bloated with exposition. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eLike these narrative details, the gameplay mechanics were at times a bit \"overwritten.\" Some of the platforming isn't quite airtight, and can grow frustrating after repeated falls that force Kay to start at the bottom. Other times, Kay is penalized because she isn't standing in a specific region to siphon off a necessary in-game item, and the margin for error feels too large. Horror becomes slightly less effective when certain core puzzles and monsters remain static—as in the case of Kay's continual dodging of a large sea creature. It's easy to imagine the game could have shrugged off the responsibility of puzzles and platforming challenges completely, leaning entirely on its narrative and visual strengths in a primarily walking sim type format with basic corruption clearing mechanics.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese gameplay snags would not be so frustrating if the fundamental mystery at the heart of \u003ci\u003e Sea of Solitude \u003c/i\u003ewasn't so propulsive, urging you to move over its hurdles more quickly. My wish for more to do or explore is symptomatic of just how enticingly gorgeous the game's environment is. I cannot understate the joyous simplicity of just steering the boat around, or the awe inspiring spine tingles of splitting the water like Moses, or watching it form a gigantic bowl around me.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"article__media\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1562302863845-Screenshot-2019-07-04-220040.png\" alt=\"Kay, standing in between parted seas\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"article__image-caption\"\u003eImage by Jo-Mei Games\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe kind of story \u003ci\u003e Sea of Solitude\u003c/i\u003e is trying to tell is deeply ambitious. It's the kind of game that might take an indie studio numerous attempts, even with the support of a giant like EA. \u003ci\u003e Sea of Solitude\u003c/i\u003e may have drawbacks, but at the end of the day the game is still a stunning accomplishment. It's still a world I enjoyed spending time in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e Follow Nicole Clark on \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/nicalexiac\"

As with other carcinogens, it\u0026rsquo;s likely people mostly have to worry about long-term or very high amounts of benzene exposure. But spending time in a poorly ventilated and newly painted room could expose people to elevated benzene levels, the ACS states.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBenzene is one of a class of chemicals known as volatile organic compounds, or VOCs.

But \u003ca href=\"https://neuro.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.neuropsych.270101\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003eresearch\u003c/a\u003e has found that some of them can be absorbed into the blood through contact with the skin or through inhalation, and that they can accumulate in the brain or organs of those who are exposed. The liver also breaks down some of these chemicals into byproducts that can bind to and potentially interfere with a cell\u0026rsquo;s genetic material.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe take-home message from all this research is that paint is potentially toxic\u0026mdash;\u003ca href=\"https://toxtown.nlm.nih.gov/chemicals-and-contaminants/volatile-organic-compounds-vocs\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003eespecially for \u0026ldquo;vulnerable\u0026rdquo; groups\u003c/a\u003e such as pregnant women, young children and the elderly. VOC levels are usually much higher indoors than out, especially if those indoor areas are not well ventilated. And wet or drying paint\u0026mdash;particularly oil-based paints\u0026mdash;tend to emit a lot of VOCs, says Clifford Weisel, a professor at the Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences Institute of Rutgers University.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErin McCanlies, co-author of the recent autism study and an epidemiologist at the CDC\u0026rsquo;s National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, says water-based low- or zero-VOC paints\u0026mdash;which are now easy to find\u0026mdash;may be safer than older generations of pain. \u0026ldquo;However, paints may contain other chemicals such as binders, corrosion inhibitors and preservatives that may contribute to their toxicological properties,\u0026rdquo; she says. And \u003ca href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132314004120#!\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003eresearch\u003c/a\u003e has found that even zero-VOC paints still emit chemical gasses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, even if you\u0026rsquo;re using these, Weisel says it\u0026rsquo;s a good idea to open windows and doors and turn on a fan.

Grandstanding and finger-pointing at each other won\u0026rsquo;t solve problems. To accept that they are part of the problem might just make them better leaders. The mark of true leadership is whether it can transform a crisis into an opportunity that serves a wider cause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYoung activists are going to be tested.

In Taiwan, batteries can be swapped at kiosks found at gas stations and more offbeat locations, including retail stores and cafes. GoShare scooters can use the same kiosks as privately-owned Gogoro vehicles. This means that users can keep riding the same vehicle all day, swapping batteries whenever necessary (on average, Gogoro scooters can travel about 80 km on one charge).

They were plagued by some of the common stumbles of first-generation earbuds with no cable between them — connection dropouts, audio delay when watching video, and so-so battery life — and the promised noise cancellation failed to measure up to Sony’s popular 1000X headphone series. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"mwxqAm\"\u003eBut Sony is back. The new \u003ca href=\"https://www.sony.com/electronics/truly-wireless/wf-1000xm3\"\u003eWF-1000XM3 earbuds\u003c/a\u003e, launching in August for $229.99, address many of my complaints about the original product. They fit better, look nicer, exhibit very little signal loss, and have improved battery life. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"8hhXbD\"\u003e(If you’re wondering, there was never a WF-1000XM2. While Sony says it doesn’t discuss its product naming process, the obvious explanation is that it’s trying to keep parity with the 1000X headphone line, which is currently on M3. So we skipped right over M2. Okay, sure. Names mean nothing.) \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-wide-block\"\u003e  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TiUy4pFwFiYjO_b4F3xoZhEZHyA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18279739/cwelch_190702_3528_0008.jpg\"\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p--has-dropcap\" id=\"STcW1E\"\u003eThe M3s have a much cleaner, more professional, and all-around sleeker look than their shiny predecessors. The Sony logo and microphone inlet are adorned with rose gold / copper accents, so these earbuds look at home when sitting next to the 1000XM3 headphones. Sony continues to supply plenty of ear tips to help you find the ideal fit. There are seven options in all, including the comfortable foam-like ones I’ve been using. The little nub / wing from the original WF-1000X that hooked into your ear’s concha is gone, but I haven't missed it and find the M3s to fit securely without causing discomfort over time. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"3UxB0G\"\u003eEach earbud has a circular area for touch controls: you adjust noise cancellation with the left earbud and audio playback with the right. Tapping the left earbud toggles between noise cancellation and ambient sound mode, which pipes in outside audio. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"DA1QYO\"\u003eSony has brought over the clever Quick Attention mode from its 1000X headphones: resting your finger over the left earbud temporarily activates ambient audio for however long you hold it there; once you let go, the noise cancellation comes right back. This is useful if you need to hear a plane announcement or quickly pay for something at the coffee shop. \u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aLRwLEG2nKkFSXeCN7zhMsqODGE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18279736/cwelch_190702_3528_0006.jpg\"\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"naDhmD\"\u003eOn the right earbud, you get the standard music controls: tap once to pause / play, twice to skip to the next song, and three times to go back. Nowhere on the M3 earbuds will you find volume controls, so you’ll need to do that via your device or with your voice assistant of choice, which can be accessed by tapping and holding the right earbud’s touchpad. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-float-right c-float-hang\"\u003e\u003caside id=\"KHWPTN\"\u003e\u003cq\u003eThere’s one major strike against the WF-1000XM3\u003c/q\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"R32QOR\"\u003eSony says it has improved the active noise cancellation on the M3s compared to the original WF-1000X, and I can attest to that. Whereas the first model felt like it offered little over the noise isolation you get with a good earbud seal, here the effect is definitely more pronounced and noticeable. I still don’t think it’s on par with full-size headphones; matching that level of NC seems like an extraordinary challenge. But what Sony has done here makes all the difference on a crowded subway train or busy city street. The company told me it added a second noise-canceling mic to each earbud, and Sony’s QN1e processor is also behind some of the improvements. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"cd3Zgo\"\u003eThanks to a new Bluetooth chipset inside, each of the two earbuds makes its own simultaneous connection to your phone. There’s no linked system where one earbud is at the mercy of the other, which was common among early true wireless earbuds. This means you can use either Sony M3 earbud by itself for listening to audio or making voice calls while the other is charging inside the case. It also \u003cem\u003edrastically\u003c/em\u003e cuts down on audio lag when watching videos since there’s no longer that relay from one earbud to the other. It’s now to the point where any lip sync delay is unnoticeable. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"PzWvls\"\u003eBattery life is rated at six hours on a charge with noise cancellation enabled. If you turn it off, that extends to eight hours. The case holds enough extra juice to allow for a total of 24 hours of listening (after repeated top-offs) with the noise-canceling feature or 32 hours with it off. Sony says you can get 90 minutes of playback with a 10-minute charge over USB-C. (No, the M3s don’t include wireless charging.) \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-wide-block\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"c-image-grid\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-image-grid__item\"\u003e  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a2Ol0J-O6sW1PwuvoXPBBDrB7Pc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18279734/cwelch_190702_3528_0004.jpg\"\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-image-grid__item\"\u003e  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/05lyqIVYI1sFdaHzF4Pv1Iz9jgo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18279735/cwelch_190702_3528_0005.jpg\"\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p--has-dropcap\" id=\"ScC2JB\"\u003eThe charging case is rather nice, coming in at around the same height as Apple’s AirPods case but quite a bit wider. Still, I like how the earbuds snugly drop into place and are held in magnetically. There’s zero chance of putting these in the case and having one of them fail to charge, which is a frustration I’ve encountered with my PowerBeats Pro. This is down to personal taste, but I also like Sony’s use of numerous lights (one on each earbud and the case itself) to clearly indicate charging status. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"tsOulp\"\u003eWhen the earbuds are paired — you can only pair to one device at a time — and in use, that hidden LED inside the earbuds will occasionally blink blue. It’s not something you’ll notice when wearing them, but others might. As with many other wireless earbuds these days, removing one of them will automatically pause audio until you put it back in your ear. \u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tObd4MUpc9P4gBkfWWqs62tlOVQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18279741/cwelch_190702_3528_0010.jpg\"\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"VSjK3c\"\u003eSo far I’ve been happy with the sound from Sony’s M3s. But it should be noted that I’ve been using a preproduction sample over the last week or so. \u003cem\u003eThe Verge\u003c/em\u003e doesn’t review non-final hardware, so Sony is sending over a final pair of the M3 earbuds very soon, and I’ll be back with a review score and final thoughts before long. But with this unit, I’ve barely noticed any connection dropouts — even in trouble spots and intersections where true wireless earbuds can frequently struggle. That’s a big turnaround from Sony’s first try. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"WRLRoN\"\u003eFor codecs, Sony supports AAC and SBC on the M3s but not the company’s own higher-res LDAC. Nonetheless, Sony still claims you’ll be hearing top-notch sound thanks to “24-bit audio signal processing” and its “Digital Sound Enhancement Engine HX” upscaling for lossy music. I won’t weigh in on the technical jargon, but my early tests have been positive. Whether I’m listening to The National, Carly Rae Jepsen, Jason Isbell, Maggie Rogers, or Lizzo, the M3s are proving plenty capable, with ample bass, good separation, and the ability to juggle genres without issue. I’ll hold a final sound verdict for the review.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-wide-block\"\u003e  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_MJNljjxLDVvZ03kBbWWJRhOM14=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18279740/cwelch_190702_3528_0009.jpg\"\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"s9u3ys\"\u003eUnfortunately, there’s one significant strike against the WF-1000XM3 earbuds: they’re not sweat or water-resistant. Bafflingly, Sony is going to market in the summer with a set of earbuds that aren’t technically cut out for exercise or coming with you on a run — or even if you just break a sweat on a hot day. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"aDVcsh\"\u003eA Sony spokesperson noted that the team “did not hear any complaints from the previous model for breaking from using at the gym.” The original model also lacked an official water-resistance rating. But for $230, this is borderline unacceptable. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"c-end-para\" id=\"NTHZ3E\"\u003eSony’s 1000XM3 earbuds will face stiff competition out of the gate. For a little more money, there are the Powerbeats Pro and Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless. For a little less, you’ll find a wide field including second-gen AirPods, Jabra’s Elite 65ts, Galaxy Buds, and plenty of other choices. But if you can get over the lack of rated sweat resistance, I can definitely see the appeal of what Sony has come up with — especially for the frequent flyers among you. If you’re itching to know something as I spend more time with these earbuds or there’s anything I haven’t covered, I’d love to hear your questions in the comments. \u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ujwf4r1sU0qxZEorKsBEAgOCrZg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18279731/cwelch_190702_3528_0001.jpg\"\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"MqpnuV\"\u003e\u003cem\u003ePhotography by Chris Welch / The Verge\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"agOEcs\"\u003e\u003csmall\u003e\u003cem\u003eVox Media has affiliate partnerships.

First, he would have asked attendees if they are “concerned about climate breakdown.” Then, to raise their hands if they are “EXTREMELY CONCERNED” about it. In the third slide, Kalmus would have asked panel-goers to raise their hands if they agreed with a simple statement: “Fossil fuel causes harm.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe never got the chance. Last Wednesday, the day before he was scheduled to appear, Kalmus was disinvited from what the oil giant billed as “an action-oriented day of dialogue focused on accelerating the energy transition.” For those curious about what spooked them, The Intercept is publishing Kalmus’s contraband slideshow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                \u003cdiv id='dcv-6181660-20190627-Shell-Talk' class='document-cloud-container' data-linking='documentcloud' data-permalink='https://theintercept.com/?post_type=document\u0026p=257426'\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n                \u003cscript\u003e\n                    DV.load('//www.documentcloud.org/documents/6181660-20190627-Shell-Talk.js', {\n                        width: '100%',\n                        height: '450',\n                        sidebar: false,\n                        container: '#dcv-6181660-20190627-Shell-Talk'\n                    });\n                \u003c/script\u003e\n            \n\u003cp\u003eKalmus, who lives in Los Angeles, specializes in ecological forecasting and analyzing boundary layer clouds. Thanks in part to that research, he’s extremely concerned about climate breakdown, and relatively outspoken about it. In 2017, Kalmus authored a book, \u0026#8220;Being the Change: Live Well and Spark a Climate Revolution,\u0026#8221; on what individuals can do in their own lives to move off fossil fuels. Since then, he’s been an enthusiastic supporter of the Sunrise Movement, Extinction Rebellion, and climate strikers, groups that are pushing for a rapid transition away from fossil fuels. Given all that, he was more than a little surprised when he was asked in early May to give the speech at a one-day conference Shell was hosting in San Francisco, one of three Powering Progress Together events planned around the world. The conference is geared toward industry members, as well as those in the clean energy business and environmental groups.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wasn’t their first choice. Another well-known climate scientist, Katharine Hayhoe, had been invited to speak but wasn’t able to attend, and she suggested Kalmus go in her place. The topic was one they’d both spent ample time researching: “Mobilizing Society to Change the Way Energy Is Used.” Kalmus had already planned to be at an academic conference nearby, so he agreed — with some caveats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There were some things I just had to say and I couldn’t get around it,” he told me by phone. “We just have to be realistic about where we’re at if we’re going to make progress. That means acknowledging that they’ve known since before 1988 \u0026#8212; with a remarkable degree of precision and accuracy \u0026#8212; what continuing business as usual in fossil fuel-burning is going to do to human civilization and ecosystems. They tried to hide from the public.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If they really want to be the good guys, they’ve got to acknowledge that and make some serious changes. I didn’t see any way I could speak at their conference without laying that out,” he told The Intercept.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Dutch journalist Jelmer Mommers revealed last year, Shell has \u003ca href=\"https://insideclimatenews.org/news/05042018/shell-knew-scientists-climate-change-risks-fossil-fuels-global-warming-company-documents-netherlands-lawsuits\"\u003eknown\u003c/a\u003e about the climate crisis for nearly four decades and its own considerable role in causing it. Company researchers warned in 1986 that “the energy industry needs to consider how it should play its part\u0026#8221; before it became \u0026#8220;too late to take effective countermeasures to reduce the effects or even to stabilize the situation.\u0026#8221; For the next several decades, Shell did precisely the opposite, joining other fossil fuel companies in formations like the now-defunct Global Climate Coalition to cast doubt on climate change and delay action at nearly every level of government, all the while exploring for and extracting as much oil and gas as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKalmus explained to organizers of the event that he wouldn’t shy away from criticisms. Just two weeks ago, he told them, “‘I might not be the right fit for your conference.’ I told them on the phone that I was going to have to say some of these things. I said you can’t censor me. And they agreed to that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast week, he headed up from Los Angeles to the Bay Area as planned, having spent over a month wrestling with what to include in the presentation and, as he put it, “how to give this talk to this different tribe.” Shell asked him to submit his slides for the event in advance, so they could upload them into the venue’s AV system. He sent them over Tuesday night. The next day, while driving up the coast, he got a call from the event organizers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class='stylized pull-right'data-shortcode-type='pullquote' data-pull='right'\u003eKalmus spent over a month wrestling with what to include in the presentation and, as he put it, “how to give this talk to this different tribe.”\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They said, ‘You were right. They don’t think that you fit into our conference,\u0026#8217;” Kalmus said. Planning and logistics for the confab were largely being handled by a co-convening organization called SustainAbility. His guess is that while SustainAbility staffers had green-lit his talk, conversations with the company about his slides led to his ousting from the program. In withdrawing the invitation, event organizers mentioned that there were several Shell employees interested in speaking with him — they just didn’t want to put him on stage. “I’d be happy to talk to them,” Kalmus said. Shell has not responded to The Intercept’s request for comment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatherine White, a business professor at the University of British Columbia who researches consumer behavior and sustainability, was supposed to appear alongside Kalmus; each would give a brief talk before answering questions from a moderator. On Wednesday, White got an email suggesting that Kalmus backed out. “They didn’t say to me, ‘We looked at Peter’s slides and decided he won’t be speaking.’”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, Kalmus’s \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/ClimateHuman/status/1144077932924563457\"\u003etweet\u003c/a\u003e explaining that he’d been disinvited went viral, and the conference organizers felt they needed to address the issue. SustainAbility Executive Director Mark Lee and Shell Projects and Technology Director Harry Brekelmans kicked off the opening plenary by discussing why Kalmus wasn’t there, then opened the session up to questions from audience members and reporters. According to White, who attended the session, Lee and Brekelmans had hoped that Kalmus would have stuck more strictly to his academic research. “What they said is that when they saw his slides, there was about half [his research] and about half talking about history.

Shell has an ugly history of fueling climate denial and pushed aggressively to delay action at the local, state, and international levels. What the slides also point out is that — despite its knowledge of how big the crisis is — Shell “has made no significant shift away from developing fossil fuel” and continued to lobby against rapid mitigation. Bringing the company in line with climate goals would require, in his words, planning “to really transition to carbon-free energy and become a market leader” and preparing “for substantial voluntary transition away from fossil fuels” as a means of regaining public trust. Kalmus also suggested that Shell refrain from making any policy recommendations on lowering emissions, instead focusing on changing its own practices: “Anything you recommend will set the activists against it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike many other multinational oil companies, Shell is attempting to cast itself as a good-faith player in decarbonization and stake a claim to climate policymaking. The company has made recent investments in renewables and even created its own “Sky Scenario,” a pathway for achieving the goals set out in the United Nations Paris Agreement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut as Democratic presidential candidates haggle over how soon the U.S. should decarbonize — by 2030 or 2050 — Shell last year offered a more lenient target: 2070. As climate modeler Glen Peters pointed out when the company’s scenario was released, it isn’t wildly out of step with a lot of relatively mainstream climate modeling, in that it’s wildly optimistic about the ability of unproven technologies to suck carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and pick up the slack in the carbon budget of continued fossil fuel emissions. The upshot? If Shell\u0026#8217;s models invest enough faith in still mostly speculative technologies, it can keep drilling for oil and gas for decades to come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"shortcode\" data-shortcode=\"newsletter\" data-campaign=\"\" data-cta=\"\" data-headline=\"\" data-layout=\"\" data-subhead=\"\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePowering Progress Together comes as Shell invests $300 million in “natural ecosystems” and pledged late last year to put \u003ca href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/dec/26/shell-says-it-wants-to-double-green-energy-investment\"\u003e$4 billion\u003c/a\u003e into renewable in the coming years.

Além disso, revelam os diálogos, comportou-se como chefe do Ministério Público Federal, posição incompatível com a neutralidade exigida para um magistrado. Na privacidade dos chats, Moro revisou peças dos procuradores e até dava broncas neles. “O juiz deve aplicar a lei porque na Terra quem manda é a lei.

Skornicki tornou-se delator na Lava-Jato, e confessou que pagou propinas a vários funcionários da estatal, entre eles, Eduardo Musa, mencionado por Deltan na conversa. “Laura no caso do Zwi, Moro disse que tem um depósito em favor do Musa e se for por lapso que não foi incluído ele disse que vai receber amanhã e dá tempo. Só é bom avisar ele”, diz. “Ih, vou ver”, responde a procuradora. No dia seguinte, o MPF incluiu um comprovante de depósito de 80 000 dólares feito por Skornicki a Musa.

No Longer Avoid Iran’s Airspace despite US Warning","content":"\u003cp\u003eSiavosh Amir Mokri, who heads Iran Airports and Air Navigation Company, said on Thursday that the number of flights using Iranian-controlled skies above the Persian Gulf and the Sea of Oman had increased over the past several days to reach its normal level of 840 flights a day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe official said the increased use of the airspace came despite a notam (Notice to Airmen) issued by US Federal Aviation Administration on June 21 which banned flights from using skies above the region.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe notam came after Iran shot down an intruding American drone which officials said had violated the country’s airspace above the Persian Gulf waters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe move caused a serious escalation in military tensions between Iran and the United States and caused major airlines, including British Airways, KLM and Lufthansa, to follow the FAA instructions and stop to use the Iranian airspace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, Amir Mokri said carriers had reversed the decision as they have noticed that security in the Persian Gulf has been restored. He said that returning to the Iranian airspace would also be more economic for the airlines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That tension is gone and airline companies have understood that the country’s airspace is still safe,” he said, adding that the number of international flights using the Iranian airspace had decreased to 800 a day, down five percent, since the downing of the US drone by Iran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe official said Iran had lodged an official complaint with the International Civil Aviation Organization over the FAA notam as it inflicted losses on the country. He said Iran’s total revenues from overflight fees in the last Iranian calendar year which ended in March topped $180 million.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe post \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ifpnews.com/wired/airlines-no-longer-avoid-irans-airspace-despite-us-warning/\"\u003eAirlines No Longer Avoid Iran\u0026#8217;s Airspace despite US Warning\u003c/a\u003e appeared first on \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ifpnews.com\"\u003eIran Front Page\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://ifpnews.com/wired/airlines-no-longer-avoid-irans-airspace-despite-us-warning/","published":"2019-07-05T09:44:52Z","guid":"https://ifpnews.com/?p=145375"}]},{"url":"https://blog.wan-ifra.org/feed/index.rss","items":[{"title":"Storytelling at the heart of East African digital monetisation","content":"","url":"https://blog.wan-ifra.org/2019/07/05/storytelling-at-the-heart-of-east-african-digital-monetisation","published":"2019-07-05T08:19:16Z","guid":"19226 at https://blog.wan-ifra.org"}]},{"url":"https://smallwarsjournal.com/rss/blogs","items":[{"title":"Pakistan PM to Be First Head of State to Meet Taliban","content":"","url":"https://smallwarsjournal.com/blog/pakistan-pm-be-first-head-state-meet-taliban","published":"2019-07-05T04:11:11Z","guid":"122946 at https://smallwarsjournal.com"},{"title":"Squeezed by U.S. Sanctions, Iran Shifts From Patience to Confrontation","content":"","url":"https://smallwarsjournal.com/blog/squeezed-us-sanctions-iran-shifts-patience-confrontation","published":"2019-07-05T04:09:50Z","guid":"122945 at https://smallwarsjournal.com"}]},{"url":"https://cloutwork.com/feed","items":[{"title":"Samsung’s earnings were likely hit by Huawei but boosted by Apple","content":"\u003cimg width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://cloutwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/akrales_190307_3272_0049.0-150x150.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" /\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O0OV0M9b4u9-5uJlIWZK9NvfJmY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/64674776/akrales_190307_3272_0049.0.jpg\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSamsung Electronics expects its second-quarter operating profit to have more than halved from a year previously, falling about 56 percent to 6.5 trillion won ($5.56 billion), according to earnings guidance released by the company today.
