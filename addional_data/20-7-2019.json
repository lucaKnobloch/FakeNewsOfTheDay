The future is about integrating the two in a way that builds technical proficiency informed by a sense of humanness.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0026#8217;re in the midst of big platform shifts happening in the technology ecosystem which in many ways have already changed our lives. Machines are reaching, and sometimes exceeding, human performance on tasks.

It’s our responsibility to shape our society in a way that is inclusive and adaptive to change. The varied subjects that comprise the liberal arts help us think critically about both the implications and opportunities of the technology that our society is advancing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eCoding enables me to be more structured in my thinking.

Leaders of institutions of higher education are responsible for bringing the right combination of arts, sciences, and technology to students, be they future engineers or poets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the main reasons I left New York for Silicon Valley is because the valley is a place where the entire culture drives creation.

Fish populations flourished, and the water was so clean that a massive fishing industry exploded. Fast-forward about 10 generations: The reefs have been virtually extinct for more than a century, and the murky waters garner many a comedic jabs from locals. Nitrogen buildup from agricultural pollution and rainwater runoff has caused a lack of oxygen in the waters surrounding the city, thereby killing any animal life, and overharvesting devastated the remaining population. While the harbor remains one of the busiest ports, you’re more likely to see a booze cruise circling Manhattan Island rather than a flotilla of fishing boats. Pose the idea of swimming in the Hudson River, and you’ll be looked at as if you have two heads. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMalinowski recognized this long before launching a nonprofit. Oysters, as well as other shellfish like clams, are superefficient filter feeders. They pump water through their bodies for food, and in the process they remove excess nitrogen from waters by incorporating it into their shells and tissue as they grow. It slowly cleans up the water, allowing for other live organisms to survive on the increased oxygen levels and, over time, hopefully rebuild an ecosystem. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image00003.jpeg?w=1000\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2666008\" srcset=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image00003.jpeg 1000w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image00003.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image00003.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image00003.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image00003.jpeg?resize=281,187 281w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image00003.jpeg?resize=754,503 754w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image00003.jpeg?resize=100,67 100w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image00003.jpeg?resize=60,40 60w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image00003.jpeg?resize=154,103 154w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image00003.jpeg?resize=591,394 591w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image00003.jpeg?resize=392,261 392w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image00003.jpeg?resize=252,168 252w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image00003.jpeg?resize=697,465 697w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image00003.jpeg?resize=234,156 234w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image00003.jpeg?resize=500,333 500w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image00003.jpeg?resize=578,385 578w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image00003.jpeg?resize=600,400 600w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image00003.jpeg?resize=90,60 90w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image00003.jpeg?resize=184,123 184w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image00003.jpeg?resize=115,77 115w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image00003.jpeg?resize=738,492 738w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image00003.jpeg?resize=777,518 777w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMore than 10 years ago, while teaching aquaculture at the New York Harbor School, Malinowski began having his students plant oysters as part of the curriculum. He and then program director Murray Fisher, who is now chairman of the board of the Billion Oyster Project, shared a passion for education through restoration. Not only did they notice how students changed their perspectives toward the environment of their own backyard, but the pair also saw how it made a measurable difference in the waterways. That’s when they decided it was time to launch something bigger, and the Billion Oyster Project was officially born.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe process of rebuilding the oyster population and increasing oxygen levels in polluted waters is not straightforward. Oysters cannot just be dumped into the waters with hopes for the best. Baby oysters spend their first few weeks as free-swimming larvae, but then they look for a hard substrate to which they can attach. That’s where the reefs come in. In order for their idea to succeed, Malinowski would have to add not only live oysters to the harbor but also reefs for them to live on. As it turns out, a discarded oyster shell makes the perfect substrate, rich in calcium carbonate, for baby oysters to make home. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s incredibly difficult to find a bulk source of oyster shell in the Northeast,” explains Madeline Wachtel, deputy director of the Billion Oyster Project. She oversees the shell collection program, which reallocates approximately 385,000 pounds of would-be-discarded restaurant oyster shells from the landfill to the harbor. In fact, the program started after a suggestion from chef Ben Pollinger at Oceana. He offered to save his extra shells for the team if they picked them up; there is no way to utilize them after the plate returns to the kitchen. “Shells are highly valuable to restoration work but are currently treated as waste and shipped to distant landfills,” says Wachtel. “Our restaurant partnerships are now critical to our success.” Participating restaurants run the gamut from neighborhood spots like The East Pole and P.J. Clarke’s to the Michelin-ranked Gramercy Tavern and world-class hospitality brands like the Mandarin Oriental New York. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1-Hotel-CPW-189-e1562848762470.jpg?w=768\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2666015\" srcset=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1-Hotel-CPW-189-e1562848762470.jpg 2250w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1-Hotel-CPW-189-e1562848762470.jpg?resize=113,150 113w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1-Hotel-CPW-189-e1562848762470.jpg?resize=225,300 225w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1-Hotel-CPW-189-e1562848762470.jpg?resize=768,1024 768w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1-Hotel-CPW-189-e1562848762470.jpg?resize=159,212 159w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1-Hotel-CPW-189-e1562848762470.jpg?resize=377,503 377w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1-Hotel-CPW-189-e1562848762470.jpg?resize=75,100 75w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1-Hotel-CPW-189-e1562848762470.jpg?resize=45,60 45w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1-Hotel-CPW-189-e1562848762470.jpg?resize=116,154 116w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1-Hotel-CPW-189-e1562848762470.jpg?resize=810,1080 810w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1-Hotel-CPW-189-e1562848762470.jpg?resize=296,394 296w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1-Hotel-CPW-189-e1562848762470.jpg?resize=392,523 392w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1-Hotel-CPW-189-e1562848762470.jpg?resize=126,168 126w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1-Hotel-CPW-189-e1562848762470.jpg?resize=349,465 349w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1-Hotel-CPW-189-e1562848762470.jpg?resize=117,156 117w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1-Hotel-CPW-189-e1562848762470.jpg?resize=250,333 250w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1-Hotel-CPW-189-e1562848762470.jpg?resize=289,385 289w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1-Hotel-CPW-189-e1562848762470.jpg?resize=600,800 600w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1-Hotel-CPW-189-e1562848762470.jpg?resize=90,120 90w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1-Hotel-CPW-189-e1562848762470.jpg?resize=92,123 92w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1-Hotel-CPW-189-e1562848762470.jpg?resize=115,153 115w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1-Hotel-CPW-189-e1562848762470.jpg?resize=369,492 369w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1-Hotel-CPW-189-e1562848762470.jpg?resize=389,518 389w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1-Hotel-CPW-189-e1562848762470.jpg?resize=1122,1496 1122w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1-Hotel-CPW-189-e1562848762470.jpg?resize=840,1120 840w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1-Hotel-CPW-189-e1562848762470.jpg?resize=687,916 687w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1-Hotel-CPW-189-e1562848762470.jpg?resize=414,552 414w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1-Hotel-CPW-189-e1562848762470.jpg?resize=354,472 354w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2250px) 100vw, 2250px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eJAMS Restaurant at 1 Hotel Central Park, New York, N.Y.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt JAMS, executive chef Ginger Pierce explained that they blow through about 200 oyster shells a day, which weekly amounts to 1,400 shells. The restaurant focuses on ways to drive down waste, from composting food waste to hosting an annual zero-waste dinner called \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/1-hotel-central-park/a-supper-that-sustains-us/347528319222976/\"\u003eA Supper That Sustains Us\u003c/a\u003e, which donates 100% of its proceeds. Part of that is an organic waste digester that sits in the corner of the kitchen, but oyster shells cannot be processed. It was heartbreaking to see them sent off in the dumpster. By partnering with the Billion Oyster Project, Pierce says, they can keep them out of landfills. It takes work on her end and, possibly more important, space for buckets of oyster shells to sit each week. But the tradeoffs are worth it to her team. “It’s pretty incredible,” she says of the nonprofit. “They are offsetting waste by giving something that would otherwise be discarded a second life.

The team regularly tests the waters and has consistently seen that oysters reduce local nitrogen levels around the reefs by 21% in the course of 60 minutes. Water continuously flows in and out, so there is always more nitrogen to be removed. Additionally, they monitor the biodiversity of the reefs and have seen an increase in the number and types of animals—everything from worms and anemones to large fish—present after a reef is installed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMalinowski is quick to point out that oysters won’t entirely resolve the issues in the harbor but do make steps toward success. “Harbor-wide nitrogen is a much larger issue that will be solved by upstream solutions, like removing the inputs,” says Malinowski. Untreated wastewater from New York City, pollution from rainfall, and, of course, legal restrictions have all posed challenges for the project as well. “Building reefs requires permission from several local, state, and federal agencies,” he adds. “These permits are not only challenging to obtain but require us to reduce the scale of our installations.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image00002.jpeg?w=1000\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2666007\" srcset=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image00002.jpeg 1000w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image00002.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image00002.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image00002.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image00002.jpeg?resize=281,187 281w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image00002.jpeg?resize=754,503 754w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image00002.jpeg?resize=100,67 100w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image00002.jpeg?resize=60,40 60w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image00002.jpeg?resize=154,103 154w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image00002.jpeg?resize=591,394 591w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image00002.jpeg?resize=392,261 392w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image00002.jpeg?resize=252,168 252w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image00002.jpeg?resize=697,465 697w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image00002.jpeg?resize=234,156 234w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image00002.jpeg?resize=500,333 500w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image00002.jpeg?resize=578,385 578w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image00002.jpeg?resize=600,400 600w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image00002.jpeg?resize=90,60 90w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image00002.jpeg?resize=184,123 184w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image00002.jpeg?resize=115,77 115w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image00002.jpeg?resize=738,492 738w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image00002.jpeg?resize=777,518 777w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe nonprofit does take its mission beyond its hands-on work on the water. It is currently advocating for a bill in the Ways and Means Committee of the Assembly that would give a tax credit of $0.10 a pound to restaurants and organizations that donate oyster shells. Currently there is no tax incentive for the businesses involved in the shell collection program—it’s all done out of the kindness of their heart and desire to be part of a closed-loop system that benefits the health of their own backyard. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFurther, Malinowski continues to educate. He partners with other organizations working in the harbor, including the NYC Parks Department, Bronx River Alliance, and the New York/New Jersey Baykeeper as well as the city’s public schools. “We want learning about the harbor and oyster restoration to be a reality for the 1.1 million public school students in NYC,” he says. “We hope to be working with 200 schools by 2024.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs for those billion oysters? That’s likely a few decades in the future, but Malinoski remains committed. If, annually, his group can restore 25 million oysters on five acres of reef, plus make improvements to breeding with a state-of-the-art hatchery and restoration facility, he believes they will be capable of reaching that scale. The organization’s goal, after all, states that “by 2035, one billion live oysters will be distributed around 100 acres of reefs, making the harbor once again the most productive waterbody in the North Atlantic.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eConsumers can help too. Simply eat oysters at partner restaurants, and you’ll know those discarded shells are gaining a second life. In the future, Malinowski notes, New York City just may be the oyster capital of the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eMore must-read stories from \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—\u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/2019/05/12/oil-gas-corporate-rebranding-climate-change/\"\u003e\u0026#8216;Oil\u0026#8217; and \u0026#8216;gas\u0026#8217; are out:\u003c/a\u003e How energy firms are rebranding for the climate change era\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—How viable are AOC’s \u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/2019/05/14/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-green-new-deal-energy-europe/\"\u003eGreen New Deal energy proposals\u003c/a\u003e?

With the first Equinox Hotel now open, the company has outlined aspirations to bring the concept to Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, and Houston.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe move comes amid boom times for the hospitality sector. From 2009 to 2017, U.S. hotel gross bookings surged from $116 billion to $185 billion, and demand for the sector outpaced growth for airlines, restaurants, and cruise ships, according to a 2019 hospitality and travel \u003ca href=\"https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/consumer-business/us-consumer-2019-us-travel-and-hospitality-outlook.pdf\"\u003ereport\u003c/a\u003e by Deloitte. Hospitality is so hot that brands like \u003ca href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/story/why-brands-like-west-elm-and-restoration-hardware-are-opening-hotels\"\u003eRestoration Hardware, West Elm\u003c/a\u003e, and even fast-food purveyor \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/05/16/taco-bell-hotel-palm-springs/\"\u003eTaco Bell\u003c/a\u003e have jumped in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eEquinox had thought about opening a hotel before the recession, but cooled to the idea when businesses and consumers cut back on their travel spending. Lately though, a greater societal focus on health and wellness inspired Equinox to revive the concept. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“We are already in the hospitality business—we already serve our members and their needs on a daily basis,” says Harvey Spevak, executive chairman and managing partner at Equinox. “Our members are saying, ‘We love Equinox, we love the experience, give us more.’” \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Equinox-Hudson-Yards_IndoorPool.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2668949\" srcset=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Equinox-Hudson-Yards_IndoorPool.jpg 2139w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Equinox-Hudson-Yards_IndoorPool.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Equinox-Hudson-Yards_IndoorPool.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Equinox-Hudson-Yards_IndoorPool.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Equinox-Hudson-Yards_IndoorPool.jpg?resize=1024,683 1024w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Equinox-Hudson-Yards_IndoorPool.jpg?resize=281,187 281w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Equinox-Hudson-Yards_IndoorPool.jpg?resize=755,503 755w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Equinox-Hudson-Yards_IndoorPool.jpg?resize=100,67 100w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Equinox-Hudson-Yards_IndoorPool.jpg?resize=60,40 60w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Equinox-Hudson-Yards_IndoorPool.jpg?resize=154,103 154w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Equinox-Hudson-Yards_IndoorPool.jpg?resize=591,394 591w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Equinox-Hudson-Yards_IndoorPool.jpg?resize=392,261 392w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Equinox-Hudson-Yards_IndoorPool.jpg?resize=252,168 252w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Equinox-Hudson-Yards_IndoorPool.jpg?resize=697,465 697w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Equinox-Hudson-Yards_IndoorPool.jpg?resize=234,156 234w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Equinox-Hudson-Yards_IndoorPool.jpg?resize=500,333 500w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Equinox-Hudson-Yards_IndoorPool.jpg?resize=578,385 578w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Equinox-Hudson-Yards_IndoorPool.jpg?resize=600,400 600w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Equinox-Hudson-Yards_IndoorPool.jpg?resize=90,60 90w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Equinox-Hudson-Yards_IndoorPool.jpg?resize=185,123 185w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Equinox-Hudson-Yards_IndoorPool.jpg?resize=115,77 115w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Equinox-Hudson-Yards_IndoorPool.jpg?resize=738,492 738w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Equinox-Hudson-Yards_IndoorPool.jpg?resize=777,518 777w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2139px) 100vw, 2139px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eThe indoor pool at the Equinox Hotel Hudson Yards.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile on a tour with Norton, I found myself slightly disoriented when we entered the Equinox Fitness Club. The hotel wasn’t even open to the public, and yet the club was filled with toned and tanned New Yorkers. “Wildstar,” by Italian artist Giorgio Moroder, pulsated as we walked beside the glistening interior pool. A yoga class we passed was full, and soon we were standing on the outdoor terrace, which provides a sweeping, breathtaking view of the Hudson River and downtown New York. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd at this point, my mind lingered on the hotel gyms I’ve visited over the past decade. Often dark, with few fellow guests—basically the antithesis of what I was seeing at Equinox. Guests at the hotel become club members for the duration of their stays. There’s even a large screen behind the concierge that lists upcoming Equinox fitness classes. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“They can’t replicate this,” says Norton of his competition. “You aren’t on a treadmill in a dark room.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo while their rooms don’t contain gyms, Equinox Hotels will feature fitness centers that serve travelers as well as locals. But the price of that monthly gym membership is already tough for many New Yorkers to stomach, and staying at a hotel for $700 per night may be out of reach for even the most hard-core fitness lovers. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/EQUINOX_model_07_RGB_V1.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2668955\" srcset=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/EQUINOX_model_07_RGB_V1.jpg 7000w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/EQUINOX_model_07_RGB_V1.jpg?resize=150,105 150w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/EQUINOX_model_07_RGB_V1.jpg?resize=300,211 300w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/EQUINOX_model_07_RGB_V1.jpg?resize=768,539 768w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/EQUINOX_model_07_RGB_V1.jpg?resize=1024,719 1024w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/EQUINOX_model_07_RGB_V1.jpg?resize=281,197 281w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/EQUINOX_model_07_RGB_V1.jpg?resize=717,503 717w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/EQUINOX_model_07_RGB_V1.jpg?resize=100,70 100w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/EQUINOX_model_07_RGB_V1.jpg?resize=60,42 60w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/EQUINOX_model_07_RGB_V1.jpg?resize=154,108 154w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/EQUINOX_model_07_RGB_V1.jpg?resize=1539,1080 1539w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/EQUINOX_model_07_RGB_V1.jpg?resize=561,394 561w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/EQUINOX_model_07_RGB_V1.jpg?resize=392,275 392w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/EQUINOX_model_07_RGB_V1.jpg?resize=239,168 239w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/EQUINOX_model_07_RGB_V1.jpg?resize=663,465 663w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/EQUINOX_model_07_RGB_V1.jpg?resize=222,156 222w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/EQUINOX_model_07_RGB_V1.jpg?resize=474,333 474w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/EQUINOX_model_07_RGB_V1.jpg?resize=549,385 549w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/EQUINOX_model_07_RGB_V1.jpg?resize=600,421 600w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/EQUINOX_model_07_RGB_V1.jpg?resize=90,63 90w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/EQUINOX_model_07_RGB_V1.jpg?resize=85,60 85w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/EQUINOX_model_07_RGB_V1.jpg?resize=175,123 175w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/EQUINOX_model_07_RGB_V1.jpg?resize=115,81 115w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/EQUINOX_model_07_RGB_V1.jpg?resize=701,492 701w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/EQUINOX_model_07_RGB_V1.jpg?resize=738,518 738w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 7000px) 100vw, 7000px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eA suite at the Equinox Hotel Hudson Yards.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNorton admits that the pricing sits in the luxury end of the sector, a world he knows well.

In the 1970s, 10-speed bikes from Europe sparked a boom stateside. A decade later, mountain bikes renewed the business. A few years after that, American Tour de France champion Lance Armstrong caused a surge of interest in the sport—before his fall from grace.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow, once again, as bikemakers find themselves confronting years of sales declines for their bread-and-butter product, a new kind of bike is fueling a renaissance in the $6\u0026nbsp;billion industry: the e-bike.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to the NPD Retail Tracking Service, unit sales of bikes with electric motors rose 73% last year at specialty shops, after more than doubling the year before. Across the industry, that comes to about 400,000 e-bikes. In contrast, traditional bike sales fell 8% last year.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTrek Bicycle, an iconic American bikemaker whose popularity soared in the early 2000s as Armstrong’s bike of choice, got an early jump on this part of the market, and it’s been a boon: Trek is now the U.S. market leader in e-bikes, ahead of Specialized and Electra, and they generate about 20% of its $1\u0026nbsp;billion in annual sales. Trek president John Burke sees this as just the start of a new golden age for the industry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“You have people who commute, you have people who want to bike up hills, and you have people who want to keep up with their spouse,” says Burke, 57, whose father, Dick, cofounded the company in 1976 in Waterloo, Wis. (An avid cyclist who covers 5,000 miles a year, Burke himself has taken to e-bikes, choosing to ride one for nights out in nearby Madison.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/PAS08.19-Trek-EBike-EMTB-Challenge.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"PAS08.19-Trek EBike EMTB Challenge\" class=\"wp-image-2670098\" srcset=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/PAS08.19-Trek-EBike-EMTB-Challenge.jpg 1468w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/PAS08.19-Trek-EBike-EMTB-Challenge.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/PAS08.19-Trek-EBike-EMTB-Challenge.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/PAS08.19-Trek-EBike-EMTB-Challenge.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/PAS08.19-Trek-EBike-EMTB-Challenge.jpg?resize=1024,683 1024w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/PAS08.19-Trek-EBike-EMTB-Challenge.jpg?resize=281,187 281w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/PAS08.19-Trek-EBike-EMTB-Challenge.jpg?resize=754,503 754w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/PAS08.19-Trek-EBike-EMTB-Challenge.jpg?resize=100,67 100w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/PAS08.19-Trek-EBike-EMTB-Challenge.jpg?resize=60,40 60w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/PAS08.19-Trek-EBike-EMTB-Challenge.jpg?resize=154,103 154w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/PAS08.19-Trek-EBike-EMTB-Challenge.jpg?resize=591,394 591w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/PAS08.19-Trek-EBike-EMTB-Challenge.jpg?resize=392,261 392w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/PAS08.19-Trek-EBike-EMTB-Challenge.jpg?resize=252,168 252w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/PAS08.19-Trek-EBike-EMTB-Challenge.jpg?resize=697,465 697w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/PAS08.19-Trek-EBike-EMTB-Challenge.jpg?resize=234,156 234w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/PAS08.19-Trek-EBike-EMTB-Challenge.jpg?resize=500,333 500w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/PAS08.19-Trek-EBike-EMTB-Challenge.jpg?resize=578,385 578w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/PAS08.19-Trek-EBike-EMTB-Challenge.jpg?resize=600,400 600w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/PAS08.19-Trek-EBike-EMTB-Challenge.jpg?resize=90,60 90w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/PAS08.19-Trek-EBike-EMTB-Challenge.jpg?resize=184,123 184w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/PAS08.19-Trek-EBike-EMTB-Challenge.jpg?resize=115,77 115w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/PAS08.19-Trek-EBike-EMTB-Challenge.jpg?resize=738,492 738w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/PAS08.19-Trek-EBike-EMTB-Challenge.jpg?resize=777,518 777w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1468px) 100vw, 1468px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eTrek e-bikes are powered by the latest generation of high-performance tech from Bosch.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe bike industry as a whole is getting a big lift from all this. The much higher price for an e‑bike—the average e-bike retails for $3,500 at specialty shops, according to the National Bicy­cle Dealers Association (NBDA), roughly three times as much as a regular bike—is mitigating the pain of slipping overall sales. E-bikes can indeed get pricey: The Trek Domane+ goes for $7,000, and the most expensive mountain e-bike from Specialized, based in Morgan Hill, Calif., retails for more than $12,000.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the U.S., e-bikes go way back. The first rudimentary patents were filed in 1898, according to the NBDA. And in 1996, a joint venture between Sanyo and the Electric Bicycle Co. led to the first commercially viable e-bike. A year later, Trek tried to make a go of it. But consumers were not ready.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIndeed, this latest push is Trek’s third stab at the e-bike market after flops in previous decades. It was only about three years ago that e-bikes took off in the U.S., just a few years behind an explosion in Europe, particularly in Germany and the Netherlands.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe pivotal moment for the industry was the arrival of high-quality motors, such as those from German manufacturer Bosch. That has gone a long way toward easing people’s “distance anxiety” about losing juice on a longer ride. And Burke’s hopes for the boom to be long-lasting stem from what he sees in Europe, where bike industry trends typically begin. In 2018, sales of new e-bikes eclipsed those of regular bikes in the Netherlands for the first time.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eRetailers, many of them staffed by cycling purists, have had to change their tune. “There is lots\u0026nbsp;of snobbery in bike retail, that\u0026nbsp;[e-bikes are] cheating, that they’re not real bikes,” says Noel Kegel, co-owner of the Wheel \u0026amp; Sprocket chain in Wisconsin. But that’s changing, he notes: “For\u0026nbsp;20 years, nothing is fueling growth, and now we have e-bikes that are generating massive growth.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe snobbery might be more widespread among the spandex-wearing weekend-warrior set. But the contingent fueling the boom sees e-bikes in a utilitarian light. For instance, about 57% of people in Amsterdam use a bike once a day, principally as a way to commute. E-bikes help them handle longer distances and not get too sweaty on their way to the office.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe e-bike boom is in sync with changing cycling habits: According to the Sports \u0026amp; Fitness Industry Association, the number of hard-core American cyclists (people riding at least 26 times a year) has fallen 14% since 2013, while the number of casual riders (people more apt to use an e-bike) has risen 7%.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBurke doesn’t expect America’s bike culture to replicate Europe’s. But, he says, with more cities installing bike lanes—and with growing concerns about obesity, traffic congestion, and the environment—e-bikes will be more than a fad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“The bicycle is a real solution for a lot of problems happening around the globe,” he says. “E-bikes help on all those fronts.” And another front they help on is Trek’s top line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eA version of this article appears in the August 2019 issue of Fortune with the headline \u0026#8220;Tour de Force.\u0026#8221;\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eMore must-read stories from \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—How to celebrate \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/07/17/celebrating-national-ice-cream-day-2019-free-ice-cream/\"\u003eNational Ice Cream Day\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—Why an \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/07/17/european-union-amazon-investigation/\"\u003eEU investigation into Amazon\u003c/a\u003e could change the way the e-tailer works\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—Nestle finds a \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/07/16/nestle-chocolate-sugar/\"\u003enew method for making chocolate\u003c/a\u003e without adding sugar\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—How\u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/longform/dollar-general-billions-revenue/\"\u003e Dollar General brings in billions\u003c/a\u003e each year\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—Listen to our new audio briefing,\u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/radio/\"\u003e \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e 500 Daily\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://flipboard.com/@fortune\"\u003eFollow \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e on Flipboard\u003c/a\u003e to stay up-to-date on the latest news and analysis.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://fortune.com/longform/ebike-sales-on-the-rise/","published":"2019-07-20T12:00:35Z","guid":"https://fortune.com/?post_type=longform\u0026p=2671670"},{"title":"This Street Is the Perfect Place to Soak Up the Spirit of San Juan","content":"\n\u003cp\u003eOn Puerto Rico’s north shore, Old San Juan is\nknown for its romantic charm, with historic cobblestoned streets,\nsorbet-colored buildings, and an ever-present easygoing vibe.

Thus started a hotel-building boom and a fevered pitch of short-term rental (such as Airbnb and Vrbo) conversions. So far this year, 926 new hotel rooms have opened—on top of 2,304 in 2018 and 1,219 in 2017.

Despite its history and relative popularity at the time, a little over 150 years later, it shuttered its doors (for the second time) in 1983.

They were always doing things that were either quite pioneering at the time, or things that would actually shape the entire industry into what it’s become today.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eThe Spirit Safe\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the biggest innovations to come out of Port Ellen was the spirit safe. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eA spirit safe is essentially a glass box at a distillery that the spirit passes through as it leaves the still. Inside, a hydrometer measures the concentration of alcohol in the liquid, and a distiller can direct the liquid inside into various receivers, cutting out the beginning “heads” and end “tails” of the distillate to save the middle “heart” of what comes off the still for consumption. Up until 1983, the local excise officer held a key to the safe, as did the distillery manager, and both keys were required to access the liquid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eEarly tests of the device, now found in every distillery in Scotland, were first performed at Port Ellen, and the distillery was the very first to own a safe when it was officially introduced in 1823, a detail that’s highlighted in the packaging for the new release, which Diageo has titled “Port Ellen: Untold Stories, The Spirit Safe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat history is further commemorated in the whisky’s box, which is opened using two keys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eA Blender’s Whisky\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSadly, 1983 wasn’t Port Ellen’s first foray into shutting its doors. The distillery was also closed from 1930 until 1967. After reopening in 1967, it endured for only 16 years before its doors were shuttered once again. Rather than focusing on single malt, Port Ellen turned to making whisky used in blends. That meant that it was consumed relatively young.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“At a relatively young age as a single malt, it was good, but it wasn’t phenomenal,” says Gunn. “It was loved by blenders because of what it brought to a great blend of Scotch whisky.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhat it brought was smoky notes as well as rich, earthy tones to the blended whiskeys it was used in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“We didn’t know how great it could eventually become,” says Gunn. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the distillery closed in 1983, the oldest maturing stock in the warehouse was 16 years old. And there wasn’t a ton of it left to mature. Even in its heyday, Port Ellen wasn’t doing a ton of production. In 1983 the distillery was capable of producing just over 1.5 million LPA (litres of pure alcohol), but was only running at about half its capacity, 800,000 LPA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eUntold Stories\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eDistilled in 1978, Port Ellen: Untold Stories, The Spirit Safe, is likely to be one of the last few releases we see from Port Ellen before it reopens to the public in 2021—and it’s a phenomenal one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOn the nose, you get soft peat notes along with fruity notes of melon and lime. Despite its time in the cask, the whisky still tastes exceptionally fresh, with beautiful complex tropical fruit notes. It’s bottled at cask strength, 50.9%, but also benefits from a splash of water, which opens up the whisky and makes it that much better. “I would say it’s the most complex and the most elegant Port Ellen we’ve ever released,” Gunn says. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd while its release is limited to just 1,500 bottles now, it might not be the last we see, thanks to the distillery’s upcoming reopening. “We have the blueprints for the stills when it originally closed. We have the layout for the distillery,” says Gunn. “We’re pretty confident we’re going to be able to make a spirit very, very close to the original style of Port Ellen that we were making all those decades ago.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat means if you miss it now, you might get another shot at sipping a very similar 39-year-old Port Ellen come 2060.

(The FTC has not formally announced the Facebook settlement, so it\u0026#8217;s unclear if such a requirement is part of the deal). \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSlaiman added, however, that a real change in privacy practices would depend on consumers understanding what companies are doing with their data—a daunting challenge, she said, given that tech companies are masters at persuading people to share personal information and stay on their apps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe FTC, meanwhile, may stand little chance for now in getting the upper hand on the tech companies. A big reason is resources. While the likes of Facebook and \u003ca href=\"http://content.fortune.com/fortune500/amazoncom-18/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAmazon\u003c/a\u003e have nearly unlimited budgets for litigation and lobbying, the agency is stretched thin. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eLast fall, an FTC\u003ca href=\"https://www.govtech.com/policy/FTC-Asks-for-More-Control-Over-Big-Tech-Privacy-Issues.html\"\u003e commissioner told Congress \u003c/a\u003ethat the number of FTC staffers is 50% below what it was at the start of the Reagan Administration in 1981. Meanwhile, the FTC chairman said agency staff are \u0026#8220;almost killing themselves\u0026#8221; in the face of unprecedented litigation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAn FTC spokesperson declined to comment to \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e about the Facebook fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAll of this may points to the need for a new law allowing the FTC to keep more of the privacy penalties it imposes, according to Slaiman. While $5 billion not faze Facebook, which declined to comment for this article, it could go a long way to providing America\u0026#8217;s leading privacy cop with some teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://fortune.com/2019/07/20/facebook-5-billion-ftc/","published":"2019-07-20T13:00:51Z","guid":"https://fortune.com/?p=2671332"},{"title":"How Mezcal’s Boom Is Helping Lift Its Makers Out of Extreme Poverty","content":"\n\u003cp\u003eYou can tell by the quiet smile on his face that Bonifacio Cruz Ruiz is proud of his agave plants. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eInside a small handmade greenhouse in his backyard, Ruiz has thousands of plants growing on shelves lined with baking sheets.

Y para todo bien, tambien.\u003c/em\u003e” Translation: “For everything bad, mezcal. And for everything good, too.” It’s a saying best accompanied with a glass of the local spirit in your hand and commemorates a liquid that is used in the area for everything from an afternoon drink to a folk remedy to cure illnesses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMezcal has been an integral part of the local community for generations. However, families in the isolated town—which has exceptionally limited access to basic utilities like running water and electricity—have had trouble making the spirit a commercial success. They’ve also run into trouble keeping the tradition going, as younger members of the community tend to leave the area, seeking greater job opportunities. Many ultimately choose to immigrate to the United States. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe agave used to make mezcal in the village has traditionally been harvested from wild plants. However, when something happened to those plants, the village was forced to buy them from other villages, cutting into their already meager profits. Wild agave can also be hard to find, making the process of collecting enough for a batch of mezcal a rather time-consuming task. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow, thanks to Heifer, that agave Ruiz is growing will ensure the area has not only a steady supply of the plant, but also that they’ll be able to locate them quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2017, Ruiz along with other members of the village voted to sell their mezcal to Pernod Ricard, which is working with Heifer on the program, after a representative from the brand visited the area. The plan at the time was to ultimately integrate mezcal from the village into the company’s popular Del Maguey brand. That hasn’t happened just yet, but Pernod is consistently purchasing the mezcal and storing it with plans to release it in future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eEven without the official release, that partnership has fueled some tremendous results. Whereas the town once sold its mezcal for just eight pesos a liter (approximately 50¢), it’s now approaching 130 pesos per liter ($7.50), a significant improvement. The villagers are also selling more. Prior to Heifer and Pernod’s involvement, the Rodriguez family typically sold around 400 liters of mezcal per year. Now that number is closer to 1,000 liters. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHeifer wants to help facilitate that growth, making the industry more sustainable for a community where the average annual family income is between $3,000 and $5,000. Now the community is making a consistent product and is aware of the spirit’s market value.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond teaching Ruiz and others how to build greenhouses and nurture seedlings, the group also helps local farmers learn skills such as how to prevent pests from destroying the plants, which can often take five to seven years to reach maturity, and how to care for and prevent diseases in their livestock, which are often used to harvest those heavy plants on the steep hills where they grow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MX201902-012.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2669579\" srcset=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MX201902-012.jpg 5760w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MX201902-012.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MX201902-012.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MX201902-012.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MX201902-012.jpg?resize=1024,683 1024w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MX201902-012.jpg?resize=281,187 281w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MX201902-012.jpg?resize=755,503 755w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MX201902-012.jpg?resize=100,67 100w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MX201902-012.jpg?resize=60,40 60w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MX201902-012.jpg?resize=154,103 154w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MX201902-012.jpg?resize=591,394 591w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MX201902-012.jpg?resize=392,261 392w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MX201902-012.jpg?resize=252,168 252w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MX201902-012.jpg?resize=697,465 697w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MX201902-012.jpg?resize=234,156 234w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MX201902-012.jpg?resize=500,333 500w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MX201902-012.jpg?resize=578,385 578w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MX201902-012.jpg?resize=600,400 600w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MX201902-012.jpg?resize=90,60 90w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MX201902-012.jpg?resize=185,123 185w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MX201902-012.jpg?resize=115,77 115w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MX201902-012.jpg?resize=738,492 738w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MX201902-012.jpg?resize=777,518 777w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 5760px) 100vw, 5760px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eCarlos Rodriguez and his father, Ciro, tie agave to a horse.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eCiro Rodriguez is one of the people responsible for harvesting agave in the village.

The worst case was 750,000.

The trials, many of which involved intentionally suboptimal circumstances, like what to do in the event that a thruster malfunctioned, ended in abortion as much as 90% of the time, Ahr estimates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“We knew what it felt like for the air to be sucked out of building 30 because an abort had been called when it shouldn’t have,” Ahr says, referring to the instant onset of depression that befell workers inside the facility where IBM’s so-called real-time computer complex, the mechanical brains of the mission, was housed, when a test-run went awry. “Boy, you don’t want to do that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut practice is no match for game day. “It’s always more chaotic or emphatic or disconcerting when it happens during a real mission,\u0026#8221; Ahr adds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eGo for moon landing\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eEven in the midst of all this then-new technology, humans had the final say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eJack Garman, a NASA computer specialist and avionics expert trained on IBM\u0026#8217;s computers, had been asked by Gene Kranz, the mission\u0026#8217;s chief flight director, to write down all possible error conditions to prepare for any contingency. Garman, who died in 2016, studied a table he had written down which described all the failure modes and what to do about them as the alarms blared. Looking over the alerts, he determined that the mission should proceed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;It took 10-to-15 seconds the first time [the alarm] occurred for him to say ‘Keep going,’\u0026#8221; Ahr remembers. “Then it happened again and again and again.” Each time an alarm triggered, as the Apollo mission\u0026#8217;s lunar module descended faster toward the Moon\u0026#8217;s surface, Garman told his superiors to continue the mission.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eEventually, people got a grip on what had happened: Onboard computers were overloaded. Due to some error, the machines were trying to process more data than they could handle. Because the computers couldn’t accomplish all the tasks asked of them, they sounded off. (\u003cem\u003eDiscover Magazine\u003c/em\u003e has a \u003ca href=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/vintagespace/2018/01/05/apollo-11s-1202-alarm-explained/\"\u003egood technical explanation\u003c/a\u003e.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“From a trajectory standpoint there was no other call but to keep going,” Ahr says. \u0026#8220;It was a good descent. It would have been a travesty if we had aborted.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eOne giant leap\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs he recollects the events that transpired fifty years ago, Ahr has to stifle an upwelling of emotion. He compares his response to the reactions veterans might have when looking back on the invasion of Normandy during World War II. While watching a commemoration of the D-Day landing last month, a thought struck him. “I started getting teary-eyed and choked up the same way I do when I talk about landings, splashdowns, or descents,” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“I got to thinking that July 20th was our D-Day,” Ahr continues, audibly moved. “It was the day we liberated mankind from just walking on the Earth. We walked on another celestial body. We liberated man from the bounds of the Earth—for good.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eToday\u0026#8217;s scientists hope to carry the torch further. The Apollo 11 mission \u0026#8220;was an incredible accomplishment,” says IBM Research’s Kelly. “The risks that the country took, that NASA took, that IBM took—these astronauts strapped themselves onto a rocket to go a quarter million miles to a cold piece of rock—is just amazing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eKelly praises the gamble of a public-private partnership that IBM and NASA forged. “We as companies and countries need to do more of that. Not just the incremental—we need to do some real soul-searching,” he says. “Are we taking enough risks? Are we going for the Moon? Are we going to try to really cure cancer? Are we really going to try to understand what’s going on with the environment? And do we have the guts and wherewithal to do it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;Humans can do almost anything,\u0026#8221; Kelly adds, \u0026#8220;if they put their minds to it.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://fortune.com/2019/07/20/apollo-11-anniversary-moon-landing-ibm/","published":"2019-07-20T17:44:42Z","guid":"https://fortune.com/?p=2671744"},{"title":"Lessons from the Pentagon, Oracle, CrowdStrike, and an Ex-CIA Entrepreneur at Brainstorm Tech 2019—Cyber Saturday","content":"\n\u003cp\u003eMy colleagues and I have just wrapped up this year\u0026#8217;s \u003ca href=\"https://fortuneconferences.com/fortune-brainstorm-tech-2019/\"\u003eBrainstorm Tech conference\u003c/a\u003e in the dry, mountain air of Aspen, Colo., and I am, for one, back to soaking up the ample humidity of New York City.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt the conclusion of a \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/07/16/silicon-valley-cybersecurity-defense\"\u003elunchtime roundtable\u003c/a\u003e I hosted on Tuesday, I asked the session\u0026#8217;s featured speakers a two-part question with varying degrees of difficulty: What\u0026#8217;s the biggest challenge the world faces with respect to cybersecurity today? (Easier.) And what is the solution? (Way harder.)

We need \u0026#8220;the equivalent of a financial auditing system for cybersecurity, and there are two different ways in which that could happen. Companies could invent one, so the same people who do financial audits could create the framework, or it could be a federal standard like via NIST,\u0026#8221; he said, using an acronym for the National Institute for Standards and Technology, which publishes a touchstone cybersecurity policy framework for businesses. \u0026#8220;Once that exists it sets up a whole lot of other things in the tort system—what are reasonable standards?—and that helps sort out a lot of what is messy in the industry today.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eDmitri Alperovitch, cofounder and chief technology officer of CrowdStrike and the final speaker, responded by cracking a joke. \u0026#8220;I think there are actually only four problems in cybersecurity,\u0026#8221; he said. \u0026#8220;They\u0026#8217;re called China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAlperovitch made another point too. \u0026#8220;At end of the day, it comes down to leadership.

Oh, they don\u0026#8217;t always look pretty, though I\u0026#8217;m rather fond of the quirky art style he\u0026#8217;s adopted from \u003cem\u003eImbroglio\u003c/em\u003e onward. It\u0026#8217;s safe to say he has a genre of choice as well, with most of his work falling rather firmly into that squishy genre we usually call roguelites. But within that little slice of the market, there\u0026#8217;s frankly no name I trust more than his. I think it\u0026#8217;s because when it comes down to it, these games all offer a tremendous amount of replay value without sacrificing the player\u0026#8217;s agency in their fate. That is a harder balance to strike than you might think. And yet time after time, game after game, Michael Brough steps up to the challenge. His latest is no exception.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/460x0w-2-1.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-255789\" src=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/460x0w-2-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/460x0w-2-1.jpg 460w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/460x0w-2-1-139x300.jpg 139w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003eThere is something a \u003cem\u003elittle\u003c/em\u003e different about \u003cem\u003eP1 Select\u003c/em\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://toucharcade.com/link/http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1470639614?mt=8\"\u003e(\u0026#36;2.99)\u003c/a\u003e, however. If this is your first experience with one of his games you may or may not believe me, but this is a kinder, gentler Brough game. It\u0026#8217;s not as complex as \u003cem\u003eImbroglio\u003c/em\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://toucharcade.com/link/http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id969264934?mt=8\"\u003e(\u0026#36;3.99)\u003c/a\u003e, nor is it as hard to come to grips with initially as\u003cem\u003e 868-HACK\u003c/em\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://toucharcade.com/link/http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id635749911?mt=8\"\u003e(\u0026#36;4.99)\u003c/a\u003e. As such, it\u0026#8217;s a great introduction into the wild world of Brough\u0026#8217;s creations. If you\u0026#8217;re a veteran, don\u0026#8217;t worry. There\u0026#8217;s still plenty here to chew on, even if it may not quite have the longevity of some of his other titles. Your aim in\u003cem\u003e P1 Select\u003c/em\u003e is to make your way through nine procedurally-generated stages, gathering as many Pontos as you can along the way. You\u0026#8217;ll get one Ponto for every floor you clear, but you can earn extra Pontos by defeating enemies in a particular way. Whether you make it to the end of the nine stages or perish along the way, the number of Pontos you collect is tallied up and recorded. A single good run isn\u0026#8217;t enough, however, as \u003cem\u003eP1 Select\u003c/em\u003e keeps track of your average score across 20 sessions, and that\u0026#8217;s what the leaderboard rankings are based on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are nine different characters to play as, and you can choose who you start with each time. But you\u0026#8217;ll be playing all of them regardless of who you start with. Every step you take shifts you to a different character. You can see ahead of time which one it will be. Attacking an enemy will also change out your character. Each character has a different way of attacking, somewhat like a chess piece. They all use rings to power their attacks, with most taking a single ring. The key character here is Midas, who has the ability to change an enemy into a Ponto when it attacks. Certainly, other characters have their uses. Some can jump over walls. Some can take out multiple enemies in one go. And they all will leave you in different positions after using their moves. All of those things can be valuable given that you\u0026#8217;re ultimately playing a game of energy conservation and positioning here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can\u0026#8217;t attack without rings, but the rings may not be within easy reach. If you defeat all of the enemies, your character will scoop up the remaining rings before leaving the room. You can walk out the exit door anytime you like provided you can reach it, however. So you really have to consider whether you can save more rings by fighting or by running. But you also need to think about making opportunities to use Midas for extra Pontos. And no matter what you do, sooner or later you are going to have to fight. Naturally, all of this comes after the basic goal of making sure you don\u0026#8217;t die a stupid death, which can happen pretty easily if you\u0026#8217;re not cautious. It\u0026#8217;s a lot to take in at first, though perhaps not as much as there usually is in one of Brough\u0026#8217;s games. You really just have to learn what each character can do and be careful not to box yourself in. Easier said than done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/460x0w-4.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-255790\" src=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/460x0w-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/460x0w-4.jpg 460w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/460x0w-4-139x300.jpg 139w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003eEverything in \u003cem\u003eP1 Select\u003c/em\u003e looks and sounds weird in that now-familiar Brough style. That said, it\u0026#8217;s always clear what everything is. All of the different characters, along with their abilities and position on the grid, are always at the top of the play area, so the amount you have to memorize is relatively limited. If you reach certain score thresholds, you\u0026#8217;ll unlock a few permanent upgrades that will help you push your score even higher. As mentioned, there is a leaderboard in the game, and you have your choice of two different control layouts thanks to a post-release update. The default method requires two fingers and while it does feel good, it\u0026#8217;s sometimes not practical to use. You can switch to a single-finger control method that works just as well and is easier to pass off as sending an email to HR or whatever it is the important management people do these days. Either way, it\u0026#8217;s not too hard to play the game. Swipe to move. Either hold two fingers or tap to set up an attack, then swipe in the desired direction to let fly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eP1 Select\u003c/em\u003e is a more accessible game, and as a result I ended up treating it more like something to play when I had a few spare minutes rather than a game to settle into for longer sessions. I like that its scoring system being so straightforward and clear. On the other hand, it does feel like it\u0026#8217;s lacking just a \u003cem\u003elittle\u003c/em\u003e in depth when compared to some of Brough\u0026#8217;s other games. I still play \u003cem\u003e868-HACK\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eImbroglio\u003c/em\u003e fairly regularly, but I\u0026#8217;m not fully confident I\u0026#8217;ll still be playing this game years from now. Is that a big problem? For how little these games sell for, I should hope not. Even if I were to quit playing it tomorrow, an unlikely possibility if ever there were one, \u003cem\u003eP1 Select\u003c/em\u003e would have provided me with a full week of taking over my phone in my free time and my thoughts in my not-so-free time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#8217;s a no-brainer purchase if you\u0026#8217;ve liked any of Brough\u0026#8217;s previous games, of course. But if that\u0026#8217;s you, then you\u0026#8217;ve probably already bought it, haven\u0026#8217;t you? If, however, you bounced off one of his games before for any reason other than the art, you might want to give this one a glance. There\u0026#8217;s a concerted effort here to try to reach out to a \u003cem\u003eslightly\u003c/em\u003e different set of tastes, and if you give it a chance to get its claws into you, you may end up finding this to be the gateway to a brighter, Broughier world.

This week, thatgamecompany\u0026#8217;s \u003cem\u003eSky: Children of the Light\u003c/em\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://toucharcade.com/link/http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1462117269?mt=8\"\u003e(Free)\u003c/a\u003e fits squarely in the middle of both of those pick styles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"clear:both;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"video-responsive\"\u003e\n\t\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z8lG5Bp_bMQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat I mean by that is that \u003cem\u003eSky\u003c/em\u003e most definitely feels unique from anything else out there, and I feel confident recommending it just based on that uniqueness. But at the same time, I\u0026#8217;m enjoying the heck out of my time in the game so far. Or, is game the right word? I don\u0026#8217;t even really know how to classify \u003cem\u003eSky\u003c/em\u003e. I mean, yeah it\u0026#8217;s a game, but it\u0026#8217;s also sort of an experience. And perhaps an experiment. I\u0026#8217;m not 100% sure what the end goal is in \u003cem\u003eSky\u003c/em\u003e, or if there even is one. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBasically you start out exploring a huge open land. Very simple tutorial tasks teach you how to move the camera, move your character, and eventually fly. Other elements in the environment can be interacted with via contextual buttons that pop up, and occasionally some light text boxes will explain something to you. Other than that though, \u003cem\u003eSky\u003c/em\u003e does a really good job at indicating what you should be doing and where you should be going without dialogue at all. It just sort of urges you to go in certain directions, and the world is so mysterious and interesting that you feel compelled to go off in those directions and explore. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"clear:both;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"video-responsive\"\u003e\n\t\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wpWhq50bwiU\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEventually things open up even more and you start to see other people that look like shadow versions of yourself roaming around the world. Again through simply implying it, you find that you can connect with these other players and perform cooperative tasks to solve puzzles and advance the game. There\u0026#8217;s no usernames and there\u0026#8217;s no text chat. These people are just other people like you that are playing the game and figuring things out as they go, and it\u0026#8217;s sort of magical how you\u0026#8217;re able to work together with total strangers to accomplish shared goals. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, magical is the best word to describe \u003cem\u003eSky\u003c/em\u003e. The visuals are gorgeous, and the soundtrack is absolutely epic. Do yourself a favor and strap on some headphones for this one. It takes a little bit to sort of get your bearings, but once you reach the hub area of the world the game\u0026#8217;s structure becomes a little more clear, and at that point you just want to press on and progress as much as possible. And the flying… You can\u0026#8217;t have a game called \u003cem\u003eSky\u003c/em\u003e without spending a lot of time IN the sky, and flying around gives me the same sort of butterflies that I got when I first took to the sky in \u003cem\u003eMario 64\u003c/em\u003e more than twenty years ago. Again, it\u0026#8217;s magical.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"clear:both;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"video-responsive\"\u003e\n\t\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MgW-rVErW1k\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0026#8217;t know how to describe \u003cem\u003eSky\u003c/em\u003e and I don\u0026#8217;t know if everyone who tries it will enjoy it. It\u0026#8217;s a very different kind of game, and I feel like I\u0026#8217;ve only just scratched the surface. But if you enjoyed this developer\u0026#8217;s previous game \u003cem\u003eJourney\u003c/em\u003e, I have a feeling you\u0026#8217;ll be in awe that you have a similarly beautiful and epic adventure in the palm of your hands. Its mysteriousness is its allure, and whether it ends up being your cup of tea or not I feel very strongly that absolutely everybody should at least give \u003cem\u003eSky\u003c/em\u003e a download and try it for themselves as there\u0026#8217;s nothing quite like this anywhere else on mobile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://toucharcade.com/2019/07/19/toucharcade-game-of-the-week-sky-children-of-the-light/","published":"2019-07-20T01:17:34Z","guid":"https://toucharcade.com/?p=255794"}]},{"url":"https://www.nintendolife.com/feeds/latest","items":[{"title":"Class Action Lawsuit Officially Filed Against Nintendo For Switch Joy-Con \"Drifting\" Issues","content":"","url":"https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/07/class_action_lawsuit_officially_filed_against_nintendo_for_switch_joy-con_drifting_issues","published":"2019-07-20T01:45:00Z","guid":"https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/07/class_action_lawsuit_officially_filed_against_nintendo_for_switch_joy-con_drifting_issues"},{"title":"Bloodstained: Ritual Of The Night Switch Fix Expected To Arrive Soon","content":"","url":"https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/07/bloodstained_ritual_of_the_night_switch_fix_expected_to_arrive_soon","published":"2019-07-20T04:30:00Z","guid":"https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/07/bloodstained_ritual_of_the_night_switch_fix_expected_to_arrive_soon"},{"title":"Poll: Tell Us Who You're Siding With In Splatoon 2's Final Splatfest","content":"","url":"https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/07/poll_tell_us_who_youre_siding_with_in_splatoon_2s_final_splatfest","published":"2019-07-20T04:00:00Z","guid":"https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/07/poll_tell_us_who_youre_siding_with_in_splatoon_2s_final_splatfest"},{"title":"Netflix Releases Its First Official Teaser For Season One Of The Witcher","content":"","url":"https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/07/netflix_releases_its_first_official_teaser_for_season_one_of_the_witcher","published":"2019-07-20T05:00:00Z","guid":"https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/07/netflix_releases_its_first_official_teaser_for_season_one_of_the_witcher"},{"title":"Hori Announces New Line Of Officially Licensed Accessories For Switch Lite","content":"","url":"https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/07/hori_announces_new_line_of_officially_licensed_accessories_for_switch_lite","published":"2019-07-20T06:30:00Z","guid":"https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/07/hori_announces_new_line_of_officially_licensed_accessories_for_switch_lite"},{"title":"Reminder: Splatoon 2 Splatfest T-Shirts Now Available On The UK My Nintendo Store","content":"","url":"https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/07/reminder_splatoon_2_splatfest_t-shirts_now_available_on_the_uk_my_nintendo_store","published":"2019-07-20T06:00:00Z","guid":"https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/07/reminder_splatoon_2_splatfest_t-shirts_now_available_on_the_uk_my_nintendo_store"},{"title":"Talking Point: What Are You Playing This Weekend?

That’s where all the drama is, but in fact most of America’s punitive actions against Iran are taking place in a world not physical but financial.

Because Trump is eager to avoid war with Iran but also to push the Iranians, she is one of the most powerful officials designing the strategy Trump’s administration hopes will force Iranian capitulation—or, failing that, perhaps even the government’s collapse.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eTrump himself touts the achievements of that campaign. “Iran is in big trouble right now.

And it’s very easy to straighten out or it’s very easy for us to make it a lot worse,” he said, a short while after reports broke that Iran had seized a British tanker in the Gulf, and one day after the U.S. announced it had destroyed an Iranian drone.

Whether it’s effective in achieving its policy goals is another question, and one that can’t necessarily be evaluated yet. The administration wants to force the Iranians back to the negotiating table, and despite a steady increase in provocations in the Gulf region, there have also been feints toward diplomacy: Trump saying he wishes the Iranians would call him and dispatching Senator Rand Paul to \u003ca href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/17/rand-paul-iran-talks-donald-trump-1418075\"\u003emeet\u003c/a\u003e with Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, and Zarif floating the outlines of a possible deal in interviews this week.

Stuart Levey, who under the George W.

Bush once mused aloud that the U.S. might be “\u003ca href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/we-should-strike-iran-but-not-with-bombs/\"\u003eall sanctioned out\u003c/a\u003e” on Iran.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eBut since then, Treasury has been coming up with ever more inventive ways to make it hard for Iran to do business—not just with the United States but with anybody. Beginning around 2006, Treasury officials including Levey focused on finding ways to cut off Iran from the global financial system. The Obama administration then made moves to restrict Iran’s ability to export oil. And now the Trump administration has moved to strangle Iran’s oil exports still further, and its whole economy along with it. At the same time, the administration has used sanctions as a weapon against every major pillar of political power in the country, including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e“I think the reality is, there have been stages of greater and greater complexity with respect to the sanctions regime,” Juan Zarate, a former Treasury official in the Bush administration, told me. “And there’s also a lot of room for creativity as to what the Treasury decides to focus on … and ways of sequencing and choreographing what to do.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eTrump says the pressure on Iran will keep escalating, both physically—via America’s military arsenal countering Iran at sea —and financially. Though much of Iran’s economy is already sanctioned, Treasury has managed to keep finding new targets to hit, often by trying to bring down complex money-moving networks to stop revenue flowing to the Iranians.

FaceApp became wildly popular, seemingly overnight, for doing the exact opposite.

The resulting images aren’t the only thing about FaceApp that strikes some people as creepy.

Yes, you should stop using FaceApp, because there are few controls on how your data, including your face data, will be used. But the problems that FaceApp poses aren’t unique. Walking around anywhere can get your face included in facial-recognition databases. How that information can be mined, manipulated, bought, or sold is minimally regulated—in the United States and elsewhere. Militaries, law-enforcement agencies, and commercial interests alike envision far-reaching uses of AI and facial recognition, but legal and regulatory controls lag far behind the pace of technology.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eFor most people, never going outside is not an option.

However, there are no legal guarantees for this in the privacy policy.

Like FaceApp, all three of those apps allow users to submit their own photos and apply an AI-powered filter to transform their image. Apps developed by large American companies, such as Snapchat and Instagram, do generally at least try to comply with existing privacy laws. However, as we saw with the \u003ca href=\"https://slate.com/technology/2018/03/who-is-to-blame-for-the-cambridge-analytica-facebook-scandal.html\"\u003eCambridge Analytica\u003c/a\u003e scandal—in which a third-party app developer harvested user data that Facebook had promised to protect, and then used that data to help sway elections—major tech platforms with highly sophisticated engineering capabilities can still fail at privacy on a large scale.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/09/why-privacy-policies-are-so-inscrutable/379615/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: Why privacy policies are so inscrutable\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eA key difference between FaceApp and Facebook is that a Russian company developed the former.

Concerns about Russian apps stem from the close relationship between government and industry, and the likelihood that Russian companies will be unable to fight government requests for data. Then again, companies in even the most liberal, democratic nations often have to share data with their government as well. In the United States, tech companies and their users do generally enjoy a higher level of legal protection from government than their counterparts in Russia do. But users of non-Russian apps should still be concerned about where their data will end up.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eRegardless of origin, tech companies need to do better to protect the privacy of their consumers. Part of this is simply making users more aware of how data are being used. This is the rationale behind privacy policies. However, many users \u003ca href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/mar/03/terms-of-service-online-contracts-fine-print\"\u003edon’t read\u003c/a\u003e those policies. Developers need to go further and build actual privacy protections into their apps. These can include notifications on how data (or photos) are being used, clear internal policies on data retention and deletion, and easy workflows for users to request data correction and deletion.

I said, ‘We can get some if you want!’ He smiled, picked up a carton, and told me he was thinking about his family. ‘We didn’t eat things like fresh strawberries,’ he explained,” Warren’s tweet read. “It made me think about my family, too, how my mother would work her grocery list to squeeze out every last nickel.

As a remarried divorcee and a candidate for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, Warren finds herself in a field of presidential hopefuls whose family lives reflect the diversity of \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2019/05/2020-candidates-families/589378/?utm_source=feed\"\u003e Americans’\u003c/a\u003e. Warren and Mann’s married life, however, kicked off in a way that was both unusual at the time and unusual now, in that Warren proposed to Mann and not the other way around. The rarity of women proposing to men is something of a curious anomaly to people who have studied marriage and its evolution: While marriage itself has grown to be a more gender-flexible and egalitarian institution, the proposal ritual has remained stubbornly, stagnantly male-driven. This may be, counterintuitively, partly a result of women’s economic and educational empowerment and marriage’s subsequent trend toward equal partnership.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eAmong heterosexual couples, 97 percent  of grooms report proposing to their brides, according to Lauren Kay, the executive editor of the wedding-planning website \u003ca href=\"https://www.theknot.com/\"\u003eThe Knot\u003c/a\u003e. Kay has, to be sure, noticed a small uptick in women proposing to male partners in the stories shared on The Knot’s sister site HowTheyAsked.com, which she attributes to the ongoing trend of couples riffing on or outright rejecting wedding and engagement traditions in accordance with their own desires. For example, some people propose with items like puppies, artwork, watches, and even new homes instead of rings, Kay told me.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2018/03/marriage-proposals-are-stupid/556403/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: Marriage proposals are stupid\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStill, a woman proposing to a man remains an incredibly rare occurrence, as it was when Warren proposed to Mann. In 1980, when the pair married, marriage rituals had certainly been undergoing some changes, most of which were aimed at making making married partnerships more egalitarian. “In the 1970s, a slightly larger percentage of women kept their own [last] names than in the 1990s, probably because the discovery of just how sexist the marriage laws and customs of the day were had only recently come home to them,” Stephanie Coontz, the director of research and public education for the Council on Contemporary Families and the author of \u003cem\u003eMarriage, a History: How Love Conquered Marriage\u003c/em\u003e, told me in an email. (The 1970s had also seen the rise of measures like \u003ca href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/582476?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents\"\u003e“marriage contracts,”\u003c/a\u003e pre-matrimonial agreements popularized by feminists that laid out the terms and conditions of a marriage in an attempt  to ensure better treatment for wives than wives had historically enjoyed.) Despite all those changes, proposals remained stubbornly male territory. Warren and Mann, Coontz wrote, are “a couple who’d be ahead of their time today and were already ahead of their time (AND our time) then.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEllen Lamont, an assistant professor of sociology at Appalachian State University and the author of the upcoming book \u003cem\u003eThe Mating Game: How Gender Still Shapes How We Date\u003c/em\u003e, chalks this up in large part to resistance to changing gender norms. But, somewhat surprisingly, Lamont found in her book research that in heterosexual relationships, women disliked the idea of being the one to propose more than men disliked the thought of being proposed to by a woman. Of the 66 heterosexual people she interviewed, “a lot of the women and men … were very professionally successful and upper-middle class,” with degrees from top universities, Lamont told me. (Research has shown that since 1980, people like Lamont’s subjects \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2019/01/education-divide-marriage/579688/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eare more likely\u003c/a\u003e than their poorer and less educated peers to be married.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“They were go-getters and high achievers, used to being pretty assertive in life. And some of the women talked to me about how because they were so assertive in life, they wanted the opportunity to feel like they were wanted or chosen, the opportunity to ‘play the girl’ [in the proposal].” In other words, some of the women Lamont spoke to were so used to pursuing what they wanted in their personal and professional lives that a proposal presented a rare opportunity to be pursued instead. “Ritualized moments seem to be where they really wanted gender norms reinforced, because those are turning-point moments that sent a message about the relationship in their minds,” Lamont said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eProposals are a ritualized moment in which society’s mixed messages about women’s roles in relationships seem to collide, with especially confusing results. “On the one hand, women are being told ‘be empowered, take the lead in your relationship.’ On the other hand, they’re also being told, ‘if you take the lead in your relationship and you’re pushing engagement, it’s because he’s not really committed. He doesn’t really love you enough to commit,’” Lamont said. Men, as the stereotype would have it, don’t like commitment, and as a result, Lamont found that women worried about being pitied if they were the ones who ‘had to’ propose to their male partners. “[They worried] that people would think their partner didn’t really love them, and that they wouldn’t have the right story to tell their friends,” Lamont said. “That their friends would be like, Oh, that’s too bad.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat said, Lamont found that although the women she spoke were uninterested in doing the actual proposing, they often took an active role in planning out the moment in less visible, behind-the-scenes ways. “People were planning their proposals together,” she said. One woman Lamont spoke to who had helped plan her male partner’s proposal to her jokingly called it “surprise-ish.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen confronted with the idea of a woman proposing marriage, “the heterosexual men I spoke to did not seem to care,” Lamont said. Sure, it’s possible that because they were being interviewed they wanted to project open-mindedness. Several of the men she spoke to, however, seemed to have never considered the idea before, and when they did, found no real objection to it. “[They’d say,] ‘Yeah, I guess that’s okay with me,’ or ‘I would be fine with that,’” she said. “I don’t think they felt it reflected on them in the same way [women felt it reflected on them].”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMany modern heterosexual partnerships do have notably different gender and power dynamics than they did just a few generations ago. “Men have \u003ca href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/06/12/fathers-day-facts/\"\u003etripled the amount of hands-on childcare they do\u003c/a\u003e; women are increasingly self-confident and assertive at work,” Coontz pointed out. “And acceptance of equality in marriage is now widespread. When there’s a difference in education between a man and a woman who marry, \u003ca href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/02/12/record-share-of-wives-are-more-educated-than-their-husbands/\"\u003eit’s usually that\u003cem\u003e she\u003c/em\u003e has more\u003c/a\u003e—and that is \u003ca href=\"https://contemporaryfamilies.org/gender-revolution-rebound-brief-marriage-becoming-more-egalitarian/\"\u003eno longer\u003c/a\u003e a risk for divorce.

So it’s entirely possible that, especially within Lamont’s set of high-achieving and professionally successful interview subjects, men were simply more accustomed to seeing the women and female partners in their lives take charge, and thus were less alarmed or put off by the prospect of their female partners proposing marriage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eAs Elizabeth Warren tells it, this is how Bruce Mann reacted when his eventual wife proposed to him. After she asked, according to her 2016 Facebook post, Mann spent a moment simply staring back at her. “It was not the first (or last) time that I gob smacked him. If I was a hard-charging, go-to-the-mat-for-whatever-you-believe kind of professor, he was more of a scholarly, camping-out-in-the-archives-poring-over-an-old-legal-manuscript kind. I’m usually the one with the wild schemes, and he’s usually the voice of reason, calmly explaining why it isn’t a great idea to paint the ceiling dark purple or rip all those unknown vines out of the overgrown flower bed by hand (lesson learned: poison ivy),” she wrote. “But he blinked a couple of times, then jumped in with both feet. ‘OK.’”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/Un2P0_-FKn4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/Un2P0_-FKn4/","published":"2019-07-20T10:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-594214"},{"title":"The Origins of the ‘Acting White’ Charge","content":"\u003cp\u003eClassroom integration wasn’t an entirely positive development for black educational prospects. That argument, entirely out of vogue, needs airing amid our reacquaintance with the busing controversy of 50 years ago.

Busing fostered the integration that many districts resisted even after the Supreme Court in \u003ci\u003eBrown v.

The pique she displayed did not magically evaporate once black kids were settled into these white schools—it became the substrate of the black kids’ new schoolroom experience, week in and week out. That kind of rejection can make a person dis-identify from a whole environment, and one result was a sense that school was for white kids, something outside of the authentic black experience.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOver time, open white resistance to black kids in these schools receded as attitudes on race changed. However, a cultural meme casting school as \"white\" had set in and has become self-perpetuating since.

But this is how cultural memes can work. A useful analogy would be the wariness some black people retain even today of hospitals, a legacy of the Tuskegee experiment, under which researchers left black men’s syphilis untreated. A meme can be especially tenacious when it is useful for other purposes. Teens of all stripes seek ways of defining their subgroup, fostering a sense of group membership, and even of acting out.

Studies show that if you ask black kids if they value school, they say yes. But issues of racial identity are subtle. The sociologists, educators, and journalists who point to studies like this would laugh out of the room a paper claiming that you can identify, for example, people’s inner racism by asking them about it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMore useful is a rarely addressed study by Clifton Casteel from 1997, in which white eighth and ninth graders tended to say they did homework for their parents, while black kids said they did homework for their teachers. That is, they had a quiet sense that school was not for what “we” are at heart. Or, Harvard’s Roland Fryer has shown that while the number of white kids who report another white kid as a friend increases with that kid’s GPA, the number of black kids who report another black kid as a friend increases with GPA at a much lower rate, and then plummets after 3.5.

After I wrote a book with a chapter addressing it in 2000, I received—unsolicited—well over a hundred letters from black people explicitly attesting that they were teased as “white” for liking school, often saying that their grades went down as a result, as well as from concerned teachers wondering what to do about black kids telling them that this charge was being lobbed at them. One letter-writer said black kids called him a “nerd” in the early 1960s because he liked school, but that they called his younger siblings  \"white\" for the same reason by the end of that decade.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2019/04/boston-metco-program-school-desegregation/584224/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: The utter inadequacy of America’s efforts to desegregate schools\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDeniers like to cite \u003ca href=\"http://cds.web.unc.edu/files/2012/12/Tyson_2005.pdf\"\u003ea study\u003c/a\u003e by Karolyn Tyson, William Darity, and Domini Castellino, who found that the “acting white” charge mostly flares up in integrated schools “in which socioeconomic status differences between blacks and whites are stark and perceived as corresponding to patterns of placement and achievement.” But why dismiss something that happens only with kids in integrated schools? If anything, this study neatly confirms the “acting white” phenomenon. To wit, black nerds get called “white” when there are white kids around to furnish a basis for the comparison; the problem arises amidst integration.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe weight of studies, reports, and testimonials on “acting white” is so crushing that the indignant resistance from some can seem almost peculiar.

However, these people need not worry that the “acting white” issue interferes with their paradigm. The sense of school as “white” was sparked quite directly by racism—such as that of the whites famous for their opposition to busing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr class=\"c-section-divider\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eNone of this is to imply that the continuing white-black educational achievement gap is the result of black kids calling each other names, or to minimize the very real effects of funding disparities, historical inequities, and the like. My point is simply that school desegregation made a lot of black kids see school as “white”—which can perhaps be classified as collateral damage, given the educational improvements it lent to so many others. However, such an unpleasant and counterproductive side effect is a useful lesson, prodding us to focus not only on desegregation but on making all-black classrooms good ones.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnderlying all the praise directed at Harris is the quiet assumption that there is something fundamentally wrong with an all-black classroom. Is there? After Emancipation, ex-slaves clamored for education. Much of the Civil Rights mission of the late 19th century was centered on building schoolhouses for black people. Even in 1899, students at all-black Dunbar High in Washington, D.C., were outscoring white students across town, while all-black schools in many other cities were similarly excellent. Black Brooklynites had P.S. 91. You would never know from the situation depicted in the fourth season of \u003ci\u003eThe Wire\u003c/i\u003e that in the old days, black kids in Baltimore had the top-class Frederick Douglass High.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/08/who-gets-to-use-black-english/566867/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eJohn McWhorter: There’s nothing wrong with Black English\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBy no means were these flagship schools the whole picture of black education before \u003ci\u003eBrown\u003c/i\u003e; legal segregation was an urgent civil-rights crisis.

Reading should be taught via phonics, not “exploration.” Teach for America has gathered data revealing just what makes for a good teacher, even to poor students, including careful attention to the abilities of each student, fostering parental involvement, and the “I do, we do, you do” method of imparting skills (first via demonstration, next involving the whole class, then assigning each student to do it alone). Education schools must focus less on sociopolitical ideology and more on the nuts and bolts of school-teaching, such as creating a curriculum and maintaining order. Teachers’ unions should be more open to longer schooldays. The idea of school ending for the summer so that kids can help their parents with the harvest must be rethought, of course, which also underscores the importance that schools always be air conditioned.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePresident Obama condemned “the slander that says that a black youth with a book is acting white.” But that slander didn’t exist in the old days and needs not exist today. We just need to get past an unintended variant kind of slander—assuming that a black youth has a book because he goes to school with whites. Desegregation forever, indeed—but let’s not forget that lots of learning can go on in all-black schools as well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/KUt8dg26vE8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/KUt8dg26vE8/","published":"2019-07-20T10:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-594130"},{"title":"Sometimes Even Newspapers Need Poetry","content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eEditor\u0026rsquo;s Note:\u003c/em\u003e This article is part of a \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/projects/apollo-11-moon-landing-anniversary\"\u003eseries\u003c/a\u003e reflecting on the Apollo 11 mission, 50 years later. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIt is difficult to imagine a more daunting task for a newspaper editor than planning the next day’s front page when the world has just witnessed humanity’s crowning achievement: the successful landing of two of its kind on an alien world.

On that occasion, too, the \u003cem\u003eTimes\u003c/em\u003e had turned to MacLeish, then 76 years of age and six years retired from his professorship at Harvard.

When the earth was the World — all the world there was — and the stars were lights in Dante’s heaven, and the ground beneath men’s feet roofed Hell, they saw themselves as creatures at the center of the universe, the sole, particular concern of God — and from that high place they ruled and killed and conquered as they pleased.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eAnd when, centuries later, the earth was no longer the World but a small, wet spinning planet in the solar system of a minor star off at the edge of an inconsiderable galaxy in the immeasurable distances of space — when Dante’s heaven had disappeared and there was no Hell (at least no Hell beneath the feet) — men began to see themselves not as God-directed actors at the center of a noble drama, but as helpless victims of a senseless farce where all the rest were helpless victims also and millions could be killed in world-wide wars or in blasted cities or in concentration camps without a thought or reason but the reason — if we call it one — of force.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eNow, in the last few hours, the notion may have changed again.

And seeing it so, one question came to the minds of those who looked at it. “Is it inhabited?” they said to each other and laughed — and then they did not laugh. What came to their minds a hundred thousand miles and more into space — “half way to the moon” they put it — what came to their minds was the life on that little, lonely, floating planet; that tiny raft in the enormous, empty night. “Is it inhabited?”\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe medieval notion of the earth put man at the center of everything.

Of course, two men were already there: Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, the Apollo 11 astronauts who became the first human beings to set foot on the lunar surface. However, the members of Pink Floyd—David Gilmour, Roger Waters, Nick Mason, and Richard Wright—weren’t using science, calculus, and technology to transport people through space on that fateful evening. They were using music, specifically an improvised and largely forgotten song called “Moonhead.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe piece isn’t ranked with Pink Floyd classics such as “Wish You Were Here” or “Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2.” Over the decades, “Moonhead” has remained one of the most overlooked entries in the band’s canon, despite its historic status. Pink Floyd was commissioned by the BBC to perform instrumental music live on the air as the Apollo 11 crew’s video and audio signals came streaming in across the emptiness of space, beating the Soviets at the race that had been spurred on by John F. Kennedy’s rousing moonshot speech in 1962.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePink Floyd was uniquely qualified for the task. Syd Barrett, the group’s founding frontman, had parted ways with his bandmates in 1968, after his struggles with mental illness and drug use had made working with him almost impossible. But before he left, Barrett had stamped on the band a fascination with both science fact and fiction, as heard on such songs as “Astronomy Domine” and “Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun,” which Barrett either wrote or contributed to. By the summer of 1968, Pink Floyd was nowhere near the superstar level it would reach in the ’70s, but it was a cult band whose psychedelic explorations were firmly associated with outer space.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt was no surprise, then, that the BBC tapped Pink Floyd to appear on a special Apollo 11–themed episode of \u003cem\u003eOmnibus\u003c/em\u003e titled, with perhaps with the slightest dearth of decorum, “So What If It’s Just Green Cheese?” This irreverent sentiment was reiterated in the middle of Pink Floyd’s performance of “Moonhead,” when an unidentified narrator breaks into the song to exclaim, “So they’re there, a quarter of a million miles away, up there on the moon, and early tomorrow morning they’ll step out and see once and for all if it’s green cheese or not”—referring to the fact that, in the wee hours of July 21, 1969, Armstrong would leave \u003cem\u003eHomo sapiens\u003c/em\u003e’ first boot print on the moon, followed about 19 minutes later by Aldrin. For good measure, a young Judi Dench and a young Ian McKellen—pre-Dame and pre-Sir—read lighthearted poetry on the program.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe levity is understandable. Laughter was one way to deal with the very real possibility of failure—not to mention the existential enormity—that came with the Apollo 11 mission. Who were we, after all, to dare walk on the moon? It was a feat of hubris that echoed Icarus’s own. Amid all the triumphalism of Apollo 11’s anticipated success was a dark underside. A few jokes here and there helped keep spirits up, hence the raft of novelty songs that appeared at the time, from the psychedelic sound of “Man in the Moon” by the group Village to the hilariously twangy single “First Country Singer on the Moon” by Don Lewis.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe BBC’s suspense-puncturing quip about green cheese wasn’t enough to deflate the grandeur and mystique of “Moonhead.” Constructed of cosmic guitar effects, pulses of percussion, and Waters’s ominously descending bass line, it’s an eerie piece of improvisation that translates the breathtaking awe of the moon landing into music. Gilmour dismissed the song humbly as “a nice, spacey, atmospheric, 12-bar blues” that sounded “a bit off the wall,” but it’s much more than that. Presaging the ambient and new-age music movements that would come into their own in the ’70s, “Moonhead” is both ahead of its time and solidly a product of the moment—the zeitgeist caught in a vacuum tube.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLater, Gilmour realized the song’s place in history. “It brought it home to me, powerfully, that you could look up at the moon and there would be people standing on it,” he said. “It was fantastic to be thinking that we were in there making up a piece of music, while the astronauts were standing on the moon.” According to Gilmour, the song also marked a turning point for the band—the point at which outer space ceased to be Pink Floyd’s preoccupation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“It didn’t have a significant impact on our later work,” Gilmour said of “Moonhead.” “I think at the time Roger, our lyricist, was looking more into going inwards, going into the inner space of the human mind and condition. And I think that was sort of the end of our exploration into outer space.” Once you’ve officially soundtracked the occasion of humanity’s first steps on another astronomical body, where do you go with space music? Even the band’s wildly successful 1973 album, \u003cem\u003eThe Dark Side of the Moon\u003c/em\u003e, used lunar imagery as a metaphor for the inner condition rather than a subject in and of itself.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Moonhead” was included on numerous bootleg recordings over the decades, sometimes alternatively titled “Trip on Mars.” But it wasn’t officially released until 2016, on the Pink Floyd box set \u003cem\u003eThe Early Years 1965–1972\u003c/em\u003e. The song’s obscurity isn’t that hard to understand; Pink Floyd was more or less an underground band until \u003cem\u003eThe Dark Side of the Moon\u003c/em\u003e was released, and “Moonhead” was an ephemeral, extemporized thing, as fleeting as a wisp of lunar dust. Plus, it was overshadowed by the other song that was played on the “Green Cheese” episode of \u003cem\u003eOmnibus\u003c/em\u003e: a new single by a barely known singer-songwriter named David Bowie that had been written and recorded as both an homage to Stanley Kubrick’s 1968 film \u003cem\u003e2001: A Space Odyssey\u003c/em\u003e and as a vehicle to capitalize on the Apollo 11 craze.

Eminent rock bands such as The Byrds released songs such as 1969’s “Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins,” which celebrated the achievements of the three Apollo 11 astronauts, including \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/michael-collins-moon-landing-apollo-11/594238/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eorbiting Michael Collins\u003c/a\u003e, relegated to the dark side of the Moon as Armstrong and Aldrin strode lunar soil.

Eventually, popular music’s obsession with space took on different forms, as the Apollo program wound down, the Viking program took unmanned probes to Mars, the Voyager program carried musical messages beyond our solar system, and the space shuttle became fully operational. But in “Moonhead,” Pink Floyd encapsulated one of rock and roll’s—and one of humanity’s—most astounding eras.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/2daRyTFKeo8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/2daRyTFKeo8/","published":"2019-07-20T13:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-594343"},{"title":"The Most Delightful Moments of the Apollo 11 Mission","content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eEditor\u0026rsquo;s Note:\u003c/em\u003e This article is part of a \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/projects/apollo-11-moon-landing-anniversary\"\u003eseries\u003c/a\u003e reflecting on the Apollo 11 mission, 50 years later. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eApollo 11 was all about the destination, but there was more to the mission than the landing itself.

But all five could be found guilty of \u0026#8220;aiding and abetting\u0026#8221; the involuntary manslaughter, as well as charged for obstruction of justice and concealment of evidence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWould Bonnie be found guilty?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Fox, California law stipulates that circumstances exist in which taking a life to defend not only yourself but also someone else in danger can be justified. It\u0026#8217;s called the \u0026#8220;defense of others,\u0026#8221; and if argued successfully, would clear up Bonnie\u0026#8217;s case. \u0026#8220;To succeed,\u0026#8221; Fox explains to TIME, \u0026#8220;Bonnie would have to prove three things: that (1) she had a reasonable belief that (2) the amount of force she used was necessary to protect the other person from (3) imminent threat of serious injury.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Fox\u0026#8217;s view, the facts are in favor of Bonnie. He thinks it\u0026#8217;s perfectly reasonable for her \u0026#8220;to have believed that she needed to run up and shove a large man like Perry with two hands in order to stop him from severely beating and kicking the smaller Celeste\u0026#8230; in light of the other three women\u0026#8217;s apparent inability to slow the ongoing assault.\u0026#8221; The fact that Perry fell to his death is admittedly \u0026#8220;tragic,\u0026#8221; Fox allows. \u0026#8220;But it doesn\u0026#8217;t make Bonnie\u0026#8217;s pushing him a violent felony.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHorowitz has a slightly more cautious take. He suggests the defense of others argument could fail if a jury found that the force used to defend \u003cspan class=\"il\"\u003eCeleste\u003c/span\u003e was excessive, which would be considered \u0026#8220;imperfect self-defense.\u0026#8221; It does help that there\u0026#8217;s no evidence Bonnie ever had \u0026#8220;specific intent to kill\u0026#8221; before she pushed Perry, making the more serious murder charge unlikely to begin with. With manslaughter, Bonnie could also claim \u0026#8220;diminished mental capacity\u0026#8221; and PTSD due to her own abusive relationship with her mother during childhood, Horowitz says \u0026mdash; she tells her unconscious mother that she envisioned that she was pushing her, not Perry \u0026mdash; and argue down the charges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWould the rest of the Monterey 5 be found guilty?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other members of the Monterey Five are in a slightly different situation from Bonnie. \u0026#8220;Technically, the other female characters present at the scene who later lied for Bonnie might be liable for aiding and abetting the involuntary manslaughter as accomplices,\u0026#8221; Dagodag explains. There are questions about obstruction of justice, too, which \u0026mdash; if one is found guilty \u0026mdash; can carry a sentence of up to five years in prison along with fines, or probation and community service.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFurther, their lie itself becomes a problem, as it is a crime to \u0026#8220;conceal, or attempt to conceal, evidence of accidental death,\u0026#8221; which is exactly what Madeline, Jane, Celeste, Bonnie and Renata have been doing; convictions on that count can carry up to a year in a county jail under the California penal code. Madeline in particular has the potential to be charged with \u0026#8220;dissuading a witness,\u0026#8221; Horowitz notes. Dagodag agrees that Bonnie, however, could use the \u0026#8220;defense of others\u0026#8221; defense in this case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eBut are circumstances any different for Celeste?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike the other women, Celeste\u0026#8217;s actions could qualify her as an accessory to the crime, or she could be liable for obstruction of justice and concealment charges. That said, she has an extra defense, Horowitz notes: She could also argue for \u0026#8220;diminished mental capacity\u0026#8221; and show evidence of PTSD and \u0026#8220;battered women\u0026#8217;s syndrome,\u0026#8221; which would help her avoid the conspiracy and accessory after the fact charges, like Bonnie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut right now Celeste has her more immediate custody battle against \u003ca href=\"https://time.com/5627477/big-little-lies-meryl-streep-mary-louise-name/\" \u003eMary Louise Wright\u003c/a\u003e (Meryl Streep) to deal with.

Before they slept Saturday night, their rest period was delayed an hour-and-a-half because of a pesky communications problem, finally tracked down. They were awakened at 7:02 a.m. Sunday, Armstrong with five-and-a-half hours sleep, Collins with six, Aldrin with five. It was the shortest rest period of the flight. They spent half an hour on breakfast. Mission Control beamed up the latest on their families, and the morning news.

Aldrin was the first into the Eagle at 9:20 a.m. Almost an hour later, Armstrong slipped through the tunnel to join him. From then on, they were Eagle. Collins was Columbia. At 12:32 p.m., they pushed a button that extended the landing legs of Eagle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThus did Columbia and Eagle, still linked together, arrive at this incredible time and place, out of sight and out of radio contact with earth on their 13th orbit of the moon. Some 100 hours had passed since they had left their home planet. Now they were 240,000 miles away from it, about to commit themselves to history. Behind the moon, Collins pressed a simple button. Latches clicked open. Springs gave Eagle a gentle shove. On earth they waited for word. Finally the radio signal came through. It was Armstrong\u0026rsquo;s voice crackling with static. \u0026ldquo;The Eagle has wings,\u0026rdquo; he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow briefly they flew formation together, Collins looking over the weird little ship Columbia had borne this far. \u0026ldquo;Looks like you\u0026rsquo;ve got a mighty good looking flying machine there, Eagle,\u0026rdquo; he said, \u0026ldquo;despite the fact you\u0026rsquo;re upside down.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Somebody\u0026rsquo;s upside down,\u0026rdquo; replied Eagle.

Eagle was on its own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, they passed behind the moon, to that point in orbit where major changes are made, again out of sight of earth and out of radio contact. Armstrong and Aldrin tilted their little ship so that the rocket faced the direction of flight. When they emerged from behind the lunar shadow, the earth heard Armstrong say, \u0026ldquo;The burn was on time.\u0026rdquo; Collins confirmed, \u0026ldquo;Listen babe, everything is going just swimmingly.\u0026rdquo; The descent to the moon\u0026rsquo;s surface had begun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEagle flew the long, looping arc, riding its tail of rocket fire like a brake, cutting into its 3,700 miles per hour speed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Current altitude about 46,000 feet,\u0026rdquo; reported Mission Control. \u0026ldquo;Everything\u0026rsquo;s looking good here.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEagle: \u0026ldquo;Our position check downrange shows us to be a little off.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMission Control: \u0026ldquo;You are to continue powered descent.

But his heart rate was running some 40 beats a minute higher than normal. Now some thing happened to send it to 156 beats a minute, but his voice never betrayed it. He saw the landing site below strewn with boulders. He overrode the automatic landing stem, grasping the rocket controls in his right hand, skimming over the littered field, searching out a clear spot: \u0026ldquo;540 feet . . . 400 feet, coming down nicely . . . 200 feet . . . 100 feet . . . 75 feet, still looking good, drifting to the right a little . . .\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt 40 feet billows of dust kicked up by the rocket rose around the craft. \u0026ldquo;Okay . . . engines stopped.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Houston,\u0026rdquo; said Armstrong tentatively.

The Eagle has landed.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Roger, Tranquility,\u0026rdquo; sighed Mission Control. \u0026ldquo;We copy you on the ground. You got a bunch of guys about to turn blue. We\u0026rsquo;re breathing again.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe time was 4:18p.m. Cape Kennedy time, Sunday, July 20, 1969. Man had landed on the moon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the White House, President Nixon watched televised reports with Frank Borman. The last 22 seconds, he said, was more like half an hour. When he caught his breath he sent the astronauts his congratulations. \u0026ldquo;It was,\u0026rdquo; he said, \u0026ldquo;one of the greatest moments of our time.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last minute difficulties were explained by Buzz Aldrin: \u0026ldquo;That may have seemed like a very long final phase. The auto targeting was taking us right into a football-field sized crater. There\u0026rsquo;s a large number of big boulders and rocks for about one or two crater diameters around it. And it required us to . . . fly in manually over the rock field to find a reasonably good area.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArmstrong noted: \u0026ldquo;You might be interested to know that I don\u0026rsquo;t think we noticed any difficulty at all in adapting to one-sixth gravity. It seems immediately natural to move in this environment.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAhead, he said, was \u0026ldquo;a relatively level plain, cratered with a fairly large number of craters of the five-to-50-foot variety, and some ridges, small, 20-30 feet high. I would guess. And literally thousands of little one- and two-foot craters around the area. We see some angular rocks several hundred feet in front of us that are probably two feet in size and have angular edges. There is a hill in view just about on the ground track ahead of us. Difficult to estimate, but might be a half a mile or a mile.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Be advised,\u0026rdquo; said Mission Control, \u0026ldquo;there are lots of smiling faces here, and all around the world.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;There are two up here also,\u0026rdquo; replied Armstrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t forget the one up here,\u0026rdquo;\u003ca href=\"https://time.com/5624528/michael-collins-apollo-11/\" \u003e called down Collins on his lonely patrol\u003c/a\u003e. Then he added his compliments: \u0026ldquo;Tranquility Base, you guys did a fantastic job.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Just keep that orbiting base up there for us,\u0026rdquo; Armstrong replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first duties were to check out the spacecraft. That done, Armstrong and Aldrin concentrated on describing sights no one had ever seen before. \u0026ldquo;Out of the hatch,\u0026rdquo; Aldrin said, \u0026#8220;I\u0026#8217;m looking at the earth, big and round and beautiful.\u0026rdquo; The sun played games with the color of the lunar rocks around them. \u0026ldquo;Almost every variety of rock you could find,\u0026rdquo; Aldrin said, looking out the window. \u0026ldquo;The color varies, depending on how you\u0026rsquo;re looking at it. Doesn\u0026rsquo;t appear to be much of a general color at all.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEagle stood some four miles beyond its planned landing site. It was also on a slight tilt, but not enough to endanger takeoff. \u0026ldquo;The guys that said we wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be able to tell precisely where we are are the winners today,\u0026rdquo; Armstrong said. \u0026ldquo;We were a little busy worrying about program alarms and things like that in the part of the descent where we would normally be picking out our landing spot.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, they bled the pressure from their spacecraft, letting oxygen out, vacuum in. At 10:40 p.m., Armstrong reported, \u0026ldquo;The hatch is coming open.\u0026rdquo; Then, following Aldrin\u0026rsquo;s instructions, he began to back out onto the porch of the spacecraft, taking care that his suit did not catch or snag in the narrow opening. It was slow going. His 185-pound suit, weighing only some 30 pounds in lunar gravity, was more a hindrance because of its bulk than its weight. Suddenly he was standing on the porch of Eagle, beginning the tentative steps down the nine rungs of the ladder. On the way he pulled a lanyard releasing an equipment shelf and a television camera. Now, on screens all over the earth, you could see the stark shadows, and there, swinging, searching, a boot, Armstrong\u0026rsquo;s boot. Bit by bit, the whole man appeared. Now, off the last rung, onto the saucer-like footpad. Then, cautiously again, unsure of what was below it, he stepped with his left foot, a size 9\u0026frac12; foot in a clumsy, awkward step. He pressed the lunar surface at 10:56 p.m. His\u003ca href=\"https://time.com/5621999/neil-armstrong-quote/\" \u003e first words\u003c/a\u003e were, \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind.\u0026rdquo; For 20 minutes he walked alone on the alien soil of the moon before Buzz Aldrin followed the same backward route down the ladder to join him. Aldrin looked around and his first words were, \u0026ldquo;Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. A magnificent desolation.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"inline-portrait_small_2x alignnone \"\u003e\u003cimg data-attachment-id=\"5630533\" data-permalink=\"https://time.com/5630478/apollo-11-moon-landing-timeline/edwin-aldrin-on-moon/\" data-orig-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/apollo_photo-6.jpg?quality=85\" data-orig-size=\"1992,1934\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"NEIL ARMSTRONG\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Edwin \\\"Buzz\\\" Aldrin carries scientific experiments to a deployment site south of the lunar module Eagle.

It’s definitely possible for certain writers of certain kinds of stories to keep things fresh and interesting even after they’ve put their central couple together, but Thomas has always said he’s not one of those writers. That means that, in order to make more seasons of \u003cem\u003eVeronica Mars\u003c/em\u003e after this one, he has to split Logan and Veronica apart. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"M4rj8f\"\u003eBut fans might be shocked by just how permanently the show has split the pair apart by the end of season four.

He’s not even talking broadly about a climate crisis. This is a political storm. (And as far as political storms go, Sanford isn’t directly talking about President Donald Trump’s conduct in office, either.) The former South Carolina governor turned House lawmaker, who lost his primary challenge after \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/6/12/17455714/trump-sanford-arrington-south-carolina-primary\"\u003eTrump tweeted\u003c/a\u003e against him, is talking about the national debt. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"TzfO0T\"\u003eIn one month, Sanford says he will decide whether he has enough support to mount a primary challenge against Trump for president. If he decides to do it, he’ll be challenging the man who left him unemployed. But notably, Sanford, who has been a vocal critic of Trump in the past, isn’t here to reclaim morality, or stand against Trump’s racist rhetoric. Trump’s racism is all distraction, Sanford says, from what he sees as the true problem facing America: bloated Social Security and Medicare programs raising the national debt. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"IZq735\"\u003e“It’s this sort of nuclear swirl with Trump in the center of it in Republican circles, and in the process, we’re not talking about issues like the debt and the deficit that I think really are going to impact people’s lives in profound ways,” he said. “I would rather you get a little more excited about debt, deficit, and government spending than the tone I hear in your voice. I want passion. I want passion on this subject.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"9WOoA9\"\u003eBut the thing is, Republicans have tried to champion “entitlement reform” for years and failed. Trump came into the game, realized it was incredibly unpopular with voters, and dumped it altogether. Former House Speaker Paul Ryan called it one of his biggest \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/11/29/18118216/paul-ryan-regrets-immigration-debt\"\u003eregrets\u003c/a\u003e of leaving office. Under Ryan’s leadership, Republicans passed tax cuts geared toward corporations, and massive budgets to boost the military, \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/10/19/17989664/deficit-tax-cuts-donald-trump-disaster-relief\"\u003egrowing the deficit to $779 billion in 2018\u003c/a\u003e, the largest since 2012, when the country was still seeing the effects of the recession. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"a5X5iH\"\u003eThe bottom line: Sanford doesn’t care that voters don’t like hearing about cuts to Medicare and Social Security. He’s scared of what he says will be a Great Depression-scale crisis, and he wants America to be scared too. (To be clear, there’s\u003ca href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/aea/2019conference/program/pdf/14020_paper_etZgfbDr.pdf\"\u003e a lot of debate about\u003c/a\u003e this, and a growing \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/4/16/18251646/modern-monetary-theory-new-moment-explained\"\u003eeconomic theory on the left\u003c/a\u003e that could reshape conventional thinking about deficits.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"HtWscl\"\u003e“What is needed is more of a country doctor.

Because if you are to run for president, that’s what you will be going up against. When you were in the House — with the Republican majority — the conventional wisdom was that Trump’s rhetoric can be ignored and defended as long as Republicans could pass a conservative agenda. That’s gone now. So when you see your colleagues defending Trump telling American-born citizens, sitting lawmakers, to be “sent back,” how do you understand that? \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"J3IwPm\"\u003eMark Sanford\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"hCMeUs\"\u003eI understand it within the context of politics. No one wants to be on the wrong side of the aisle with Trump. I’m probably poster child 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 in that demonstration. He was dancing on my grave — nobody wants that. I get it. Part of that is self-preservation, which drives a lot of action in politics. Part of it is that people can legitimately see it different ways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"QCjxLw\"\u003eWhat I am saying is this: I think everybody wants out of this \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/7/19/20699261/trump-conservatism-omar-racism-rally-send-her-back\"\u003espin cycle\u003c/a\u003e. It is exhausting and counterproductive. And what happens is that the president goes out and says something crazy. You guys in the media highlight it. His opponents go out and react. And then what is  left for a Republican colleague who is still in the Senate or the House is “Oh, my goodness, which side of the aisle do I go on?” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"V5oQSN\"\u003eI’m not saying they don’t have a choice.

And there is a view that — this book is not about that — but there is a view that the Founding Fathers were more than aware of that, so they built in a lot of checks and balances, which has made the government agonizingly frustrating and slow-moving, but it is by design based on the Founding Fathers’ observations of history and the dangers of unfettered power in any one hand or institution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"Wl1UXg\"\u003eTara Golshan\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"T2YZ1v\"\u003ePolling, popular opinion, all that aside, do you think Trump has committed impeachable offenses when you are talking about checks and balance?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"sUrQmN\"\u003eMark Sanford\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"9HWFuF\"\u003eI’m not in Congress.

But think about this. I just got through watching two Democratic presidential debates. And there was one question by a moderator or commentary by a candidate on debt, deficit, or government spending. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"zQZXZr\"\u003eWe have a president who has ruled out action on the very things that drive our debt and deficit.

I’m just saying wait a minute, I see a hurricane coming in from offshore and I know it’s a pleasant day on the coast of South Carolina right now, but this thing is coming our way, will be here in a short time, might we not want to have a conversation about this?

You have diffused costs and concentrated benefits to every program that’s out there, so the people people who want something, the government will show up, and the people who don’t are just trying to manage their life. People want to say yes. People want to have a reasonably good day in Washington or in their state capital. So you have this bias toward more in the way of spending. More in the way of deficit and debt.

For a while, George Bush did. But now you have this president, he said no, we are not going to deal with that issue. What I would argue is that we are now at a tipping point.

This is fundamentally a corporate tax reduction and restructuring bill. So the bet was, we were certainly out of line with the rest of the industrial world in terms of corporate rates. We were seeing corporate inversions. But I’ll put it to you this way. The tax cut was based on, could we make our corporate environment more inviting. And I said at the time, this was an educated bet but not a guarantee. They could take that money and, instead of reinvesting it, buy back stock.

We have rich emotional landscapes that are far more complex than those of, say, fish. Right? \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"EkKitQ\"\u003eA recent \u003ca href=\"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2019.0760\"\u003estudy\u003c/a\u003e shows that fish are more emotionally complex than we give them credit for. Scientists at the University of Burgundy in France studied one called the convict cichlid, a monogamous fish species that forms long-lasting pairs. They found that when female cichlids lose their chosen mates, they become glum and more pessimistic about the world. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"oTXSfM\"\u003eIt turns out emotional attachment to a partner is not unique to humans or even to mammals. Breakups really suck, even if you’re a fish. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"xSX9EH\"\u003eThe scientists started by giving females a chance to express a preference between two males. In a tank partitioned into three compartments, the female fish was put in the middle, and a male was put on either side of her. After seeing, hearing, and — let’s be real — judging them through the mesh partitions, she huddled up close to the one she liked best. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"aElpBF\"\u003eBut the scientists didn’t allow all the female fish to stay with their chosen mates. In some cases, the researchers split them up and paired the females with the males they’d rejected. They found that these unfortunately paired fish couples were slower to spawn than the others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"V11Mcj\"\u003eNow, the scientists switched gears. They exposed the female fish to little clay boxes in the tank. Boxes with white lids contained food (one yummy larva, to be exact), while boxes with black lids contained nothing. The fish learned that with some effort, they could suck or push off the lids, and they gradually figured out that a white lid means there’ll be a treat inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"3xbJcL\"\u003eHere’s the tricky bit: The scientists then introduced a third kind of box, this one with a grey lid. They wanted to see how the female fish would respond to an ambiguous signal — halfway between white and black — and whether the response would correlate with whether the fish had gotten to stay with her chosen mate or had been separated from him and paired with the reject instead. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"1Z65TE\"\u003eThe researchers hypothesized that females who’d been made optimistic by a positive experience would push off the grey lids, expecting to find food, while females who’d been made pessimistic wouldn’t bother to make the effort. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"VZQcuG\"\u003eAnd that’s exactly what happened. “Females that were assigned their non-preferred partner exhibited pessimistic bias,” the researchers wrote in the journal \u003ca href=\"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2019.0760\"\u003eProceedings of the Royal Society B\u003c/a\u003e, “which indicates a negative affective state.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"JPyNb4\"\u003eOr as Chloé Laubu, the study’s lead author, \u003ca href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jun/12/lovelorn-fish-have-gloomier-outlook-study-finds\"\u003eexplained\u003c/a\u003e, “A good analogy would be the way you perceive the glass either half-full or half-empty according to your mood.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"W93Meb\"\u003eStudies like these are important because they can challenge our conventional views of which animals possess sentience — the ability to feel sensations like pain and pleasure — and to what degree.

That can be a good thing — the alternative to running a deficit is stockpiling money you could be using to do good — but it means at some point they’ll need to slash programs or grow their base of permanent supporters. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"MUTMyT\"\u003e“We are running a deficit of several million each year, even as we have taken on multi-year commitments to clinics and research studies.

While it’s fun to donate as part of a big viral event like the Ice Bucket Challenge, you can often do a lot more for a charity if you donate regularly, and if you double-check to see if the core programs you want to fund have room for more funding — that is, additional money will be spent on those programs if it’s received. No matter how important a charity’s work is, that’s only one part of the equation for effectiveness; there’s also the question of how (and whether) additional money will enable them to do more important work down the line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"wKHvrG\"\u003eBut none of that means donations can’t be worthwhile, or make a significant difference. Drugs and therapies that the ALS Association funded are headed through the research pipeline. From 2014 to 2018, the NIH has provided more than $208 million in funds to researchers that the ALS Association had previously funded. The association has increased the number of patients served by 28 percent, to more than 20,000. And in many local chapters, people diagnosed with ALS — who typically have fewer than five years left to live — will no longer spend that time on a long waitlist for a powered wheelchair. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"hayj8k\"\u003eMoney matters.

But beyond the image problem for Sanders that field staff are hoping to exploit in order to get themselves a raise, it’s a case study in the power and the limits of Sanders’s less wonky, more moralistic version of left-wing politics. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"Wb6BBP\"\u003eLow salaries + long workweeks = low pay \u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ys1miF\"\u003eThe underlying issue is that while the Sanders campaign’s collective bargaining agreement with its staff union \u003ca href=\"https://t.co/E8MW4Taftb\"\u003esets hourly pay above $15\u003c/a\u003e, there are also salaried workers on the team. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"L4XlCR\"\u003eField staff earn $36,000 a year, which would be above minimum wage on a standard workweek, but Sanders field personnel say they’re actually working about 60 hours a week — for an hourly wage of $13. Long hours are typical of campaign work (you have a limited span of time in which to win the thing, after all), but these particular positions fall into a kind of legal and sociocultural black hole. The norm in America was that low-status workers would be paid an hourly wage and thus be eligible for overtime pay if they worked long hours. Salaried workers wouldn’t necessarily get overtime for pulling long shifts, but salaried work was associated with high-skill, high-status, well-compensated white-collar work. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"iuJvFS\"\u003eBut capitalism abhors a vacuum, so over time, more and more low-paid workers found themselves in the category of being salaried and ineligible for overtime. The Obama administration tried to tackle this with a \u003ca href=\"https://t.co/VQg75xULJ7\"\u003eLabor Department regulation mandating overtime for anyone earning less than $47,000\u003c/a\u003e, but it was challenged in court and the Trump administration elected not to defend the rule, instead writing a new \u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2019/03/08/trump-administration-releases-new-overtime-rules/?noredirect=on\u0026amp;utm_term=.e35f2f6f9f75\"\u003erule that set the threshold at $35,000\u003c/a\u003e. At an annual salary just below that threshold, Sanders’s field staff would be collecting lots of overtime and thus earning more than $36,000, but instead, their salary was pegged (perhaps not coincidentally) to be just above the exempt threshold. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"RhLlws\"\u003eThis is, of course, just the Sanders campaign operating by the rules as written.

And, of course, in his capacity as a member of the Senate Democratic Caucus, he \u003ca href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/bernie-sanders-regular-luxurious-dscc-fundraising-retreats\"\u003eattended the caucus’s ritzy retreats for big contributors\u003c/a\u003e.

If he were in charge of American campaign finance law, he might make everything publicly funded, but he’s not. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"AHoEx1\"\u003eBy the same token, he’s not in charge of American labor law. If he were, all low wage workers for all campaigns might be better paid. But if he single-handedly raises pay, he could be putting himself at a disadvantage — which is a pretty normal reason not to want to do something. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"8aI4Kk\"\u003eThis is what minimum wage skeptics have been saying\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"GXHMCy\"\u003eBeyond the question of campaign optics, however, this is exactly the point that opponents of minimum wage increases are always making — if you force employers to pay more, they’re going to respond by cutting back elsewhere. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Fzv4Ld\"\u003eIf Sanders increases the compensation for his field staff, he might end up needing to employ fewer field staffers. Alternatively, he might need to cut back on other areas of expense like travel, staging rallies, or running television ads. It would be misleading to say, as minimum wage opponents sometimes do, that some iron law of supply and demand dictates a cutback on field staff.

Months ago, he drafted a bill that didn’t make much sense and \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/9/11/17831970/stop-bezos-bernie-sanders\"\u003ecalled it the Stop Bezos Act\u003c/a\u003e to dramatize his sense of moral outrage at the fact that America’s richest man employed so many near-impoverished workers. Soon afterward, \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/10/3/17932884/amazon-minimum-wage-increase\"\u003eAmazon announced a hike in low-wage pay\u003c/a\u003e and attracted public acclaim from Sanders for their trouble.

As an example of this from another policy domain, Sanders hustled last week to Philadelphia to join community groups in rallying against a private equity company that wanted to close down a hospital and redevelop the site as condos — announcing at the rally that he plans to introduce legislation that would stop this well before his staff had actually crafted any such bill. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"bobYSZ\"\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"\u003e\n\u003cp lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003ei mean, i'm not done writing the bill yet\u003c/p\u003e— Lori Kearns (@lori_kearns) \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/lori_kearns/status/1150923380176171008?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"\u003eJuly 16, 2019\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cscript async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"cUihqr\"\u003eOn the minimum wage, Democrats’ bill says \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/7/18/20697509/minimum-wage-bill-raise-the-wage-act\"\u003eeveryone should be paid at least $15 an hour\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"LRmdab\"\u003eThat bill would, yes, apply to companies like Walmart that are closely associated with one particular wealthy family.

This is not an uncontested point of view by any means, but it’s certainly a credible one. What that literature says, however, is that there aren’t aggregate job losses. And it’s almost certainly true that if Sanders decided to raise pay for his field staff and then make up the budget hole by laying some of them off, those newly unemployed field staffers wouldn’t end up permanently jobless — they’d go find some other work. Historically, though, one reason campaign work has involved such punishing hours and low pay is that it’s something a lot of people want to do. They feel passionately about their candidate, and the job is inherently temporary, so it doesn’t necessarily need to pay a long-term sustainable wage.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"68YX9g\"\u003eCommonsense morality perceives a significant difference between passionate young people working to advance a cause on shoestring budgets and adults trying to support a family on minimum wage jobs working for billionaire-owned retail conglomerates. That’s why the examples Sanders picks for his crusades are big companies with easily identifiable rich owners. But to try to translate that distinction into policy would be the work of fussy, detail-oriented wonks, which is not really Sanders’s thing. \u003c/p\u003e","url":"https://www.vox.com/2019/7/20/20700841/bernie-sanders-minimum-wage-staff-pay","published":"2019-07-20T13:00:00Z","guid":"https://www.vox.com/2019/7/20/20700841/bernie-sanders-minimum-wage-staff-pay"},{"title":"Why the ending of Game of Thrones elevated the worst of fan culture","content":"\u003cimg alt=\"Game of Thrones finale Bran Stark\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z-cqi33QcChcZLw5zGwXUrjm_Ss=/89x0:2889x2100/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/64772247/4724F294_885A_4BC0_954F_E7947BFAB591.0.jpeg\" /\u003e\n\n  \u003csmall\u003eThe face of a man who’s definitely a Hanzo main. | HBO\u003c/small\u003e\n\n  \u003cp\u003eGame of Thrones turned Bran Stark into a tired geek power fantasy — at its own expense.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp id=\"4BRWCC\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/game-of-thrones\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eGame of Thrones\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e’ \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/5/20/18632090/game-of-thrones-series-finale-the-iron-throne-recap-winners-losers-house-stark-daenerys\"\u003eending\u003c/a\u003e left many fans disappointed with what they viewed as \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/game-of-thrones/2019/5/20/18632343/game-of-thrones-finale-season-8-bran-tyrion-iron-throne\"\u003elazy or misguided storytelling\u003c/a\u003e, or sloppy writing that abandoned many of the show’s \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/5/22/18634056/game-of-thrones-series-finale-questions-ending\"\u003elongstanding plot threads\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"92fq1E\"\u003eAmong the most hotly debated, even confusing choices the show made was the issue of who would finally rule what was left of Westeros.

Part of the frustration stems from something beyond the world of \u003cem\u003eGame of Thrones\u003c/em\u003e: By naming him king, Bran Stark is cemented as a perfect analogue for a certain type of protector of geek culture; specifically, fans (often male) who are rigidly deferent to the original lore of a story, often alienating other (typically marginalized) fans who support a more flexible approach. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"PmkJ66\"\u003eWithin our own real-world context, Bran’s ascension to rulership feels like a myopic, self-aggrandizing celebration of curatorial fandom, or the specific way in which many fans worship canon — in this case, \u003cem\u003eGame of Thrones\u003c/em\u003e’ source material, the \u003cem\u003eSong of Ice and Fire\u003c/em\u003e book series by George R.R.

Ending the show with Bran in charge of Westeros codifies a male-dominated version of geek culture that reflects mainstream perceptions about fandom and aligns generally with the show’s \u003ca href=\"https://tv.avclub.com/rape-of-thrones-1798267897\"\u003efrequent\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/5/17/18624767/game-of-thrones-series-finale-season-8-episode-5-the-bells-daenerys-dany-kings-landing-targaryen\"\u003emisogyny\u003c/a\u003e.

And the flaws within this oppressive, holier-than-thou type of fandom can also help explain just why \u003cem\u003eGame of Thrones\u003c/em\u003e itself was such a disappointment to many in its final two seasons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"26Fnxm\"\u003eCuratorial fandom and transformative fandom are two halves of a whole\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"hdP7Un\"\u003e“Curatorial fandom” is a general term for the area of geek culture that emphasizes amassing as much canonical knowledge as possible, no matter how minute. The concept was first formally articulated by a \u003ca href=\"https://obsession-inc.dreamwidth.org/82589.html\"\u003eLivejournal user, obsession_inc\u003c/a\u003e, in 2009, as “\u003ca href=\"https://fanlore.org/wiki/Affirmational_Fandom\"\u003eaffirmational fandom\u003c/a\u003e,” and then further expanded upon and re-defined by \u003ca href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/2u73cg/tumblrbashing_why_or_why_not/co5ucsk/\"\u003eReddit user LordByronic in 2015\u003c/a\u003e as “curative fandom.” The curatorial fan is one who passionately commits details about their favorite story to memory and uses those details to fuel their understanding of the narrative. Curatorial fandom worships and upholds the source text above all else, rather than deconstructing it, or challenging its canonical authority. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"5pcdd3\"\u003eThe other side of fandom is “transformative fandom.” If curatorial fandom is about enshrining an authorial version of canon, transformative fandom is about changing it. Transformative fandom is centered on fanworks, like fanfiction, fanart, or fan critique, all of which use the source text as the jumping-off point for original interpretations. The idea of “transformative fandom” is a core concept of fanworks-based fandom because transformativity is part of the legal framework that protects fanfiction (i.e. it’s a “transformative work”). Transformative fandom often arises out of biases built into the canons themselves, and fans’ need for a place to confront and respond to stories that neglected to include their identities or experiences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"PuqnEM\"\u003eAcademics have long associated curatorial and transformative fandoms with \u003ca href=\"https://www.academia.edu/32749631/Gender_Dynamics_in_Fandom_The_Gender_Theory_Behind_Curative_and_Creative_Fandoms\"\u003ea general fandom gender divide\u003c/a\u003e, finding that curatorial fandom appeals more to men and transformative fandom appeals more to women.

It’s a frustrating hierarchy that only underscores the fact that geek culture \u003cem\u003eisn’t\u003c/em\u003e a hierarchy: The two sides of fandom balance one another equally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"wmLIUf\"\u003eSo what does all this have to do with Bran Stark? Well, if modern fandom is a multi-faceted whole made up of curatorial fans and transformative fans that balance one another, and Bran represents modern fandom, you’d expect him to embody both curatorial and transformative fandom. But he doesn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"xGUxwd\"\u003eBran Stark embodies curatorial fandom — including its worst aspects\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"mlAcDk\"\u003eIt must be said: Bran embodies the stereotype of a fannish geek that spends his entire day sitting surfing the internet. After \u003cem\u003eGame of Thrones\u003c/em\u003e’ series finale, I \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/5/19/18629699/game-of-thrones-finale-reaction-who-won-the-iron-throne\"\u003ewrote semi-snarkily\u003c/a\u003e that Bran is the “Westerosi equivalent of an internet addict who spends all his time reading Wikipedia and playing video games”; but seriously, he’s easily viewed as an analogue for the curatorial male \u003cem\u003eGame of Thrones\u003c/em\u003e fan who believes knowing tons of trivia represents his dedication to the series. Bran is a human database of facts and knowledge that he acquired from “reading” the history/canon presented to him through his nebulous abilities as the Three-Eyed Raven. Not only that, but his first official act as king was to essentially go gaming in search of Drogon the dragon, while Tyrion and the small council were left to run the kingdom. These characteristics and behaviors make Bran easy to read as an avatar for curatorial fandom. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"BTbONe\"\u003eLike the (generally) male geeks who think their worship of the canon gives them a say in \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/7/24/17599132/james-gunn-fired-gamergate-guardians-of-the-galaxy\"\u003ewho holds the power\u003c/a\u003e in their culture, as well as \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/6/30/12027882/ghostbusters-reboot-all-female-backlash-sexism-sony\"\u003ewhat kind of stories are told\u003c/a\u003e in that culture, Bran is rewarded by a communal narrative that validates his sense of entitlement. In \u003cem\u003eGame of Thrones\u003c/em\u003e’ final episode, Tyrion declares that stories have power, and then he anoints Bran as not only having the best story of them all, but consequently holding the most power. This is a not-so-subtle suggestion that the “best” kind of \u003cem\u003eGame of Thrones\u003c/em\u003e fan is the one who’s spent hours on Reddit soaking up trivia, or to go back even further, the dedicated \u003cem\u003eSong of Ice and Fire\u003c/em\u003e fan who has spent over two decades at this point playing the game by close-reading the canon, often developing theories from these close reads that \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/8/30/16213394/r-l-j-game-of-thrones-fandom-oral-history\"\u003eultimately proved correct\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"tfsaA8\"\u003eBut of course that’s not the only way to engage with a story, nor should it be. Emphasizing an encyclopedic knowledge of canon silences the many many fans who engage with the source texts they love by focusing on what those source texts left out to begin with. Remember, the draw of transformative fandom is often in exploring what the text \u003cem\u003eomits\u003c/em\u003e. Obviously, a creator can’t possibly anticipate everything that every reader would like them to include in their story. But when a knowledge of what’s already \u003cem\u003ein\u003c/em\u003e the text is upheld as the best thing for a good fan to focus on, it creates less motivation for fans to think about what’s \u003cem\u003enot \u003c/em\u003ein the text, and how exploring those elements might make the whole story better.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"hM6plI\"\u003eBran’s knowledge of Westerosi history is a perfect case in point, because he doesn’t just “know” history; his special connection to the Children of the Forest has given him the ability to physically \u003cem\u003esee\u003c/em\u003e history as it actually played out, so he’s always got a running replay in his mind. You’d think that would make him virtually all-knowing, but in fact, it gives him a limited view of history that leaves out many, many historical stories and perspectives. After all, his knowledge only extends as far as events that happened near specific weirwood trees. \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/4/26/18515988/bran-is-the-night-king-theory-reverse-spell-battle-of-winterfell\"\u003eSeriously\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"4wdLoy\"\u003eThe problem is that for the last 5,000 years or so, weirwood trees \u003ca href=\"https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Weirwood\"\u003ehave existed\u003c/a\u003e mainly in the northern part of the kingdom, so all the history Bran has access to is, pretty literally, the history that “the north remembers.” Despite this, he’s validated by his community, via Tyrion’s speech and the council’s approval, as the one who holds the keys to all of Westeros’s past and future, which justifies his ascension to the throne. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"A9gh6A\"\u003eSo Bran gets to be the gatekeeper of power and the sole interpreter of knowledge for his culture, without having his authority over that story questioned. And while he deserves full marks for having trained hard to become a human library, we’ll never have a total grasp on what stories have been left out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"PACkIz\"\u003eWhat’s more, by not acknowledging those limitations, \u003cem\u003eGame of Thrones\u003c/em\u003e tells us that Bran’s store of knowledge is fine, and that he needs no corrective lens. Similarly, \u003cem\u003eGame of Thrones\u003c/em\u003e creators David Benioff and D.B. Weiss seem to have their feet firmly planted in curatorial fandom, without possessing any deeper interest in or understanding of transformative fandom or why it might matter, both in terms of how the show is constructed and why fans care about it to begin with.  And that disinterest in transforming the narrative they’re working with is part of why \u003cem\u003eGame of Thrones\u003c/em\u003e’ storyline collapsed in season eight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"w5Dl23\"\u003eA transformative fandom approach to \u003cem\u003eGame of Thrones\u003c/em\u003e’ home stretch could have kept it from falling apart\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"aaEOWP\"\u003eRemember how I said above that this new \u003cem\u003eGame of Thrones\u003c/em\u003e power dynamic is all ultimately bigger than Bran? The choice to put Bran in charge doesn’t only reflect, however inadvertently, the elevation of one form of fandom over another; it also reflects the kind of shortsighted perspective you can wind up with when a solely curatorial approach, or for that matter a solely transformative approach, is your only way of being involved in a fandom. And \u003cem\u003ethat \u003c/em\u003etells us a lot about where the series went in its final two seasons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"mILAjs\"\u003eAll of the criticisms made about \u003cem\u003eGame of Thrones\u003c/em\u003e’ final season — that it de-emphasized character, that it abandoned narrative threads and stopped deconstructing tropes, that it mistreated women and characters of color — are issues that transformative fandom is built on addressing and correcting. And many of those criticisms have been made with \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/AlannaBennett/status/1130470136522125315\"\u003ea frequent reminder\u003c/a\u003e that having women and writers of color in the writers’ room could have solved many of these problems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"HmukBP\"\u003eThat’s because creators who come from marginalized groups are the ones who are usually thinking most deeply about what’s being left out of the story. Why? Because, to be blunt, the story usually leaves \u003cem\u003ethem \u003c/em\u003eout. Marginalized fans can often bear the burden of speaking up for their groups, but transformative fandom gives them an eager audience that dares to shake up established lore through gender- and race-swapping, among other storytelling approaches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"NAFYMQ\"\u003eAs such, many transformative fanworks are character-driven; far more than engaging with world-building and expanding plot possibilities, transformative fans tend to be drawn to explorations of characters and their relationships with each other. When plots render beloved characters unrecognizable, or do badly by them in a way they don’t think is justified, fans will frequently write “\u003ca href=\"https://fanlore.org/wiki/Fix-it\"\u003efix-it fic\u003c/a\u003e” to right the perceived wrong. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"3YLKHL\"\u003eBenioff and Weiss’s prescriptive approach to storytelling is exactly what transformative fandom runs counter to, and it plays into the specific problem that plagued the show throughout its final season: \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/5/27/18639229/game-of-thrones-finale-disappointing-the-iron-throne-recap\"\u003ethe conflict\u003c/a\u003e between natural character progressions and the bulleted checklist of plot points that Benioff and Weiss seemingly felt obligated to deliver. Instead of relying on the inherently transformative emphasis on characterization and deconstructing fantasy tropes that made \u003cem\u003eGame of Thrones\u003c/em\u003e’ earlier seasons compelling, Benioff and Weiss fell back on plot and spectacle and callbacks, even when it meant characters contradicted themselves or acted in highly inconsistent ways. The effect was that they wound up regurgitating George R.R. Martin’s plot directions without any deeper thought for what it would do to the characters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"QPIFCh\"\u003eThat’s the irony of the finale’s claim that “stories have power.” In fact, \u003cem\u003eGame of Thrones\u003c/em\u003e’ whole final season illustrates that a story utterly fails to have any power when all it’s doing is worshipfully preserving a pre-existing one — in this case, the \u003cem\u003eSong of Ice and Fire\u003c/em\u003e novels and their ostensible ending as dictated by Martin, which \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/5/20/18623683/game-of-thrones-finale-reaction-george-rr-martin-got-ending\"\u003ewe may never get to see\u003c/a\u003e. Without showrunners who balanced reverence for the written story with a desire to be true to their characters’ unique evolutions on the show, it was hard for \u003cem\u003eGame of Thrones\u003c/em\u003e to fully shake its roots in the end. That’s even mirrored in the show itself: Bran’s and Tyrion’s attempt to start a “new” political system really just ended up \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/5/19/18629699/game-of-thrones-finale-reaction-who-won-the-iron-throne\"\u003eenshrining the old political system\u003c/a\u003e, with a few tweaks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Cb6eUg\"\u003eIt’s easy to see how this ending, with Bran on the throne, the geek inheriting the Earth, could represent a fantasy of ascension for other nerds like him. But ultimately, all it’s done is illustrate why curatorial fandom, left on its own, will never be as satisfying as a fandom that allows everyone access to the same story, and lets new stories have just as much value as the old ones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"58FqTN\"\u003eHow disappointing that this show that wanted to break the wheel couldn’t even break through its own shortsighted vision of which stories are worth telling.\u003c/p\u003e","url":"https://www.vox.com/2019/7/20/18638718/game-of-thrones-ending-bran-stark-transformative-fandom","published":"2019-07-20T14:05:00Z","guid":"https://www.vox.com/2019/7/20/18638718/game-of-thrones-ending-bran-stark-transformative-fandom"},{"title":"Trump met with refugees and seemed to learn about major humanitarian crises for the first time","content":"\u003cimg alt=\"Nadia Murad speaks to Donald Trump as other victims of religious persecution around the world look on. \" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ffpz4IP3n8V2rPgh3JHhz4qvu5Q=/146x0:5382x3927/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/64772452/GettyImages_1156698653.0.jpg\" /\u003e\n\n  \u003csmall\u003eYazidi activist and Nobel Peace Prize winner Nadia Murad speaks to Donald Trump.  | Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post/Getty Images\u003c/small\u003e\n\n  \u003cp\u003ePresident Trump displayed awkwardness and ignorance throughout a meeting with refugees.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp id=\"EsL8si\"\u003eIn a meeting with victims of religious persecution on Wednesday, President Donald Trump repeatedly appeared to be unaware of many of the world’s most pressing humanitarian crises.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"JG1hUw\"\u003eTrump met with more than two dozen survivors of religious conflict, a few of whom told their stories — and made impassioned entreaties for aid — directly to the president.

But all five could be found guilty of \u0026#8220;aiding and abetting\u0026#8221; the involuntary manslaughter, as well as charged for obstruction of justice and concealment of evidence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWould Bonnie be found guilty?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Fox, California law stipulates that circumstances exist in which taking a life to defend not only yourself but also someone else in danger can be justified. It\u0026#8217;s called the \u0026#8220;defense of others,\u0026#8221; and if argued successfully, would clear up Bonnie\u0026#8217;s case. \u0026#8220;To succeed,\u0026#8221; Fox explains to TIME, \u0026#8220;Bonnie would have to prove three things: that (1) she had a reasonable belief that (2) the amount of force she used was necessary to protect the other person from (3) imminent threat of serious injury.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Fox\u0026#8217;s view, the facts are in favor of Bonnie. He thinks it\u0026#8217;s perfectly reasonable for her \u0026#8220;to have believed that she needed to run up and shove a large man like Perry with two hands in order to stop him from severely beating and kicking the smaller Celeste\u0026#8230; in light of the other three women\u0026#8217;s apparent inability to slow the ongoing assault.\u0026#8221; The fact that Perry fell to his death is admittedly \u0026#8220;tragic,\u0026#8221; Fox allows. \u0026#8220;But it doesn\u0026#8217;t make Bonnie\u0026#8217;s pushing him a violent felony.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHorowitz has a slightly more cautious take. He suggests the defense of others argument could fail if a jury found that the force used to defend \u003cspan class=\"il\"\u003eCeleste\u003c/span\u003e was excessive, which would be considered \u0026#8220;imperfect self-defense.\u0026#8221; It does help that there\u0026#8217;s no evidence Bonnie ever had \u0026#8220;specific intent to kill\u0026#8221; before she pushed Perry, making the more serious murder charge unlikely to begin with. With manslaughter, Bonnie could also claim \u0026#8220;diminished mental capacity\u0026#8221; and PTSD due to her own abusive relationship with her mother during childhood, Horowitz says \u0026mdash; she tells her unconscious mother that she envisioned that she was pushing her, not Perry \u0026mdash; and argue down the charges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWould the rest of the Monterey 5 be found guilty?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other members of the Monterey Five are in a slightly different situation from Bonnie. \u0026#8220;Technically, the other female characters present at the scene who later lied for Bonnie might be liable for aiding and abetting the involuntary manslaughter as accomplices,\u0026#8221; Dagodag explains. There are questions about obstruction of justice, too, which \u0026mdash; if one is found guilty \u0026mdash; can carry a sentence of up to five years in prison along with fines, or probation and community service.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFurther, their lie itself becomes a problem, as it is a crime to \u0026#8220;conceal, or attempt to conceal, evidence of accidental death,\u0026#8221; which is exactly what Madeline, Jane, Celeste, Bonnie and Renata have been doing; convictions on that count can carry up to a year in a county jail under the California penal code. Madeline in particular has the potential to be charged with \u0026#8220;dissuading a witness,\u0026#8221; Horowitz notes. Dagodag agrees that Bonnie, however, could use the \u0026#8220;defense of others\u0026#8221; defense in this case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eBut are circumstances any different for Celeste?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike the other women, Celeste\u0026#8217;s actions could qualify her as an accessory to the crime, or she could be liable for obstruction of justice and concealment charges. That said, she has an extra defense, Horowitz notes: She could also argue for \u0026#8220;diminished mental capacity\u0026#8221; and show evidence of PTSD and \u0026#8220;battered women\u0026#8217;s syndrome,\u0026#8221; which would help her avoid the conspiracy and accessory after the fact charges, like Bonnie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut right now Celeste has her more immediate custody battle against \u003ca href=\"https://time.com/5627477/big-little-lies-meryl-streep-mary-louise-name/\" \u003eMary Louise Wright\u003c/a\u003e (Meryl Streep) to deal with.

Before they slept Saturday night, their rest period was delayed an hour-and-a-half because of a pesky communications problem, finally tracked down. They were awakened at 7:02 a.m. Sunday, Armstrong with five-and-a-half hours sleep, Collins with six, Aldrin with five. It was the shortest rest period of the flight. They spent half an hour on breakfast. Mission Control beamed up the latest on their families, and the morning news. Aldrin was told his son had a visit to the space center with an uncle.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen it was time to get down to business. Aldrin was the first into the Eagle at 9:20 a.m. Almost an hour later, Armstrong slipped through the tunnel to join him. From then on, they were Eagle. Collins was Columbia. At 12:32 p.m., they pushed a button that extended the landing legs of Eagle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThus did Columbia and Eagle, still linked together, arrive at this incredible time and place, out of sight and out of radio contact with earth on their 13th orbit of the moon. Some 100 hours had passed since they had left their home planet. Now they were 240,000 miles away from it, about to commit themselves to history. Behind the moon, Collins pressed a simple button. Latches clicked open. Springs gave Eagle a gentle shove. On earth they waited for word. Finally the radio signal came through. It was Armstrong\u0026rsquo;s voice crackling with static. \u0026ldquo;The Eagle has wings,\u0026rdquo; he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow briefly they flew formation together, Collins looking over the weird little ship Columbia had borne this far. \u0026ldquo;Looks like you\u0026rsquo;ve got a mighty good looking flying machine there, Eagle,\u0026rdquo; he said, \u0026ldquo;despite the fact you\u0026rsquo;re upside down.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Somebody\u0026rsquo;s upside down,\u0026rdquo; replied Eagle. Less than half an hour later, Collins gave Columbia a spurt of rocket power and dashed some two miles ahead, allowing Eagle flying room. \u0026ldquo;See you later,\u0026rdquo; he said. Eagle was on its own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, they passed behind the moon, to that point in orbit where major changes are made, again out of sight of earth and out of radio contact. Armstrong and Aldrin tilted their little ship so that the rocket faced the direction of flight. When they emerged from behind the lunar shadow, the earth heard Armstrong say, \u0026ldquo;The burn was on time.\u0026rdquo; Collins confirmed, \u0026ldquo;Listen babe, everything is going just swimmingly.\u0026rdquo; The descent to the moon\u0026rsquo;s surface had begun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEagle flew the long, looping arc, riding its tail of rocket fire like a brake, cutting into its 3,700 miles per hour speed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Current altitude about 46,000 feet,\u0026rdquo; reported Mission Control. \u0026ldquo;Everything\u0026rsquo;s looking good here.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEagle: \u0026ldquo;Our position check downrange shows us to be a little off.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMission Control: \u0026ldquo;You are to continue powered descent.

The guidance computer on board was showing some variations. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re looking great, Eagle, you\u0026rsquo;re looking great,\u0026rdquo; Mission control reassured. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re go for landing.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Roger, understand,\u0026rdquo; said Eagle. \u0026ldquo;Go for landing, 3,000 feet . . . 2,000 feet . . . Okay, it looks like it\u0026rsquo;s holding.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArmstrong\u0026rsquo;s voice was clear, and as brisk as a stock market report. But his heart rate was running some 40 beats a minute higher than normal. Now some thing happened to send it to 156 beats a minute, but his voice never betrayed it. He saw the landing site below strewn with boulders. He overrode the automatic landing stem, grasping the rocket controls in his right hand, skimming over the littered field, searching out a clear spot: \u0026ldquo;540 feet . . . 400 feet, coming down nicely . . . 200 feet . . . 100 feet . . . 75 feet, still looking good, drifting to the right a little . . .\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt 40 feet billows of dust kicked up by the rocket rose around the craft. \u0026ldquo;Okay . . . engines stopped.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Houston,\u0026rdquo; said Armstrong tentatively.

Man had landed on the moon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the White House, President Nixon watched televised reports with Frank Borman. The last 22 seconds, he said, was more like half an hour. When he caught his breath he sent the astronauts his congratulations. \u0026ldquo;It was,\u0026rdquo; he said, \u0026ldquo;one of the greatest moments of our time.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last minute difficulties were explained by Buzz Aldrin: \u0026ldquo;That may have seemed like a very long final phase. The auto targeting was taking us right into a football-field sized crater. There\u0026rsquo;s a large number of big boulders and rocks for about one or two crater diameters around it. And it required us to . . . fly in manually over the rock field to find a reasonably good area.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArmstrong noted: \u0026ldquo;You might be interested to know that I don\u0026rsquo;t think we noticed any difficulty at all in adapting to one-sixth gravity. It seems immediately natural to move in this environment.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAhead, he said, was \u0026ldquo;a relatively level plain, cratered with a fairly large number of craters of the five-to-50-foot variety, and some ridges, small, 20-30 feet high. I would guess. And literally thousands of little one- and two-foot craters around the area. We see some angular rocks several hundred feet in front of us that are probably two feet in size and have angular edges. There is a hill in view just about on the ground track ahead of us. Difficult to estimate, but might be a half a mile or a mile.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Be advised,\u0026rdquo; said Mission Control, \u0026ldquo;there are lots of smiling faces here, and all around the world.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;There are two up here also,\u0026rdquo; replied Armstrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t forget the one up here,\u0026rdquo;\u003ca href=\"https://time.com/5624528/michael-collins-apollo-11/\" \u003e called down Collins on his lonely patrol\u003c/a\u003e.

That done, Armstrong and Aldrin concentrated on describing sights no one had ever seen before. \u0026ldquo;Out of the hatch,\u0026rdquo; Aldrin said, \u0026#8220;I\u0026#8217;m looking at the earth, big and round and beautiful.\u0026rdquo; The sun played games with the color of the lunar rocks around them. \u0026ldquo;Almost every variety of rock you could find,\u0026rdquo; Aldrin said, looking out the window. \u0026ldquo;The color varies, depending on how you\u0026rsquo;re looking at it. Doesn\u0026rsquo;t appear to be much of a general color at all.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEagle stood some four miles beyond its planned landing site. It was also on a slight tilt, but not enough to endanger takeoff. \u0026ldquo;The guys that said we wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be able to tell precisely where we are are the winners today,\u0026rdquo; Armstrong said. \u0026ldquo;We were a little busy worrying about program alarms and things like that in the part of the descent where we would normally be picking out our landing spot.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, they bled the pressure from their spacecraft, letting oxygen out, vacuum in. At 10:40 p.m., Armstrong reported, \u0026ldquo;The hatch is coming open.\u0026rdquo; Then, following Aldrin\u0026rsquo;s instructions, he began to back out onto the porch of the spacecraft, taking care that his suit did not catch or snag in the narrow opening. It was slow going. His 185-pound suit, weighing only some 30 pounds in lunar gravity, was more a hindrance because of its bulk than its weight. Suddenly he was standing on the porch of Eagle, beginning the tentative steps down the nine rungs of the ladder. On the way he pulled a lanyard releasing an equipment shelf and a television camera. Now, on screens all over the earth, you could see the stark shadows, and there, swinging, searching, a boot, Armstrong\u0026rsquo;s boot. Bit by bit, the whole man appeared. Now, off the last rung, onto the saucer-like footpad. Then, cautiously again, unsure of what was below it, he stepped with his left foot, a size 9\u0026frac12; foot in a clumsy, awkward step. He pressed the lunar surface at 10:56 p.m. His\u003ca href=\"https://time.com/5621999/neil-armstrong-quote/\" \u003e first words\u003c/a\u003e were, \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind.\u0026rdquo; For 20 minutes he walked alone on the alien soil of the moon before Buzz Aldrin followed the same backward route down the ladder to join him. Aldrin looked around and his first words were, \u0026ldquo;Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. A magnificent desolation.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"inline-portrait_small_2x alignnone \"\u003e\u003cimg data-attachment-id=\"5630533\" data-permalink=\"https://time.com/5630478/apollo-11-moon-landing-timeline/edwin-aldrin-on-moon/\" data-orig-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/apollo_photo-6.jpg?quality=85\" data-orig-size=\"1992,1934\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"NEIL ARMSTRONG\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Edwin \\\"Buzz\\\" Aldrin carries scientific experiments to a deployment site south of the lunar module Eagle.

That alone would be enough to deter any victim from coming forward and cooperating with the league.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 1.1rem;\"\u003eIn the five years since the Ray Rice video — which showed the Baltimore Ravens running back punching his then-fiancée, Janay Rice, in the face in an elevator in Atlantic City and knocking her out — made international headlines and pressured the league into promising to take violence against women more seriously, the NFL has botched every attempt at disciplining players under its revamped personal conduct policy.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Hill\u0026#8217;s case, things seemed rather straightforward. In March of this year, Hill and Espinal were investigated for battery after their three-year-old son sustained a broken arm. In April, their son was placed into care temporarily because of a result of an emergency hearing conducted by the Kansas Department of Children and Families. On April 24, Johnson County District Attorney Steve Howe announced that though he did believe a crime had been committed, there wasn\u0026#8217;t enough evidence to press charges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following day, the audio of Hill and Espinal\u0026#8217;s conversation was released. Espinal recorded the audio herself earlier this year at an airport while the couple was traveling, and gave to a friend as an “insurance policy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat made the audio recording so chilling \u0026#8212; particularly when Hill directly threatened Espinal \u0026#8212; was the fact that this was not the first time Hill had been accused of domestic violence. In college, Hill pleaded guilty to abusing Espinal, who was pregnant with their son at the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2014, he was arrested for throwing her around like a “rag doll,” punching her in the stomach while two months pregnant, and leaving her with cuts and bruises all over her face and neck. At the time, she told police that this wasn’t the first time he had hit her, though it was the worst assault so far.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith Espinal\u0026#8217;s approval, Hill pleaded guilty and was sentenced to three years of probation and court-mandated counseling. He was drafted by the Chiefs in the fifth round of the 2016 draft, and has since become a star in the league and heralded as a redemption story. But this incident proved that reality is likely much more complicated than forced narratives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 1.1rem;\"\u003eEarlier this month, KCTV5 released the \u003ca href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/27156381/in-full-audio-chiefs-hill-denies-assaulting-fiancee\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003efull version of the audio\u003c/a\u003e that Espinal recorded in the airport.

The NFL said that the son\u0026#8217;s safety was its priority, as well. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;Throughout this investigation, the NFL\u0026#8217;s primary concern has been the well-being of the child,\u0026#8221; the league said in a statement on Friday. \u0026#8220;Our understanding is that the child is safe and that the child\u0026#8217;s ongoing care is being directed and monitored by the Johnson County District Court and the Johnson County Department for Children and Families.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#8217;s understandable why Espinal did not cooperate with the NFL\u0026#8217;s investigation, particularly if she thought that Hill\u0026#8217;s job was on the line. And she should not be blamed for staying with him. Abusive relationships are difficult \u0026#8212; and often dangerous \u0026#8212; to exit. To that end, the NFL and the Chiefs immediately cutting any and all ties with Hill could have made things worse for Espinal and her son, not better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it also feels wrong for the NFL \u0026#8212; which drafted him knowing he had plead guilty to domestic abuse \u0026#8212; to completely let this slide, too. It is bothersome that the NFL\u0026#8217;s personal conduct policy couldn\u0026#8217;t find cause to to suspend a player who was caught on tape threatening a woman who he previously assaulted. And it is an abject failure that the NFL has alienated victims and survivors in the five years since Rice, instead of building up trust with them and putting proactive measures in place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNFL commissioner Roger Goodell begged fans five years ago to trust the league to get its house in order when it comes to handling domestic violence and sexual assault. The Hill decision is proof that the house has collapsed.\t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"promo amp-wp-article-promo\"\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"post__figure post__figure--format-full\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"post__thumbnail\"\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003ca href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/membership/?c=cr042018-7-00-wp\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cimg width=\"2917\" height=\"2038\" src=\"https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/membership-graphic_2.03-1.png?w=2917\u0026amp;h=2038\u0026amp;crop=1\" class=\"attachment-full size-full\" alt=\"\" data-attachment-id=\"1142474\" data-permalink=\"https://thinkprogress.org/membership-graphic_2-03-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/membership-graphic_2.03-1.png?w=2917\u0026amp;h=2038\u0026amp;crop=1\" data-orig-size=\"2917,2038\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{\u0026quot;aperture\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;credit\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;camera\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;created_timestamp\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;copyright\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;focal_length\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;iso\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;shutter_speed\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;title\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;orientation\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;}\" data-image-title=\"membership graphic_2.03\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/membership-graphic_2.03-1.png?w=2917\u0026amp;h=2038\u0026amp;crop=1\" data-large-file=\"https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/membership-graphic_2.03-1.png?w=2917\u0026amp;h=2038\u0026amp;crop=1\" draggable=\"false\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1920px) 1920px,(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1920px) 1920px,(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1024px) 1024px,(min-width: 512px) and (max-width: 1024px) 1024px,(min-width: 512px) and (max-width: 768px) 768px,(max-width: 512px) 512px,(max-width: 768px) 768px,2917px\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/membership-graphic_2.03-1.png?w=1920\u0026#038;crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C1341px\u0026#038;ssl=1 1920w,https://i1.wp.com/thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/membership-graphic_2.03-1.png?w=1024\u0026#038;crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C715px\u0026#038;ssl=1 1024w,https://i1.wp.com/thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/membership-graphic_2.03-1.png?w=768\u0026#038;crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C537px\u0026#038;ssl=1 768w,https://i1.wp.com/thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/membership-graphic_2.03-1.png?w=512\u0026#038;crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C358px\u0026#038;ssl=1 512w,https://i1.wp.com/thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/membership-graphic_2.03-1.png?w=2917\u0026#038;crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C2038px\u0026#038;ssl=1 2917w\" /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/a\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n","url":"https://thinkprogress.org/the-nfls-domestic-violence-policy-is-broken-beyond-repair-013d48c08ae8/","published":"2019-07-20T13:58:10Z","guid":"https://thinkprogress.org/?p=1150273"},{"title":"Missouri GOP Senator trots out anti-Semitic trope during speech before national conservative group","content":"\u003cp\u003eOn Tuesday this week, freshman Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO) made an appearance at the National Conservatism Conference to deliver the keynote address.

Instead, they were confronted and physically threatened by an employee who told them to \u0026#8220;go back to your country.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe incident triggered a civil rights complaint against the Canada-based coffee chain, which failed to respond to the couple\u0026#8217;s initial complaint for weeks, and even then offered a meager apology and a gift card for a free coffee. The complaint was filed on the couple\u0026#8217;s behalf by the Council on American-Islamic Relations, which is claiming that the incident was a violation of Michigan\u0026#8217;s Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese kinds of incidents are hardly new, but they have increased in frequency since President Donald Trump first burst onto the political scene in 2015. The number of hate crimes committed in the United States has risen every year since he announced his presidential campaign on a platform of racism and white supremacy. Since then, he has only further stoked animosity towards immigrants, people of color, Jews, and Muslims.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrump\u0026#8217;s racism was on full display this week after he targeted four congresswomen of color with a slew of bigoted attacks. The president took to Twitter to tell the four women — all Democratic representatives elected in 2018 — to \u0026#8220;go back\u0026#8221; to the countries \u0026#8220;from which they came,\u0026#8221; a demand echoed days later by racists in the crowd at one of Trump\u0026#8217;s campaign rallies in North Carolina, which broke out into a \u0026#8220;send her back\u0026#8221; chant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike the Muslim couple in Michigan, three of the four congresswomen in question were born in the United States. All are U.S. citizens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is a strong connection between Trump\u0026#8217;s open embrace of racism and incidents of hate crimes. The Washington Post did an analysis of Trump\u0026#8217;s campaign rallies during the last election cycle and found that counties that hosted a Trump event saw a 226% spike in hate crimes afterward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe president has largely refused to condemn white supremacists who have endorsed him or committed acts of hate in his name. In the most notorious incident, Trump appeared to defend neo-Nazis after a white-supremacist protest in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017, that left one anti-racism protester dead and dozens more injured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;[Y]ou had some very bad people in that group, but you also had people that were very fine people, on both sides,\u0026#8221; Trump said at the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWords like that have consequences.

A three-person crew — made up of NASA astronaut Andrew Morgan, Russian cosmonaut Alexander Skvortsov, and Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano of the European Space Agency — are heading to space on top of a Russian Soyuz rocket from Kazakhstan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"yiZmyd\"\u003eThe trio will be joining the three current members of the International Space Station — NASA astronauts Nick Hague and Christina Koch, as well as Russian cosmonaut Alexey Ovchinin. All three have been aboard since March, when they launched to the ISS. For Hague and Ovchinin, that trip was actually their second launch to the station, after their first flight ended in an emergency landing. For Koch, it’s her fist stay on the ISS and it’s going to be a significant one. She’ll be staying on the station until February of 2020 which sets her up to break the record for longest continuous spaceflight by a woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"aG9Ed6\"\u003eAmong the new crew, Morgan is also slated for an extended stay. His fellow crew members will be coming back in February along with Koch, but Morgan will be coming back in the spring of 2020, making his trip nearly a year long.

Since 2011, NASA has relied on the Russian Soyuz to transport people to and from the ISS, but soon two commercial companies, SpaceX and Boeing, will start flying NASA astronauts to the station. Those vehicles aren’t ready to fly people yet though, and it’s possible they won’t be ready until early next year. Meanwhile, NASA has only a few seats left on future flights of Russia’s Soyuz vehicle, which means the agency will be without a ride very soon. Until SpaceX and Boeing are up and running, NASA is keeping its astronauts on the ISS a little longer than normal to ensure that the station continues to have US astronauts aboard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"7vvNgO\"\u003eMorgan and his crew mates are scheduled to take off at 12:28PM ET from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. They’ll meet up with the ISS just six hours after launch and dock around 6:50PM ET. About two hours after that, the spacecraft’s hatches will open and the crew will be greeted by their new roommates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"pOosm1\"\u003eNASA’s coverage of the launch will begin at 11:30AM ET, and the show will immediately be followed by remarks from Vice President Mike Pence, who is scheduled to give a speech about the Apollo 11 anniversary at 1PM ET from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

The bulk of the series follows the crew of a spaceship called the Rocinante as they find themselves in the midst of an interplanetary war, and have to contend with the discovery of an alien substance called the Protomolecule that’s been weaponized by a malevolent Earth corporation, and which went on to create an gate to thousands of worlds beyond our home system. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Zi4FhH\"\u003eThis latest season will be based on the fourth installment of the series, \u003cem\u003eCibola Burn\u003c/em\u003e, in which the crew of the Rocinante are dispatched to a colonial world known as Ilus to settle a dispute between the corporation that claimed the world, and the settlers who touched down on it first. The planet is also home to the remnants of an alien civilization that created the protomolecule. The trailer shows off some of the troubles that the crew will face, and some new faces, like Adolphus Murtry (played by \u003cem\u003ePacific Rim’\u003c/em\u003es Burn Gorman), a brutal and temperamental security chief for the company that’s laid claim to the planet, Royal Charter Energy. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"y4Y6XL\"\u003eIn addition to the trailer for the season, Amazon released a longer clip from the show, showing off the crew of the Rocinante landing on the Ilus, which will be one of the major locations this season. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"kSOdJf\"\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"\u003e\u003ciframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9LrZiNOvp_c?rel=0\" style=\"border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"g3k82z\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eSome spoilers ahead. \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"OWEjoy\"\u003eThe Syfy channel picked up the series for adaptation back in 2015, and over the course of three seasons, adapted the first three books, \u003cem\u003eLeviathan Wakes\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eCaliban’s War\u003c/em\u003e, and \u003cem\u003eAbbadon’s Gate\u003c/em\u003e.

Up until this point in the series, humanity has been fighting amongst itself, but now, people have access to thousands of new, uninhabited planets to travel to. The Syfy’s tenure on the series ended right at that point, and had the show not continued, it would have been a natural ending point. \u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rQt4biywuGo6MKxZdastjoVpLIk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18318676/EXPA_S4_01292_SigningPoster.jpg\"\u003e\n      \u003ccite\u003eImage: Amazon Studios\u003c/cite\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"XSemGY\"\u003eBut the book series will last for nine installments, and the penultimate book, \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/20/18295290/james-sa-corey-the-expanse-tiamats-wrath-science-fiction-space-opera-book-review\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eTiamat’s Wrath\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, hit bookstores earlier this year. \u003cem\u003eCibola Burn\u003c/em\u003e is a good opportunity for Amazon to reboot the show, as it brought in a couple of new major storylines for the series.

And it paid off. The plastic bag receptacle that the kids painted green and outfitted with triangular white teeth and a “feed me” sign won the students from the Nashville suburb first place in a recycling box decorating contest. The idea, as Westmeade’s proud principal told a \u003ca href=\"https://www.newschannel5.com/news/mnps-students-participate-in-recycling-competition\"\u003elocal TV news\u003c/a\u003e show, was to help the environment.

That organization is part of the Plastics Industry Association, a trade group that includes Shell Polymers, LyondellBasell, Exxon Mobil, Chevron Phillips, DowDuPont, and Novolex — all of which profit hugely from the continued production of plastics. And even as A Bag\u0026#8217;s Life was encouraging kids to spread the uplifting message of cleaning up plastic waste, its parent organization, the Progressive Bag Alliance, was backing a state \u003ca href=\"https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/local/2019/03/29/bill-lee-sign-tennessee-bill-stop-local-plastic-bag-pans/3315143002/\"\u003ebill\u003c/a\u003e that would strip Tennesseans of their ability to address the plastics crisis.

Meanwhile, A Bag\u0026#8217;s Life gave the Westmeade kids who worked on the bag monster a $100 gift card to use “as they please.” And with that, a minuscule fraction of its vast wealth, the plastics industry applied a green veneer to its increasingly bitter and desperate fight to keep profiting from a product that is polluting the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"promote-embed\" data-promo=\"bad-chemistry\" data-crop=\"promo\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Bag’s Life is just one small part of a massive, industry-led effort now underway to suppress meaningful efforts to reduce plastic waste while keeping the idea of recycling alive. The reality of plastics recycling? It\u0026#8217;s pretty much already dead. In 2015, the U.S. recycled about 9 percent of its plastic waste, and since then the number has dropped even lower. The vast majority of the 8.3 billion metric tons of plastic ever produced — \u003ca href=\"https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/7/e1700782.full\"\u003e79 percent\u003c/a\u003e — has ended up in landfills or scattered all around the world.

We have to. But we are well past the point where the heartfelt efforts of schoolchildren or anyone else on the consumer end can solve the plastics problem. It no longer matters how many hoots we give. There is already way too much plastic that won’t decompose and ultimately has nowhere to go, whether it’s mashed into a dragon container or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-bleed full-bleed width-auto' style='width: auto;'\u003e\n\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-259757\" src=\"https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/07/AP_483696550584-1563481895.jpg\" alt=\"A Chinese worker labors in front of high piles of plastic bottles at the plastic bottle recycling station, which trapped a man, in Ji'nan city, east China's Shandong province, 4 May 2017.\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"caption overlayed\"\u003eA Chinese worker walks past piles of plastic bottles at a plastic bottle recycling station in Ji\u0026#8217;nan city, in east China\u0026#8217;s Shandong province, on May 4, 2017.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class='caption source pullright' style=''\u003ePhoto: Imaginechina via AP Images\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eChina’s National Sword\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChina’s decision in 2017 to stop receiving the vast majority of plastic waste from other countries blew the flimsy lid off our dysfunctional recycling system. That year, when the Chinese government announced the National Sword policy, as it’s called, the U.S. sent 931 million kilograms of plastic waste to China and Hong Kong. The U.S. has been offloading vast bundles of scrap this way since at least 1994, when the Environmental Protection Agency began tracking plastics exports. The practice has served to both mask the mounting crisis and absolve U.S. consumers of guilt. But in fact, much of the “recycled” plastic scrap that the U.S. sent to China \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0Kif9cugQ0\"\u003eappears\u003c/a\u003e to have been burned or buried instead of being refashioned into new products.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough China’s turnabout made the failure of the plastics recycling system suddenly and undeniably obvious, in truth the plastics problem has been with us as long as plastic has. Over the decades, as production has grown exponentially, we’ve never managed to repurpose even one-tenth of our plastic waste. Since the EPA began tracking plastics recycling in 1994, when the U.S. recycled less than 5 percent, the rate went up only about 5 percent, peaking at 9.5 percent in 2014. Although there is no data before 1994, the rate was almost certainly even lower then. Some of that failure can be blamed on careless consumers, but much of the waste that is dutifully put into recycling bins and bags also gets landfilled and burned because there’s no market for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class='stylized pull-right'data-shortcode-type='pullquote' data-pull='right'\u003eMuch of the “recycled” plastic scrap that the U.S. sent to China appears to have been burned or buried instead of being refashioned into new products.\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe plastics problem has been growing exponentially for decades. In 1967, when Dustin Hoffman’s character in “The Graduate” was being advised to go into plastics, less than 25 million tons were produced each year. Even back then, the companies that made the plastic \u003ca href=\"https://www.ciel.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Fueling-Plastics-Plastic-Industry-Awareness-of-the-Ocean-Plastics-Problem.pdf\"\u003ewere already aware\u003c/a\u003e of the growing waste problem. Yet by 1980, production had doubled. Ten years later, it doubled again to 100 million tons, surpassing the amount of steel produced globally. Today, the plastics industry, estimated to be worth more than $4 trillion, generates more than 300 million tons of plastic a year according to the most recent records — nearly half of which is for single-use items, meaning that it will almost instantly become trash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the institution of China’s new policy in January 2018, the extent of the plastic waste crisis became dramatically more visible. Around the world, bales of used plastic that just a year earlier would have been destined for China began \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/11/world/china-recyclables-ban.html\"\u003epiling up\u003c/a\u003e. In the U.S., some cities have \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/16/business/local-recycling-costs.html\"\u003estopped their plastics recycling\u003c/a\u003e programs altogether.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout good alternatives, the U.S. is now \u003ca href=\"https://www.plasticpollutioncoalition.org/pft/2019/4/29/six-times-more-plastic-waste-is-burned-in-us-than-is-recycled\"\u003eburning\u003c/a\u003e six times the amount of plastic it’s recycling — even though the incineration process releases cancer-causing pollutants into the air and creates toxic ash, which also needs to be disposed of somewhere.

Because the U.S. can no longer ship its plastic waste to China, much of that waste is going to Turkey, Senegal, and other countries that are ill-equipped to deal with it. In May, the most recent month for which data is available, the U.S. sent 64.9 million kilograms of plastic scrap to 58 countries.

Antimony, which Turner found in food containers, toys, and office supplies, “is restricted in drinking water, but not in electrical waste.” Turner and Zhanyun Wang, another scientist I spoke with who studies chemical additives to plastics, told me that they no longer use black plastic utensils. “Given the option, I’d prefer something white or clear,” said Turner, adding that he tries to avoid utensils made of any kind of plastic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe solution to this global mess clearly has to be much bigger than personal cutlery choices.

All we hear is “you’ve got to get rid of plastics,” Garry Kohl, of PepsiCo, said to his fellow members of the Plastics Industry Association at a conference in April. Gathered in the gilded ballroom of a Dallas hotel, the representatives of big plastics manufacturers, recyclers, raw materials providers, extruders, brand owners, and others in the plastics business grappled aloud about their role in the crisis. Especially difficult, said Kohl, who directs packaging innovation of PepsiCo’s snacks and foods, was the widely circulated picture of a dead plastic-filled \u003ca href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2868708/More-five-TRILLION-pieces-plastic-litter-seas-oceans.html\"\u003ealbatross\u003c/a\u003e. “This is very emotional for our senior leaders,” Kohl said, as the now iconic picture of the albatross — really just a few feathers and a decaying beak arranged around an assortment of bottle caps, lighter parts, and plastic bits — flashed above him. “They’re all talking about the albatross.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatty Long, interim president and chief executive officer of the Plastics Industry Association, the group that convened the Texas meeting, also acknowledged the pain of being the public face of an industry held responsible for the devastation of the natural world. Long admitted that she squirmed her way through another social media phenomenon that, along with the albatross, has changed the course of the war over plastics: the \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wH878t78bw\u0026amp;t=2s\"\u003evideo\u003c/a\u003e of the sea turtle with a plastic straw jammed in its nostril.

Kirk Lippold guided his crew through a terrorist attack on the USS Cole, in which 17 sailors were killed and 39 injured. Now a crisis management consultant, Lippold told the audience at the Plastics Industry Association meeting a grueling story of mass casualties, near-death experiences, and a shrapnel-filled vessel taking on water. His tale, which ended with Lippold piloting his hobbled ship back into the open seas with the national anthem blaring, suggested that with enough fierce determination, the plastics executives too might be able to sail past the threats facing them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt stake for them is not just the current plastics market now worth hundreds of billions of dollars annually, but its likely expansion. Falling oil and gas prices mean that the cost of making new plastic, already very low, will be even cheaper. The price drop has led to more than 700 plastics industry projects now in the works, including expansions of old plants and the construction of new ones by Chevron, Shell, Dow, Exxon, Formosa Plastics, Nova Chemicals, and Bayport Polymers, among other companies, according to a presentation from the regulatory affairs director of the BASF Corporation at the plastics industry conference.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe growing output of new cheap plastic further undermines the industry’s own argument that recycling can resolve the waste crisis. It’s already impossible for most recycled plastic to compete with “virgin” plastic in the marketplace. With the exception of bottles made of PET (No. 1) and HDPE (No. 2), the rest of the waste is essentially worthless. Around 30 percent of both types of plastic bottles were sold for recycling in 2017, though some of those may have wound up being landfilled or incinerated. The recent fossil fuel boom makes it even cheaper to make new plastic and thus, even more difficult to sell the recycled product. This, in turn, makes the plastics companies’ push for recycling that much more implausible — and their battle to kill efforts to limit plastics production even more desperate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-bleed full-bleed width-auto' style='width: auto;'\u003e\n\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-259765\" src=\"https://prod01-cdn05.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/07/GettyImages-sb10064940c-001-plastic-bag-1563483341.jpg\" alt=\"Crumpled plastic bag, studio shot\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"caption overlayed\"\u003eWhile only eight states have enacted plastic restrictions, more than 330 local plastic bag ordinances have passed in 24 states.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class='caption source pullright' style=''\u003ePhoto: Getty Images\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eBanning Plastic Bans\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt Seaholm, the executive director of the American Progressive Bag Alliance, seemed to relish his part in the fight. While others at the plastics industry conference tended toward hand-wringing and at least some acknowledgment of the problem of plastic waste, Seaholm was unapologetic in his antagonism of environmental groups that have been calling attention to it. In Texas, Seaholm, the former national director of the Koch brothers-led Americans for Prosperity, positioned himself as the enemy of environmentalists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They hate what we’re doing,” Seaholm told his plastics industry colleagues at the conference with a mischievous grin. “We wear this as a badge of honor.” The fact that environmental groups oppose the APBA’s tactics, Seaholm added, is evidence that his lobbying group “must be doing something right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe APBA began pushing back against plastics restrictions around the country in 2011. Around 2015, the industry group upped its game. Rather than just opposing individual bans, the APBA began lobbying for state preemption laws. The approach, which another \u003ca href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/alec-exposed-koch-connection/\"\u003eKoch brothers-affliated group\u003c/a\u003e, the American Legislative Exchange Council, has used to fight local action on other issues, including \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/09/15/oregon-pesticides-aerial-spray-ban/\"\u003epesticide\u003c/a\u003e restrictions and \u003ca href=\"https://www.alec.org/model-policy/living-wage-mandate-preemption-act/\"\u003eliving wage\u003c/a\u003e laws, prevents cities and towns from passing local plastic bans. In the past eight years, the American Chemistry Council has helped pass preemption bills based on \u003ca href=\"https://www.alec.org/model-policy/regulating-containers-to-protect-business-and-consumer-choice/\"\u003eALEC’s model\u003c/a\u003e in 13 states. According to Seaholm, who joined the group in 2016, 42 percent of Americans now live in states where they can’t pass local bans on plastics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther plastics industry lobbying groups, including ALEC’s American City County Exchange and the National Federation of Independent Business, have also argued for preemption, or “uniformity” as they call it, on the grounds that bans hurt businesses that use plastic. While presenting bans as bad for both businesses and poor people, who they claim will be disproportionately affected, the industry has also used campaign donations to make its case. Over the past year, the \u003ca href=\"https://www.flexpack.org/\"\u003eFlexible Packaging Association\u003c/a\u003e, whose members include Dow, Exxon Mobil Chemical, SABIC, Chevron Phillips Chemical, and LyondellBasell, more than doubled its spending nationwide. The group significantly upped its contributions to Tennessee lawmakers, for instance, in the year leading up to the passage of the bag preemption bill there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the APBA is fighting hard to push plastics preemption, the group’s national spending is unclear because as a wholly owned entity of the Plastics Industry Association, there\u0026#8217;s no federal requirement to make its expenditures public. But state lobbying disclosures show that it has spent millions fighting bag bans. This advocacy of plastic bans puts Plastics Industry Associations members, including PepsiCo, Walmart, and the Carlyle Group, in an uncomfortable situation. All these brands have made public sustainability pledges that appear to be at odds with the group’s fights against local laws limiting plastic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsked about the apparent dissonance between its sustainability pledge and participation in the Plastics Industry Association, Walmart provided an emailed statement saying that “Walmart’s aspiration is to achieve zero plastic waste. We are taking actions across our business to use less plastic, recycle more and support innovations to improve plastic waste reduction systems.” The statement also said that Walmart has “asked our suppliers to reduce unnecessary plastic packaging, increase packaging recyclability and increase recycled content, and to help us educate customers on reducing, reusing and recycling plastic.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePepsiCo and the Carlyle Group did not respond to requests for comment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeaholm appeared not to care about the terrible optics of the industry’s fight against efforts to protect the environment with plastic bans, which he derided as “primarily driven by emotion.” “They’re doing it because it feels good,” Seaholm told the plastics executives in Dallas. “They get to high-five each other.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-bleed large-bleed width-auto' style='width: auto;'\u003e\n\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-259771\" src=\"https://prod01-cdn06.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/07/letter-1563484430.jpg\" alt=\"letter-1563484430\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"caption overlayed\"\u003eAt left, Kathy Kent with her daughter, Suzette Head, collecting garbage on the beach.

Suzette was at her local aquarium when a naturalist held up a jar with a gray swirl inside and asked what the kids thought it was. Suzette thought it was a jellyfish and said so. When she learned that it was, in fact, a plastic bag and that a turtle could die if it made the same mistake and ate the bag, she became distraught.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Suzette loves animals,” her mother, Kathy Kent, explained. On their walk home from the aquarium after the demonstration, the two began talking about how they could stop people from throwing away plastic bags. “At first I said to her, Well, you just can’t change people,” said Kent. “But then I listened to myself and thought, Oh my God, what am I saying and quickly walked it back.” Without having any idea what exactly she was promising, Kent told her daughter that the two of them would do something to keep plastic bags from ending up in the ocean. Shortly afterward, they teamed up with Mila and her mother and several other Isle of Palms residents who were also upset about plastic. They’d walk the beach in the afternoons picking up bags and brainstorming. Eventually, they hit on the idea of drafting a petition to ban bags and walked door to door to get the support of several local shop owners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was a piece of cake asking businesses to support us,” said Kent. “Everyone else knows that having a litter-free, clean beach is good for everyone and every business.” A little over a year after Suzette’s upsetting trip to the aquarium, the ordinance passed the city council in its first vote.

The trick has been to publicly embrace its opponents’ concern for the environment while privately fighting attempts at regulation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe double-edged strategy dates back to at least 1969, when an editorial in Modern Plastics magazine warned about the impending waste crisis. The big plastics makers were already aware of the problem. That year, DuPont, Chevron, Dow, and the Society for the Plastics Industry were among the groups represented at a conference on packaging waste. And when the first Earth Day was launched in 1970 in part to tackle that crisis, the industry was ready.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat week, demonstrators held an “ecology trek” in which they dumped their nonreturnable bottles at Coca-Cola’s headquarters. The activists had a solution to the mounting waste crisis: bottle bills that would put the onus for cleaning up the waste on manufacturers. Coca-Cola, which had been tipped off about the protests by the National Soft Drink Association, met the demonstrators with free soda and trash bins. The big beverage and packaging companies fought the bottle bill and came up with a clever dodge that’s still paying off today. Not only did they tar supporters of the bottle bills as radicals, but they also launched a massive PR campaign that seemed to incorporate some of the anger about the mounting garbage that had fueled the Earth Day protests while shifting responsibility for the waste away from the companies that created it and onto consumers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-bleed' data-type='video' data-height='281' data-width='500' data-pz-module='video'\u003e\u003ciframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/exEUZS6bH3w' style='min-width:500px;min-height:281px;' frameborder='0' webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1971, Keep America Beautiful, an anti-litter organization formed by beverage and packaging companies, including PepsiCo, Coca-Cola, and Phillip Morris, teamed up with the Ad Council to create the now-infamous \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEUZS6bH3w\"\u003e\u0026#8220;Crying Indian\u0026#8221; ad\u003c/a\u003e.

But because the lids are made from polypropylene (also known as No. 5 plastic), and there is very little market for recycled polypropylene, that number has no basis in reality. Only 5 percent of polypropylene was recycled in 2015 — and that was before China decided to stop taking our waste. Since then, the percentage recycled is likely much lower still, meaning that the vast majority of the 1 billion new “recyclable” Starbucks lids will end up where the old ones did — in landfills, trash heaps, incinerators, and the oceans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"promote-embed\" data-related-post-number=\"1\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn January, \u003ca href=\"https://www.environmentalleader.com/2019/01/taco-bell-recyclable-cups/\"\u003eTaco Bell\u003c/a\u003e also crowed over its own new plastic lids, as if creating more plastic would somehow fix the plastics crisis. “Love the Earth?

In order to make unqualified claims that a product is recyclable, recycling facilities have to be available to at least 60 percent of the consumers to whom it’s sold. But the How2Recycle symbol is now affixed to several products that will be all but impossible for many consumers to recycle, including cups, plates, and containers made from plastics Nos. 3 through 7, all of which now have recycling rates close to zero.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsked about the “guilt-free” pouch, Kelly Cramer, director of How2Recycle at GreenBlue, wrote in an email that the product was not “appropriately qualified” for the label and said that the organization would “reach out to this company immediately to rectify.” Regarding the pictures of plastic cups and plates that are not accepted by recyclers in most parts of the country but whose packaging bore the How2Recycle label, Cramer said that the label referred to the bags that contained the cups and plates, which is recyclable if brought back to an in-store recycling program, but acknowledged that the plates and cups inside them were not recyclable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough How2Recycle provides “not recyclable” as well as “recyclable” labels, it is the member companies’ choice whether to apply them, she said. “That member chose not to label the product,” Cramer said. “This is an area where we’ve given the member a choice to label the product or not.

Most municipal recycling programs don’t accept shopping bags and other flexible plastic, which can snag machines.

The plastic first has to be washed and dried, according to WRAP, and even then only some of it can be recycled. The program can recycle the clear wrap you might put around food at home, as well as bags that contain most produce, groceries, and bread, but not candy-bar wrappers, six-pack rings, and the plastic bags that contain chips or frozen food.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut even as WRAP promotes the message that plastic film can and should be recycled, and \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/WRAPrecycling/status/1146118879103660037\"\u003escolds\u003c/a\u003e people who don’t put plastic bags in recycle bins, many of the used bags and other plastic waste it collects wind up being burned or sent to landfills.

The ACC report admitted that some of the bags wound up where they would have if they didn’t first make a brief stop in a bag-recycling bin. “Due to a lack of buyers — for the quality and amount of material available — towards the end of 2017, landfilling material started to be more economical (despite diversion or other environmental goals) than covering the handling and shipping costs of getting material to market.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s not clear what happened to the 300 million pounds of film that were sold for recycling in 2016 but not in 2017. Because the ACC doesn’t report the total amount of plastic film collected, what proportion of the collected film that represents is also obscure. Nor is it clear why the ACC has not yet reported the 2018 numbers. But even within the 1 billion pounds of plastic film the ACC categorized as “recycled,” much is likely either burned or landfilled. According to the report, 378 million pounds of the film were exported, and the ACC said in an emailed statement to The Intercept that it doesn’t know what happened to the waste after that point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough the ACC doesn’t put an exact number on the total amount of bags that were burned or landfilled, a recent \u003ca href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6184756-Original-Call-to-Action-PCR.html\"\u003ecall to action\u003c/a\u003e from a group of plastics recyclers called Recycle More Bags does.

They just had to put the plastic trash into special orange Hefty bags, put them out on the curb, and the city would pick up and recycle the trash. “They were very definitely calling it recycling,” recalls Richard Yoder, a local sustainability consultant. But Yoder and other Omahanians soon learned that rather than being melted down into reusable plastic, the contents of their bags were being burned in an incinerator in Missouri that had a \u003ca href=\"https://echo.epa.gov/detailed-facility-report?fid=110012704136\"\u003ehistory\u003c/a\u003e of Clean Air Act violations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast year, after Yoder argued at a \u003ca href=\"http://greenomaha.org/event/environmental-ethics-on-trial-the-good-the-bag-and-the-ugly/\"\u003elocal debate\u003c/a\u003e over the program that calling the Energybag program recycling was misleading, Hefty stopped using that term. Yet, in labored language, the company’s \u003ca href=\"https://www.hefty.com/hefty-energybag/hefty-energybag-program\"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e still pitches the program as an environmental good, or “a groundbreaking initiative that collects hard to recycle plastics.” The Hefty EnergyBag program “complements existing recycling programs,” according to Ashley Mendoza, a spokesperson for Dow. “Our long-term vision is to keep more plastics out of landfills by collecting them for recycling or recovery if they cannot be reused.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the \u003ca href=\"https://www.no-burn.org/energybagpr/\"\u003eGlobal Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives\u003c/a\u003e called out the Omaha program for creating more pollution, the Dow and Hefty initiative also stopped sending the orange bags to the incinerator. Since then, the plastic waste has been put to several purposes, including being compressed into fence posts and railroad ties and going “to a Canadian firm that made some sort of decking,” according to Dale Gubbels, CEO of \u003ca href=\"https://firststarrecycling.com/\"\u003eFirstStar Recycling\u003c/a\u003e, the Omaha company partnering with Dow and Hefty on the project.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class='stylized pull-right'data-shortcode-type='pullquote' data-pull='right'\u003eBecause no one has learned how to remove additives from plastic, products made from recycled waste can release toxic chemicals as they degrade.\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Dow and Hefty promote the program as a way to convert plastic into “valuable energy sources,” it isn’t cheap, according to Gubbels. The expense has apparently disappointed some initial proponents, who expected the program to pay for itself. “I have to try to convince them if you want to recycle, you have to recognize that you’ve got to pay for it,” he said. All in all, he added, the program, which was pitched as an energy-efficient solution to plastic waste, has proven “far more challenging than anyone had envisioned when this thing got started.” According to an email from Mendoza, “The price of the Hefty® EnergyBag® orange bags cover the cost of running the program.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScientists point out another hitch in the energy bag plan: Because no one has learned how to remove additives from plastic, products made from recycled waste, such as the railroad ties, fence posts, and decks made from Omaha’s plastic, can release toxic chemicals as they degrade. “Until we do a better job of eliminating the hazards in its first use, you’re going to have problems managing the toxicity in every subsequent use,” said Pete Myers, a biologist and the founder and chief scientist of \u003ca href=\"https://www.healthandenvironment.org/about/staff-consultants-and-advisors/advisory-board/pete-myers-phd\"\u003eEnvironmental Health Sciences\u003c/a\u003e. “Some of the types of plastics that they’re proposing to recycle contain chemicals connected to a 50-year decline in sperm count, to type 2 diabetes, and to breast and prostate cancer. These are serious problems and we don’t know enough about the exposures to make it safe for the child sitting on that deck.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen asked about this possibility, Gubbels said he hadn’t considered it and didn’t have expertise in toxic chemicals. In any case, Gubbels has been spreading Omaha’s plastic waste around. He sent one recent load to Renewlogy, a plant in Salt Lake City, Utah, that heats the plastic and extracts energy from it, and said he plans to send a load to a similar plastic-to-energy facility in Texas called New Hope Energy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eThe Myth of “Chemical Recycling”\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRenewlogy and New Hope are two firms offering what the plastics industry is putting forward as the newest solution to plastic waste: so-called chemical recycling. According to the \u003ca href=\"https://www.americanchemistry.com/Media/PressReleasesTranscripts/ACC-news-releases/Report-Finds-10-Billion-in-Potential-Economic-Output-from-Advanced-Technologies-That-Recycle-and-Recover-Plastics.html\"\u003eAmerican Chemistry Council\u003c/a\u003e, expanding plastics recovery into this realm could “result in billions of dollars of economic output.” Yet even the technology’s biggest proponents acknowledge that no one yet knows how to efficiently and economically convert plastic into its component parts and then back into fuel. If all the non-recycled plastics in the U.S. were converted to oil, “we could create enough fuel to power 9 million cars each year,” the Chevron Phillips sustainability director, Rick Wagner, argued in a recent \u003ca href=\"https://resource-recycling.com/plastics/2018/02/20/opinion-plastics-fuel-launchpad-innovation/\"\u003earticle\u003c/a\u003e in Plastics Recycling Update magazine. That transformation would also allow Chevron, the \u003ca href=\"https://www.plasticpollutioncoalition.org/pft/2019/4/9/7vynjta76svqssdj39yx76yxgmol47\"\u003esecond-largest\u003c/a\u003e plastic manufacturer in the world, to shrug off its responsibility for the massive quantities of pollution now choking the globe. But even Wagner admits that we’re still far from knowing how to chemically recycle. It’s sort of like \u003ca href=\"https://resource-recycling.com/recycling/2018/01/25/opinion-launchpad-circularity/\"\u003egoing to Mars\u003c/a\u003e, Wagner wrote. “We’re not quite there yet. Not tomorrow, but someday. Hopefully soon.” Mendoza described pyrolysis, the method used by the Renewlogy plant to which Hefty EnergyBag waste has already been sent, as “a potential next step toward advanced recycling.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe idea that plastic can be broken down into its elements, which can then be turned into fuel, waxes, and lubricants has been around for decades. But such waste-to-fuel plants have never proven economically or environmentally viable. According to a 2017 \u003ca href=\"https://www.no-burn.org/wp-content/uploads/Waste-Gasification-and-Pyrolysis-high-risk-low-yield-processes-march-2017.pdf\"\u003ereport\u003c/a\u003e of the Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives, most of the waste-to-fuel projects in the U.S., Canada, and Europe, which used either pyrolysis or a related technology called gasification, were closed or canceled before even getting off the ground. Among the impediments cited in the report were the inability to meet energy efficiency and pollution control goals. “In general, costs are higher and more uncertain than project proponents foresee and revenues are lower and more uncertain,” the report noted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class='stylized pull-left'data-shortcode-type='pullquote' data-pull='left'\u003eWaste-to-fuel plants have never proven economically or environmentally viable.\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe environmental and financial viability of the latest energy-to-fuel plants is also unclear. When asked about the efficiency of the facilities used by the Hefty EnergyBag program, Mendoza wrote in an email that “material efficiency of a pyrolysis processing unit is dependent on the technology used and the types of materials fed into the facility.” Mendoza also wrote that “Dow has a vital interest and responsibility in making plastic materials beneficial throughout their lifecycle. We are working to improve the entire system where our products are used in order to maximize resource efficiency and the benefits derived from using our products.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither New Hope or Renewlogy, two of the nine companies in the American Chemistry Council’s \u003ca href=\"https://plastics.americanchemistry.com/Chemical-Recycling-Alliance.html\"\u003eindustry alliance\u003c/a\u003e for chemical recycling, would reveal what volume of plastics their plants require to produce fuel. Renewlogy did not respond to numerous emailed interview requests. But the company’s \u003ca href=\"http://renewlogy.com/press/\"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e says that between Omaha’s waste and that collected through a similar Hefty EnergyBag program in the city of Boise, a million pounds of plastic were “diverted” in 2018. A video on the site also describes Renewlogy’s process as cost-effective and “proven clean.” The New Hope plant in Texas issued a press release announcing that it will have a capacity to process 150 tons of plastic a day, but the company declined to comment on that facility’s efficiency. “It’s a brand-new industry and there are some things we can’t communicate about,” said Lee Royal, who answered the phone there. “How we do business is probably not something we’d like to share just now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn an emailed statement, the American Chemistry Council defended the value of chemical recycling, noting that “these technologies can produce a wide range of products beyond fuel, including higher value chemicals and other feedstocks” and that such products “have much greater value in the marketplace than in a landfill.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"shortcode\" data-shortcode=\"newsletter\" data-campaign=\"\" data-cta=\"\" data-headline=\"\" data-layout=\"\" data-subhead=\"\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe big open questions about the efficiency, safety, and economic viability of the chemical recycling process — and the admissions from its proponents that they haven’t figured out how to make it work — haven’t stopped the chemical industry from passing laws facilitating funding of the scheme. Texas recently became the \u003ca href=\"https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/energy/article/Texas-part-of-national-push-for-laws-promoting-13847145.php\"\u003esixth state\u003c/a\u003e to pass legislation (supported by Chevron Phillips Chemical, Exxon Mobil, and the American Chemistry Council) that would pave the way for new chemical recycling facilities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of these laws have been designed to ensure that the facilities will be subject to minimal regulation. By categorizing them as manufacturing plants rather than solid waste disposal sites, chemical recycling operations may be exempted from limits on nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, particulate matter, heavy metals, and greenhouse gases that are imposed on solid waste sites.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNevertheless, chemical recycling facilities are already being promoted — and, in some cases, funded — as sustainable fixes for the plastics problem. In \u003ca href=\"https://www.statesmanjournal.com/story/news/2019/05/13/marion-county-garbage-disposal-rates-double-covanta-marion/1190973001/\"\u003eOregon\u003c/a\u003e, a waste management company is pushing to get its plastic-burning plant classified as renewable energy. And in Ashley, \u003ca href=\"https://www.apnews.com/Business%20Wire/c737fea879cc485aabd711e9db240aec\"\u003eIndiana\u003c/a\u003e, a new chemical recycling plant is being financed with $85 million in green bonds from the state, funds that are earmarked for environmentally beneficial projects. Brightmark Energy, the company behind it, says its \u003ca href=\"https://brightmarkenergy.squarespace.com/#mission\"\u003emission\u003c/a\u003e is to “rise up and meet the needs of our planet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome have objected to the use of taxpayer money to back a process that has repeatedly failed financially when it’s been tried in the past. “Every one of these pyrolysis facilities has depended upon government largesse to even try to get off the ground,” said Andrew Dobbs, campaign director at Texas Campaign for the Environment, a group that opposed the Texas bill. “So-called chemical recycling doesn’t make economic sense. It’s a highly expensive and energy-intensive process that’s competing with burying things in a hole in the ground. On the other end, they’re producing fuel, which is competing with natural gas when natural gas is dirt cheap. The only way they’re going to make that work is for the costs to be paid by someone else.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to the email from the American Chemistry Council, chemical recycling “facilities are being developed by venture capital and investment firms, which is a vote of confidence in the financial promise of these technologies and business models.” The email also noted that “Chemical recycling technologies are developing very quickly and — like other technologies including wind and solar — will become more efficient as they reach commercial scale.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhether it can meet its goal of turning 288 tons of plastic per day into 778 barrels of diesel blend stocks, 418 barrels of naphtha blend stocks, and 360 barrels of industrial wax, this latest take on plastic recycling will, like all chemical recycling plants, use fossil fuels to convert fossil fuel products into additional fossil fuels. They will also almost surely ease the way for the continued production of even more plastic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is all just a huge, incredibly expensive distraction,” said Denise Patel, U.S. program director at the Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives. While China’s decision to stop taking U.S. plastic finally revealed the country’s plastics problem, the idea of chemical recycling — fanciful as it may be — could undermine public urgency about it, according to Patel. “China’s decision is an opportunity for cities to examine waste and double down on reducing,” she said. “Instead, these projects are exacerbating the problem by giving people the idea that there is a solution and it’s OK to keep buying them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the industry conference in Texas, no one asked whether it was OK to keep producing more plastic. After the pictures of injured sea creatures were gone and an accountant spoke to the executives about how to best take advantage of Trump’s cuts to the top tax brackets, attendees learned about the bright prospects for their industry. Exports of the world’s most popular plastic, polyethylene, will not just continue, but will likely experience “healthy growth” over the next several years, as a presentation from the investment research firm IHS Markit explained. Nor was there much question where all that new plastic will be sold. An increasing share is expected to go to Asian countries other than China, since the growing awareness of plastics pollution in Europe and North America may slightly weaken markets there. The only real question about the proliferation of a product we know to be heating the planet, amassing all around and within us, and poisoning water and air around the world, is what new techniques its producers will adopt to make it seem fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe post \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/07/20/plastics-industry-plastic-recycling/\"\u003eHow the Plastics Industry Is Fighting to Keep Polluting the World\u003c/a\u003e appeared first on \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com\"\u003eThe Intercept\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://theintercept.com/2019/07/20/plastics-industry-plastic-recycling/","published":"2019-07-20T11:30:36Z","guid":"https://theintercept.com/?p=259226"},{"title":"Ele nos distraiu e nos enganou de novo: o que o governo aprontou enquanto Bolsonaro mentia para proteger os filhos","content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eEste texto foi publicado originalmente na newsletter do Intercept Brasil.

International cooperation in many fields, including free trade, environment, the rule of law, international organizations and more are being hit in unprecedented ways. While some nations are threatened by unilateral economic sanctions and military aggressions, others are bearing the brunt of a crude American protectionist impulse. Even many US allies are subject to an unprecedented wave of intervention in their domestic affairs. Remembering the catastrophic results of the previous wave of American unilateralism in the early 2000s, including invasions, brutalities and violent extremism, we have a duty to stand up to and repulse the new wave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy country is at the forefront of resisting the US new unilateral tendencies, which includes outright economic terrorism. Our sincere efforts to address the concern about our nuclear peaceful program, though baseless, is one among many victims of new unilateralism. The US administration is defeating the Iran nuclear deal, despite the investment the whole world made to bring it about. And in the process it has not only breached the relevant Security Council resolution, but also ironically sanctioned those who try to abide by it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gross US intervention in domestic affairs of our host, Venezuela, including through instigating the failed coup attempt in last April, is another example of the US malign behavior. The novelty is that the new US administration is shedding the mask and showing open and unveiled disrespect for international law and the rights of sovereign nations. The people of Venezuela, as in every other country, are the supreme authority to elect their president as they did in May 2018. They are now entitled to rise in defense of their elected president.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLikewise, the US unilateral and rogue impulse is destroying any bases already set in place to resolve the Palestinian question, with the occupation at its center. The illegal US moves, which aims to deny the basic rights of the Palestinian people, are exacerbating the situation in the whole Middle East. Those very few Arab regimes who have aligned themselves with these and other US schemes are not only betraying the Palestinian people, but are also jeopardizing peace and security in the whole region.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Chairman,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOpposing unilateralism and trying to promote the rule of law at the international level have always been high on the NAM agenda since its inception. As the law-based international order is now threatened more than ever in the past, it is imperative for NAM Member States to close their ranks and focus on how to repel this threat. All of us will lose if we don’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe post \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ifpnews.com/exclusive/iran-slams-us-unilateralism-as-major-challenge-to-nam/\"\u003eIran
