The truth is that over half of sales on Amazon are from third parties, and the number is increasing. Furthermore, Amazon makes more money on third party products than it does on those it sells itself. In other words, Amazon is primarily a distribution company, but it’s got no idea what it’s distributing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHOW CAN THIS BE?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is what happens when you live in the land of visionaries focused first and foremost on profits, where their solution is always algorithms as opposed to human hands/eyeballs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot that there is not duplicity. Earlier this week, the WSJ printed an exhaustive analysis of how people are overpaying for bandwidth, as in they don’t need that much and they’re paying too much for what they do have. In other words, most people don’t need 100 Mbps down, never mind a multiple of that, and the cable companies trick customers into paying for higher speeds, often as freebies that expire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWelcome to the information age, where there’s no consensus and the word can’t get out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow if this had been ten years ago, fifteen, these “Wall Street Journal” investigations would be all over the papers and TV, everybody would be aware of them. But today, the WSJ is a sideshow in news. Everything’s gone topsy-turvy. We pay attention to the talking heads/arguers on cable news and are exposed to disinformation online, to the point where the truth has little traction. Furthermore, there are bad actors doing their best to counter truth with falsehood, which is why YouTube shut down so many channels of propaganda re the Hong Kong protests. That’s right, in China people don’t know the truth. Now the perpetrators are trying to spread these falsehoods to not only Hong Kong, but the rest of the world, to change perception and quell unrest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut we don’t believe this happens in the U.S. Mueller says the Russians are messing with our elections right now and the President pooh-poohs it. It’s as if D.C. is analog while the rest of the country is digital. And since everybody’s on their own in America, and tort lawyers are the enemy, if you’re the victim of an unsafe product, already banned but sold on Amazon, good luck fighting back. Especially if the seller is unfindable or out of business, which is oftentimes the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lunatics have taken over the internet. It’s not only 8chan, but the big name companies, i.e. Amazon, Facebook and Google. Somehow, Apple has remained outside this fray, locking up its platform with rules for safety. But when it kicked the big guys out of their App Store (yup, the household names were hoovering up data from its customers via their apps), somehow Apple becomes the bad guy and relents. And the truth is, while most of the profits lay with Apple, the upscale choice, the world is dominated by Android with holes galore. That’s what happens when something is free, you’ve got to pay for it somehow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo while the big bad tech companies are labeled as all-powerful monopolies, the truth that is being revealed is that they’ve lost control of their platforms, with seemingly no ability to get it back. If Amazon discontinues third party selling, its profits will crater, and investors won’t stand for it. There’s not enough money in the world to vet all YouTube videos. And Facebook is the land of Whac-A-Mole, only the platform doesn’t seem aware of the moles and doesn’t have enough firepower to quash them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was happening in front of our very eyes. But we became addicted to these services, and humans have an urge to connect, and are lazy and like delivery and are addicted to low prices. StubHub proffers an all-in price right upfront and sales tank. Somehow the public likes deception.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is the story of our age, how no one is in control and nobody is talking about it. We’re busy raging about Trump when our nation is being eaten up and torn apart from the inside. Hell, look at spam e-mail, after two and a half decades it’s still an issue, and phishing scams are still prevalent. And now the big story is fighting robocalls. But there’s always a provider who will allow them (they’re sent via the internet, i.e. VOIP). This is a quality of life issue. But the truth is most people will not answer a phone call unless they know who’s on the line. But somehow these same people will wander into the wilderness and play on social networks and buy from Amazon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s like one of those alien/monster movies. Or like “2001.” We’ve built the platforms and now they’ve turned on us and are wreaking havoc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the word is just getting out, and no one has got a solution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd no one can get the word out accurately to the masses. We’re in our own silos, with our own tribes, and we don’t trust anything from outsiders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce upon a time we believed in musicians.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then they put money before art and lost our faith.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then for twenty years we placed our faith in the techies, at least they said they were into the money right up front, and there were a hell of a lot more zeros.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now the techies have been revealed to be flawed personally, as well as their products.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut few know and few know where to turn. The canard is if you’ve got enough guns you can save yourself. But this is patently untrue. The next war, the coming war, the war that is happening right now, is being waged via 0’s and 1’s, i.e. digitally. Those who can program, who can use the new tools, who understand them, who are aware of their flaws, cannot only run circles around the hoi polloi, but the government itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd we argue about social issues because we can’t understand technology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou have to know how the machine works, you have to have the power of analysis. But in a world where everybody thinks they’re going to be a rapper or an influencer, the hoi polloi have no clue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it affects you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://on.wsj.com/2ZsegIw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003e“Amazon Has Ceded Control of Its Site.

But the length and timing of the suspension have led his critics—including, increasingly, many in his own party—to argue that the move not only frustrates British Parliamentarians\u0026#8217; attempts to negotiate an orderly exit from the EU ahead of the October 31 cut-off, but worse, is a cynical assault on the norms that underpin British democracy. (It\u0026#8217;s not just MPs: according \u003ca href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c9c3e030-42f5-325a-8990-742d5399f40d\"\u003eto one poll\u003c/a\u003e, just 13% of British adults buy Johnson\u0026#8217;s logic.) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAmid the maelstrom, the Queen agreed to the suspension. She really had no choice, constitutional experts say: she is duty-bound to follow the advice of the British prime minister. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0026#8220;It would have been very, very difficult for the Queen not to follow the government\u0026#8217;s advice,\u0026#8221; says Robert Hazell, a professor at University College London\u0026#8217;s Constitution Unit. \u0026#8220;And there\u0026#8217;s no evidence that [Johnson] is seeking to avoid a vote of no confidence,\u0026#8221; which would trigger a general election, he added. If Parliamentarians wish to bring down the government, they have time to do so next week. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStill, the move \u0026#8220;put her on the spot,\u0026#8221; says Hazell. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat awkwardness did not go unnoticed. Jeremy Corybn, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, and other party leaders, said they would petition to meet with the Queen directly—a claim Hazell noted is basically \u0026#8220;for show.\u0026#8221; \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen, there were the legal challenges to this week\u0026#8217;s series of events, including one backed by a previous prime minister and a cross-party range of MPs, arguing that Johnson\u0026#8217;s advice to the Queen should be legally struck down. A hearing will be heard \u003ca href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-49523055\"\u003enext Thursday in London\u003c/a\u003e.

That\u0026#8217;s the possibility that MPs may pass promised legislation blocking the possibility of a no-deal Brexit, and that Johnson may then ask the Queen to withhold the \u0026#8220;Royal Assent\u0026#8221;—the official Royal rubber-stamp—for that legislation to become law.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the question of whether such a thing has ever happened before, you might find yourself combing the history books of Great Britain and the wider Commonwealth, and encountering crises with names like the \u0026#8220;Scottish Militia Bill\u0026#8221; (Queen Anne, 1707), the \u0026#8220;King-Byng Affair\u0026#8221; (Canada, 1925), and \u0026#8220;The Dismissal\u0026#8221; (Australia, 1975). \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"wp-block-image\"\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"aligncenter\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-495597362.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2691471\" srcset=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-495597362.jpg 1024w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-495597362.jpg?resize=150,106 150w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-495597362.jpg?resize=300,212 300w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-495597362.jpg?resize=768,542 768w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-495597362.jpg?resize=281,198 281w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-495597362.jpg?resize=713,503 713w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-495597362.jpg?resize=100,71 100w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-495597362.jpg?resize=60,42 60w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-495597362.jpg?resize=154,109 154w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-495597362.jpg?resize=559,394 559w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-495597362.jpg?resize=392,276 392w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-495597362.jpg?resize=238,168 238w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-495597362.jpg?resize=660,465 660w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-495597362.jpg?resize=221,156 221w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-495597362.jpg?resize=472,333 472w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-495597362.jpg?resize=546,385 546w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-495597362.jpg?resize=600,423 600w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-495597362.jpg?resize=90,63 90w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-495597362.jpg?resize=85,60 85w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-495597362.jpg?resize=174,123 174w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-495597362.jpg?resize=115,81 115w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-495597362.jpg?resize=698,492 698w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-495597362.jpg?resize=735,518 735w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eQueen Elizabeth could face an even greater constitutional crisis next week if she is drawn back into a vote by Parliament against the Government.

B Corp shone a light on those practices.

We’ve been carbon-neutral since 2010, so we’ve been doing a lot of work and setting up to become climate positive next year. So an example of that is we will be offsetting at 125% as of 2020.

We know that tourism is fantastic in job creation, but we should be distributing that wealth. That’s something that we’ve really been looking at. We’ve been trying to flip that around and focus on under-tourism, community-based tourism projects. We launched a project in Vietnam in a community that was struggling in the face of climate change, because its crops are no longer getting the same output. We helped them develop tourism products and invested in their community to build some lodging, et cetera, and now we bring probably a couple thousand tourists through there each year, and tourism is becoming a positive effect. So I think, How do we keep having a positive effect in a responsible manner, because we know tourism has positive effects, but we need to recognize and take action when it’s not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe second is how we combat the \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/05/02/climate-change-lifestyle/\"\u003eclimate\u003c/a\u003e crisis. I think at the end of next year we’ll probably be tackling a whole broader subsection of environmental issues. And the other, the third one, is modern slavery. We’ve done a lot of work about removing children from our supply chain and taking a stance on orphanage tourism. Children are not a tourist attraction. So it’s how we can continue to improve our supply chain and ensure that we’ve got a diverse, healthy supply chain that engages those businesses in the right way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Intrepid-Travel-Portugal-Lisbon-043-4.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2686282\" srcset=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Intrepid-Travel-Portugal-Lisbon-043-4.jpg 1100w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Intrepid-Travel-Portugal-Lisbon-043-4.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Intrepid-Travel-Portugal-Lisbon-043-4.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Intrepid-Travel-Portugal-Lisbon-043-4.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Intrepid-Travel-Portugal-Lisbon-043-4.jpg?resize=1024,684 1024w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Intrepid-Travel-Portugal-Lisbon-043-4.jpg?resize=281,188 281w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Intrepid-Travel-Portugal-Lisbon-043-4.jpg?resize=753,503 753w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Intrepid-Travel-Portugal-Lisbon-043-4.jpg?resize=100,67 100w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Intrepid-Travel-Portugal-Lisbon-043-4.jpg?resize=60,40 60w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Intrepid-Travel-Portugal-Lisbon-043-4.jpg?resize=154,103 154w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Intrepid-Travel-Portugal-Lisbon-043-4.jpg?resize=590,394 590w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Intrepid-Travel-Portugal-Lisbon-043-4.jpg?resize=392,262 392w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Intrepid-Travel-Portugal-Lisbon-043-4.jpg?resize=252,168 252w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Intrepid-Travel-Portugal-Lisbon-043-4.jpg?resize=697,465 697w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Intrepid-Travel-Portugal-Lisbon-043-4.jpg?resize=234,156 234w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Intrepid-Travel-Portugal-Lisbon-043-4.jpg?resize=498,333 498w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Intrepid-Travel-Portugal-Lisbon-043-4.jpg?resize=576,385 576w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Intrepid-Travel-Portugal-Lisbon-043-4.jpg?resize=600,401 600w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Intrepid-Travel-Portugal-Lisbon-043-4.jpg?resize=90,60 90w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Intrepid-Travel-Portugal-Lisbon-043-4.jpg?resize=184,123 184w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Intrepid-Travel-Portugal-Lisbon-043-4.jpg?resize=115,77 115w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Intrepid-Travel-Portugal-Lisbon-043-4.jpg?resize=736,492 736w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Intrepid-Travel-Portugal-Lisbon-043-4.jpg?resize=775,518 775w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eSelfie snapshots in Lisbon.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"image-credit\"\u003eIntrepid Travel\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou’ve said before that the bigger Intrepid gets, the bigger difference it can make.

Braun says there needs to be mutual respect. “If you start off demanding things, rather than compromising and moving towards a single point, the Chinese can’t negotiate from that standpoint because they’ll lose face. The current Chinese government is not going to do anything that will make them look weak.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe says the process should start with two general guidelines:\u003cbr /\u003e\n• Don’t talk about it in the press\u003cbr /\u003e\n• Work behind closed doors to try to find solutions\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnthony Chan agrees. \u0026#8220;The sense of national pride in China should never be underestimated.\u0026#8221; Chan has visited China 30 times over a period of 25 years as Chief Economist with JP Morgan, including meeting with government officials. \u0026#8220;They don’t want to look weak as they prepare to celebrate their 70th Birthday, so let’s stop publicly bashing them or telling the world that China badly wants or needs a deal and is begging us to negotiate. That makes China less likely to strike a deal with the U.S.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe says by negotiating behind the scenes, you could find out what issues are important to China and then quietly begin to offer those up in exchange for what\u0026#8217;s important to the United States, such as preventing IP theft and forced technology transfer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Navarro’s colleague, Greg Autrey, Professor of Entrepreneurship and Innovation at the Marshall School of Business at the University of Southern California, who co-authored the book, “Death by China” and co-produced the documentary by the same name, thinks the U.S. has been down that “nice” road before. “This task requires a lead disruptor, like the microcomputer industry required Steve Jobs and the auto and space industries needed Elon Musk. He sees Navarro, working with Trump, as that disruptor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For a historical analogy,” Autrey says. “Jimmy Carter was ‘nice’ with the Soviets. Ronald Reagan called them the ‘Evil Empire’ and the advocates of ‘nice’ were appalled. Neville Chamberlain was ‘nice’ and people were aghast at Winston Churchill’s gruff demeanor. General Montgomery was ‘nice’ and Patton was not. I’ll take Reagan, Churchill and Patton when I have an existential threat to deal with.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAutrey also says the financial media is being naïve when, after the Chinese cheat on all the agreements they’ve ever signed, the media wants someone from the Trump administration to just go in and get China to sign more agreements. “Why? So they can go back to selling off U.S. assets and transferring technology and capital while China builds nukes aimed at you and me? It’s just stupid.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAutrey says the U.S. can’t be soft on China. “Trump was smart enough to make it clear he has power, which is the only thing Beijing respects. He can then proceed from a position of authority.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course the on-again, off-again, tariff approach from Trump has not paid off on Wall Street, with the Dow Industrials in a range for the past two years. (Of course, stock prices are never based on one thing.) In addition, JP Morgan predicts that American families will pay about $1,000 in additional costs as consumers, on average, as the result of trade tariffs; and several economists have revised their economic projections downward, including the Congressional Budget Office. And there’s also the inverted yield curve, often a harbinger of a recession. (Again, not necessarily tied directly to the tariffs.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProfessor Braun doesn’t see playing hard ball with tariffs on China will bring factory jobs back to America. “I don’t expect it to happen,” says Braun. “Our U.S. wage rate is too high relative to some Southeast Asia countries.” And he points out that the factories moving out of China are not opening up here in the U.S. “They’re going to places like Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth Braun and Chan agree that the benefit for China of reaching an agreement is having access to Western markets. “I think they still want to trade with the U.S., so they’ll be willing to give up something,\u0026#8221; says Braun. \u0026#8220;But ideally, it has to be an international effort, so that China would stand to lose access around the world if they didn’t comply.\u0026#8221; That would include the European Union, with Germany and the U.K., Canada, Mexico, and Japan, among others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;Why not capitalize upon that shared discontent,\u0026#8221; says Chan, \u0026#8220;by seeking to form a coalition with all these countries? That would make China feel isolated and more willing to make concessions that favor eliminating or at best reducing their hated trade practices.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Trump has already established that he likes to go it alone in dealing with the Chinese. That may actually lessen his leverage, especially given that he has an election coming up in a year, something the Chinese are fully aware of, and which they could use it to their benefit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the consequences of getting it wrong with China are summed up by Autrey, and he doesn’t mince words. “China is the most dangerous peer competitor the U.S. had ever faced. Unlike Germans or the Japanese Empire, they fully intend to displace us on the global stage. Like the Soviets they are determined to see our ideology perish. Unlike the Soviets we have made them wealthy and economically viable via the transfer of tech, capital and \u0026#8216;low level\u0026#8217; capitalism that they have incorporated into their centrally planned model.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSounds like a war with no easy end in sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eMore must-read stories from \u003c/span\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eFortune\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e—\u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/21/thirdlove-tech-diversity-women/\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eA rare tech company where women dominate\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e—Why \u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/20/wework-ipo-s-and-p-500/\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eWeWork won’t be in the S\u0026amp;P 500\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e after its IPO\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e—Is it “only human” to feel anxious about money? \u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/02/sofia-the-robot-finance-investing-interview/\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eTalking finance with Sophia the Robot\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e—\u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/16/europes-cyber-watchdog-for-banks-has-a-little-problem-it-keeps-getting-hacked/\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eEurope’s cyber watchdog for banks has a problem\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e—it keeps getting hacked\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e—Listen to our audio briefing, \u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/radio/\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eFortune\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e 500 Daily\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://flipboard.com/@fortune\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eFollow Fortune on Flipboard\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e to stay up-to-date on the latest news and analysis.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://fortune.com/2019/09/01/china-trade-war-what-it-takes-win-win/","published":"2019-09-01T11:00:32Z","guid":"https://fortune.com/?p=2687170"},{"title":"Deloitte’s Plan for Fighting Employee Burnout: Let AI Take Over the Dreaded HR and IT Tasks","content":"\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0026#8217;ve all had those days where getting the simplest thing fixed, or even a basic question answered, takes hours. It might be anything from a mysterious glitch in your desktop computer, to a query about what\u0026#8217;s covered by your employer\u0026#8217;s health insurance plan. Whatever your dilemma, resolving it takes a seemingly endless exchange of emails and voicemails that not only distracts you from your real work, but wrecks your mood, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf it seems like you\u0026#8217;re slogging through more of those frustrating days lately than ever before, you\u0026#8217;re not imagining it. As work keeps getting more complex, fast-paced, and demanding, time vampires have a maddening way of multiplying. Unsurprisingly, a new study from A.I.-powered workflow-management firm Service Now says that about half of employees worldwide \u003ca href=\"https://research.servicenow.com/assets/ServiceNow-GlobalEmployeeExperienceReport.pdf\"\u003e\u0026#8220;struggle to get answers to basic questions\u0026#8221; from HR or the IT help desk\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eKristine Dery calls them \u0026#8220;speed bumps\u0026#8221;—the inefficiencies baked into companies\u0026#8217; day-to-day operations that drag down productivity and, ultimately, profits. A research scientist who \u003ca href=\"https://cisr.mit.edu/blog/documents/2017/06/15/2017_0601_employeeexperience_derysebastian.pdf\"\u003estudies employee experience\u003c/a\u003e at the MIT Sloan Center for Information Systems Research (CISR), Dery thinks these obstacles wreak havoc on employee experience (EX). \u0026#8220;If you can\u0026#8217;t do your job efficiently, it\u0026#8217;s difficult or impossible to be happy in it, or get any satisfaction from it,\u0026#8221; she says. \u0026#8220;So companies now are continually seeking out speed bumps they can eliminate.\u0026#8221; \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026#8217;s a smart move, especially in the current labor market where hiring and retaining talent is most employers\u0026#8217; biggest challenge. Excessive speed bumps, on top of already ferocious workloads, are a major cause of burnout. And a whopping 96% of managers in a new study from staffing company Robert Half say they\u0026#8217;re seeing signs of workplace combustion in their employees. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat, in turn, seems to be scaring off the would-be candidates companies want most. More than two-thirds (69%) of job seekers in a different \u003ca href=\"https://blog.hibob.com/research-shows-69-of-candidates-reconsider-job-offers-if-your-people-seem-burnt-out/\"\u003ereport\u003c/a\u003e, from collaboration-platform software firm Hibob, are turning down even high-paying roles if their online due diligence reveals that employers\u0026#8217; overall EX is lousy, and especially if current staffers seem exhausted or are headed that way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#8217;s no wonder, then, that companies of all sizes—from huge global consulting and tech giants to tiny A.I. startups—are charging into the business of A.I.-assisted EX management. It\u0026#8217;s an enormous potential market. This year\u0026#8217;s annual \u003ca href=\"https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/insights/us/articles/5136_HC-Trends-2019/DI_HC-Trends-2019.pdf\"\u003eHuman Capital Trends report\u003c/a\u003e from Deloitte notes that, while 84% of organizations rate employee experience as important, only 22% think they\u0026#8217;re \u0026#8220;excellent\u0026#8221; at it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eDeloitte first itself introduced an A.I.-supported system called ConnectMe in 2016. It\u0026#8217;s designed to improve EX in two ways. First, ConnectMe\u0026#8217;s algorithms draw on vast amounts of in-house data, and then it uses chatbots to deliver fast, frictionless answers and solutions to just about any imaginable speed bump an employee might encounter. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOne reason it\u0026#8217;s so much quicker than interminable rounds of phone tag: People can get the help they need directly from the chatbots \u0026#8220;without interacting with another human being,\u0026#8221; says Bill Docherty, a Deloitte managing director and ConnectMe\u0026#8217;s general manager. Even so, if for some reason the chatbot can\u0026#8217;t quite handle a problem, \u0026#8220;a human manager will intercede,\u0026#8221; Docherty adds. \u0026#8220;Sometimes, the system can identify what\u0026#8217;s wrong, but it\u0026#8217;s still people who decide what to do about it.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eDeloitte\u0026#8217;s system can be customized for individual employees\u0026#8217; situations, providing essential information at each step of someone\u0026#8217;s overseas transfer or re-entry to the U.S., for example, or offering timely support and resources related to another workers\u0026#8217; upcoming maternity leave. What Docherty calls \u0026#8220;hyper-personalization\u0026#8221; is especially appealing, he says, to Millennials and digital-native Gen Zers who\u0026#8217;ve never lived in a one-size-fits-all world and aren\u0026#8217;t about to start now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe second way ConnectMe aims to make EX better is that it takes over the repetitive, boring parts of any given job, so that people can spend most of their time and talents on more complex, interesting work that demands a human touch. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs managing director in charge of personal wealth planning at Deloitte, Brian McMahon oversees the long-term financial health of about 600 of the company\u0026#8217;s partners, principals, and other senior executives. The routine data-gathering, data entry, and number-crunching his team has been doing the old-fashioned way (including \u0026#8220;chasing down data on things like salary history and names of insurance beneficiaries from different departments all over the company,\u0026#8221; he says) will be handled by ConnectMe beginning this fall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMcMahon can\u0026#8217;t wait. Having all the data and analytics he needs at his fingertips will \u0026#8220;eliminate mundane, mind-numbing tasks.\u0026#8221; \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;We\u0026#8217;ll be able to spend a lot more time meeting one-on-one with our clients, so we can better understand each person\u0026#8217;s financial goals, worries, and needs,\u0026#8221; he says. \u0026#8220;That\u0026#8217;s the fun part.\u0026#8221; That face-time, and the understanding that comes with it, is also the one thing that only humans can do, since it calls for the kind of empathy, EQ, and imagination that A.I.

When it came to New York, Shake Shack sold more than 700 units in one day.

Rosati and his team observed that juice bars are very popular in the region, so they set about drafting a menu of juices, date-based shakes, and mocktails. It should be noted here that Shake Shack’s local consultants are critical to introducing Shake Shack to a new audience. In this case, the local fixer possibly helped the U.S.-based team avert an expensive mistake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“He says to me, ‘This is great, man. This menu you created is great. I love the juices, I love the dates. But we don’t need this. Like, we know dates. We can make amazing pastries, savory items with dates. We have this whole juice thing down. We do this. We can’t make burgers. We don’t know how to do that. The milkshakes and fries, like that’s what you guys do and that’s probably why we want you to be here. Just come in, be yourself. People are going to come because this is really good stuff. We don’t know this stuff. We can’t do this, and you guys are the best,’” Rosati recalls. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt was at that point, Rosati says, that a light went off in his mind, denoting he was getting caught up in the local scenes because he found them exciting. At the same time, that excitement deviated from Shake Shack’s core mission. “Maybe that menu for Dubai was a little ambitious, but we still do stuff with dates. It’s just a little more restrained,” Rosati says. “We also had to realize that we are an American-inspired modern-day roadside burger stand.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eMore must-read stories from \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—Vancouver is a haven for \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/longform/vancouver-restaurants-cheap-tasting-menus/%E2%80%8E(opens%20in%20a%20new%20tab)\"\u003echeap but delicious tasting menus\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e—\u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/03/what-is-vietnamese-egg-coffee/\"\u003eVietnamese egg coffee\u003c/a\u003e is taking North America by storm–but what is it?\u003cbr\u003e—Why \u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/longform/charleston-restaurants-food-scene/\"\u003eCharleston’s food scene\u003c/a\u003e is stronger than ever right now\u003cbr\u003e—Foraging for high-end meals on Dominica, \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/longform/dominica-caribbean/%E2%80%8E\"\u003ethe Caribbean’s best-kept secret\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e—Listen to our new audio briefing, \u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/radio/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e 500 Daily\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://flipboard.com/@fortune\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eFollow Fortune on Flipboard\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e to stay up-to-date on the latest news and analysis\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://fortune.com/longform/shake-shack-new-menu-items/","published":"2019-09-01T11:00:00Z","guid":"https://fortune.com/?post_type=longform\u0026p=2689807"},{"title":"Behind the Rise in ‘Stadium’ Bags—and Why You’ll Be Needing One at Football Games This Fall","content":"\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat does she keep in that thing?\u003c/em\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat particular question has been a source of mystery surrounding women\u0026#8217;s purses for decades. But now fashion trends—and the National Football League—are making it completely, well, clear. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2013, the NFL announced an update to its bag policy, what you could and could not bring into a stadium on game day, and has continued to fine-tune that policy each year. As it stands, the only bag an average attendee at any NFL football game can bring in is a small clutch, the size of one’s hand, or a clear bag. The “All Clear” policy was a game changer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eCollege football, which is the trickle-down recipient of many NFL policies, followed suit with the majority of the Big Ten and Pac 12 schools adopting the same clear bag policy in 2016. When handbag designer Kelly Wynne, who’s based in Austin, heard the rumblings that the SEC would surely adopt the same policy and soon, her first thought was less for her eponymous purse line, but as a diehard Ole Miss alum and fan. “This is really going to cramp my style,” she said, explaining that Southern female fans care deeply about their appearance in the stands. “We dress up to go to these football games.”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWynne’s leather bags were already popular with women in the Southeast, and as they showed up regularly on Instagram post with hashtags devoted to game day outfits, it was fairly obvious what she needed to do.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe designer and her team kicked into high gear, condensing what is normally an 18-month process into six months, so that when the SEC did, in fact, announce its own clear bag policy in 2017, Kelly Wynne brought to market that July a clear bag based on the design of their best-selling leather purse. As a small batch business, Ann Elize Allen, the director of operations and production, was concerned the first order was too big, but they were sold out within a month and had a 50% increase in sales growth by the end of that year. Now the company offers six different clear bags, which account for roughly 50% of total revenue, and their order this year is five times the volume of their first order, “and we are still wondering if we ordered enough,” Allen said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOther companies such as Hammitt, Truffle Co. and Loeffler Randall have also debuted fashion-forward (and stadium compliant) bags in recent years. Stadium operators, for their part, care far less if a fan is carrying a sleek clear crossbody, adorned with tassels in the team’s colors, or a Ziploc gallon bag. So long as its no bigger than 12 x 6 x 12 inches. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the San Francisco 49ers played their first preseason game in August 2014 in the newly opened Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, CA, the team had been working for over a year to communicate to its season ticket holders and fans about the policy. Jim Mercurio, the team’s stadium general manager, who also sits on the NFL’s committee for stadium security, said the 49ers spent the first season flooding the zone, as it were, with radio and TV spots, signage that extended to the farthest reaches of the parking lot, prominent printing on the tickets, all to alert game-goers about the policy. Each year, the 49ers continue to advertise the policy as much as possible, the goal being that every person who comes to a game knows about the clear bag policy before they arrive and has planned accordingly. The efforts have paid off. “We are tracking very, very well for how long it takes to get into the facility,” Mercurio said, noting that Levi’s processes 30,000 people into the stadium in the final 30 minutes before kick-off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eA few miles up the road in Palo Alto, the majority of college football fans have accepted the new reality of attending large public events, but each year still brings indefatigable outliers, who want to debate the policy, the size of their bag, or to simply register their outrage. “It’s been a real adventure,” laughs Chris Dorst, director of guest services at Stanford. The university viewed the NFL as its roadmap when instituting the policy in 2016. “The expectation with each passing year is [the fans] will be more familiar and comfortable with the clear bag policy,” Dorst said. “We are happy with the way things have gone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut even beyond the world of sports, clear bags seem to be having a moment. Today’s Harajuku influencer or Shoreditch-based blogger might be rather surprised to find that they share an accessory with someone chanting, “Roll Tide!” “Clear bags are making a comeback from the ‘90s as a part of the nostalgia movement,” Avery Faigen, a retail analyst at EDITED, which tracks retail data, said. “Similar to the fanny pack comeback, clear bags would currently be classified as a micro-trend that’s seen mostly in streetwear.” Indeed, luxury designers like Balenciaga, Michael Kors, Chanel and Staud have all put out transparent bags in the last two years. According to EDITED data, clear handbag arrivals have increased by 235% over the last year, and their popularity is allowing retailers to increase prices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFaigen said, however, that the Fall 2019 and pre-Spring 2020 runway shows were filled not with PVC, but quilted and animal-skinned bags. “Only time will tell if clear bags will follow the same success as the fanny pack,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut for the game-day crowd, the clear look seems here to stay. Last year, Kelly Wynne bags, which previously had an almost exclusively Southern customer base, launched online at \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/fortune500/nordstrom-197/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eNordstrom\u003c/a\u003e and has since seen a major expansion in the geographic reach of its orders, particularly California. “I never in a million years thought I would be known for clear bags,” the designer said.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eMore must-read stories from \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—\u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/21/thirdlove-tech-diversity-women/\"\u003eA rare tech company where women dominate\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e—Why \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/20/wework-ipo-s-and-p-500/\"\u003eWeWork won’t be in the S\u0026amp;P 500\u003c/a\u003e after its IPO\u003cbr\u003e—Is it “only human” to feel anxious about money? \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/02/sofia-the-robot-finance-investing-interview/\"\u003eTalking finance with Sophia the Robot\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e—\u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/16/europes-cyber-watchdog-for-banks-has-a-little-problem-it-keeps-getting-hacked/\"\u003eEurope’s cyber watchdog for banks has a problem\u003c/a\u003e—it keeps getting hacked\u003cbr\u003e—Listen to our audio briefing, \u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/radio/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e 500 Daily\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://flipboard.com/@fortune\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eFollow Fortune on Flipboard\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e to stay up-to-date on the latest news and analysis.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://fortune.com/2019/09/01/stadium-bags-football-games/","published":"2019-09-01T12:30:57Z","guid":"https://fortune.com/?p=2689381"},{"title":"Tiny Luxuries Travelers and Foodies Love","content":"\n\u003cp\u003eSitting down to a meal recently, I slid my phone out from my back pocket to set it on the table; I don’t like to sit on it.

And it indeed has the perfect ingredients for debate: A sky-high valuation, a lack of profits, impressive growth, and an unconventional, effusive founder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe company is liability-heavy, overvalued in a space that is ostensibly easily copied, and is going public at a time when global markets are slowing, fanning recession fears. At the same time, investors have plowed billions into the company (which plans to list under the stock symbol \u0026#8220;WE\u0026#8221;) for a reason. Put on the rose-tinted glasses, the growth story WeWork tells is compelling. Riding on the rising mobile office trend, WeWork is disrupting a potentially massive market. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHere\u0026#8217;s the most bullish (and bearish) case. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBullish\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGrowth has been huge\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWeWork\u0026#8217;s revenue doubled to $1.8 billion in 2018. For companies, washing the dishes, fixing the WiFi, replacing the lightbulbs, or other so-called back office operations, are generally not things they excel at. That\u0026#8217;s especially the case for startups and gig economy workers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;We love WeWork,\u0026#8221; said Coterie co-founder Sarah Raffa. \u0026#8220;It\u0026#8217;s convenient, and it\u0026#8217;s nice to have access to a larger group of people.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe party supply startup with six employees initially opted to build out its own offices, but struggled with a frustrating string of logistical complications—getting hot water being among the to-dos. The team eventually decided to rent a WeWork space, and have been happy customers since. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNot too long ago, co-working spaces were considered a fad that would come and go with the gig economy. But companies including WeWork have sought not only to maintain their existing small company clientele, but also reach out to corporations such as \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/fortune500/ibm-31/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eIBM\u003c/a\u003e, which is now a customer of the co-working firm. And there is a believable argument for why larger corporations should outsource their offices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;For companies, [building an office] is not a core competency of theirs,\u0026#8221; said Industrious CEO Jamie Hodari. (Industrious is the third largest office sharing company stateside.) Companies like Industrious say this ability to focus on improving office design by gathering data on worker satisfaction and correlating that with features of the building—how close do they need to be to a window, for example, or does a certain amenity lower the chances of the worker leaving the company—can be valuable for larger firms who want to focus on getting a product out the door rather than the auxiliary work that gets it there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWeWork\u0026#8217;s prospectus emphasizes that 80% of members reported increased productivity after joining, and 78% of enterprise members say WeWork helped attract and retain talent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch4\u003eLosses may be less egregious than they look\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWeWork\u0026#8217;s losses in 2018 were jaw-dropping. At $1.9 billion, the company was massively outspending its $1.8 billion revenue. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut that could be oversimplifying the picture. The company has stepped hard on the accelerator when it comes to new locations, adding over 300 between 2016 to 2018, which could put those losses in context, per Ben Thompson\u0026#8217;s \u003ca href=\"https://stratechery.com/2019/the-wework-ipo/\"\u003eStratechery\u003c/a\u003e. Indeed new locations will be in the red for months before they can onboard customers and generate revenue. Bulls argue that if WeWork stopped expanding now and allowed its locations to mature, dots of green could appear across the map.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eShould WeWork achieve scale, bulls say, the company also then has more power to exert pricing pressure on its suppliers, giving the firm more negotiating power on rent prices and other office products, says Sandy Kory, managing director at Horizon Partners. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe problem? It\u0026#8217;s mostly guesswork—conjecture rather than fact. The filing fails to disclose whether WeWork locations for instance are profitable after a certain number of months, as WeWork\u0026#8217;s filing is light on location-specific detail.

Other co-working companies including Knotel and Industrious have recently raised more funding.

That Luxembourg-based business for instance posted revenue of $3.4 billion and income of $149.7 million in 2018; WeWork posted revenue roughly half of that at $1.8 billion in 2018 and a loss of $1.9 billion. Yet WeWork was last valued at $47 billion, while IWG commands less than a tenth of that at $4.5 billion in market capitalization.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNotably, WeWork dismisses comparisons to IWG, instead calling itself a tech company at heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut even when compared to tech company with similar top and bottom-line metrics that recently went public, its valuation remains a head scratcher, says the founder of Equity Zen, a market for private company shares, Phil Haslett.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eRide-hailing firm Lyft posted revenue that doubled to $2.2 billion in 2018 and a losses grew 32% to $911 million year-over-year. Yet that company is valued at about $15 billion. To be fair, Lyft operates in a completely different business. However, \u0026#8220;In regards to WeWork, we have seen lackluster interest, particularly compared to other IPOs like Spotify, Slack, Docusign,\u0026#8221; he said. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch4\u003eIt has a lot of debt \u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWeWork takes on long-term leases on buildings, and in turn rents out the space to consumers and businesses on a short-term period.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat mismatch puts WeWork at significant risk if there is a downturn. WeWork members typically pay on a monthly basis, with cancellations expected to tick upward in  in global recession. But the company is on the hook to pay at minimum $47.2 billion in the future, with leases lasting an average 15 years as a result of the office spaces it has rented. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;While our business has withstood localized recessions in various geographies, we have yet to experience a global economic downturn since founding our business,\u0026#8221; the filing reads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch4\u003eToo much depends on Adam Neumann\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026#8217;s not a whole lot of \u0026#8220;we\u0026#8221; in WeWork\u0026#8217;s corporate structure. While the company invokes its \u0026#8220;community\u0026#8221; 150 times in its prospectus and is slated to list under the symbol \u0026#8220;WE,\u0026#8221; investors will have little say in how the company is run by CEO and founder Adam Neumann, who will continue controlling the firm following the IPO via a dual class share structure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBased on the filing alone, such structure would be a positive as: \u0026#8220;We believe [Neumanns\u0026#8217;] strategic insight, leadership and commitment to the growth of our global team and community will provide us the leadership we need to execute our vision,\u0026#8221; the filing reads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut Neumann\u0026#8217;s control comes with real cost. As payment for a dual-class share structure, shares of the We Company will be excluded from major indices \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/20/wework-ipo-s-and-p-500/\"\u003eincluding the S\u0026amp;P 500\u003c/a\u003e—meaning popular index fund won\u0026#8217;t buy \u0026#8220;WE\u0026#8221; shares. Moreover, the traditional checks-and-balances traditionally imposed on companies between the CEO and his or her board dissolves with the dual-class share structure, with the CEO holding the ability to appoint directors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMuch of the recent negative sentiment surrounding WeWork has also centered on Neumann and his dealings with the company. Ahead of the IPO, Neumann was \u003ca href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/wework-co-founder-has-cashed-out-at-least-700-million-from-the-company-11563481395\"\u003ereported\u003c/a\u003e to have cashed out than $700 million through a mix of stock sales and debt. In the filing, WeWork also revealed that it paid Neumann\u0026#8217;s company $5.9 million for rights to use \u0026#8220;We,\u0026#8221; a fact that raised more than a few eyebrows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;Founders deserve a lot of credit,\u0026#8221; said Kory. But he notes, Neumann \u0026#8220;appears to be a little capricious.\u0026#8221;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd unlike a growing number of companies that have begun imposing clauses limiting the length of time a founder controls a company even in a dual-class setting, WeWork has made an unusual move to ensure control remains in the family: In the event that Neumann can no longer serve as CEO before 2029, his wife, Rebekah Neumann, will work with two board members to pick a successor, the S-1 filing specifies. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch4\u003e\u0026#8220;They took something intrinsically simple, and made it complicated.\u0026#8221;\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026#8217;s according to Rett Wallace, CEO and founder of Triton, a firm that focuses on evaluating new listings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWeWork\u0026#8217;s first IPO filing leaves investors with a basin of questions. While the firm does provide a macro level picture of the company, it fails to discuss operations on a per location level that is important in deciding whether a company should in fact be expanding to new locations. Wallace, like Kory, says he would like to see the unit economics of individual locations and understand how long it takes for each one to become profitable in different geographies, a factor that could help investors understand if WeWork at large can scale and become more profitable with each subsequent location.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMoreover, WeWork has also been criticized unconventional ways of measuring itself as a tech company. The company evaluates its profitability with the so-called “contribution margin including non-cash GAAP straight-line lease cost.” The measure though leaves out several expenses, including depreciation and amortization—a move that may make sense for a software company with very little in the ways of physical assets, but doesn\u0026#8217;t seem to line up when it comes to WeWork. Its offices are stocked with chairs, tables, kitchens and other physical items that are certain to devalue with time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;The growth is incredible. Their size is incredible. What makes it remarkable in every single way is that they are asking for all this money without a cogent explanation for why investors should hand it over,\u0026#8221; Wallace said. \u0026#8220;You think I need something custom and extra brain damage and complexity? Just serve up the math.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo even while the business model does have a place and has a chance at growing, the company\u0026#8217;s pretzel-like accounting structure alongside its convoluted corporate pecking order, sky-high valuation, and somewhat incestuous financial dealings with Neumann have certainly left some investors dubious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eMore must-read stories from \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—For tech companies going public, \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/27/uber-lyft-ipo-aftermath-lawsuits/\"\u003eIPO-related lawsuits\u003c/a\u003e are an unwanted side effect \u003cbr\u003e—\u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/27/ges-basic-businesses-underperforming-accounting-metric/\"\u003eGE’s basic businesses are badly underperforming\u003c/a\u003e, by this accounting metric\u003cbr\u003e—Ex-Fannie Mae CEO: \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/26/ex-fannie-mae-ceo-housing-will-be-fine-in-the-next-recession/\"\u003eHousing will be fine in the next recession\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e—100-year bonds?

He found an area of Hokkaido surrounded by mountains and near the coast—and with a climate similar to that of the Scottish Highlands—where he could set up shop, opening Nikka’s Yoichi distillery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile waiting for liquid from the distillery to age, Taketsuru started a juice company, Dai Nippon Kaju—described then as a “great Japanese juice company”—to make ends meet. Nikka launched its first whisky, aptly named Nikka Whisky, in 1940. However, the company’s name wasn’t changed to Nikka, a shortening of that juice company name, until 1952.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there’s no longer just one Nikka distillery. The company makes whisky at two distilleries in Japan: the Yoichi distillery, which uses coal-heated pot stills and steam-heated pot stills; and the Miyagikyo distillery, equipped with Coffey stills. Miyagikyo was completed in 1969. Both distilleries create uniquely different liquids, blended together for some of Nikka’s releases, and sold on their own for others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Taketsuru passed away in 1979, at age 85, his legacy continues at both Suntory and Nikka. We’re probably still a few years off from seeing the results, but both brands have ramped up production to prevent another Japanese whisky shortage in future, especially now that the world has fallen in love with Japanese whisky—in much the same way that Masataka and Rita fell in love as he was learning how to make it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eMore must-read stories from \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—\u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/longform/australian-winemakers-shiraz/\"\u003eAustralia’s new wave of winemakers\u003c/a\u003e won’t make Shiraz \u003cbr\u003e—How \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/longform/fruit-wines/%E2%80%8E\"\u003efruit wines\u003c/a\u003e are becoming a serious business\u003cbr\u003e—How to drink—and enjoy—\u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/10/chilled-red-wine-summer/\"\u003ered wine in the summer\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e—What I learned in \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/10/restaurants-bars-inclusion-training/\"\u003einclusion training at the world’s top cocktail festival\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e—\u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/10/boen-wines-nfc-technology-tap-phone/\"\u003eTap these bottles of wine with your phone\u003c/a\u003e to learn more about their makeup\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://flipboard.com/@fortune\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eFollow Fortune on Flipboard\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e to stay up-to-date on the latest news and analysis.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://fortune.com/2019/09/01/japanese-whisky/","published":"2019-09-01T13:00:47Z","guid":"https://fortune.com/?p=2686965"},{"title":"Dorian, Now a Category 5 Hurricane, Poised to Wreak Havoc Along Eastern Seaboard","content":"\n\u003cp\u003eHurricane Dorian, which became a \u0026#8220;catastrophic\u0026#8221; Category 5 hurricane early Sunday, continues to adjust its path, causing fear and consternation along the Southeastern Atlantic coast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe National Hurricane Center, in its \u003ca href=\"https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCPAT5+shtml/DDHHMM.shtml\"\u003e11 a.m. ET update\u003c/a\u003e Sunday, said the storm\u0026#8217;s sustained winds stood at 180 mph (with higher gusts), putting it at the highest possible level of the Saffir–Simpson scale.

Tech Backlash","content":"\u003cp\u003eThe problem isn’t so much that these companies are too big, but that they’ve lost control of their platforms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday the WSJ printed an exhaustive article about the sale of unsafe/fake/substandard merchandise on Amazon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce again, these tech companies are far ahead of the politicians, who’ve got no idea how they really work. The truth is that over half of sales on Amazon are from third parties, and the number is increasing. Furthermore, Amazon makes more money on third party products than it does on those it sells itself. In other words, Amazon is primarily a distribution company, but it’s got no idea what it’s distributing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHOW CAN THIS BE?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is what happens when you live in the land of visionaries focused first and foremost on profits, where their solution is always algorithms as opposed to human hands/eyeballs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot that there is not duplicity. Earlier this week, the WSJ printed an exhaustive analysis of how people are overpaying for bandwidth, as in they don’t need that much and they’re paying too much for what they do have. In other words, most people don’t need 100 Mbps down, never mind a multiple of that, and the cable companies trick customers into paying for higher speeds, often as freebies that expire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWelcome to the information age, where there’s no consensus and the word can’t get out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow if this had been ten years ago, fifteen, these “Wall Street Journal” investigations would be all over the papers and TV, everybody would be aware of them. But today, the WSJ is a sideshow in news. Everything’s gone topsy-turvy. We pay attention to the talking heads/arguers on cable news and are exposed to disinformation online, to the point where the truth has little traction. Furthermore, there are bad actors doing their best to counter truth with falsehood, which is why YouTube shut down so many channels of propaganda re the Hong Kong protests. That’s right, in China people don’t know the truth. Now the perpetrators are trying to spread these falsehoods to not only Hong Kong, but the rest of the world, to change perception and quell unrest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut we don’t believe this happens in the U.S. Mueller says the Russians are messing with our elections right now and the President pooh-poohs it. It’s as if D.C. is analog while the rest of the country is digital. And since everybody’s on their own in America, and tort lawyers are the enemy, if you’re the victim of an unsafe product, already banned but sold on Amazon, good luck fighting back. Especially if the seller is unfindable or out of business, which is oftentimes the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lunatics have taken over the internet. It’s not only 8chan, but the big name companies, i.e. Amazon, Facebook and Google. Somehow, Apple has remained outside this fray, locking up its platform with rules for safety. But when it kicked the big guys out of their App Store (yup, the household names were hoovering up data from its customers via their apps), somehow Apple becomes the bad guy and relents. And the truth is, while most of the profits lay with Apple, the upscale choice, the world is dominated by Android with holes galore. That’s what happens when something is free, you’ve got to pay for it somehow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo while the big bad tech companies are labeled as all-powerful monopolies, the truth that is being revealed is that they’ve lost control of their platforms, with seemingly no ability to get it back. If Amazon discontinues third party selling, its profits will crater, and investors won’t stand for it. There’s not enough money in the world to vet all YouTube videos. And Facebook is the land of Whac-A-Mole, only the platform doesn’t seem aware of the moles and doesn’t have enough firepower to quash them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was happening in front of our very eyes. But we became addicted to these services, and humans have an urge to connect, and are lazy and like delivery and are addicted to low prices. StubHub proffers an all-in price right upfront and sales tank. Somehow the public likes deception.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is the story of our age, how no one is in control and nobody is talking about it. We’re busy raging about Trump when our nation is being eaten up and torn apart from the inside. Hell, look at spam e-mail, after two and a half decades it’s still an issue, and phishing scams are still prevalent. And now the big story is fighting robocalls. But there’s always a provider who will allow them (they’re sent via the internet, i.e. VOIP). This is a quality of life issue. But the truth is most people will not answer a phone call unless they know who’s on the line. But somehow these same people will wander into the wilderness and play on social networks and buy from Amazon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s like one of those alien/monster movies. Or like “2001.” We’ve built the platforms and now they’ve turned on us and are wreaking havoc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the word is just getting out, and no one has got a solution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd no one can get the word out accurately to the masses. We’re in our own silos, with our own tribes, and we don’t trust anything from outsiders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce upon a time we believed in musicians.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then they put money before art and lost our faith.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then for twenty years we placed our faith in the techies, at least they said they were into the money right up front, and there were a hell of a lot more zeros.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now the techies have been revealed to be flawed personally, as well as their products.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut few know and few know where to turn. The canard is if you’ve got enough guns you can save yourself. But this is patently untrue. The next war, the coming war, the war that is happening right now, is being waged via 0’s and 1’s, i.e. digitally. Those who can program, who can use the new tools, who understand them, who are aware of their flaws, cannot only run circles around the hoi polloi, but the government itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd we argue about social issues because we can’t understand technology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou have to know how the machine works, you have to have the power of analysis. But in a world where everybody thinks they’re going to be a rapper or an influencer, the hoi polloi have no clue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it affects you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://on.wsj.com/2ZsegIw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003e“Amazon Has Ceded Control of Its Site.

The game was called \u003cem\u003ePlunge\u003c/em\u003e from developer Spooky Buns, and it more or less combined a tile-sliding puzzler with a rogue-lite dungeon crawler. It\u0026#8217;s a really cool formula, and at that time \u003ca href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2017/09/03/plunge-is-an-upcoming-puzzle-dungeon-crawler-with-a-great-art-style-at-pax-west/\"\u003ewe were able to go hands-on\u003c/a\u003e with \u003cem\u003ePlunge\u003c/em\u003e on a tablet and enjoyed it a ton.

That launch has gone well so far, but it will still be some time before Spooky Buns will know if it was successful enough to put the time and resources needed into finishing up and releasing a mobile version. The game plays great on the touchscreen and the nature of the game is very well-suited to mobile, but a mobile port isn\u0026#8217;t a 100% lock just yet. However, Spooky Buns does seem hopeful and definitely would love to put out the game on mobile, and until the time that it actually is 100% confirmed check out our latest look at \u003cem\u003ePlunge\u003c/em\u003e from PAX West 2019 below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"clear:both;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"video-responsive\"\u003e\n\t\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qZHzUGdOGwY\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://toucharcade.com/2019/09/01/pax-west-2019-plunge/","published":"2019-09-01T16:00:43Z","guid":"https://toucharcade.com/?p=257682"},{"title":"PAX West 2019: Here’s a Quick Look at the Nintendo Switch Lite","content":"\u003cp\u003eAfter months and months of rumors that Nintendo was going to release some sort of hardware revision of their mega successful hybrid console the Switch, they finally did officially announce the Switch Lite back in July. It\u0026#8217;s in a slightly smaller form factor than the OG Switch, and more importantly it does not have detachable Joy-Con controllers and instead is housed in a plastic body that\u0026#8217;s all one piece. This means it can ONLY be played in handheld mode; no docking to a TV, no tabletop mode. On the one hand, many people I see predominantly play their Switch in handheld mode anyway, so losing those features is no big loss. On the other hand, the ability to \u0026#8220;switch\" is literally the entire core design of the Switch, so it\u0026#8217;s kind of odd to remove those core features. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, I\u0026#8217;ve been perfectly happy with my launch Switch and while the Lite model does seem tempting with its slightly smaller footprint, I didn\u0026#8217;t think it was enough to make me want to go out and buy a whole new console. But they have the Switch Lite on display here at PAX West 2019, and well, these suckers are absolutely beautiful in person. Something I never considered is that since the Switch Lite has a slightly smaller screen than the normal model, its pixel density is actually considerably higher, and it\u0026#8217;s really striking how sharp and vibrant everything looks running on the Switch Lite screen. I tried to capture what I\u0026#8217;m talking about below but I\u0026#8217;m not sure how well the effect of the new screen comes through over video.

Boar Rebellion","content":"\u003cp\u003eThe instance group had been discussing a guild on Discord for a few days.  Well, we knew we had to make a guild, but we had to resolve the primary question when it comes to guild creation: The name!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVarious ideas had been pass about, things like \u0026#8220;The Nethergarde Choir\u0026#8221; or \u0026#8220;The Candle Takers\u0026#8221; or \u0026#8220;Blood of Heroes,\u0026#8221; the last being a reference to everybody\u0026#8217;s favorite Plaguelands death trap.  But none of them were really clicking.  And then Ula came up with \u0026#8220;Crag Boar Rebellion.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is difficult to explain why that stuck.  I guess it is kind of snappy and sounds impressive when you first hear it, but becomes somewhat silly when you think about it.  Also, we had been slaughtering many crag boars out in Dun Morogh, which I am sure added to things.  So, while we did not have a majority around to consider it, the guild naming steering committee decided we should just go ahead and pull the trigger on Saturday.  It was time to make a guild.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then came the awkward part; who was going to go buy the charter and ask people to sign it?  We gathered together outside the bank in Ironforge and both Skronk and I offered up half the cost of the 10s charter, opening up a trade to hand over our half.  That went about as well as you might expect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_73011\" style=\"width: 635px\"

inconsiderable percentage of our combined wealth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I stood outside of the bank and, when I saw a few unguilded people about\u0026#8230; you can\u0026#8217;t sign a charter if you\u0026#8217;re already in a guild\u0026#8230; I would ask aloud\u0026#8230; not shout, not whisper, but just say\u0026#8230; if people would please sign our guild charter.  Skonk and Ula worked the general channel looking to raise support from there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd together it seemed to work.  We were up to six then eight and then nine signatures before too long.  People were very nice about it and seemed to generally want to help us out.  It was indicative of the behavior I have seen for the most part on the server.  In my experience retro servers like this tend to be friendly as most people really want to be there and have a good time.  On top of that, RP servers tend to be the most chill of servers.  So we were nearly there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith one more signature needed I just started spamming some passers by with signature requests\u0026#8230; and somebody signed right away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd with the 10th signature I got up and ran back to the visitor\u0026#8217;s center and registered the guild.  I have learned to be quick.  I recall one guild registration fiasco where I got the signatures down on Goldshire then had to run up to Stormwind, during which time two people signed another charter\u0026#8230; people I had paid no less\u0026#8230; which took them off of our charter.  So I was taking no chances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGuild successfully registered, I thanked everybody in guild chat and said they could /gquit.  Most went right away.  A couple had logged off before we were done, so I kicked them.  And so we had a guild.  I made people officers and we logged in all of our alts and got everybody in the guild.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_73018\" style=\"width: 611px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\u003e\u003ca

Last week, on the other side of the country, fans picketed outside Netflix's Los Angeles headquarters with signs reading \"Algorithms don't tell stories.

There may be a hashtag, but the efforts to bring back \u003cem\u003eThe OA\u003c/em\u003e go far beyond the usual internet slacktivism.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"image shortcode-img right full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/wired-logo.png\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo be clear, there is also a Change.org petition.

around to consider it, the guild naming steering committee decided we should just go ahead and pull the trigger on Saturday.  It was time to make a guild.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then came the awkward part; who was going to go buy the charter and ask people to sign it?  We gathered together outside the bank in Ironforge and both Skronk and I offered up half the cost of the 10s charter,

The doors won’t open, and even if they do, the engine will not start. And because you will be in an area with no cell reception, it might be impossible for you to call for help.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIt is a particularly vexing part of the give-and-take of attaching everything to everything. With services like Zipcar, your rental car becomes not just a car, but a node in a complex, connected system.

We used a landline to call Zipcar, whose representatives told us about the reception issue. We could abandon the car, they said, and they would waive the normal fee. (Thanks!) Or we could wait for a tow. Unable to get a cab to come to us, we waited. A tow truck took us to a lot with reception, where the rental failed to start.

But it does occur. Zipcars in general work just fine when they do not have cell service, he said, as they have some internal memory that lets them function even when out of touch with the company servers. Indeed, making sure that the cars work when out of reception is a “mission-critical success factor” for the company, he said. Still, cars without reception become vulnerable in a few scenarios: when members lose or do not have their physical Zipcard with them, when they exceed their reservation time or want to extend their Zipcar reservation, or when the vehicle battery dies. That last scenario was the one my family and I found ourselves in, though we did not know it at the time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSuch issues might be rare—Prus declined to give any hard numbers to quantify how rare—but online, tales of the dreaded “out-of-comms scenario” abound.

I had just finished talking about the Catholic thinker Thomas Aquinas. My sin? According to my student, I had “intellectualized” Saint Thomas.

He was a believer at a secular liberal-arts school, and he was sick of being condescended to either by a campus lousy with self-congratulatory progressives or by teachers (like me, he assumed) who treated religious faith as an inert museum piece. “Wait,” I told him. “Today we talked historical context, and next time we’ll illuminate religious practice.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/06/free-speech-crisis-campus-isnt-real/591394/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eLee C.

As a teacher, I find remarkable resistance to bringing religious ideas and experiences into class discussions. When I ask what a philosopher had in mind in writing about salvation, or the immortality of the soul, my normally talkative undergraduates suddenly stare down at their notes. If I ask them a factual theological question about the Protestant Reformation, they are ready with answers: predestination; “faith, not works”; and so on. But if I go on to ask students how one knows in one’s heart that one is saved, they turn back to their laptops. They look anywhere but at me—for fear that I might ask them about feeling the love of God or about having a heart filled with faith. In my cultural-history classes, we talk about sexuality and identity, violence and revolution, art and obscenity, and the students are generally eager to weigh in. But when I bring up the topic of religious feeling or practice, an awkward silence always ensues.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs a nonbeliever myself, I am not trying to convert any student to any religion. Yet how to discuss religious faith in class poses a major challenge for nonreligious colleges and universities. How can such an institution claim to educate students about ideas, culture, and ways of life if students, professors, or both are uncomfortable when talking about something that’s been central to humanity throughout recorded history?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI teach my classes at Wesleyan University, where I am also the president. For most of its first century, the school was—as its name indicates—firmly in the tradition of the theologian John Wesley, the founder of Methodism. In 1831, Wesleyan’s first president, Wilbur Fisk, articulated the mission of the school as being for “the good of the individual and the good of the world,” drawing on Methodism’s synthesis of deeply personal spirituality and the pursuit of social reform. Indeed, the passion for reform often was energized by that spirituality. In the early 1900s, Wesleyan officially became a secular university, eventually prizing academic freedom and independent research rather than adhering to a set of religious teachings.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStill, Fisk’s words have continued to ring true. Although few of our students today know much about John Wesley’s charismatic preaching or the core tenets of Methodism, many of them are still perfectly comfortable with the idea of finding one’s own good while also doing work in the world that promotes what they now call social justice. If they no longer have a principled spirituality, they need to think hard about what else sustains efforts aimed at justice—and about how politics, ethics, and the nature of knowledge have been intertwined with religious faith and practice.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/06/2020-democrats-are-talking-about-religious-faith/592966/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eChris Coons: Democrats need to talk about their faith\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYet classroom discussions of these very subjects often seem threatening to even students of faith, who tell me they don’t want to be “outed” on campus. These undergrads encounter mostly secular professors who sometimes treat religious believers as somehow intellectually deficient, or as morally compromised by their commitments to traditions that their teachers have left behind.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese students have ample reason to feel left out. Not long ago, a group of such students at Wesleyan asked me to participate in a discussion about religion on campus, and now it was my turn to try to hide. “Hey,” I said, “I’m an atheist Jew. I’m the wrong guy to talk about these topics.” They pressed: \u003cem\u003eWhat happened to your commitment to intellectual diversity?\u003c/em\u003e I signed up for the event. The organizers had planned a public conversation with Michael Wear, the director of evangelical outreach for President Barack Obama’s 2012 campaign, and more than 100 students attended, comfortable to be talking about these issues in “safe enough” company. I participated, but while doing so I also explained my reluctance to show up. As a Jew, I worried about the easy slide from “evangelical outreach” to harassment, and then to anti-Semitism. The tension in the room was real, and so were the issues we discussed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI wasn’t converted to Wear’s liberal evangelicalism that night, and he wasn’t persuaded by my combination of atheism and Torah study. What I took away most of all was the reluctance of students to “bring their whole selves to class”—as we urge all Wesleyan students to do—because of perceived prejudice against faith practices. Now, some may say that students should check their faith at the door (perhaps alongside their privilege) before they enter the seminar room. But that’s not the way I teach. In my classes, I want students to bring their complex, changing identities into our efforts to wrestle with enduring questions of love and judgment, justice and violence, grace and forgiveness. These are historical questions, but they can also be meaningful in students’ lives right now. If we neglect these issues in our liberal-arts classes, we are cutting off a vital domain of human experience from an education claiming to deepen cultural understanding. And we desperately need that understanding in our polarized society.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn my next class with Tom, we talked about Aquinas’s connection to Saint Augustine’s “short command,” by which he told the faithful to “love, and do what you will.” We talked about the struggle to bring love and intellect together, about the mystics and their relation to the philosophers. Tom energetically joined our discussion of how religious traditions create practices that link faith and reason and reveal the tensions between them. I didn’t need to be a believer to create space in the classroom for him and others to be fully present to learn. I did have to respect what people of faith brought to the conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat my students ultimately believe is none of my business. But they, like all other college students, need to understand what it’s like to be absorbed in robust traditions, including religious ones. They—and I—should refuse to hide behind narrow versions of critical thinking that keep them from engaging with people whose lives are energized by compassion and forgiveness. Becoming more aware of the multiplicity of traditions and practices will make all of us more curious about and more empathetic toward others’ beliefs—and more humble with respect to our own.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/t6K-Q0GuVFk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/t6K-Q0GuVFk/","published":"2019-09-01T10:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-597109"},{"title":"From Asia’s Finest to Hong Kong’s Most Hated","content":"\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eHONG KONG—Moments after a gasoline bomb arced over a police-station wall, officers began shooting rounds of rubber bullets at protesters here.

In a \u003ca href=\"https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/magazine-feature/8484019/supergoup-boygenius-interview\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eBillboard\u003c/em\u003e interview\u003c/a\u003e, Dacus traced the name to the combined frustration and envy the three women felt toward “hyper-confident” male performers too convinced of their own talent to take criticism or share the stage. While recording, she said, “we’d just tell each other, ‘Every thought is worth saying. Just be the boy genius. Act with confidence.’ That was helpful, even if it is based off of a toxic characterization.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eBaker, Bridgers, and Dacus are not the only artists to simultaneously criticize and channel the boy-genius trope. Contemporary fiction has a rich vein of women writers exploring the bravado of male artists in order to demonstrate the limits it imposes. This proves an effective way to undermine the myth of male genius; rather than condemn the trope outright, these novelists complicate it until it crumbles. The peak of the form, to my mind, is Penelope Fitzgerald’s \u003cem\u003eThe Blue Flower\u003c/em\u003e (1995), which explores the German Romantic poet Novalis’s youth with acid wit. In that book, as well as Meg Wolitzer’s \u003cem\u003eThe Wife\u003c/em\u003e (2003) and Erin Somers’s\u003cem\u003e Stay Up With Hugo Best \u003c/em\u003e(2019), male swagger quickly reveals itself to be a trap: The more airtight an artist’s confidence, the more it seems to stunt his emotional growth.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eCaitlin Horrocks’s debut novel \u003cem\u003eThe Vexations\u003c/em\u003e, a fictional dive into the early life of the French composer Erik Satie, riffs on this form. Rather than making Erik her sole protagonist, Horrocks includes his loved ones: his brother Conrad; his girlfriend, Suzanne Valadon; his friend Philippe; and his sister Louise. By writing her male virtuoso from the inside and outside, Horrocks creates a wrenching portrait of overconfidence as a destructive force.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"right\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" height=\"254\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/08/The_Vexations_Cover/676a0dd58.jpg\" width=\"164\"\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"credit\"\u003eLittle, brown and company\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eErik begins \u003cem\u003eThe Vexations\u003c/em\u003e as a boy “magnificently without shame”; in his adulthood, that shamelessness transforms into unlimited ambition. He crashes through fin de siècle Paris as a poorly mannered cabaret accompanist in worn, flamboyant velvet suits, climbing on chairs at bourgeois restaurants and challenging the director of the Paris Opera to a duel after he refuses to look at Erik’s unsolicited ballet score. This behavior (which echoes the real-life Satie’s reputation) humiliates Philippe, whom Erik drags along to the duel. Philippe becomes the first of many characters to abandon Erik, exhausted by his friend’s antagonistic approach to life.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThat antagonism stems from entitlement, which courses through \u003cem\u003eThe Vexations\u003c/em\u003e. Erik expects attention from the moment he arrives in Paris. Tellingly, Horrocks very rarely shows him working. Rather, she has him wondering irritably “why [he hasn’t] superseded himself by now.” This question may motivate artists at all stages in their careers, but in Horrocks’s hands, it becomes less productive ambition than immature demand.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eSmartly, Horrocks places Erik’s egotism in contrast to the circumscribed world of his sister Louise, whose gender, in early-20th-century France, sentences her to a small and often grief-filled life. In childhood, Louise is so dutiful that neighborhood women call her “Little Mother,” trusting her to enforce their rules. As an adult, she longs for glory, but can barely even ask for affection. The first time Erik declares to her that he will be famous, she reacts with mixed emotions. “Somebody has to be extraordinary. Why not you?” Then she thinks, “\u003cem\u003eWhy not me?\u003c/em\u003e The thought quiet as a puff of steam from a boiling pot.” This is her lone reach for ambition, and Horrocks presents it in domestic language, the image trapped at home with Louise.\u003cb\u003e \u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eLouise serves as Horrocks’s reminder that Erik’s confidence is predicated on his maleness. She also helps teach the reader to like her brother. Her affection for him is a key point of complexity in \u003cem\u003eThe Vexations\u003c/em\u003e; it springs from habit and envy and awe, emotions plenty of sisters have felt toward their older brothers. This familiarity allows Horrocks to zoom in on Erik’s inner self: Initially at his most human with Louise, as he behaves more like an artist, he forgets how to respect or care for his sister. In Erik’s faltering relationship with Louise, Horrocks shows a crucial piece of his humanity disintegrating.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eAs Erik approaches fame, his personal life collapses. The celebrated Claude Debussy arranges his work, and he collaborates with luminaries such as Serge Diaghilev and Jean Cocteau. His dreams are coming true—but he’s made himself a stunted Peter Pan, hiding his growing loneliness behind aggressive antics and a worsening drinking problem. Horrocks turns to another female character to demonstrate the severity of Erik’s loss: The first time Suzanne, the woman he’s fallen in love with, shows him real empathy, he treats her with cruelty. He has lost the capacity for connection, and with it, the capacity to be cared for.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThis leaves Erik with only music, which he recognizes belatedly is not quite enough—an awareness spurred by his struggles to collaborate with Cocteau. When his professional relationships are called into question, he wonders about the root issue: “Failure of consideration, or failure of empathy? The former makes him a hero, Artist Above All; the latter makes him something broken.” The answer to that query lies in its placement within the novel. Only art—and its public reception—spurs Erik to mull his “failure of empathy.” All he wants is to more effectively assert his musical superiority. Erik cannot stop behaving like a boy genius; he’s a grown man with a child’s impulses—and that, in Horrocks’s telling, makes him broken, no matter how beautiful and lasting his music may be.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eReading \u003cem\u003eThe Vexations\u003c/em\u003e, I often thought about its predecessor, Fitzgerald’s \u003cem\u003eThe Blue Flower\u003c/em\u003e, which offers a brighter telling of a similar story. Whereas Horrocks writes her boy genius’s life as a tragedy, Fitzgerald approaches her protagonist’s early years as comedy. Like Erik, Novalis—in the novel, referred to by his real name, Fritz von Hardenberg—is extremely attuned to his own feelings, but unaware of much else. He’s brilliant but ridiculous, and with the exception of his hero-worshipping brother Erasmus, his family doesn’t take him very seriously. In college, he blossoms into a boy genius of the first order, but the moment he returns home, his hyper-confidence becomes a running joke. Fitzgerald’s supporting characters, especially the women, handle Fritz with laughing patience. They have total faith in his intelligence, but don’t grant his overblown ideas the weight he himself accords them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eFitzgerald’s method beautifully reverses the sad trajectory on which Horrocks—working within biography—sets Satie.

A poll \u003ca href=\"https://2ks7od1dgl654aorxx98q3qu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NYU.Family-Travel-Survey-2018.pdf\"\u003econducted\u003c/a\u003e last year by the Family Travel Association and New York University found that 37 percent of adult parents in the United States with kids 17 or younger have taken their children to a family reunion. (Comparable historical data about the popularity of reunions are unavailable.) Their popularity, notably, \u003ca href=\"https://www.aarp.org/content/dam/aarp/research/surveys_statistics/general/2012/Bulletin-Poll-Family-Reunions-2012-AARP.pdf\"\u003eappears to be consistent\u003c/a\u003e across age groups—older and younger Americans are just as likely to attend family reunions, according to the AARP. The main motivation for attendance: “reconnecting with old and new family members, making new memories, and sharing family history.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat reasoning is similar to what Purdue University’s Juyeon Y. Kluin and Xinran Y. Lehto, hospitality and tourism scholars, found in a 2012 \u003ca href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160738311001563\"\u003estudy\u003c/a\u003e of 300 U.S. adults who’d attended at least one such gathering. Rarely do people explicitly partake in these events for more typical vacation purposes (such as relaxation), the researchers found. Rather, they do so to maintain and remember family history, to engage in activities as a group, and to grow closer to one's spouse and children or familiarize those children with their extended family. These people see reunions “as an effective means of creating an 'altogether atmosphere,’\" of “fostering the feeling of being close to each other,” and of experiencing “love and belonging”—a draw that the researchers suspect grows more intense the more geographically scattered families become.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAdditionally, at a time when \u003ca href=\"https://www.multivu.com/players/English/8294451-cigna-us-loneliness-survey/\"\u003enearly half of Americans\u003c/a\u003e report feeling lonely at least sometimes, the \u003ca href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1300/J194v03n01_04\"\u003emultigenerational connections\u003c/a\u003e forged by family reunions can contribute to \u003ca href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1300/J194v03n01_04\"\u003efamilial cohesion\u003c/a\u003e.

Yet, Dorsey continued, “they still decide to do it [a family reunion] again.” A family reunion is kind of like a workout: No matter how apprehensive a person feels going into it, or how beat she feels coming out, she continues to partake in the ritual because it’s so nourishing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn text messages, Roberts explained that his T-shirt design was inspired by his grandpa Maynard, who loved to tell his younger kin “stories that’d he’d populate with these specific creatures of his invention.” He’d often simulate “convincing-enough” encounters with those invented monsters during regular “nighttime haunted walks” through his “almost-pastoral backyard.” Those kids are, like Roberts, now adults. The terror Maynard once instilled in them has since evolved into nostalgia—for their gullibility, for the make-believe, and, of course, for Maynard.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“The great part is that these stories were so pervasive, the shirt connected instantly with all the aunts, uncles, and cousins equally, as we all had encountered them together and apart as long as Maynard lived to be able to tell them,” Roberts told me. “It was almost as if that side of the family had a shared zeitgeist that only existed among all of us.”    \u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/M80GdmgDpa4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/M80GdmgDpa4/","published":"2019-09-01T11:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-596362"}]},{"url":"https://feeds.feedburner.com/time/topstories?format=xml","items":[{"title":"Protesters Storm Hong Kong International Airport and Disrupt Transport Links","content":"\u003caside class=\"right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad\" id=\"right-rail__ad-5666387\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module video-2\" data-src=\"https://time.com/5666387/protest-hong-kong-international-airport-transport-disruption/\" data-widget-id=\"SB_4\" data-ob-template=\"timemag\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePro-democracy protesters blockaded Hong Kong International Airport Sunday afternoon, disrupting transportation routes and briefly storming one of the terminals a day after violent clashes with police shook the city.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral hundred black-clad demonstrators gathered outside the airport in the drizzly afternoon, chanting, \u0026#8220;fight for freedom,\u0026#8221; according to live feeds and reports from the scene.

He has supported a federal red flag law, which would allow police to take away someone’s guns if there’s some proof of a risk of violence (a “red flag”). But on other measures, from universal background checks to an assault weapons ban, Trump and Republican lawmakers have resisted, instead talking up questionable connections between violence, \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/11/9/16618472/mental-illness-gun-homicide-mass-shootings\"\u003emental illness\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/8/5/20754769/trump-video-games-mass-shooting-el-paso-toledo\"\u003eviolent media\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"WYOAHm\"\u003eDemocratic candidates, however, have taken more comprehensive stances on guns. For the most part, they’re sticking to common Democratic themes like universal background checks, an assault weapons ban (which is typically paired with a ban on high-capacity magazines), and federally funded research into gun violence. But the campaigns’ plans do include some new ideas here and there — including red flag laws, which campaigns ranging from Cory Booker’s to John Delaney’s back, and requiring a license to buy and own a gun, which Booker in particular \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/5/6/18528472/cory-booker-gun-control-licensing-plan-policy\"\u003ebrought to the presidential stage\u003c/a\u003e but others, like Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg, also support.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"logoyI\"\u003eAs \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/7/1/18683860/democrats-2020-gun-control-mass-shootings\"\u003eI’ve argued before\u003c/a\u003e, even the most ambitious of the candidates’ gun control proposals don’t go far enough to seriously dent gun violence. America \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/8/29/17792776/us-gun-deaths-global\"\u003eleads the developed world in gun violence\u003c/a\u003e, with gun death rates nearly four times that of Switzerland, five times that of Canada, 35 times that of the United Kingdom, and 53 times that of Japan. The core problem is the US simply has way too many guns and too much access to firearms, letting just about anyone obtain a weapon to carry out a mass shooting or more typical types of gun violence, whether \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/6/3/8721267/gun-suicide-gun-control\"\u003esuicides\u003c/a\u003e or homicides. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ryh3uO\"\u003eBut none of the Democratic proposals do anything to swiftly address that core problem and significantly reduce the number of guns in the US.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"sOiQ8z\"\u003eStill, the \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/10/3/9444417/gun-violence-mass-shootings-us-america\"\u003eresearch\u003c/a\u003e suggests that stricter gun laws, \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/1/9/18171909/universal-background-checks-hr-8-gun-violence-democrats\"\u003eparticularly licensing\u003c/a\u003e, would reduce gun deaths. So the Democratic proposals would make some progress, even if they wouldn’t be enough to bring down America’s rate of gun deaths to that of its developed peers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"xqFA5a\"\u003eSome proposals show a little movement\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"QBD7uI\"\u003eMost of the Democratic candidates at least mention gun violence on their campaign websites and other networks (like Medium), though just a few — Booker, Warren, Buttigieg, Andrew Yang, and Kamala Harris in particular stick out — go into a lot of detail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"bZI0dr\"\u003eThe Democratic candidates are in general agreement on at least two proposals: universal background checks and an assault weapons ban. When it comes to other issues, there’s a bit less agreement, or at least less attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"M3cuTM\"\u003eThe big common proposal is universal background checks. Under federal law, licensed gun dealers have to run a background check, looking at factors like criminal record and mental health history, to sell someone a firearm. But unlicensed sellers — think a family member, or perhaps someone over the internet or at a gun show — don’t have to run a check. Universal background checks attempt to stamp out the unlicensed sellers by requiring a background check for all or nearly all gun transactions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"dHhq9x\"\u003eAn assault weapons ban has also received more attention with the rise of extremely deadly mass shootings, as the shooters have used weapons like AR-15s and WASR-10s (a variant of an AK-47) to carry out the attacks. There are \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/4/3/17174160/assault-weapons-ar-15-ban\"\u003equestions\u003c/a\u003e about how it would be implemented and enforced, but the idea is to ban military-style semiautomatic rifles. Some Democratic candidates frame this as bringing back a previous federal assault weapons ban, which was enacted in 1994 but expired in 2004, that kept existing weapons in circulation but tried to restrict future sales. Others want to go further, mandating that gun owners actually turn in the banned weapons.\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"iOErfK\"\u003eBeyond those two proposals, candidates have also supported red flag laws, which could allow a family member, neighbor, close friend, teacher, or cop to report an “extreme risk” of violence to the courts. The court could then order the seizure of a person’s weapons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"rIEdcx\"\u003eThe candidates also favor closing loopholes in existing gun laws. That includes the \u003ca href=\"https://lawcenter.giffords.org/gun-laws/policy-areas/who-can-have-a-gun/domestic-violence-firearms/\"\u003e“boyfriend loophole,”\u003c/a\u003e which lets people get a gun even if they have a protective order against them due to a dating relationship, and the \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/3/6/18253165/background-check-bill-charleston-loophole\"\u003e“Charleston loophole,”\u003c/a\u003e which allows a small number of people to obtain a gun without completing a background check if the check takes too long. (This is how the self-described white supremacist who killed nine people at a predominantly black church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015 got his gun.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"RZt6AZ\"\u003eThere’s also a lot of support for federally funded research into gun violence, as well as the repeal of \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/10/14/9533389/bernie-sanders-gun-lawsuits-democratic-debate\"\u003especial legal protections for gun companies\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"f8AYMO\"\u003eSome candidates have moved to the left by calling for gun licensing, which would require a license to purchase and own a firearm. Typically, obtaining a license would involve a background check, but also a more extensive vetting process that can require submitting fingerprints and a photo, interviews with law enforcement, and a gun safety training course. Some would pair this proposal — as is done in, for example, \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/11/13/17658028/massachusetts-gun-control-laws-licenses\"\u003eMassachusetts\u003c/a\u003e — with mandatory registration of firearms. (This, in theory, allows police to pull up a database of weapons to seize if someone loses a license.) \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"QxTfNr\"\u003eSeveral candidates, including Booker, Warren, Buttigieg, and Yang, support gun licensing. But others, including Joe Biden and Michael Bennet, have been critical of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"OVUMqn\"\u003eOtherwise, there’s been little significant movement from the typical Democratic mantras of universal background checks and an assault weapons ban.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"rtnEU0\"\u003eEven the boldest proposals don’t go far enough\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"quEF3s\"\u003eThe Democratic proposals on guns show how stuck the debate over this issue has been for decades. In 1993 and 1994, a Democratic-controlled Congress passed federal background checks and a 10-year assault weapons ban. In the 25 years since, the debate has largely been relegated to … more background checks and an assault weapons ban.

Maybe some bills get introduced. Critics respond with concerns that the government is trying to take away their guns. The debate stalls. So even as America continues experiencing levels of gun violence unrivaled in the rest of the developed world, nothing happens — no laws are passed by Congress, nothing significant is done to try to prevent the next horror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"0ZPQ8A\"\u003eSo why is it that for all the outrage and mourning with every mass shooting, nothing seems to change? To understand that, it’s important to grasp not just the stunning statistics about gun ownership and gun violence in the United States, but America’s unique relationship with guns — unlike that of any other developed country — and how it plays out in our politics to ensure, seemingly against all odds, that our culture and laws continue to drive the routine gun violence that marks American life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"lJ4C2g\"\u003e1) America’s gun problem is completely unique\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"xT29Iy\"\u003eNo other developed country in the world has anywhere near the same rate of gun violence as America. The US has nearly six times the gun homicide rate as Canada, more than seven times as Sweden, and nearly 16 times as Germany, according to \u003ca href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/jul/22/gun-homicides-ownership-world-list\"\u003eUN data\u003c/a\u003e compiled by the Guardian.

And while this group is generally outnumbered by those who support gun control, the opponents tend to be much more passionate about the issue than the supporters — and they’re backed by a very powerful political lobby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"umKehk\"\u003e4) The gun lobby as we know it is relatively recent but enormously powerful\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ptxUnj\"\u003eThe single most powerful political organization when it comes to guns is, undoubtedly, the \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/12/16418524/us-gun-policy-nra\"\u003eNational Rifle Association\u003c/a\u003e (NRA). The NRA has an enormous stranglehold over conservative politics in America, and that development is more recent than you might think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"H6Q1iG\"\u003eThe NRA was, for much of its early history, more of a sporting club than a serious political force against gun control, and \u003ca href=\"http://www.vox.com/2015/8/27/9215501/nra-president-gun-control\"\u003eeven supported some gun restrictions\u003c/a\u003e. In 1934, NRA president Karl Frederick was quoted as \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/EvanDickson/status/636673894670184448\"\u003esaying\u003c/a\u003e, “I do not believe in the general promiscuous toting of guns. I think it should be sharply restricted and only under licenses.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Y3QJR6\"\u003eA 1977 revolt within the organization changed everything. As crime rose in the 1960s and ’70s, calls for more gun control grew as well. NRA members worried new restrictions on guns would keep coming after the historic \u003ca href=\"http://smartgunlaws.org/key-federal-acts-regulating-guns/\"\u003e1968 law\u003c/a\u003e — eventually ending, they feared, with the government’s seizure of all firearms in America. So members mobilized, installing a hard-liner known as Harlon Carter in the leadership, forever changing the NRA into the gun lobby we know today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ZPIhLy\"\u003eThis foundation story is crucial for understanding why the NRA is near-categorically opposed to the regulation of private firearms. It fears that popular and seemingly common-sense regulations, such as banning assault-style weapons or a federal database of gun purchases, are not really about saving lives but are in fact a potential first step toward ending \u003cem\u003eall\u003c/em\u003e private gun ownership in America, which the NRA views — wrongly, in the minds of some \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/12/16418524/us-gun-policy-nra\"\u003elegal experts\u003c/a\u003e — as a violation of the Second Amendment of the US Constitution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"rNMfkP\"\u003eSo any time there’s an attempt to impose new forms of gun control, the NRA rallies gun owners and other opponents of gun control to kill these bills. These gun owners make up a minority of the population: anywhere from around 30 to around 40 percent of households, depending on which survey one uses. But that population is a large and active enough constituency, particularly within the Republican base, to make many legislators fear that a poor grade from the NRA will end their careers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"FR28iI\"\u003eAs a result, conservative media and politicians \u003ca href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/01/29/nra-releases-coveted-endorsements-and-grades-for-texas-state-races/\"\u003etake\u003c/a\u003e the NRA’s support — especially the coveted A-to-F ratings the organization gives out — very seriously.

In comparison, gun control advocates are motivated by more abstract notions of reducing gun violence — although, Goss noted, the victims of mass shootings and their families have begun putting a face on these policies by engaging more actively in advocacy work, which could make the gun control movement feel more relatable. (See: \u003ca href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1516588\u0026amp;xs=1\u0026amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fnews%2Fnews-desk%2Furgency-and-frustration-the-never-again-movement-gathers-momentum\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e#NeverAgain\u003c/a\u003e.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"OZkTyX\"\u003eThere is also an exception at the state level, where lawmakers and voters have passed laws imposing (and relaxing) restrictions on guns. In the past several years, for instance, \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/12/26/18145305/gun-control-violence-parkland-effect-2018\"\u003eVermont\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://www.vox.com/2014/11/5/7157451/midterm-elections-2014-ballot-initiatives-marijuana-legalization\"\u003eWashington state\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/oregon-tightened-gun-buying-restrictions-weeks-shooting-n437096\"\u003eOregon\u003c/a\u003e passed laws expanding background checks. “There’s a lot more going on than Congress,” Goss said. “In blue states, gun laws are getting stricter. And in red states, in some cases, the gun laws are getting looser.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"u6cIPH\"\u003eBut state laws aren’t enough. Since people can cross state lines to purchase guns under laxer rules, the weaker federal standards \u003ca href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/4/13/11409894/clinton-sanders-guns-new-york\"\u003emake it easy\u003c/a\u003e for someone to simply travel to a state with looser gun laws to obtain a firearm and ship it to another state. This is such a common occurrence that the gun shipment route from the South, where gun laws are fairly loose, to New York, where gun laws are strict, has earned the name \u003ca href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/11/12/us/gun-traffickers-smuggling-state-gun-laws.html\"\u003e“the Iron Pipeline.”\u003c/a\u003e But it also happens all across the country, from New York to Chicago to California. Only a federal law could address this issue — by setting a floor on how loose gun laws can be in every state. And until such a federal law is passed, there will always be a massive loophole to any state gun control law.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"hfl7Ti\"\u003eYet the NRA’s influence and its army of supporters push many of America’s legislators, particularly at the federal level and red states, away from gun control measures — even though some countries that passed these policies have seen a lot of success with them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"qTpC0w\"\u003e5) Other developed countries have had huge successes with gun control\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"6dWWxU\"\u003eIn 1996, a 28-year-old man armed with a semiautomatic rifle \u003ca href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/port-arthur-massacre-shooting-spree-changed-australia-gun-laws-n396476\"\u003ewent on a rampage in Port Arthur, Australia\u003c/a\u003e, killing 35 people and wounding 23 more.

The Australian government confiscated 650,000 of these guns through a mandatory gun buyback program, in which it purchased the firearms from gun owners. It established a registry of all guns owned in the country and required a permit for all new firearm purchases. (This is much further than bills typically proposed in the US, which almost never make a serious attempt to \u003cem\u003eimmediately\u003c/em\u003e reduce the number of guns in the country.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"fbTY4h\"\u003eThe result: Australia’s firearm homicide rate dropped by about 42 percent in the seven years after the law passed, and its firearm suicide rate fell by 57 percent, according to one \u003ca href=\"https://cdn1.sph.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/1264/2012/10/bulletins_australia_spring_2011.pdf\"\u003ereview of the evidence\u003c/a\u003e by Harvard researchers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"U9aMPf\"\u003eIt’s difficult to know for sure how much of the drop in homicides and suicides was caused specifically by the gun buyback program and other legal changes.

Marvel can’t just surrender a character that it’s primed for the spotlight, can it? Sony wouldn’t just abandon the blockbuster Marvel Cinematic Universe right after it bumped July’s \u003cem\u003eSpider-Man: Far From Home \u003c/em\u003einto becoming Sony’s biggest-ever movie worldwide, right? \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"nKOMyV\"\u003eBut according to Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige, Spider-Man and the Marvel Cinematic Universe are done.

As much as we loved Tobey Maguire and Sam Raimi’s Spider-Man movies of the early aughts (well, two-thirds of them), Sony’s middling \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/2/10/8010235/spider-man-sony-marvel-movie-rights\"\u003epre-Tom Holland reboots starring Andrew Garfield\u003c/a\u003e as the webslinger didn’t garner much faith or box office loyalty from fans. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"N3ArKH\"\u003eAnd Garfield’s first starring turn hit theaters not long after \u003cem\u003eThe Avengers, \u003c/em\u003ewhich showed that Marvel had something great on its hands — superhero cinema had turned a corner and entered a far more impressive era.

But this is firmly the never-before-seen story of Miles, whose background differs heavily from Peter’s. That includes his alternate rogues gallery; the movie also features Kingpin, a second or even third-tier Spidey villain compared to the likes of Thanos or Ultron. And his love interest of sorts is not MJ, but the female hero Spider-Gwen, whom  \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/6/24/8839485/spider-man-black-gay\"\u003estudios may have thought too esoteric\u003c/a\u003e or too female for her own solo movie, despite being beloved by comics readers. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"dZPptN\"\u003eDespite notions that characters would be too weird or too nice or too female, and that the only Spider-Man that people care about is Peter Parker,\u003cem\u003e Into the Spider-Verse \u003c/em\u003esucceeded. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"cSvyUu\"\u003eYes, it helps that it had the backing of celebrity voices like Nicolas Cage or John Mulaney, as well as the production power of \u003cem\u003eThe Lego Movie\u003c/em\u003e’s Phil Lord and Chris Miller.

I mean it as a compliment. I love \u003cem\u003eGood Eats\u003c/em\u003e. I loved it in its first 14 seasons (which ran from 1999 to 2012). I loved its handful of specials. I even loved its \u003cem\u003eReloaded \u003c/em\u003eversion, which updated the original with scenes and bits featuring newer information and cooking techniques. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"snsjCx\"\u003eWith that said, if you’re going to enjoy this show, you’re going to have to contend with the fact that Brown himself is one of TV’s nerdiest nerds. Again, I mean this as a compliment, but your mileage may vary. You might feel a deep secondhand embarrassment over his refusal to “just” do a cooking show; instead, he uses an episode about the origins of chicken parmesan as an opportunity to indulge in fancy camera tricks and stage parodies of movie scenes where a nervous, normally straitlaced person goes to some back alley to pick up contraband merchandise. You might even find him actively annoying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"xXk45Z\"\u003eBut you know what?

The new series is no exception.\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"6gXTPD\"\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"\u003e\u003ciframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5kg6regArFY?rel=0\" style=\"border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"encrypted-media; accelerometer; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"CAPOBd\"\u003eThe first moment in \u003cem\u003eGood Eats: The Return\u003c/em\u003e — what Food Network is calling the show’s 15th season — that reminded me of how much I enjoy this show at its best came when Brown wandered around a New York City alleyway while talking about the Italian immigrant experience in late 19th century and early 20th century America. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"j7tj3e\"\u003eSure, it was a fun way to teach the audience a bit about how Italian cooking mutated and changed after it hopped across the Atlantic and landed in New York, where chicken was plentiful and the eggplant that used to provide the foundation of [x] parmesan was not. But it was also a stealthily excellent “oner” — a.k.a., a scene filmed in only one shot. Brown walks around the alley, telling the story of the Italian immigrant experience, and because the whole thing is captured in a single take, the story becomes more mesmerizing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"qK1pBd\"\u003eThat’s how \u003cem\u003eGood Eats\u003c/em\u003e approaches all of its knowledge drops. It has always been as much of a science show as a food show, and Brown is fond of explaining why, say, chia seeds bond together if you pour a little water on them, which makes them a great basis for pudding. (He delivers this information in \u003cem\u003eThe Return\u003c/em\u003e’s second episode, all about the ancient grains quinoa and chia.) If the series can take a moment to illustrate something scientific or historical in a cheeky and fun way, it’ll always do its best.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"kfwB3l\"\u003eSometimes, these moments are almost \u003cem\u003etoo\u003c/em\u003e silly for me. The aforementioned riff on Brown going to a dark garage somewhere to buy some San Marzano tomatoes (the \u003cem\u003eonly\u003c/em\u003e tomatoes worth using in a red sauce, Brown suggests) eventually devolves into various people in the scene ripping mustaches off of each other’s faces, like a lesser Monty Python bit. But at the same time, I can’t deny that I learned a lot about San Marzano tomatoes, how to spot them in the store, and what makes them so special for Italian cooking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"oIFb3f\"\u003eAnd even in the moments that don’t work as well, \u003cem\u003eGood Eats\u003c/em\u003e’ visual verve is enough to carry the day. It’s rare for a series in the rough genre of “instructional cooking show” to put as much thought into its filmmaking as this one does. Even if several of its innovations (like filming Brown from inside a refrigerator or cupboard as he rummages around for ingredients) no longer feel as fresh as they did when \u003cem\u003eGood Eats\u003c/em\u003e debuted 20 years ago, it’s still striking how few other cooking shows have followed \u003cem\u003eGood Eats\u003c/em\u003e’ lead and tried to come up with a visual grammar to accompany all that delicious food.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"lbIAwr\"\u003eThink about it: How many cooking shows are staged so the host stands behind their counter as they look to camera while preparing a dish in a medium shot? The camera might occasionally cut in for an insert shot to showcase a particularly complicated bit of knifework. But then it will go right back to the medium shot. The formula works if the host is particularly fun to watch (as with \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/6/7/18639332/girl-meets-farm-molly-yeh\"\u003eMolly Yeh of my beloved \u003cem\u003eGirl Meets Farm\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e), but woe to you if the host \u003cem\u003eisn’t\u003c/em\u003e a fascinating figure in their own right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"yBs0tx\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eGood Eats\u003c/em\u003e has never had this problem. Brown exudes nerdy charm, but even in routine insert shots, he\u003cem\u003e \u003c/em\u003ehas thought about how to make the show fun to watch. In \u003cem\u003eThe Return\u003c/em\u003e, for example, a mirror slides down into the frame every so often, to reflect Brown’s face while his hands are performing one intricate task or another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"BYtNPO\"\u003eThat would almost be enough of a reason to celebrate the return of \u003cem\u003eGood Eats\u003c/em\u003e while also bemoaning how many sorry, boring food shows are out there. But then I realized that Brown’s legacy \u003cem\u003edoes\u003c/em\u003e live on — just not on television proper. And with \u003cem\u003eThe Return\u003c/em\u003e, he’s learned just a little bit from his assorted copycats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"eDTcj0\"\u003eThe true heirs to the \u003cem\u003eGood Eats\u003c/em\u003e throne are all on YouTube\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"IqOE0D\"\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"\u003e\u003ciframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ABtt5y-maO4?rel=0\" style=\"border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"encrypted-media; accelerometer; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"yZfN3Y\"\u003eIn \u003cem\u003eGood Eats: The Return\u003c/em\u003e, those insert shots I mentioned where Brown’s face will sometimes appear via mirror are filmed from an overhead position, just slightly at an angle — almost meant to mimic what it’s like to look down at your own counter as you debone and fillet a chicken breast. And it took me a second to realize that Brown’s mirror setup is almost a direct lift from perhaps the foremost innovation in food cinematography of the last 10 years: the overhead shot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"PAcOuN\"\u003eObviously, there’s nothing particularly original about an overhead shot. But after starting with \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJFp8uSYCjXOMnkUyb3CQ3Q\"\u003eBuzzFeed’s Tasty channel\u003c/a\u003e on YouTube and then spreading to, well, seemingly everywhere else on the internet, the overhead shot has become \u003cem\u003ethe \u003c/em\u003eway to quickly and cleanly document a recipe being prepared. Rather than seeing the person who’s cooking, we often see just their hands; rather than hearing their voice, we see onscreen text detailing the recipe steps while peppy music plays. These videos distill a recipe to its absolute essence — ingredients and instructions — without even the distraction of a host.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Xq7nvS\"\u003eThe trend seems to have changed how \u003cem\u003eGood Eats: The Return\u003c/em\u003e is presented, despite arguably having evolved from the show’s original run (which presented somewhat similar first-person views of particular steps in a recipe). So there’s a bit of cross-platform influence going on. But realizing as much made me think about how so much of what’s innovative in food TV right now isn’t happening on TV but on YouTube.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"YAARzU\"\u003eThink of \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJHA_jMfCvEnv-3kRjTCQXw\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eBinging with Babish\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, a more conventionally presented YouTube food show, in that the host is always on camera. But we don’t see the host’s face, because the focus is on how the recipe is being prepared, not on the person preparing it. (On \u003cem\u003eBinging with Babish\u003c/em\u003e, said person’s name is Andrew Rea — who, it must be said, has some big Alton Brown dorky energy.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Cd5I3j\"\u003eOr consider just how many YouTube cooking videos essentially fast-forward through the more time-consuming steps of a recipe by speeding up the footage of a cake baking in an oven or somebody stirring a batter. That’s not so very far from \u003cem\u003eGood Eats\u003c/em\u003e’ use of a clock hand traveling around the screen, wiping from one shot to another to indicate the passage of time without actually having to show it (an especially useful trick in a medium where every little moment has to be accounted for to hit an exact episode length).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"0UjbXH\"\u003eYes, it’s wonderful to have \u003cem\u003eGood Eats\u003c/em\u003e back. But it’s just as wonderful to notice the ways in which it ushered in a new era of food filmmaking, and then learned from its own offspring. I’m heartened by the thought that if Alton Brown is a great, occasionally embarrassing TV dad, he has a whole brood of culinary children running around on the internet, making their own names. It was sad when the original \u003cem\u003eGood Eats \u003c/em\u003ewent away, but its return has now revealed that it never \u003cem\u003ereally\u003c/em\u003e left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"sXMv2b\"\u003eGood Eats \u003cem\u003eairs Sundays at 10 pm Eastern \u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.foodnetwork.com/shows/good-eats\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eon Food Network\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e, and there is, at present, no good way to stream it, though the first episode of season 15 is currently available \u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kg6regArFY\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eon YouTube\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e. \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","url":"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/9/1/20837373/good-eats-the-return-alton-brown-review-recap-food-network","published":"2019-09-01T17:30:00Z","guid":"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/9/1/20837373/good-eats-the-return-alton-brown-review-recap-food-network"},{"title":"Trump says a mysterious “big package” of bipartisan legislation is on the way to stop mass shootings","content":"\u003cimg alt=\"Donald Trump gestures while wearing a blue hat reading “USA” and “45.”\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KmNBHklckcGFOg1zUbP8HVW6mF8=/0x0:4949x3712/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/65153531/GettyImages_1165474390.0.jpg\" /\u003e\n\n  \u003csmall\u003eTrump speaks to reporters at the White House following a mass shooting in Odessa, Texas. | Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images\u003c/small\u003e\n\n  \u003cp\u003eIt isn’t clear what the legislation is, or if it actually exists. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp id=\"MJXuSI\"\u003eAfter back-to-back mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, in early August, President Donald Trump said he would consider “meaningful background checks.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"fFRptT\"\u003eHe changed his mind shortly after, and following another mass shooting in Texas that \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/8/31/20842667/odessa-midland-texas-shooting-what-we-know\"\u003ekilled at least seven and injured at least 21\u003c/a\u003e, he told reporters at the White House Sunday that he is still against expanding background checks. Instead, he said he’d like to consider “different things.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"QcOzf8\"\u003e“We’re looking at a lot of different things. We’re looking at a lot of different bills, ideas, concepts,” he said. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"hwXDVQ\"\u003eThe president also cast background checks as being limited in their effectiveness: “For the most part, as strong as you make your background checks, they would not have stopped any of it,” Trump said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"01RBSg\"\u003eAnd he promised that he is working with lawmakers on a bipartisan basis to pass a “package” of legislative responses to mass shootings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"6ewtUv\"\u003e“We’re in the process of dealing with Democrats, Republicans. They’ve been working very hard on it, they’re coming back very soon,” the president said. “There’s a big package of things that’s going to be put before [Congress], by a lot of different people. We have a lot of groups working on it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"grR0Kb\"\u003eWhat package the president spoke of — and whether it actually exists — is not clear. Congress does have a \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/2/27/18224727/house-universal-background-checks-gun-violence-congress\"\u003egun reform bill that has passed the house\u003c/a\u003e, H.R. 8, that would expand background checks on gun purchases. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has refused to take up the bill in the upper chamber, and given that it deals with background checks — something Trump has made clear he is against expanding — it seems likely the president would veto the measure even if it passed the Senate. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"cYBsM5\"\u003eIn speaking with the press, Trump cast his ambiguous “big package of things” as having been working its way through Congress for some time. He said work on it began before news of the latest violence in Texas, when a man \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/8/31/20842667/odessa-midland-texas-shooting-what-we-know\"\u003ewent on a shooting rampage\u003c/a\u003e following a traffic stop. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"o13dVq\"\u003e“This really hasn’t changed anything,” Trump said. “We’re doing a package. And we’ll see how it comes about. It’s coming about right now. A lot of people are talking about it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"7NdJ8b\"\u003ePraising West Texas law enforcement and Gov. Greg Abbott (R-TX), Trump also called the shooter “a very sick person” and described gun violence as “a mental problem.” Research has suggested that those with \u003ca href=\"https://www.nami.org/learn-more/mental-health-public-policy/violence-and-gun-reporting-laws\"\u003emental illness are more likely to be victims of gun violence than they are mass shooters\u003c/a\u003e. This, however, has not stopped Trump from referred to mental illness the root cause of mass shootings, something he also did following the Dayton and El Paso shootings. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"7XexlB\"\u003eLittle legislative action has been taken following other mass shootings; however, the Trump administration has pushed limited gun reform before. Following a mass shooting in Las Vegas, \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/12/18/18146455/trump-bump-stock-ban-gun-violence\"\u003eTrump banned bump stocks\u003c/a\u003e, which allow semiautomatic weapons to function like machine guns. While it remains opaque what legislation the president was promoting Sunday, he could help to expand background checks by endorsing them, as he did with the bump stock ban.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"16Jxz4\"\u003eAnd polls suggest he could do so without alienating too much of his base: the \u003ca href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/08/10/749792493/americans-largely-support-gun-restrictions-to-do-something-about-gun-violence\"\u003emajority of Americans\u003c/a\u003e support universal background checks on all gun purchases, including those between individuals and at gun shows and online.

At the time \u003cem\u003eThe Dark Crystal\u003c/em\u003e film takes place, the Skeksis have used up all the natural resources of the planet of Thra, represented by the once-healing giant crystal at its center.

As \u003cem\u003eDark Crystal\u003c/em\u003e fans know well, the Chamberlain often plays the fool to get what he wants, until he reveals his truest nature: crafty, ruthless, and manipulative. Here, Pegg and puppeteer Warrick Brownlow-Pike unite for a performance so committed and perfect that I came away feeling as though this, surely, was the role of Pegg’s dreams. He nails the Chamberlain’s \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpIoPQHYhrw\"\u003ewell-known vocal mannerisms\u003c/a\u003e and plays every scene with a mix of cackling glee and clear-sighted shrewdness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"lKUitD\"\u003eThe Chamberlain serves as a mouthpiece for several of the series’ biggest ideas, like the creatures’ tendency to debase each other when their own status is threatened. In one key scene, the Chamberlain captures Rian, one of our heroes, and holds him for a chat. Rian is a Gelfling, so you might expect the Chamberlain to be ruthless to him. But the Chamberlain intriguingly treats Rian both as an equal, a fellow persuasive strategist, and as a pawn, a mere resource who could be turned into compost for Skeksis at any moment. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"MPpuqs\"\u003eThe Chamberlain reconciles this contradiction as a natural, primitive survival instinct, but he’s also open about manipulating the other Skeksis’ primitive greed to get what he wants most: more power. He’s also blunt about viewing Gelfling as inferior: “Gelfing want to be ruled,” he tells Rian matter-of-factly, so why shouldn’t the Skeksis rule them? The Chamberlain’s logic isn’t just that the Skeksis are entitled to whatever they want; it’s that the Gelflings are somehow inherently subservient to them. It’s a chilling, straightforward supremacy, made all the more scary because it’s accompanied by the Chamberlain’s sophisticated politics. He’s completely capable of treating Rian as an equal, and acting as if all the normal societal conventions are in play, until it’s no longer expedient to mask his true, murderous intent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"aFDndE\"\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAge of Resistance\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e’s chief narrative is one of complicity, complacency, and the mix of trust and lies that fuel both. \u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"uRrdNl\"\u003eThe other thing the Chamberlain manipulates, with terrifying finesse, is the truth. He clearly sees reality as malleable depending on what narrative best suits his purpose; and he’s frequently proven correct. For instance, when the Chamberlain bluntly tells him he needs Rian to “lie about Skeksis” to the other Gelfling, Rian is tempted; the Chamberlain spins him a narrative in which he spins a narrative of his own in order to save lives — and it almost works. At several other moments, the Skeksis allow the Gelflings, who still consider them to be just, wise, and gracious stewards, to spread Skeksis-friendly narratives on their behalf, while demonizing anyone who speaks against them. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"B6tPAC\"\u003eThis social conditioning is one of \u003cem\u003eAge of Resistance\u003c/em\u003e’s most searing themes. Characters frequently refuse to accept or even hear facts that challenge the dominant view that things are fine and the Skeksis are benevolent rulers who know what’s best for society. They dismiss, ignore, or become outraged by reports that contradict this worldview, sometimes from fear, sometimes from malice, and sometimes over personal reasons. Again and again, the Gelfling, despite all their education, cultivation, and sophistication, are shown as completely unwilling to hear truths that threaten to throw their comfortable existence into upheaval. They’re frequently depicted as being reverently loyal to the Skeksis, and those among them who view the Skeksis clearly are often dismissed and branded as troublemakers. In this respect, the Chamberlain is right: the Gelfling \u003cem\u003edo\u003c/em\u003e want to be ruled — at least, they want to be able to trust and put their faith in the leaders of the land. Who doesn’t? \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"exskOw\"\u003eNone of this would work if the Skeksis weren’t, on some level, engaging and appealing. They’re often sophisticated and welcoming, masking their ruthlessness beneath grand shows of generosity. Indeed, what’s often terrific about these characters is the ease with which the banal and the horrifying resides within them. These are creatures who preen over the latest fashion, worry about their looks, and laugh endlessly at their own hilarity. They’re endlessly ravenous, but rather than openly consuming everything in sight, they manipulate Thra’s customs and social norms to remain in their subjects’ good graces until their true evil can no longer be denied. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"tXRCKO\"\u003eAnd this is usually funny and whimsical until it isn’t. In one scene, a pair of Skeksis horrify a Gelfling queen by \u003cem\u003eeating\u003c/em\u003e a portion of her clan’s sacred ritual bulbs, but rather than complain she remains civil; shortly afterwards, they drop all pretense and seize her power, in the same room where the ritual bulbs dangle overhead. The Skeksis know that civility is always a veneer that can fall away the moment status and survival are threatened. And their willingness to consciously use that veneer to mask their depravity make them scarier, and more fascinating, than ever.\u003c/p\u003e","url":"https://www.vox.com/2019/9/1/20838991/skeksis-are-the-best-part-of-the-dark-crystal-age-of-resistance","published":"2019-09-01T20:03:04Z","guid":"https://www.vox.com/2019/9/1/20838991/skeksis-are-the-best-part-of-the-dark-crystal-age-of-resistance"}]},{"url":"https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml","items":[{"title":"Texas

But many of the people who actually make the games feel exploited in several ways. Mass layoffs are common and employees are worked to the point of exhaustion during what’s known as “crunch” periods in the lead-up to a new release. That’s when work weeks can stretch to 80 hours or more. (A Rockstar Games co-founder recently \u003ca href=\"https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2018-10-18-rockstar-allows-employees-to-speak-out-on-100-hour-week-controversy\"\u003ebragged that employees worked 100-hour weeks\u003c/a\u003e in the crunch before \u003cem\u003eRed Dead Redemption 2\u003c/em\u003e hit the market.)

It may feel like a young sector, but gaming has had about four decades to develop practices that would better serve workers and their families.

Graeme Kirkpatrick, a UK-based scholar who studies video games, argues that “people who work in the games industry are, invariably, invested in gaming as a cultural practice,” the \u003ca href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/153892/riot-game-workers-union\"\u003eNew Republic reports\u003c/a\u003e, meaning this isn’t about “work,” it’s about passion.

In response, YouTube changed its advertising rules, to give brands more control over where their ads appeared. This, in turn, drew protests from YouTube video creators, who were losing revenue. A German vlogger formed the YouTube union in 2018, in hopes of avoiding such sudden upheavals on the platform. The union, which now has more than 23,000 members, received an invitation to YouTube\u0026#8217;s offices in Germany, although the company recently told The Verge it \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/26/20833315/youtube-union-youtubers-negotiate-germany-meeting\"\u003ewill not negotiate with the vloggers\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe key demands: \u003c/strong\u003eThe union\u0026#8217;s primary \u003ca href=\"https://fairtube.info/en/\"\u003edemand\u003c/a\u003e is for more transparency in YouTube\u0026#8217;s decision-making. They want the company to publish the criteria that affect monetization and video views, as well as clear explanations for individual decisions punishing creators (which parts of a violating video exactly violated YouTube\u0026#8217;s rules, for example). They want a qualified human to explain these individual decisions, not a vague message from a bot. And when there is a dispute, it should be resolved through an independent mediator. YouTubers also demand that their voice be represented in an advisory board of sorts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy it matters: \u003c/strong\u003eThis year, the YouTubers joined forces with \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/7/30/20747122/youtube-union-fairtube-ig-metall-instagram\"\u003eEurope\u0026#8217;s largest trade union\u003c/a\u003e, giving them significant leverage.

Each episode is available on Netflix three days after it first airs in the UK. (There have been \u003ca href=\"https://qz.com/quartzy/1451242/netflix-adds-two-newish-season-of-the-great-british-baking-show/\"\u003e10 seasons of the show\u003c/a\u003e in the UK, where it\u0026#8217;s called \u003cem\u003eThe Great British Bake Off\u003c/em\u003e, whereas the US is just now getting its seventh.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe weekly release is a surprising choice for Netflix, which more or less \u003ca href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-netflix-invented-binge-watching-2016-6\"\u003ecreated binge-watching\u003c/a\u003e. It\u0026#8217;s great news for GBBS fans, though. The show is far better savored over several months than gobbled down in one or two all-you-can-eat buffets of pastries, tortes, and tennis cakes.

With only 10 or so new episodes a year (give or take a \u003ca href=\"https://qz.com/quartzy/1484008/the-great-british-baking-show-holiday-special-on-netflix-is-wonderful/\"\u003eholiday special or two\u003c/a\u003e), you have to dole them out to yourself carefully to prolong the enjoyment. When an entire collection drops at once, and the next episode automatically starts playing no sooner than the week\u0026#8217;s star baker is revealed, it\u0026#8217;s next to impossible to watch just one at a time.

Many, like Poshmark and eBay, work on a bidding system, and it\u0026#8217;s often possible to pay only what you want (within reason) for an item, with a little luck and patience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Quartz editor \u003ca href=\"https://qz.com/quartzy/1503003/giving-up-fast-fashion-for-a-year-taught-me-how-to-shop-again/\"\u003eJackie Bischof gave up buying new clothes\u003c/a\u003e for a year, she embraced clothing swaps as a way to re-up her closet without spending a dime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor the most part, the shopping ban came as a relief. Participating in clothing swaps gave me permission to try new things without the guilt or financial dent of something not working out. At a clothing swap in May, for example, I picked up several items that I thought suited me, only to reconsider when I tried them on at home. I’ve kept a Banana Republic coat, Nine West sandals, and an H\u0026amp;M sweater in heavy rotation; the other items I recycled at another swap, guilt-free.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwaps are more than just an exchange of clothing, though. They can also build community. The school my children are starting at next week holds an annual clothing swap at the start of every school year. To my mind, it not only recognizes the fact that kids either stain, rip, or grow out of most everything we put on them with shocking regularity, it feels like a pragmatic gesture of welcome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eYou have more than you think\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor most adults, new clothing is not strictly necessary. Other items like shampoo, pens, and dish soap do actually run out. When the novelist Ann Patchett took a year off from shopping she determined a set of rules for herself (she could buy books and anything in the grocery store, but no clothing or furniture), one of which was that she had to use up things she had before buying new ones. She wrote about how much stuff she \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/15/opinion/sunday/shopping-consumerism.html?module=inline\"\u003ediscovered that she had unwittingly stockpiled\u003c/a\u003e:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"\u003eMy first few months of no shopping were full of gleeful discoveries. I ran out of lip balm early on and before making a decision about whether lip balm constituted a need, I looked in my desk drawers and coat pockets. I found five lip balms. Once I started digging around under the bathroom sink I realized I could probably run this experiment for three more years before using up all the lotion, soap and dental floss. It turns out I hadn’t thrown away the hair products and face creams I’d bought over the years and didn’t like; I’d just tossed them all under the sink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"\u003eI’m using them now, and they’re fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLikewise, before I buy new containers to store toys, blankets, or sweaters, or anything at all new, I \u003ca href=\"https://qz.com/quartzy/1509230/the-money-saving-storage-solution-hiding-in-your-closet/\"\u003eshop from my house\u003c/a\u003e first, digging through kitchen drawers for pens and notepads (so many!), and pulling folded storage bins and baskets from the back of the closet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat you have already is good\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026#8217;s one Marie Kondo.

First sparked when civilians rejected a proposed extradition bill, the unrest has since gathered momentum and accumulated more demands for an independent democratic government.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHistorically, pop culture has figured prominently in Hong Kong’s protest culture.

In the past, Wong and his peers have employed American pop culture trends to contextualize their own struggles, such as when a government bill moved to make China’s anthem—and an adequate show of respect for the anthem—mandatory in Hong Kong public institutions like schools. Wong and his colleague Jeffrey Ngo pointed out how preposterous it would have been to \u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/theworldpost/wp/2019/01/14/hong-kong/\"\u003earrest or jail NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick\u003c/a\u003e when he took a knee during the US national anthem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMartial arts and action mogul Bruce Lee \u003ca href=\"https://qz.com/emails/quartz-obsession/1688303/\"\u003ehas also provided fodder\u003c/a\u003e—and a motto—to protesting Hong Kongers, who have taken up the late movie star\u0026#8217;s famous philosophy to “\u003ca href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3015627/be-water-my-friend-protesters-take-bruce-lees-wise-saying\"\u003ebe water\u003c/a\u003e.” Hong Kongers adamantly position their demonstrations as a leaderless movement, and the adage has been fitting in the oft impromptu protests as they gather in different locations around the city, involve people across social and professional sectors, and have rather nimbly adapted and responded to authorities and crackdowns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEngaging with pop culture has also helped bring major brands (and their global audiences) into the fray, as when Chinese-American actress Liu Yifei \u003ca href=\"https://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2019/08/mulan-star-liu-yifei-support-hong-kong-police-boycott\"\u003etweeted out her support\u003c/a\u003e for Hong Kong police.

Pop culture and entertainment is a language that transcends geography, and is highly relevant to global markets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis may also help remedy the common phenomenon of protest fatigue, where all too often we see protests, civil unrest, and all manner of humanitarian tragedies drop off news headlines once they go on for a sustained period of time. It’s sad but true that while deadly civilian protests rage on in Sudan, and Brazil’s Amazon forests continue to burn, the media has largely run out of new things to say about them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn \u003cem\u003eMockingjay\u003c/em\u003e, the final installment of the \u003cem\u003eHunger Games\u003c/em\u003e series, from which the “If we burn, you burn with us” decree comes, the tyranny of the capital is vanquished—eventually, over the course of many battles, and at tremendous cost.

Unexpected news about your finances or career may also reach you at this time. It’s a great day to discuss plans, commitments, and value as Venus in Virgo connects with Saturn in Capricorn. A new cycle in acquiring your desired wealth and security arrives as the sun meets Mars in Virgo on September 2.

Do your best to keep things light, little lion. Avoid conversations or commitments concerning money, and try to fill your day with music, poetry, and spiritual pursuits. If someone is trying too hard to sell you something, or you suspect someone may be manipulating you, do your best to end the conversation without slipping into paranoia.

Big conversations take place, and while there may be some exaggeration, you’re excited and optimistic about the way things are going, especially financially. You have support at work and people believe in your leadership—you may even be part of the VIP or “in crowd” treated to perks.

However, a feeling of being invisible or undervalued arrives when the sun opposes Neptune on September 10. This is also a tricky time for your finances—don’t buy or invest in something out of insecurity, and reflect on your boundaries and emotions concerning money. It might be hard to draw the line between what’s yours and what’s someone else’s right now—not just financially, but energetically, too. It’s OK to put off decision making right now and ask for more time to consider.

Hazy, dreamy Neptune clouds your view this month as it opposes a slew of planets in Virgo. Virgo is all about the details, but Neptune is about fantasy, illusion, and worst of all, delusion. It’s important that you find ways to stay grounded, avoid paranoia, and do your best not to force conversations or decisions. Make the best of Neptune’s influence by immersing yourself in art, music, spirituality, and the lighter aspects of romance.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBefore we get lost in Neptune’s fog, some lovely planetary connections are made: Communication planet Mercury in Virgo makes a harmonious connection with brilliant Uranus in Taurus on the first of the month, and you’re receiving exciting news and running into unexpected or even eccentric people.

Productive energy continues to flow as Mercury, Mars, and the sun all meet in Virgo on September 3: A new cycle begins in your communications, but confusion descends and you’re not sure of what you want to ask for as Venus opposes Neptune in Pisces on September 4. The mood is sensitive, so be mindful of miscommunication; it won’t be easy to figure out the true value of something at this time, so save negotiations for another day. Don’t listen to all the gossip you hear and avoid indulging in jealousy or paranoia. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWe’re all getting back in touch with reality as Mercury connects with serious Saturn on September 5, giving us more focus—but watch out for exaggerations on September 6 as Mercury clashes with Jupiter.

You’re showing up for intense conversations about fear, limitations, and boundaries, and you reach new intimacy and undergo an amazing transformation as a result. Solid communication takes place on September 6, when the sun connects with Saturn, and it’s a deeply powerful day for expressing your needs as Venus connects with Pluto in Capricorn.

Fortunately, Mercury also connects with Pluto on this day, helping you and your partners find out what’s really going on behind the scenes.

Mars clashes with Jupiter on September 10—don’t act out or pick fights as a way to feel “real” or validated. Let yourself rest—especially from mental activity—as the sun opposes Neptune and action planet Mars clashes with lucky Jupiter.

You’re releasing the past, and it’s a great time to toss out or donate things you no longer need. Also on this day, Venus clashes with Jupiter in Sagittarius, bringing a burst of good luck and fun opportunities to spend time with people who inspire and delight you—just be careful not to over-indulge! A productive energy flows on September 3, as Mercury, Mars, and the sun meet in Virgo, inspiring you to reorganize something at home or begin an important conversation concerning security, privacy, or boundaries.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cul\u003e \u003cli\u003e There’s a reason Marie Kondo has her own Netflix show now. \u003ca href=\"https://fave.co/2zHoKoY\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRead the book that started it all\u003c/a\u003e to help you declutter your life and space.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e Use a \u003ca href=\"https://fave.co/32sg1Uf\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ebeautiful storage basket\u003c/a\u003e to help keep your bedroom or living room tidy.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e Wear a \u003ca href=\"https://fave.co/2HEhVsC\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eturquoise bracelet\u003c/a\u003e to help you approach conversations about more difficult subjects with ease.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e \u003cp\u003eVenus opposes Neptune in Pisces on September 4, and you find yourself feeling confused about where you fit in.

It’s very important that you find ways to stay grounded and curb your paranoia at this time. If you hold off on decision making and suspend your desire for fast results, this could prove to be an amazingly creative time for you, Gemini. On September 5, your ruler Mercury connects with Saturn, inspiring you to communicate your limits and boundaries, supporting you if you need to deliver any bad news or end a situation, and helping you stay grounded. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cul\u003e \u003cli\u003e They’re not always easy to set, but here’s why \u003ca href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/xwb794/lets-talk-boundaries?utm_source=astroguideapp\u0026utm_campaign=monthly\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ecommunicating where your boundaries are\u003c/a\u003e is important to your well-being.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e Wearing this \u003ca href=\"https://fave.co/32eICMk\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehematite pendant\u003c/a\u003e could help ground you during this time.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e \u003cp\u003eCommunication in your relationships gets a boost when Mercury clashes with Jupiter on September 6, just watch out for exaggerations!

A productive and stabilizing energy flows in your personal life on September 9, when warrior planet Mars connects with the planet of rules and commitments, Saturn. But things get hazy again on September 10 as the sun opposes Neptune—you’re feeling lost and unsure what direction you want to head. There are so many options ahead of you, and you don’t know which is the right one. It’s not the time for decision making, Gemini—take things slow. Be especially mindful of the ways you spend your energy on September 12, and don’t pick any fights as they’re likely to be blown out of proportion as Mars clashes with Jupiter—the last thing you need this month is another energy suck! \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYou might be wondering if Neptune has robbed you of having a good month, but I’m happy to report that you will have fun!

An important culmination in your career is taking place, but you have to watch out for sleazy, lazy, lying, or sneaky people. This is not the time to make commitments. Full moons are emotional, so instead of making critical decisions right now, challenge yourself to feel your feelings. A wonderful change in energy arrives during this full moon as Mercury and Venus enter fellow air sign Libra, bringing fun, romance, and creative inspiration your way. Saturn ends its retrograde on September 18, and you reach a turning point in your inner work and finances.

Think back to January 13 and June 16, the last time these planets faced off, since similar issues resurface for you to work with. Jupiter and Neptune are both very spiritual planets. Neptune is the eternal idealist; Jupiter, the optimist. They see the potential in everything, but things don’t always reach their full potential, and as these planets clash, you may find yourself let down by your career path or relationships.

Just watch out for rejection on September 25, when Venus clashes with Saturn—don’t ask for a favor or plan a romantic outing at this time!

And get everything in writing at work so you can refer to an agreed-upon list of tasks and expectations when things feel unclear. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cul\u003e \u003cli\u003e Use this \u003ca href=\"https://fave.co/2HCvDwf\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ecolorful notepad\u003c/a\u003e to keep track of your weekly tasks.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e Digital calendars are great, but there’s nothing quite like looking at—and writing on—a beautifully drawn calendar.

Mercury rules the mind and communication, and Uranus is the planet of genius, so it bodes well when the planets work together—you’ll be in for plenty of eureka moments! This is a fantastic time for you, Aries, to get organized at work and share creative ideas with your team. Also on this day, Venus in Virgo makes a harmonious connection with Saturn in Capricorn, creating a supportive energy, especially in your career. Your patience is paying off, and an easy energy for making commitments flows. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThings are moving at a quick pace as the sun meets Mars in diligent Virgo on September 2, and plenty of fun arrives as Venus clashes with Jupiter in fellow fire sign Sagittarius, bringing an exciting break to your usual flow. You continue slaying your to-do list as Mercury, Mars, and the sun meet on September 3, helping you get things done at work and inspiring you to cut out bad habits to begin a new, healthy routine. Our first taste of Neptune’s impact on this month arrives on September 4, when it opposes Venus. You might feel lazy stepping back at this time, but the energy isn’t conducive to productivity since people don’t see eye-to-eye and sensitive emotions are in the air.

Just be mindful of exaggerations or overbooking yourself the next day, when Mercury clashes with Jupiter. It would be a better idea to take notes of the ideas coming to you at this time, because they will be brilliant! Also on September 6, the sun makes a grounding, supportive connection with Saturn, helping you out in your career.

You’re usually great at trusting your gut, but your intuition could feel a little off at this time, so make space to reconnect with your inner voice. And try to get extra rest since you might feel off simply because your mind is tied. The energy kicks back up on September 8, and new adventures and opportunities to travel or stand in the spotlight arise as the sun clashes with Jupiter and Mercury connects with Pluto. The next day, important information comes your way, and a solid strategy—especially in your career—arrives as your ruling planet Mars connects with Saturn. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYou’re not feeling like your usual confident self as the sun opposes hazy Neptune on September 10—take it slow and don’t overextend yourself, Aries. You might feel a bit invisible or unappreciated at this time, so watch out for paranoia and do your best to channel your energy into your spiritual practice. September has its ups and downs, but you’ll be back up on September 12 as Mars clashes with Jupiter, bringing exciting things your way—but be very mindful of tempers (yours and others’!) and don’t pick any fights, as they’ll likely get blown out of proportion. A more social energy flows as chatty Mercury meets charming Venus on September 13, igniting a joyous new conversation, project, or plan.

The atmosphere is charged, but you need your rest, little ram; this is a powerful moon for dream work or therapy, as a climax is reached in a spiritually and emotionally charged situation. Full moons are all about release, and this is an important period for you to let go of the past. New relationships are entering your life as messenger planet Mercury and love and money planet Venus enter Libra. You’re focused on connecting with others, and a gentle, easy atmosphere for compromising and enjoying time together flows—but before that fresh start can take place, the full moon in Pisces asks you to sit with your emotions, feel them, and move through them, especially if you’ve been ignoring or repressing them! Watch out for shady characters and lazy behavior during this full moon as Mars opposes Neptune, and do your best to focus on releasing things rather than setting new plans in motion. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSaturn ends its retrograde on September 18, and a restructuring in your career is finalized as you begin to move forward in your public life. A powerful move is made in your work as Mars connects with Pluto on September 19—you’ve stepped into an exclusive circle, and you’re making it work for you! Jupiter clashes with Neptune for the third and final time this year on September 21, and an important corner is turned. These planets faced off on January 13 and June 16, so think back to themes in your life on those dates, as they may be revisited now. Your beliefs are being challenged, and you might be disappointed or even embarrassed to find that things aren’t as they seemed. This can be disheartening, but now that you know the truth, what will you do? \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYou’re setting new boundaries now that you have a fresh understanding of your reality on September 22 as Mercury clashes with Saturn—but watch out for grumpy vibes, and don’t ask for favors at this time. The energy shifts the next day as Libra season begins, finding you focused on your relationships after a super productive and exhausting few weeks. Exciting news is shared on September 24 as Mercury connects with Jupiter—this is a fantastic time to travel and study, and connect with people as you do so. Just watch out for frustration on September 25 as Venus clashes with Saturn: Detailed plans are hammered out, but the energy isn’t affectionate and it’s not a good time to plan a romantic date. Secrets are revealed and power plays are made as Mercury clashes with Pluto on September 26—be careful about who you’re trying to outsmart, and watch out for manipulators. Bring in an unbiased third party to mediate if you must! \u003c/p\u003e \u003cul\u003e \u003cli\u003e Don’t put up with any liars this month.

Will it be a whimsical whirlwind, or will you be left paranoid and deflated by disappointment? You’re at a turning point this month, discovering what’s gold and what’s total crap in your life, especially when it comes to relationships, as Neptune opposes a slew of planets in flawless and perfectionistic Virgo.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eCommunication planet Mercury in its home sign of Virgo makes a harmonious connection with Uranus in Taurus on September 1, inspiring unexpected conversations and breakthroughs in connecting with others.

They may be more confrontational than usual, which can be great if they’re usually shy about asking for what they want—just don’t pick any fights. Also on September 2, Venus clashes with Jupiter in Sagittarius, bringing a burst of fun and generosity. This is a great time to partner with people and also stand in the spotlight. You make a lucky move that helps you connect with someone you’ve been wanting to reach out to. Just be careful about over-indulging!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMercury, Mars, and the sun meet on September 3, boosting communication in your relationships—however, the next day brings confusion, especially in your partnerships, as Venus opposes Neptune. This combination may not totally be bad, though; it may bring the dose of fantasy you’ve been craving or you could have the time of your life getting lost with a lover! But the vibe is weepy, and our vulnerabilities are especially sensitive at this time. Tread lightly. This isn’t a time to make important decisions or commitments. Take it slow, avoid any situations that could stir up paranoia, watch out for whiney attitudes, and be especially attuned to any martyr behavior or guilt trips—this is good advice all month, since Neptune will oppose quite a few planets in Virgo.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cul\u003e \u003cli\u003e Plan a romantic getaway with your lover, like this \u003ca href=\"https://fave.co/32g4Mhp\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewine tour in Strasbourg\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e While you’re there, play this \u003ca href=\"https://fave.co/32jTY1L\" target=\"_blank\"\u003etravel-themed card game\u003c/a\u003e to get to know one another even better\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e Keep communication flowing with this \u003ca href=\"https://fave.co/32hUJIz\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eclear quartz necklace\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e \u003cp\u003eA more grounding energy arrives as detail-minded Mercury connects with taskmaster Saturn in Capricorn on September 5, helping you and your partners hammer out responsibilities and commitments. Plenty of news is shared and the mood is busy at work as Mercury clashes with Jupiter on September 6. Also on this day, the sun connects with Saturn and Venus connects with Pluto, encouraging a supportive energy as you explore your relationships on a deeper, more intimate level. However, confusion and miscommunication abound as Mercury opposes Neptune on September 7—avoid making agreements on this day, and don’t let your imagination run away from you. Watch out for lies or lazy calculations. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eA busy mood descends on September 8 as the sun clashes with Jupiter and Mercury connects with Pluto, bringing excitement to your career and finding you connecting with VIPs! This is a fantastic time to network; people are excited to partner with you, and you’re receiving a thrilling amount of recognition. Mars connects with Saturn on September 9, encouraging you and your partners to strategize and turn your dreams and fantasies into reality...but confusion arrives the next day as the sun opposes Neptune. You might find that your dreams for the future are quite different than your partner’s, or that there has been a disconnect, delay, or disappointment. This is a sensitive period, so be gentle with yourself and others. This month brings a lot of stop-and-go energy that can be incredibly annoying—especially in your partnerships—but you have to get through it to figure out what’s really working and what just seems to work because you’re romanticizing a situation. This month, you’re learning that what’s important to you might not be so important to your partners—romantic and otherwise—but that isn’t a reflection of your worth or importance.

Much of this month has been focused on your relationships, and this full moon brings the spotlight back to you! How do you feel, Pisces? This is a powerful time to release emotions and not the best time to take action, since Mars makes a lazy, sleazy opposition to illusory Neptune—watch out for passive aggressive behavior or sneaky people. A shift in energy arrives as chatty Mercury and charming Venus enter Libra, a sign associated with balance: What ideas, conversations, relationships, or desires do you need to release in order to regain your sense of equilibrium? You’ve come into this full moon carrying a lot of baggage, but Mercury and Venus in Libra won’t let you leave it mired down by B.S.

Think back to those dates and consider the themes you were facing. Neptune and Jupiter are your two ruling planets, and their clash finds you at odds with yourself, wondering where you belong in the world and in your career, and considering whether you’ve been dreaming too big, or worse, selling yourself short. Now, you’re learning whether your beliefs about the world and success are rooted in reality or fantasy. You may very well experience an embarrassing moment if you’ve been living with delusion or paranoia, so check in with the people you trust and get back down to earth. A reality check arrives as detail-minded Mercury clashes with taskmaster Saturn, the planet of rules and responsibilities, on September 22—this will certainly help you figure out what’s what!

This is a powerful time to form bonds with people and connect on a deeper level, but be mindful of TMI and PDA: It’s easy to get carried away with the energy now, but be smart about what you share!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003ePDA is a fairly divisive topic. \u003ca href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/8xp7nx/why-do-i-hate-watching-people-make-out?utm_source=astroguideapp\u0026utm_campaign=monthly\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRead more\u003c/a\u003e on why some people think it’s fine while others can’t stand the thought of it, and how those feelings might be related to your personality.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWear this \u003ca href=\"https://fave.co/2PneJI8\" target=\"_blank\"\u003enecklace\u003c/a\u003e as a reminder of the connection you have with earth, or give it to a close friend to commemorate the bond you two have.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://video.vice.com/en_us/show/geico-debt-diaries?utm_source=astroguideapp\u0026utm_campaign=monthly\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWatch these videos\u003c/a\u003e for some extra inspiration on how you can pay off your debt.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eMercury, Mars, and the sun meet on September 3, creating a super focused energy that helps you analyze details concerning finances. A finicky, picky mood is in the air, which could be annoying, but it will also motivate you to cut something out of your life that’s simply not working. Watch out for big egos and know-it-alls on this day! \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhile the convergence of action planet Mars, witty Mercury, and the sun helps things feel very clear cut, a haze of confusion descends on September as the planet of illusion and delusion, Neptune, currently in Pisces, opposes a slew of planets in Virgo. On September 4, Venus opposes Neptune, which finds you totally confused about money. But on a deeper level, you’re not even sure what you want anymore. What you previously wanted may have been a disappointment, or maybe you’re just in a bad mood, feeling like nothing will ever be good enough.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eA melancholy vibe is in the air, and romance also takes a peculiar turn. Don’t make or believe any promises at this time, and definitely keep things light—people don’t know what they want! At the same time, an interesting adventure in love may take place. Neptune’s a tricky planet: As it opposes planets in grounded earth sign Virgo this month, some wonderful whimsy or fantasy might manifest itself, but you’ll have to check in with yourself about paranoia and delusion. You just have to approach things gently and without expectations.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSeptember 5 helps you get back down to earth as Mercury connects with taskmaster Saturn in Capricorn, helping you get organized, but also encouraging you to cut down on the tasks that you’re adding to your calendar and get some rest. If you have the option, say no to taking on more work, finalize what you’ve already been working on, and catch up on sleep. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSeptember 6 is busy: Mercury clashes with Jupiter, the sun connects with Saturn, and Venus connects with Pluto. A busy energy in communication takes place and your intuitive abilities receive a boost. You’re also setting some important boundaries at this time, which is crucial considering Neptune’s wobbly influence over people’s sense of limits this month! This is also a powerful time of the month for deepening bonds and connections in love and in your spiritual practice.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eDeepen the bond with yourself through a \u003ca href=\"https://fave.co/2PmKT6M\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emeditation retreat like this one at the beach\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHelp yourself have a deeper sleep with these \u003ca href=\"https://fave.co/2Hzt1iK\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emelatonin-infused transdermal patches\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIt’s not always easy to say no, but there comes a point when you have to draw a line.

If a deal sounds too good to be true, trust your instincts. You might feel insecure at this time about what you have to offer people and miscommunications may leave you frustrated, so take it slow and avoid having important conversations on this day. On September 8, the sun clashes with Jupiter and Mercury connects with Pluto, inspiring a generous and open-minded atmosphere in your social life. You’ll find yourself sharing secrets and working through tricky emotional issues with confidence and clarity—it’s a wonderful time to dig to the bottom of a problem in therapy and heal it! More productive energy flows as Mars connects with Saturn on September 9, inspiring emotional strength and helping you set boundaries. Watch out for confusion on September 10, however, as the sun opposes Neptune and stirs up confusion about money and finds you feeling insecure again. Though you’re not sure where you fit in, the energy shifts on September 12 as Mars clashes with Jupiter, bringing you a boost in courage—just don’t pick any unnecessary fights!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe full moon in Pisces lands on September 14, bringing a climax to issues that have been brewing in your finances. A feeling of release accompanies the full moon; however, Mars opposes Neptune, which may also inspire a lazy, and even shady, vibe. Mind your business today, save important talks for another time, and if someone is pressuring you to do things their way, work it out another time—especially if it’s going to cost you money (save receipts!). At the same time, the mood takes a big shift as Mercury and Venus enter fellow air sign Libra, inspiring a lighter, freer energy. Chatty Mercury loves socializing in Libra, and Venus, being the ruling planet of Libra, loves to flirt and have fun while it’s in this intellectual, harmony-seeking sign.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSaturn, one of your ruling planets in addition to Uranus, ends its retrograde on September 18. Saturn retrograde has been restructuring the sector of your chart that rules your subconscious, so watch out for symbols in your dreams, or messages from your inner voice during meditation. Meanwhile, Mars connects with Pluto on September 19, inspiring bravery as you make changes and find the courage to explore repressed emotions and parts of yourself that you have hidden not only from the world, but even from yourself, dear Aquarius.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eUse this \u003ca href=\"https://fave.co/2Pl8iFA\" target=\"_blank\"\u003edecoder\u003c/a\u003e to help you make sense of the symbols or themes that pop up in your dreams.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThese \u003ca href=\"https://fave.co/2ZgAbSY\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ecandles\u003c/a\u003e can help you set your intentions before any meditation practice.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTake an \u003ca href=\"https://fave.co/2Py5EN4\" target=\"_blank\"\u003earomatherapy class\u003c/a\u003e like this one to help you heal your body and soul.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eJupiter clashes with Neptune on September 21 for the third time this year: think back to January 13 and June 16, as threads from those times in your life will resurface for you to work with. Neptune and Jupiter have things in common: They are both planets associated with belief. But Neptune is prone to denial, while Jupiter is always concerned with the truth. As they clash, you will learn where you have been ignoring the truth and be tasked with accepting it. Doing so can be hard and might even feel embarrassing! The truth hurts, but it’s the key to making the changes you want to see in your life, especially in regards to money, but also to your social life. You’re learning a lot this month about what to invest in and what changes you want to see in the world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSeptember 22 brings an opportunity to have a real, but difficult, conversation as Mercury clashes with Saturn; boundaries, expectations, and standards will be set. People will be in a grumpy mood, so now is not the time to ask for a favor. Instead, use that energy toward getting organized. You’ll also be exhausted, so remember to rest!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eLibra season begins on September 23! The sun entering fellow air sign Libra brings a big shift in energy for you: You’re looking at the big picture, regaining balance, and finding excitement in the future travels you will embark on. You’ve experienced many transformations and endings this month with Virgo season, and new opportunities are coming, bringing you to a new place in your life. Chatty Mercury connects with philosophical Jupiter on September 24, inspiring a wonderful atmosphere for socializing and sharing ideas. It’s a great time to network! Still, watch out for rejection as Venus clashes with the planet of “no,” Saturn, on September 25. This isn’t the best day to plan a date, and you might find yourself feeling groggy and grouchy. Secrets are shared and discoveries are made as Mercury clashes with Pluto on September 26; watch out for shady people and manipulators, and be careful who you share information with.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eNot all secrets have to be shady or malicious.

So many exciting plans are made right now… but that’s just it: they’re only plans, they’re only seeds. Don’t expect things to happen overnight. Amazing things are on the horizon, but you need to give them plenty of time—don’t beat yourself up if they’re not happening tomorrow.

Your perspective and beliefs are challenged this month as you discover what’s real and what’s B.S.! \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eStill, the start of the month is exciting: Mercury is in fellow earth sign Virgo, and it makes a harmonious connection with Uranus in Taurus, another earth sign. The planets’ connection on September 1 promises a whirlwind of spontaneous adventure and strokes of genius. Venus in Virgo also connects with your ruling planet Saturn in Capricorn on September 1, creating a wonderfully supportive energy. This bodes especially well for connecting with leaders or authorities at school, during your travels, or even in you spiritual pursuits! A kind spiritual counselor helps you get clear on your desires and values and inspires you to open your mind to what else could be out there for you.

Getting a handle on communication will not be easy, and you're having a hard time expressing your needs. It's unlike you not to know what you want, but right now, you may be quite confused! This is also a difficult time for understanding how others feel and what their desires and values are. There is a lazy energy in the air, making people feel weepy, so watch out for guilt trips or sleazy behavior.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThankfully, a grounded energy arrives as Mercury connects with your ruling planet Saturn in your sign on September 5!

September 6 is busy: Mercury clashes with Jupiter, the sun connects with Saturn, and Venus connects with Pluto in Capricorn. Lots of talk is taking place and your intuition gets a boost.

Don't try to prove you are right today—nothing makes sense to you at this time, anyway, as you feel challenged mentally and spiritually. You may find that something you believed in before turned out not to be so reliable after all. Still, these discoveries are part of the journey that you’ve been on all year.

This full moon marks the beginning of the shift between thinking about what you will do and actually doing it. When Saturn’s retrograde—a powerful period of inner work for you, since Saturn is your ruling planet—ends on September 18, you're ready to rebuild some of the most important structures in your life. You're also feeling especially energized as action planet Mars connects with the planet of transformation, Pluto, on September 19.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYour final drama with Neptune arrives on September 21 as it clashes with Jupiter. Think back to January 13 and June 16, when the two planets last opposed (though truthfully, you may well have been feeling a similar energy all year). It's not like you to put blind faith into something, but you may not have realized you were doing that. You might’ve taken a fact, idea, or situation for granted, and now you’re learning that things aren't as you previously believed. Don't beat yourself up about it. It's possible there was truly no way you could have known, and now with this learning experience—as disappointing or even embarrassing as it may be—you know better now...unless, of course, you're in denial!

Mercury connects with Jupiter on September 24, inspiring a boost in optimism; while you're still feeling burned by the B.S. that Jupiter's square to Neptune exposed, you're learning to trust your intuition again after recovering from the disappointments that took place. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eVenus clashes with Saturn on September 25, applying pressure on you to make a decision about what you want.

Upgrades at work arrive, and an unexpected windfall may take place. September 1 also finds Venus in Virgo connecting with Saturn in Capricorn, raising the standards for your day-to-day life, and helping you hammer out a happier, healthier schedule. The sun meets Mars in Virgo, and Venus squares off with Jupiter in Sagittarius on September 2, bringing plenty of movement, especially in your career and your day job—just don’t overcommit yourself!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMercury, Mars, and the sun meet on September 3, starting a dynamic new journey in your career. This is an exciting time to stand in the spotlight, receive recognition, and step into a position of leadership. But on September 4, a confusing opposition occurs between Venus and Neptune in Pisces—you’re not totally sure where you want to head with your career and home life. Your feelings are very big this month, and making sense of them will take time. While the energy is confused and even a bit lazy, on the plus side, some romance or glamour is also in the atmosphere, and a more grounding energy around making plans arrives on September 5 as Mercury connects with Saturn in Capricorn.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSeptember 6 is busy: Mercury clashes with Jupiter, the sun connects with Saturn, and Venus connects with Pluto in Capricorn. You’re excitedly sharing a message, support is all around you, and an important gift, blessing, allowance, or reveal is made or given to help you push forward with your goals—you just have to be more clear on what they are, and the key to doing that this month is acknowledging your emotions about your childhood and family life. The two might not seem connected, but if you can’t address and tell the truth about your past to yourself (this isn’t even about making the private public!), you’re going to be frustrated by your future this September.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eSometimes, acknowledging your past means having to confront some uncomfortable memories—and it’s \u003ca href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/8x7qnk/how-to-set-boundaries-relationships?utm_source=astroguideapp\u0026utm_campaign=monthly\" target=\"_blank\"\u003enot always clear why\u003c/a\u003e our brains tend to do that, according to some neuroscientists.

Two days later, Mars clashes with Jupiter, inspiring a burst of action and creativity, but watch out for big egos. A cheerful, social energy arrives as Mercury meets Venus and the sun connects with Pluto on September 13, helping you step into a place of confidence and power, especially at work.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe full moon in Pisces lands on September 14, pulling your attention to your home and family. A climax is reached in an issue that’s been building at home; like many things this month, the energy is lazy and confusing due to Mars’s opposition to Neptune. Disappointment is in the air. You dream big, Sag, but those visions can’t always come true. Your efforts have been obscured. Let yourself cry. The moon in Pisces is weepy as hell and holding it in will not do you any good. Express yourself! Thankfully, a shift in energy will come as chatty Mercury and sweet Venus enter Libra, bringing friends to your side. Make the best of this full moon by creating a low-key, comfy, cozy space to spend time with family and loved ones.

They\u0026#8217;d rather have two or three \u0026nbsp;cars, a boat, trips to Europe, a larger home, and so on than pay the money necessary to place their children in a well-run private school, or take the time to homeschool them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt isn\u0026#8217;t\neasy being with children 24/7, although I can say thanks be to God for giving\nme the grace to do so, and now true joy in being able to.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026#8217;ve wondered, what might happen to state schools in terms of funding if there were to be a mass exit of their \u0026#8220;customers\u0026#8221; when enough parents got tired of letting the state indoctrinate their children?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFewer\nteachers would be needed, fewer facilities.

Certainly this is not the case across\nthe board. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, when we surrender our children to these state-run institutions influenced so heavily by groups like Planned Parenthood, we can\u0026#8217;t expect the content or outcome to be what we want.

One, Apple really sets the tone for consumer privacy among the tech giants so making notable changes here is positive and might push others to make similar updates. Two, Apple has the worst consumer-facing digital assistant. Like, Siri is just unquestionably worse than Alexa and Google Assistant so they arguably have the most to lose here and this is a decision that means less data for the company to hone its tech on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTogether, all of these gaffes really weren\u0026#8217;t egregious, they were dealing with data that wasn\u0026#8217;t nominally connected to users, but audio files should definitely be treated with a little more respect than anonymous crash reports. The journalism from publications like The Guardian pushing on \u0026#8220;common\u0026#8221; industry practices seemed to surface some positive change here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"embed breakout\"\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"DURktAdLVf\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/28/apple-is-turning-siri-audio-clip-review-off-by-default-and-bringing-it-in-house/\"\u003eApple is turning Siri audio clip review off by default and bringing it in house\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ciframe title=\"\u0026#8220;Apple is turning Siri audio clip review off by default and bringing it in house\u0026#8221; \u0026#8212; TechCrunch\" class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/28/apple-is-turning-siri-audio-clip-review-off-by-default-and-bringing-it-in-house/embed/#?secret=DURktAdLVf\" data-secret=\"DURktAdLVf\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eSend me feedback\u003cbr /\u003e\non Twitter \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/lucasmtny?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\"\u003e@lucasmtny\u003c/a\u003e or email\u003cbr /\u003e\nlucas@techcrunch.com\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn to the rest of the week’s news.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"attachment_1829158\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"attachment_1845731\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"caption-attachment-1845731\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"\u003e\u003cimg class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1871338\" title=\"Nintendo Switch Lite\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/CMB_7883.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"Nintendo Switch Lite\" width=\"680\" height=\"453\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/CMB_7883.jpg 4464w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/CMB_7883.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/CMB_7883.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/CMB_7883.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/CMB_7883.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/CMB_7883.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eTrends of the week\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere are a few big news items from big companies, with green links to all the sweet, sweet added context:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eNintendo\u0026#8217;s portable gets more portable\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\nThe Nintendo Switch has been a huge success for the company, but in a new hardware update, the giant is doubling down on portability and simplicity in what might be a bid to capture some of the market it\u0026#8217;s left behind from the DS line.

of a terrible mass murder that had occurred there two decades earlier. In a somber ceremony attended by local dignitaries, a 5.5-meter reflective steel monument was raised on top of a grassy hill overlooking the town. Višegrad was the site of some of the \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi%C5%A1egrad_massacres\"\u003eworst atrocities\u003c/a\u003e that took place during the ugly wars following the collapse of Yugoslavia. Over the course of one summer in 1992, as many as 3,000 Muslims were shot, raped, and drowned in this historic town along the banks of the Drina River. A resort hotel, the Vilina Vlas, was transformed into a concentration camp for the rape of young women. On at least two occasions, dozens of elderly people, women, and children were herded into homes by jeering Serb gunmen and burned alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose atrocities are exactly what made the new memorial so jarring. The shining cross was not erected in memory of the Muslim victims of the genocide. It was put up to honor the perpetrators and their allies: Serbian paramilitaries and the Russian volunteers who helped them ethnically cleanse the town.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c!-- BLOCK(photo-grid)[1](%7B%7D)(%7B%22columns%22%3A2%2C%22photos%22%3A%5B%7B%22alt%22%3A%22Cemetery%2C%20genocide%22%2C%22src%22%3A%22https%3A%5C%2F%5C%2Ftheintercept.com%5C%2Fwp-uploads%5C%2Fsites%5C%2F1%5C%2F2019%5C%2F08%5C%2FIMG_7029-1567221148-768x1024.jpg%22%7D%2C%7B%22alt%22%3A%22IMG_6984-1567221104%22%2C%22src%22%3A%22https%3A%5C%2F%5C%2Ftheintercept.com%5C%2Fwp-uploads%5C%2Fsites%5C%2F1%5C%2F2019%5C%2F08%5C%2FIMG_6984-1567221104-768x1024.jpg%22%7D%5D%2C%22caption%22%3A%22Left%5C%2Ftop%3A%20A%20grave%20in%20the%20cemetery%20in%20Vi%5Cu0161egrad%2C%20where%20the%20word%20%27genocide%27%20was%20removed%20in%202014.%20The%20word%20was%20added%20again%20in%20black%20ink%20by%20an%20unknown%20person.%20Right%5C%2Fbottom%3A%20An%20Orthodox%20Christian%20cross%20monument%20was%20unveiled%20on%20Grad%20hill%20above%20Vi%5Cu0161egrad%20in%20April%202017.%22%2C%22credit%22%3A%22Photos%3A%20Murtaza%20Hussain%5C%2FThe%20Intercept%22%2C%22size%22%3A%22xtra-large%22%7D) --\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"photo-grid\" data-caption=\"Left/top: A grave in the cemetery in Višegrad, where the word 'genocide' was removed in 2014.

Yet what may be even more alarming is that outside of Bosnia, the memory of the genocide committed against its Muslims has become a source of inspiration for the global far right. The shooter who killed 51 people at two mosques in New Zealand this March wrote the names of Serbian nationalist leaders on the rifle he used to carry out the massacres. During his livestream of the attacks, he played a jaunty song performed by Bosnian Serb soldiers during the war, nicknamed “Remove Kebab,” that has become popular among the online \u0026#8220;alt-right.\u0026#8221; The Norwegian extremist Anders Breivik, who murdered 77 people during a 2011 shooting rampage, reportedly also showed a “\u003ca href=\"https://www.economist.com/eastern-approaches/2011/07/25/breiviks-balkan-obsession\"\u003estrange obsession\u003c/a\u003e” with the genocide in Bosnia, heaping praise on wartime Serb leaders in a manifesto he wrote before his attacks. A domestic terrorist in Pennsylvania who killed a state trooper in 2014 was similarly infatuated with the \u003ca href=\"https://www.mcall.com/news/local/mc-eric-frein-serbian-20141012-story.html\"\u003ewartime Bosnian Serb military\u003c/a\u003e, posing images of himself on social media in a uniform from the notorious Drina Wolves unit. On websites like 4chan that are helping to breed a new culture of racial hatred and glorification of violence, it’s not hard to find the Bosnian genocide favorably discussed. These new online connections are also \u003ca href=\"https://balkaninsight.com/2018/05/01/british-nationalist-trains-serb-far-right-for-online-war-04-30-2018/\"\u003ehelping to foster real-world links\u003c/a\u003e between the Western far right and its Balkan counterparts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c!-- BLOCK(promote-related-post)[4](%7B%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22relatedPostNumber%22%3A1%7D) --\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"promote-embed\" data-related-post-number=\"1\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c!-- END-BLOCK(promote-related-post)[4] --\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the ethnically cleansed areas of Bosnia, where the genocide occurred, today the perpetrators seem to have narrowed their responses to either ignoring what happened or celebrating it. In addition to the memorial on the hill above Višegrad, in the town center a bronze statue stands in honor of local military veterans, several of whom have been convicted of war crimes at The Hague. Aside from a few small plaques put up by victims’ groups in neighborhoods where mass killings happened, there is no recognition of the massacres — and those plaques have been placed on the upper floors of buildings to keep them out of reach after repeated vandalism. A few years ago, the local municipality even sandblasted the word “genocide” off a memorial stone erected by victims’ families in the town’s Muslim graveyard. When I visited that cemetery this summer, the word had still been obliterated from the monument — though someone had defiantly written it back in with black marker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn order to understand the ideology of the emerging far right — obsessed with demographics and starry-eyed over the Bosnian genocide — it’s important to look at what actually happened in Bosnia. The grim success of the genocide in cleansing much of Bosnia should give a hint as to why it has become an inspiration. Around 100,000 people are believed to have been killed during the Bosnian war. The majority of them were Muslims. The cleansing of places like Višegrad, Fo\u0026#x10D;a, Srebrenica, Prijedor, and Zvornik was not a war between two equal and opposing forces. It was a campaign of murder and cruelty against a defenseless people, waged in the name of demographics and ethnic purity. It mixed equal parts racism and misogyny. The level of sexual violence against Bosnian Muslim women was so targeted and systematic — educated women were singled out for the worst treatment — that it led to rape being recognized for the first time as a weapon of war under international law.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c!-- BLOCK(photo)[5](%7B%7D)(%7B%22scroll%22%3Afalse%2C%22align%22%3A%22center%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22724px%22%7D) --\u003e\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-center  width-fixed' style='width: 724px;'\u003e\u003c!-- CONTENT(photo)[5] --\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/08/h_19.00150044-familyphoto-1567206196.jpg\" alt=\"A defaced photograph that was found by a Bosnian family when they returned to their home in a suburb of Sarajevo, Bosnia, March 17, 1996.

As historian Michael Sells wrote in his history of the war, “Birthrates became so heated an issue that Serb nationalists charged Muslims with a premeditated plot to use their higher birthrates to overwhelm and ultimately destroy the Christian Serbs.” That same fever dream of birth rates and racism is now taking hold in the minds of many people outside Serbia and Bosnia, including in the United States. The young man who murdered 22 people in a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, left a manifesto online despairing over the demographic growth of Hispanics in his state.

In reality, Serbs, Croats, and Muslims had lived together as compatriots in the former Yugoslavia for a long time before violent demagogues came to power; it took years of effort during the late 1980s and early 1990s for ultranationalist leaders to drum up the level of fear and hatred necessary for war to start. Before it fell apart, the former Yugoslavia was a relatively modern place, with a highly educated elite in its cities and a solid professional class. In some ways, politically, the region might be ahead of us. It was decades ago that the former Yugoslavia began to experience the top-down encouragement of racism that the United States is now undergoing. We are only witnessing the early stages of a process that the former Yugoslavia has already been through in its entirety. The war and genocide in Bosnia proved that it is, in fact, possible to incite and kill your way to an ethno-state. The eastern half of the country, where towns like Višegrad are located, was cleansed of almost all of its non-Serb populations and transformed into an entity known to this day as Republika Srpska.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the United States and Western Europe now grapple with political movements demanding ethnic purity and demographic change — through individual acts of terrorism, as well as government policy — it feels more urgent to take a look at the inspiration for these demands and the consequences.

The one time it did hold the world’s attention for a prolonged period, in the 1990s, it was connected to terrible war crimes. But the Bosnian genocide was not the first campaign of mass atrocity in the region. The former Yugoslavia was made up of a number of republics, each with a predominant group: Croat, Muslim, Slovene, Montenegrin, or Serb. During World War II, a Nazi-allied regime in Croatia carried out a genocide against Serbs, in which hundreds of thousands were murdered. Unlike that campaign, the crimes in the 1990s took place in the full glare of the modern global media, and the Serbs were the perpetrators, not the victims. It branded Serbia’s national image in a way that has proven lasting. “The Serbian leadership never seemed to realize that they had fallen into a trap and that with every shot they were turning the Serbs into international pariahs,” wrote journalist Tim Judah, in his postwar history of the country. “They consistently failed to understand that since 1941 an extra dimension had been added to war — international opinion as guided by television and the media.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c!-- BLOCK(photo)[8](%7B%7D)(%7B%22scroll%22%3Afalse%2C%22align%22%3A%22bleed%22%2C%22bleed%22%3A%22large%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22auto%22%7D) --\u003e\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-bleed large-bleed width-auto' style='width: auto;'\u003e\u003c!-- CONTENT(photo)[8] --\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/08/IMG_8408-soldiers-1567268218.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_8408-soldiers-1567268218\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-266174\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class='caption overlayed'\u003eA member of Arkan\u0026#8217;s Tigers, a Serbian volunteer paramilitary unit, kicks Bosnian Muslim civilians they had killed during the first battle for Bosnia in Bijeljina, Bosnia, on March 31, 1992.

As a young man, Poluga was a commander in one of the notorious militias operating in Višegrad.

After numerous calls to Poluga’s cellphone, he agreed to meet for lunch at a small patio restaurant just down the road from Višegrad’s famous bridge. When we met, he was wearing a white T-shirt with a slightly stretched-out collar and striped jogging pants. Short, with spiky, graying hair and narrow eyes, he looked less like a fearsome paramilitary than a washed-up, middle-aged \u0026#8220;Sopranos\u0026#8221; character. He was visibly nervous. “I didn’t kill anyone during the war, so I don’t have any guilt about that time,” he told me over a plate of greasy grilled meat and onions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVišegrad is a small town. From the outer bank of the Drina River, it is almost possible to take in the whole place at once. During the war, the bridge became a site for ritual executions, where people were brought by the dozens to have their throats slit. Large public buildings were requisitioned for use as concentration camps. The Vilina Vlas resort spa became a particular site of horror. Hundreds of young Bosnian Muslim women and girls were held there for months where they were raped, tortured, and killed by Serb paramilitaries. Never significantly renovated, it still functions as a resort today. When I visited it just before meeting Poluga, the ground-floor cafeteria was filled with vacationing families and elderly people noisily eating. The only indication that something bad might have happened there in the past was a “no photography” sign at the entrance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegarding who was responsible for the notorious crimes that cleansed Višegrad of its Muslims during the war, Poluga was evasive. Some crimes did take place — “international courts have documented this” ­— but he told me that they had little to do with anyone from Višegrad. “Except for one or two people, no one from the town knew about what was going on. The killings that happened were done by paramilitaries that came from places in Serbia, not people from here,” he told me carefully. “Most of the people here only found about what had happened after the war was over. Of course, everyone was shocked when they learned.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[15](%7B%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22left%22%7D) --\u003e\u003cblockquote class=\"stylized pull-left\" data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"left\"\u003e\u003c!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[15] --\u003eNot only were many of its inhabitants murdered or expelled forever by the genocide, but Višegrad itself was ruined even for the winning side of the ethnic cleansing.\u003c!-- END-CONTENT(pullquote)[15] --\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c!-- END-BLOCK(pullquote)[15] --\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople are killed in wars, of course, but the sadistic tortures and murders that took place in Višegrad were acknowledged by international courts as something abnormal. At the sentencing of Milan and Sredoje Luki\u0026#x107;, the two brothers who led a local paramilitary group, a judge at The Hague said that the crimes in Višegrad \u0026#8220;exemplified the worst acts of inhumanity that one person may inflict on others.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite his pending war crimes case, Poluga’s life has continued relatively normally. He works now as a karate instructor, a job that takes him around the country. He has a son living in Sarajevo. Over the course of a few hours talking on the patio of the restaurant — with its plastic chairs and wooden tables just a short walk from the Drina — he opened up a bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There is no life here, no jobs, no opportunity,” Poluga told me pensively. “The factories that employed most people closed down during the fighting. When it ended, they didn’t come back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was the other tragedy of Višegrad’s cleansing. Not only were many of its inhabitants murdered or expelled forever by the genocide, but the town itself was ruined even for the winning side. The victors got what they wanted, but they are now worse off than ever. Today, Višegrad is an eerie ghost town. Violently remade as a homogenous Serbian enclave, it bears little resemblance to the lively place so eloquently depicted in Ivo Andri\u0026#x107;’s famous novel, “The Bridge on the Drina.” A bizarre historical theme park town under construction in the city center — named “Andri\u0026#x107;grad” after the Nobel Prize-winning author who wrote about the town — is the only sign of new development. Andri\u0026#x107; was a complex figure who wrote a relatively nuanced history of Bosnia and its peoples. But in Andri\u0026#x107;grad, he’s been transformed into a forefather of modern Bosnian Serb ultranationalism. His image is plastered all over the place. Intended as a tourist draw, the miniature town doesn’t seem particularly popular even to locals.

It’s not often you get to meet an accused war criminal, and I wanted to know what he had seen or done during the war. The more I pressed, however, the more a great wall of contradiction began to be erected. After admitting that there had been atrocities against innocent people, Poluga switches to saying that there was actually a great military battle between opposing sides — something that never happened in Višegrad.

Some of his earliest memories were of playing on the town’s bridge, which was built nearly 500 years ago when Višegrad was part of the Ottoman Empire. Considered a masterpiece of medieval architecture, the ornate stone bridge stretches out almost 180 meters over the emerald waters of the Drina River. Back in his childhood, the bridge had been a lively gathering place for people to drink, gossip, and go fishing. After the paramilitaries took over in 1992, it became a place for executions. “I hate that fucking bridge now,” Sabanija said as we passed it after our meeting with Poluga.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTall and lanky, with his long hair pulled back into a ponytail, Sabanija is now in his 40s. Despite his gray hair, he gives off the impression of a man much younger. A teenager when the war started, Sabanija, like hundreds of thousands of other Bosnians, suddenly found himself a refugee in his own country. Enlisted into the fledgling Bosnian Army, his youth was over almost before it began. During the war, he was wounded four times, including once by a piece of mortar shrapnel lodged in his abdomen. He spent a year in a wheelchair before he could walk again. Today, he swims to stay in shape, insisting that his war injuries don’t slow him down. But, as he conceded to me quietly as we left Višegrad, he can no longer run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSabanija represents the other side of the coin of ethnic cleansing: the community that was targeted with violence. For some Bosnian Muslims, the knowledge that their neighbors tried to exterminate them has bred a deep anxiety about the future. But for Sabanija, especially after coming to the brink of death on numerous occasions, it has instead engendered a kind of steely resilience. Or, at the very least, indifference. Unlike many people who would be queasy at the thought of visiting Višegrad, Sabanija agreed to accompany me there without hesitation, including to the meeting with Poluga. He didn\u0026#8217;t seem to think the former militia commander has changed much. “If there is another war, this guy would become a commander again in one second. No question,” he told me as we piled into his gray Ford Focus and left town.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSabanija grew up in Rogatica, a small town west of Višegrad that is now also part of the ethno-state of Republika Srpska. On the way back to Sarajevo, he agreed to stop and give me a short tour of where he grew up. Rogatica today seems like a superficially normal place. Like most towns in eastern Bosnia, the surrounding scenery is beautiful: all soaring cliffs and thickly forested hills. Around the main street, there are several cafes, a small movie theater, houses, and a few apartment buildings. The architecture is a combination of lusterless communist-style concrete buildings, mixed with orange-roofed, white-painted stone houses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c!-- BLOCK(photo)[18](%7B%7D)(%7B%22scroll%22%3Afalse%2C%22align%22%3A%22center%22%2C%22width%22%3A%221024px%22%7D) --\u003e\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-center  width-fixed' style='width: 1024px;'\u003e\u003c!-- CONTENT(photo)[18] --\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/08/samir-1567222362-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Samir\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-266140\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class='caption'\u003eSamir on the bridge over the river Drina on June 25, 2019.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class='caption source' style=''\u003ePhoto: Murtaza Hussain/The Intercept\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- END-CONTENT(photo)[18] --\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c!-- END-BLOCK(photo)[18] --\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose unremarkable buildings have a sinister history. When the war started, Sabanija’s Serbian neighbors suddenly turned into members of radical paramilitary organizations who were intoxicated by the rhetoric of leaders promising a pure Serb homeland. As Rogatica descended into madness, the childhood landmarks of his life took on new meanings. The local high school became a concentration camp where prisoners were detained and tortured. A pale orange house near the park where he had played with his cousins became notorious as a detention center for women, where dozens were held prisoner and raped by paramilitaries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter driving around the cramped main streets of the town, Sabanija turned onto a side road leading into a hilly residential neighborhood. The white houses are built on a huge incline. From their windows, they look out over a breathtaking forest embankment. On a fenced-off grassy lot, a few bricks mark the empty space where a building once stood. “This was my house,” Sabanija said. When the paramilitaries began taking over Rogatica, Sabanija’s family had fled with the town’s other Muslims to the surrounding hills. From their hiding place in the forest, someone told him that they could see his house on fire. He climbed up a tree to see if it could possibly be true. “I watched it burn down,” Sabanija whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[19](%7B%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22left%22%7D) --\u003e\u003cblockquote class=\"stylized pull-left\" data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"left\"\u003e\u003c!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[19] --\u003e\u0026#8220;These people were our friends and our neighbors.

Intellectuals, politicians, religious leaders, and others somehow esteemed in their community were murdered in horrible public spectacles.

As the news began trickling in, including a horrifying video of the killings, I initially felt the normal human reaction to some unpleasant news: I wanted to ignore it. No one wants to imagine that there are other people in their society who want to kill them and are willing to bring those desires into reality. After the massacre in El Paso, many Latinos in the United States began \u003ca href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/08/16/el-paso-texas-mass-shooting-latino-hispanic-reaction/2027932001/\"\u003ecoming forward to express similar feelings\u003c/a\u003e. But as the attacks have continued, including an attempted far-right shooting at a mosque in Oslo that I was just a few miles from at the time, I’ve fought back the urge to look away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne thing these shooters have all left behind are written manifestos. Starting with the New Zealand shooting, I’ve made sure to read every one. More than the hatred, the thing that strikes me when reading the words of these young men justifying their killings is the sense of hopelessness. They are obsessed with culture and race and are convinced that they are part of a demographic contest in which their side is losing. The future they see is bleak beyond imagination. The only way it could possibly be redeemed is through the mass murder they’re about to commit. It is not hard to see the similar vision of demographic decline and redemption through violence that animated wartime Serbian leaders. Even more than promises of glory, Karadži\u0026#x107; and Miloševi\u0026#x107; warned that their community was in mortal demographic danger and that violence would be necessary to reverse its collapse. Their vision shattered innumerable lives and turned Serbia and the newly created Republika Srpska into something like pariah states. Despite its failures, visible today on the desolate streets of Višegrad, their vision lives on in the imaginations of the international far right and among a young, ultranationalist generation present not just in Serbia, but across the Balkans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, that ultranationalist vision doesn’t attract everyone. It’s not clear yet who the future belongs to, either in the Balkans or the United States. In Serbia, there are still young people in touch with the painful memory of the past, who are trying to prevent their society from going down the same dark road again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[22](%7B%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22right%22%7D) --\u003e\u003cblockquote class=\"stylized pull-right\" data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"right\"\u003e\u003c!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[22] --\u003eThe manifestos left behind after every new shooting are the calling cards for a new era of violence — driven by a sense of demographic threat — that we are only starting to understand.\u003c!-- END-CONTENT(pullquote)[22] --\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c!-- END-BLOCK(pullquote)[22] --\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a wood-floored, glass-paneled office in central Belgrade, a group of young people, mostly Serbian, spend their time working in the hope that no demons of historical memory emerge from the most recent war to destroy their country again. In the aftermath of the years of war that came with the collapse of Yugoslavia, a number of nongovernmental organizations were founded across the Balkans to try and stitch back together the torn social fabric of the region. One of them is the Youth Initiative for Human Rights, an activist group founded in 2003 to nurture the region’s fledgling democracies and help people grapple with the legacy of the conflict.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIvan Djuri\u0026#x107; is the program director of the YIHR’s Belgrade office. Born in Belgrade, he was a child during the wars that destroyed Yugoslavia. Tall and reserved with parted brown hair, he speaks with a quiet confidence about the organization’s purpose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“People in Serbia generally do not like to talk about the wars. If they do, they prefer to talk about the NATO bombing that happened in 1999, which was ‘the war’ for most people,” he said, referring to the brief U.S.-led bombing campaign that struck Serbia during its 1999 war with Kosovo. “But when I was a teenager, around 2006, I started to hear about things that happened 10 to 15 years earlier — crimes that took place in Bosnia and Croatia involving the Serbian army and militias.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe YIHR conducts public seminars on war crimes, transitional justice, and authoritarianism in the Balkans. Despite the heavy subject matter, however, there is a light and optimistic atmosphere in their second-floor office. On a Friday evening, groups of people are still tapping away at laptops. On a back patio, others are laughing, smoking, and playing music. A small, black Labrador dog weaves its way through the desks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLately, activists from the group have taken to protesting events held in honor of war criminals. In 2017, Djuri\u0026#x107; and a group of other YIHR activists attended an event held in honor of Veselin Šljivan\u0026#x10D;anin, an army officer found guilty at The Hague for crimes against humanity. As the event began, Djuri\u0026#x107; and the others \u003ca href=\"https://balkaninsight.com/2017/01/18/protest-sparks-clash-at-serbian-ruling-party-event-01-18-2017/\"\u003eblew whistles\u003c/a\u003e and unfurled a banner in front of the crowd that read: “War Criminals Be Silent, So Victims Can Be Heard.” They were surrounded by people in the crowd, pummeled with fists and pushed out of the venue. Djuri\u0026#x107; and the others who protested were charged and convicted on a misdemeanor offense for interrupting the event.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the support offered to war criminals by the Serbian government seems totally alien to Americans, it shouldn’t. Elected officials in the United States today \u003ca href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/eddie-gallagher-case-house-republicans-call-on-navy-leadership-to-review-treatment-of-seal-being-held-on-war-crimes-charges\"\u003eopenly defend accused war criminals\u003c/a\u003e as part of a broader campaign of ultranationalist chest-beating and xenophobia. The constant drumbeat of warnings about demographic invasion is legitimizing racist attitudes that might have been seen as beyond the pale just a few decades ago, or even a few years ago. The parallels with how Serbian leaders psychologically primed their society for violence are unsettling. The manifestos left behind after every new shooting are the calling cards for a new era of violence — driven by a sense of demographic threat — that we are only starting to understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[23](%7B%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"shortcode\" data-shortcode=\"newsletter\" data-campaign=\"\" data-cta=\"\" data-headline=\"\" data-layout=\"\" data-subhead=\"\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[23] --\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Yugoslavia began to violently be carved into competing ethno-states, there remained many people, including Serbs, Croats, Muslims, and Slovenes, who refused to go along with the new sectarian reality. Some of them, in fact, continued to call themselves Yugoslavs: citizens of a multicultural society that would soon cease to exist. What many who remembered the time before the war will tell you is that they never imagined that such a thing could happen in their country. Yugoslavia was a modern country that, by most appearances, had left the past behind. In 1984, the city of Sarajevo was the home of the Winter Olympics. Less than a decade later, it was under the worst military siege Europe had witnessed since Stalingrad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the final years of Yugoslavia, when the system was beginning to crack, nationalist leaders kept insisting against all evidence that things would be better than ever, if the people would only let them push their rightwing agenda through. Even with a demagogic and incompetent leader, the United States is still likely more resilient than Yugoslavia was at any point in its history. But the xenophobia, hubris, and ignorance being loudly trumpeted in the United States strikes a familiar note to people like Djuri\u0026#x107;. It’s what happened to his society, after all, right before it collapsed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When you put so much effort into building a glorious narrative built on lies and half-truths, at some point you run out of new stories to feed it with,” Djuri\u0026#x107; said.

situation\u0026#8221;.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she accused activists of using the extradition bill to hide their real goal, which she claims is to \u0026#8220;destroy Hong

former British colony had been promised it would be able to elect its leader by universal suffrage by 2017 \u0026#8211; unlike the system of a \u0026#8220;nominating committee\u0026#8221; of 1,200, formed largely from Beijing elites.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProtests were sparked when in August 2014, Beijing passed a reform framework to stipulate universal suffrage as they wanted it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis would mean only two or three committee-vetted candidates who \u0026#8220;love the country\u0026#8221; would be able to run \u0026#8211; and proved the final straw

This trend shows the international community has turned a blind eye to the sanctions imposed on me,” Zarif said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We can present the country’s official points of view using different methods. This method could be one which is warmly welcomed inside the country, but which is abused by ill-wishers abroad more than it can serve the interests of Iranian people,” he added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because such a method is popular, many of our friends use it,” he noted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Also, there is another method which may not be welcomed in the country, but which could help you influence the viewpoints of the other party,” the foreign minister said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Although many people in the country criticized my way of holding talks, I tried to choose a method of dialogue outside the country that would be beneficial for realizing the country’s national interests,” he added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think what bothers conservative groups in the United States most is this very method of dialogue that I used. It prompted them to make threats first, and impose sanctions on me afterwards,” the top diplomat noted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe also touched on the reaction to the US move by diplomatic officials in different circles and in his private meetings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“First, when the Americans themselves announced it and said the president had ordered sanctions to be imposed on Zarif and that they would slap the sanctions by week’s end, but later, the came under so much pressure and stopped short of imposing sanctions,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mr Pompeo officially announced that Iran’s foreign minister comes here and easily talks to our reporters. He (Pompeo) does not realize that in the world of communications, I can even sit in my home and talk to American journalists, unless they want to violate the basic principles of their own country, and I believe the American community is unlikely to allow them to do so,” said Iran’s foreign minister.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And when I went to New York, US authorities came to me and said Mr Trump had invited me to the White House to have a meeting with him. At the same time, they said it was decided to put my name on the sanctions list in a matter of two weeks. Of course, they didn’t link these two subjects to each other that much,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My interpretation was that if I go talk to him, the minimum outcome would be that I wouldn’t be put on the sanctions list; however, our authorities do not approve of holding talks with American officials at a time when they do not pay much attention to the results of previous negotiations,” Zarif noted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course, if [Iranian officials] had ordered me to do so, I would have definitely done it despite the fact that such a meeting would incur much domestic pressure,” said the top diplomat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But such a move (meeting Trump) was against the policies of the Establishment and the country, and I wouldn’t deem it useful, either, given the circumstances as they had made threats along with giving an offer of talks,” he noted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIran’s Diplomacy Successful\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe foreign minister further weighed in on some individuals believing that the United States’ recent move amounts to the failure of diplomacy and the option of dialogue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Look at the reality in the world. Now, it is the US that has failed, and it is diplomacy that has won,” said the top diplomat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Our friends are of the opinion that the United States is the biggest adversary of our country and revolution, but they should see whether or not they were put under sanctions all those years when they chanted slogans against the US and opposed diplomacy. Did the US take any action against them? Was is because the US was scared of them that it did not slap sanctions on them?” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t like to blow my own horn, but the fact that no sanctions have been imposed on those shouting anti-US slogans shows Washington has no problems with them and what they do is not problematic for the US,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“[But] What we did created major problems for the United States,” he added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Diplomacy has been very successful not because of our extraordinary capabilities, but because our people were efficient,” said Zarif.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Our people laid the groundwork for us to stand up to 6 major powers and make the Americans feel they have suffered a blow and say this has been the worst deal in history …,” he noted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSanctions on Me Show I Had Not Been Pursuing US Policies\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe then touched upon reactions inside the country to the performance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as well as the Iranian state radio and TV’s way of covering relevant news.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Unfortunately, the programs produced at the state radio and TV are not aimed at reviewing foreign policy; rather, they are aimed at dealing a blow to it,” said Iran’s diplomacy chief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They must have thought that it would be in their best interests to portray it as a weak point of the Establishment when Iran’s foreign policy secures achievements in the world and when the Zionist regime [of Israel] regards me as a thorn in its eye,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is a lack of appreciation of national pride and dignity. If I were them, I would try to downplay the foreign minister’s errors, not to turn the Foreign Ministry’s accomplishments into errors and hunt the paper tiger every day and tell the people that you should know your foreign minister or diplomacy apparatus has fallen behind the world and retreated, and is not doing well in the world, and that it is others that are deceiving your Foreign Ministry,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All around the world they usually try to show that they are doing well, not to launch a smear campaign against their officials,” Zarif explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now, the whole world is saying that the Islamic Republic of Iran’s diplomacy has been successful; Mr. Trump himself says he has watched two minutes of the Iranian foreign minister’s interview and believes the US delegation won’t be able to handle talks with him,” he added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The same Mr. Trump who has said the US has spent $7 trillion in the region and still failed is saying that the JCPOA was a major deception for the US,” said Zarif.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We accept part of Trump’s comments, but regard the other part as untrue. Go see for yourself that the whole world is saying that Iran was successful with regards to the JCPOA,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know how long these folks are going to question the achievements of the country. If [as some people say] I had been pursuing the Americans’ line, then why did the US slap sanctions on me?” he asked rhetorically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How is it that none of them and none of those involved in negotiations before me was put under sanctions, and why was it only me that was put under sanctions?” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If [as some people say] I had been enforcing the United States’ orders, then why were they (those criticizing Zarif) not put under sanctions and why were sanctions imposed on me, only?” said Zarif.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe post \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ifpnews.com/fm-zarif-says-us-ban-wont-silence-him\"\u003eFM Zarif Says US Ban Won’t Silence Him\u003c/a\u003e appeared first on \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ifpnews.com\"\u003eIran Front Page\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://ifpnews.com/fm-zarif-says-us-ban-wont-silence-him","published":"2019-09-01T10:57:11Z","guid":"https://ifpnews.com/?p=150361"},{"title":"Streets of Iranian Village Named after Literary Masterpieces","content":"\u003cp\u003eThe Tajabad Sofla (Rasoolabad) village is located in the town of Bahar in Hamadan province.
