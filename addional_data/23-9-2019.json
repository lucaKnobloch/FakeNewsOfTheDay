Fidelity has become one of the first mainstream Wall Street brokerage and investing firms to offer cryptocurrency services. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOther participating funds include Stage 1 Ventures and Robot Ventures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eElementus is part of a new field known as blockchain analytics, a widely-misunderstood aspect of cryptocurrency and the blockchain technology underlying it. Early media coverage of Bitcoin, the first and most valuable cryptocurrency, often characterized the system as anonymous or private. But all Bitcoin transactions are in fact permanently recorded and \u003ca href=\"https://blockexplorer.com/\"\u003epublicly-viewable\u003c/a\u003e, and the same is true of many other systems and currencies inspired by Bitcoin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eUser funds on these blockchains are stored publicly as character strings similar to bank account numbers, with no real names attached. But the identity of the entity controlling an address can often be discovered through determined investigation, and suspicious activity on a blockchain can be identified by tracking transaction patterns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOne recent example of blockchain analytics in action was the flurry of investigations into \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/02/06/quadriga-cryptocurrency-exchange-gerald-cotten-death-frozen-funds/\"\u003eQuadrigaCX\u003c/a\u003e, a Canadian cryptocurrency exchange that collapsed early this year.

Despite the cooling of crypt-mania since its peak at the end of 2017, exchanges remain robust businesses. American exchange Coinbase, for example, had an estimated \u003ca href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-crypto-currencies-vc/big-corporates-back-crypto-plumbing-despite-currency-caution-idUKKCN1RU0KV\"\u003e$520 million in revenue\u003c/a\u003e in 2018, while the less-regulated global exchange Binance reaped an estimated \u003ca href=\"https://www.theblockcrypto.com/genesis/10491/analysis-binance-brought-in-446-million-in-profits-in-2018-despite-the-bear-market\"\u003e$446 million in profit\u003c/a\u003e the same year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eLaw enforcement agencies also frequently retain blockchain analytics firms for help investigating crimes such as ransomware attacks, which often involve ransom in cryptocurrency. Elementus cofounder Mike Kalomeni says Elementus is currently working with law enforcement clients, and hopes to expand to servicing government agencies and financial institutions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eA number of other firms compete in the blockchain analytics space, and several are further along than Elementus. They include Elliptic, which closed a \u003ca href=\"https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/38327/blockchain-analytics-firm-elliptic-raises-23m-series-b-to-fund-asia-expansion\"\u003e$23 million\u003c/a\u003e Series B funding round this month; CipherTrace, which closed \u003ca href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/galaxy-digital-backs-15-million-raise-for-crypto-analytics-firm-ciphertrace\"\u003e$15 million\u003c/a\u003e in new funding in February; and Chainalysis, which closed a \u003ca href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/blockchain-sleuthing-startup-chainalysis-raises-30-million-series-b\"\u003e$30 million\u003c/a\u003e Series B round, also in February. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eKalomeni claims that his company\u0026#8217;s technology, which uses machine learning, gives it an edge over the competition. “We came up with algorithms that let us know exactly the provenance of the funds, to an infinite number of [transaction] hops, automatically.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe involvement of Avon Ventures in funding Elementus is notable thanks to its links (albeit indirect) to Fidelity Investments, which has taken a leading role in expanding cryptocurrency services. In October 2018, Fidelity created a new entity, \u003ca href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/15/fidelity-launches-trade-execution-and-custody-for-cryptocurrencies.html\"\u003eFidelity Digital Assets\u003c/a\u003e, to offer cryptocurrency trading and custody services to large customers, making it the first Wall Street incumbent to do so.

In February, those anxieties were brought to a head when cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase acquired blockchain analytics firm Neutrino. The company’s executives had previously run a firm implicated in the \u003ca href=\"https://breakermag.com/coinbases-newest-team-members-helped-authoritarians-worldwide-monitor-journalists-and-dissidents/\"\u003etracking, targeting, and harassment\u003c/a\u003e of journalists and pro-democracy activists on behalf of authoritarian regimes.

Although Silicon Valley’s notoriously\n“founder-friendly,” my question has always been: Is it naive to think that the\nsame person can continue to lead the company as it enters each new growth\nstage?

It\u0026#8217;s the \u0026#8220;repo market,\u0026#8221; comprising the short-term funding that banks and financial counter-parties regularly tap to lend each other trillions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#8217;s suddenly in the news again, and for all the wrong reasons. The repo market is looking a lot like it did on the precipice of the 2007 housing market crash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what is the repo market, anyway, and why has the Federal Reserve Bank this week injected hundreds of billions of dollars into the financial system to stabilize it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRepos (short for repurchase agreements) are short-term borrowing transactions, often made overnight. Think of them as trades of cash for some kind of collateral.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a repo transaction, the borrower will sell certain securities in their possession with the agreement to buy them back the next day. If the transaction is not rolled over, then the trade has to be settled the following day, with the borrower repurchasing the collateral from the lender for slightly more than it had previously sold it for, compensating the lender with interest for taking on the risk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eA $1 trillion market springs a leak \u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eLarge corporations and banks typically hold vast quantities of highly liquid financial assets, and so they like using these markets as a means of quick and easy financing. In fact, there are more than $1 trillion worth of overnight repo transactions collateralized with US government debt occurring every day. Banks frequently go to these markets to fund the loans they issue, and to finance the trades they execute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s when it’s working smoothly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe repo market seized up last week, with median repurchase rates skyrocketing from their usual band of 2.00-2.25% to 2.46% on Monday, and 5.25% on Tuesday. Keep in mind, that’s the median rate. Some repo rates were as high as 9%, more than quadruple the Federal Reserve’s own target rate, which usually puts a cap on how high Treasury repo rates could climb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn unlucky confluence of events, including an exceptionally large demand for cash from U.S. companies that needed to pay their corporate tax bills, sucked a lot of the available cash out of the financial markets. What happened last week was any counter-party in need of cash, and only holding collateral like Treasuries, agreed to pay the much higher going repo rates. That’s supply and demand, plain and simple, and it mirrors what happened in certain repo markets in 2007 before the housing crash and the Great Recession that followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, what happened to the usual abundance of cash and liquid securities that powers the trillion-dollar repo market?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s been slowly evaporating, actually, for some time, since the Fed ended five years ago the policy of quantitative easing (QE), its maneuver to buy highly liquid bank securities to boost overall bank reserves. The thinking (and hope) of that controversial policy was that the increased liquidity would encourage banks to lend more and spur economic growth at the depths of the downturn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose kind of accommodative actions have been over for some time now, and total bank reserves have steadily been decreasing. They peaked in August, 2014, and are now close to where reserves were in 2011. One principle reason for that: an elevated level of government debt issuances in the past four years have sucked reserves out of the financial system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen a squeeze like the one last week occurs it’s a clear indicator that there aren’t enough reserves in the financial system for repo markets to clear at the Fed’s preferred level—in central bank parlance, the “target rate,” or the Fed Funds rate. That explains why the central bank has been engaged in open market operations to inject reserves back into the banking system through overnight purchases of Treasuries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Fed plans to use open market operations to address funding pressures through the quarter-end, and learn more about the adequate level of reserves. We expect it to find the U.S. funding markets in a state of reserve scarcity,” wrote \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/fortune500/bank-of-america-corp-26/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBank of America\u003c/a\u003e economists in a September 20 note.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eThe repo plan: more interventions to come  \u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eEven though the Fed has routinely used open market operations in the past to stabilize these funding markets, it doesn’t look like a few routine interventions will be sufficient. Moreover, it\u0026#8217;s becoming clear banks need more reserves on hand. On Friday, the Fed pledged to allow roughly two more weeks of overnight repo transactions, each injecting around $75 billion daily into the economy, the Federal Reserve \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/fortune500/bank-of-new-york-mellon-corp-179/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBank of New York\u003c/a\u003e said in \u003ca href=\"https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/opolicy/operating_policy_190920\"\u003ea news release on Friday\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePut otherwise, the Fed is back where it was roughly a decade ago, effectively buying U.S. Treasuries from banks on an indefinite basis. But the difference this time? There’s no financial crisis in sight, just the uncomfortable fact that private capital markets once again need public support.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For all intents and purposes, this will be equivalent to QE, with scheduled purchases of securities.

Among the concerns they voiced: Neumann’s controversial style and control of the company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eRarely has so much gone so wrong so fast for a young company in the spotlight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s Uber-scale mess,” said Kellie McElhaney, a professor at the University of California Berkeley’s Haas School of Business, who blames both the board and Neumann for not learning from that company’s earlier mistakes. “He’s really taken a first-mover advantage that WeWork had in the space and blown it in a big way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe WeWork story is beginning to fit squarely into the era of unicorn capitalism: A young and charismatic entrepreneur disrupts an industry, runs afoul of elders and investors, sometimes winning but sometimes failing to live up to their own hype.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions including Benchmark Capital, one of WeWork’s investors, pushed out Uber Technologies’ Travis Kalanick before the ride-hailing company went public.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eStill, even if some directors want to oust Neumann, it won’t be easy given the company’s governance structure. Based on the number of shares he controls and their unique super-voting rights, Neumann has the power to get rid of the entire board on his own, according to the prospectus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSoftbank’s intervention in the WeWork saga comes as the biggest backers of the company’s gargantuan Vision Fund are reconsidering how much to commit to its next investment vehicle. Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, which contributed $45 billion to the $100 billion Vision Fund, is now only planning to reinvest profits from that vehicle into its successor, people familiar said last week. Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Investment Co., which invested $15 billion, is considering paring its future commitment to below $10 billion, the people said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eWeek of Uncertainty\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe news of Neumann’s potential ouster comes after a whirlwind week of uncertainty for WeWork.

As the team waited on the field to accept their trophy, a chant erupted in the stands. In the din of the stadium, teammates Christen Press and Alex Morgan recall, the champs couldn’t make out the words. It wasn’t until the players rode their victory float through New York City a few days later that they heard the same chant and understood what the crowds were yelling: “Equal pay! Equal pay!” “I actually cried,” Press, who plays striker, tells \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e. “I was so taken aback.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe chants weren’t the only thing that had changed since the last time the team earned a ticker-tape reception, after the 2015 cup. Back then, the team had not yet sued their employer, the U.S. Soccer Federation, for allegedly violating equal pay and civil rights laws. (They filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 2016 and filed suit in a California court this March.) The cultural context had also shifted profoundly. The 2017 women’s marches broke American records for the largest protests, catalyzing a freshly urgent societal conversation around gender equity, women’s rights, and sexual harassment. “This time around, we just understood so much more that we’re a part of this greater movement,” says Megan Rapinoe, the team’s cocaptain and forward. “Coming home the first couple of days, I was like, ‘Oh, this is so much bigger than I even thought.’ ”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt has been 47 years since Title IX became U.S. law, prohibiting gender discrimination in schools and requiring sports programs for girls to be equivalent to those for boys. But women’s professional sports are still generations behind men’s, with fewer teams and generally smaller audiences. Pay equity is rare—and virtually nonexistent in team sports like soccer and basketball. Now the field is experiencing a reckoning, as athletes speak up for gender equality—and the women’s soccer team, whose dominance has given them the world’s ear, are leading the charge (and earning a special spot on our annual list).\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SOC-PullQuote1.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2700083\" srcset=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SOC-PullQuote1.jpg 2880w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SOC-PullQuote1.jpg?resize=150,45 150w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SOC-PullQuote1.jpg?resize=300,91 300w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SOC-PullQuote1.jpg?resize=768,232 768w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SOC-PullQuote1.jpg?resize=1024,310 1024w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SOC-PullQuote1.jpg?resize=281,85 281w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SOC-PullQuote1.jpg?resize=906,274 906w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SOC-PullQuote1.jpg?resize=100,30 100w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SOC-PullQuote1.jpg?resize=60,18 60w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SOC-PullQuote1.jpg?resize=154,47 154w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SOC-PullQuote1.jpg?resize=701,212 701w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SOC-PullQuote1.jpg?resize=392,119 392w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SOC-PullQuote1.jpg?resize=252,76 252w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SOC-PullQuote1.jpg?resize=697,211 697w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SOC-PullQuote1.jpg?resize=234,71 234w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SOC-PullQuote1.jpg?resize=500,151 500w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SOC-PullQuote1.jpg?resize=578,175 578w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SOC-PullQuote1.jpg?resize=600,181 600w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SOC-PullQuote1.jpg?resize=90,27 90w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SOC-PullQuote1.jpg?resize=110,33 110w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SOC-PullQuote1.jpg?resize=223,67 223w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SOC-PullQuote1.jpg?resize=115,35 115w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SOC-PullQuote1.jpg?resize=1007,305 1007w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SOC-PullQuote1.jpg?resize=892,270 892w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2880px) 100vw, 2880px\" /\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe sports uprising is akin to the one the entertainment industry has confronted in the wake of #MeToo, as female actors who came forward about sexual assault began also campaigning for equal pay and better representation in front of and behind the camera. “There’s a moment in women’s sports, there’s momentum around our league, and there’s this movement around women’s empowerment,” says Cathy Engelbert, the former CEO of Deloitte and new commissioner of the WNBA. The convergence underscores why Time’s Up, the Hollywood-based organization created around #MeToo, partnered with the women’s soccer team this summer on a fundraising initiative aimed at helping all women close the wage gap. “We can sort of see ourselves in that,” Rapinoe says of Time’s Up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe lawsuit against USSF is the first known instance of a professional sports team suing its employer for gender discrimination. U.S. soccer is unusual in that the same organization employs both men’s and women’s teams—which makes it easier, as a legal matter, to demonstrate unequal treatment. The women’s on-field success and popularity, meanwhile, have made their case more viable by giving it an economic underpinning. Since 2015, they argue, they have outperformed the men financially: For example, USSF projected that the women’s team would generate a $5\u0026nbsp;million profit in fiscal 2017, while the men would lose $1\u0026nbsp;million. Still, the USSF’s pay structure awards substantially greater compensation to the men. In 2014, the last time the men’s team was in the World Cup, they were eliminated in the round of 16, but thanks to various bonuses, they allegedly received roughly triple what the women got for winning it all in 2015. (USSF has denied that it discriminates, saying in a court filing that because the men and women compete “in vastly different spheres” internationally, “no comparison can be made between their respective performance and compensation.”) “It seems like [the lawsuit] was a step that this team was always destined to make,” says cocaptain Morgan, who plays forward. Adds Press: “The most important thing we could do to change the world and make the world a better place is winning.”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAlready, the female soccer players have tangibly influenced other sports—inspiring other women to ask for better pay, even when equal pay is a long shot. This year, the World Surf League began awarding equal prize purses to men and women. In hockey, hundreds of women are currently refusing to play in North American pro leagues, demanding better compensation and playing standards. Kendall Coyne Schofield, who plays forward on the U.S. women’s national ice hockey team, consulted with women’s soccer players before deciding to boycott the 2017 hockey world championships amid a compensation dispute. “We looked at them and said, ‘If they can do it, we can do it,’ ” Coyne Schofield recalls.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt the WNBA, where the league is in the midst of negotiating a new contract with players, Engelbert says she’s committed to improving female players’ compensation and travel arrangements, though she cautions that “the economics of this league need to improve to support the players more.” Ultimately, she thinks elevating women’s sports will have benefits beyond just the game—by expanding opportunities for corporate sponsorship dollars (less than 5% of which goes to women’s sports today) as well as by inspiring women to achieve and lead.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBillie Jean King, the tennis legend whose advocacy helped bring equal pay to her sport decades ago, understands that dynamic. After she defeated male star Bobby Riggs in the famed “Battle of the Sexes” match in 1973, King says, she heard from women who felt compelled to ask their bosses for a raise the next day. “Sports is a platform for change,” she tells \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e. “We can help this drive toward equality.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eA version of this article appears in the October 2019 issue of Fortune as part of the\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/most-powerful-women/2019\"\u003eMost Powerful Women\u003c/a\u003e\u0026nbsp;package with the headline \u0026#8220;No. 51: Bonus Pick!

Since it debuted in 2016, the show—a science fiction story set in small-town Indiana in the early 1980s, featuring a psychokinetic tween girl, top-secret government experiments, and a portal to another dimension—has become a cultural phenomenon. To promote season three, the global streaming giant partnered with everyone from Burger King (which debuted an “Upside Down” Whopper) to Coca-Cola (which gamely revived its failed ’80s New Coke for limited release) to Nike (which rolled out a retro-style “Hawkins High” line of sneakers and apparel).

Netflix revealed that it had lost subscribers in the U.S. for the first time in eight years—with some 120,000 American viewers abandoning the service. Slower-than-expected growth outside the U.S. also hurt: Overall, Netflix added 2.7 million subscribers in the quarter, but that was well below its target of 5 million. According to Netflix, a weaker content slate was partly to blame for the tepid results.

Netflix subscribers in the U.S., for instance, pay anywhere from $8.99 to $15.99 per month to access its offerings of shows and movies. (In some foreign markets, like India and Malaysia, Netflix is experimenting with much lower price points that give access to mobile-only content.) Disney Plus, which launches in November with content from Marvel, Lucasfilm, and Pixar, will cost $6.99 per month.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Netflix already has formidable competition in the form of Amazon and Hulu. Amazon has more than 100 million subscribers to its Prime service, which includes video, and it has had some hits with its original programs, such as the \u003cem\u003eThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\u003c/em\u003e. And Hulu, which lowered its basic-level pricing from $7.99 to $5.99 earlier this year, now has more than 26 million paid subscribers. According to fresh numbers from research firm eMarketer, Netflix has 87% penetration of the video-streaming market in the U.S., compared with roughly 53% for Amazon Prime and 41.5% for Hulu.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image is-resized\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET10.19Strangerthings1.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"NET10.19Strangerthings1\" class=\"wp-image-2701866\" width=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET10.19Strangerthings1.jpg 2880w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET10.19Strangerthings1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET10.19Strangerthings1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET10.19Strangerthings1.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET10.19Strangerthings1.jpg?resize=1024,683 1024w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET10.19Strangerthings1.jpg?resize=281,187 281w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET10.19Strangerthings1.jpg?resize=755,503 755w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET10.19Strangerthings1.jpg?resize=100,67 100w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET10.19Strangerthings1.jpg?resize=60,40 60w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET10.19Strangerthings1.jpg?resize=154,103 154w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET10.19Strangerthings1.jpg?resize=591,394 591w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET10.19Strangerthings1.jpg?resize=392,261 392w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET10.19Strangerthings1.jpg?resize=252,168 252w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET10.19Strangerthings1.jpg?resize=697,465 697w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET10.19Strangerthings1.jpg?resize=234,156 234w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET10.19Strangerthings1.jpg?resize=500,333 500w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET10.19Strangerthings1.jpg?resize=578,385 578w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET10.19Strangerthings1.jpg?resize=600,400 600w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET10.19Strangerthings1.jpg?resize=90,60 90w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET10.19Strangerthings1.jpg?resize=185,123 185w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET10.19Strangerthings1.jpg?resize=115,77 115w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET10.19Strangerthings1.jpg?resize=738,492 738w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET10.19Strangerthings1.jpg?resize=777,518 777w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2880px) 100vw, 2880px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Stranger Things \u003c/em\u003ecast on set filming episode 3 of Season 3 (L to R) Finn Wolfhard, Caleb McLaughlin, Noah Schnapp.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"image-credit\"\u003eCourtesy of Netflix\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo while Netflix remains the streaming king, it will have to fight harder than ever to defend its crown. And the dynamics of the competition are shifting dramatically. Netflix’s meteoric rise over the past two decades, from DVD-by-mail service to entertainment powerhouse, has been fueled primarily by cutting-edge technology. From the cloud infrastructure that enabled its seamless streaming service to the data-driven personalization engines making educated guesses at what viewers wanted to watch, the company has been a step ahead. Even though Netflix believes its tech prowess will continue to give it a competitive advantage, its top executives concede that its rivals are narrowing the technology gap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo win in the new era of streaming, Netflix must become as good at producing original content as it has always been at delivering it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“While we certainly have our roots in tech, Netflix today is an entertainment company,” says Ted Sarandos, Netflix’s longtime chief content officer. The new key to growth, according to the company, is an expanding roster of must-see shows and movies that get an increasingly global audience to not only sign up for Netflix but also stay subscribed. “Our challenge every day is making a show you can’t live without, and that show is different for every person,” says Sarandos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image is-resized\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET-PullQuote1.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2700077\" width=\"650\" srcset=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET-PullQuote1.jpg 2880w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET-PullQuote1.jpg?resize=150,38 150w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET-PullQuote1.jpg?resize=300,77 300w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET-PullQuote1.jpg?resize=768,197 768w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET-PullQuote1.jpg?resize=1024,262 1024w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET-PullQuote1.jpg?resize=281,72 281w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET-PullQuote1.jpg?resize=906,232 906w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET-PullQuote1.jpg?resize=100,26 100w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET-PullQuote1.jpg?resize=60,15 60w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET-PullQuote1.jpg?resize=154,39 154w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET-PullQuote1.jpg?resize=701,179 701w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET-PullQuote1.jpg?resize=392,100 392w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET-PullQuote1.jpg?resize=252,64 252w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET-PullQuote1.jpg?resize=697,178 697w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET-PullQuote1.jpg?resize=234,60 234w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET-PullQuote1.jpg?resize=500,128 500w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET-PullQuote1.jpg?resize=578,148 578w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET-PullQuote1.jpg?resize=600,154 600w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET-PullQuote1.jpg?resize=90,23 90w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET-PullQuote1.jpg?resize=110,28 110w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET-PullQuote1.jpg?resize=223,57 223w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET-PullQuote1.jpg?resize=115,29 115w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET-PullQuote1.jpg?resize=1007,258 1007w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET-PullQuote1.jpg?resize=892,228 892w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2880px) 100vw, 2880px\" /\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNetflix says it has been preparing for this moment for years. And the proof is the enormous spending spree on which the company has embarked in recent years to produce everything from the hit prison-drama series \u003cem\u003eOrange Is the New Black\u003c/em\u003e to the Oscar-winning film \u003cem\u003eRoma\u003c/em\u003e—and gobs of niche content in between. In 2018, the company invested some $12 billion to produce 700 new, original programs in every conceivable category—scripted, unscripted, documentaries, stand-up comedy specials, animation. And analysts expect Netflix’s content budget to rise to $15 billion this year. To help finance all that programming, \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/07/18/netflix-investors-debt/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Netflix has borrowed a lot of money (opens in a new tab)\"\u003eNetflix has borrowed a lot of money\u003c/a\u003e: It currently holds $12.6 billion in long-term debt on its books, up from $6.5 billion at the end of 2017.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe gusher of new content, Netflix believes, will provide benefits and draw subscribers well into the future. But its success hinges on launching shows that resonate with viewers. While Netflix’s algorithms may be able to predict the loyalty of a subscriber with uncanny accuracy based on how long she takes to finish watching a series, predicting whether a script will become the next \u003cem\u003eStranger Things\u003c/em\u003e is less scientific. “There are some things you can’t necessarily model out with great precision,” says Sarandos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo address this new challenge, Netflix has assembled a team of veteran content developers who bear little resemblance to the typical\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eC-suite crew sitting around a Silicon Valley conference room. Most of them have joined Netflix just in the past few years and were poached from the traditional Hollywood ecosystem. They present a diverse range of ethnicities, races, and sexual orientations—an approach that reflects Netflix’s strategy of continuing to build its user base by connecting with audience segments across geographies and categories. Several of the senior members of the team also happen to be women. As Netflix enters the streaming wars, they’re the ones leading the charge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image is-resized\"\u003e\u003cimg

a women-only coworking space above a Sprouts grocery store to celebrate the third season of \u003cem\u003eGLOW\u003c/em\u003e, a popular Netflix show about female wrestlers. The inside of the space looks like a slightly more adult version of a teenage girl’s dream bedroom: There are plush, pale-green sofas, peach-hued chairs, and wall-to-wall shelves neatly filled with color-coordinated books. The attendees, almost entirely women, mill about sipping complimentary wine. The show’s leading actors (all women) and its creators (also women) are on hand for the screening. Over by registration, someone is handing out hot-pink fanny packs, a throwback to the 1980s era in which \u003cem\u003eGLOW\u003c/em\u003e, which stands for Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling, takes place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“I couldn’t think of a better place to hold this event,” says Cindy Holland, Netflix’s vice president of original content, addressing the crowd as they take their seats. Shortly after she speaks, the lights dim, and the first episode of the new season of \u003cem\u003eGLOW\u003c/em\u003e pops up on a large screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHolland is no-frills, in both ensemble and personality. Dressed in her signature dark jacket and pants, the self-described introvert doesn’t seek the spotlight, however visible her role has become. Holland joined Netflix in 2002, at a time when the company was still known for its signature red envelopes, not shows like\u003cem\u003e GLOW\u003c/em\u003e. The DVD-by-mail business was launched in 1997, the brainchild of current CEO Reed Hastings and his cofounder, former CEO Marc Randolph. Back then, ­Sarandos and Holland’s task was to find and license programs for DVD distribution, and they did it with a lean team of transplants from tech and entertainment circles. (Today, Netflix’s content department employs some 400 people worldwide.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET10.19.Monarca.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"NET10.19.Monarca\" class=\"wp-image-2701863\" srcset=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET10.19.Monarca.jpg 2880w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET10.19.Monarca.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET10.19.Monarca.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET10.19.Monarca.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET10.19.Monarca.jpg?resize=1024,684 1024w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET10.19.Monarca.jpg?resize=281,188 281w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET10.19.Monarca.jpg?resize=753,503 753w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET10.19.Monarca.jpg?resize=100,67 100w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET10.19.Monarca.jpg?resize=60,40 60w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET10.19.Monarca.jpg?resize=154,103 154w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET10.19.Monarca.jpg?resize=590,394 590w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET10.19.Monarca.jpg?resize=392,262 392w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET10.19.Monarca.jpg?resize=252,168 252w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET10.19.Monarca.jpg?resize=697,465 697w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET10.19.Monarca.jpg?resize=234,156 234w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET10.19.Monarca.jpg?resize=500,333 500w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET10.19.Monarca.jpg?resize=578,385 578w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET10.19.Monarca.jpg?resize=600,401 600w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET10.19.Monarca.jpg?resize=90,60 90w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET10.19.Monarca.jpg?resize=184,123 184w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET10.19.Monarca.jpg?resize=115,77 115w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET10.19.Monarca.jpg?resize=737,492 737w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET10.19.Monarca.jpg?resize=776,518 776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2880px) 100vw, 2880px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eWORKING WITHOUT A NET: Actor Alison Brie (left) prepares to do a stunt on the set of the series GLOW.

Eventually, the traditional Hollywood players who had created all of those must-see programs and movies would want to keep them for themselves. “Pretty soon, you could see a world where it would cost us just as much to license a show as it would to make one for ourselves,” says Holland. Netflix didn’t want to wait until it \u003cem\u003ehad to\u003c/em\u003e create its own content.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe catalyst for jumping into original content came in February 2011, when the producers of \u003cem\u003eHouse of Cards\u003c/em\u003e, a British-made political thriller, came to Netflix with an interesting proposition: buying the rights to make an original version of the popular series for an American audience. Netflix quickly bit on the opportunity. The bet paid off. Netflix’s \u003cem\u003eHouse of Cards\u003c/em\u003e, starring Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright as ruthless Washington opportunists, was a streaming sensation. (Spacey eventually left the show after allegations of past sexual misconduct.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“They saw it coming,” says Matt DelPiano, a longtime talent agent with Hollywood firm Creative Artists Agency, who was involved with inking the deal for \u003cem\u003eHouse of Cards\u003c/em\u003e.

Launched in 2016, \u003cem\u003eThe OA\u003c/em\u003e is a supernatural drama about a missing blind woman who returns to her suburban Michigan family with her vision inexplicably restored. The series was expensive to shoot and its audience relatively tiny. For a broadcast network, cancellation would be a no-brainer. But the show’s ardent fans were incensed. They put up billboards and organized flash mobs in Times Square. They started a Change.org campaign to save the series, gathering 80,000 signatures. Some protested outside Netflix’s offices in Hollywood and New York. And one hard-core devotee, an unemployed TV writer named Emperial Young, went on a hunger strike, saying she needed \u003cem\u003eThe OA\u003c/em\u003e more than she needed food.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNetflix canceled the show anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe episode illustrates two things about Netflix’s evolving operating model: First, niche appeal is still good—just not too niche. Second, Netflix is learning to operate a bit more like a traditional Hollywood studio.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBecause Netflix isn’t dependent on advertising dollars and because it has so much data at its fingertips, it can micro-­segment audiences to create programs for a wide variety of different so-called taste clusters. As a result, the company has built a reputation among artists and viewers as a haven for obscure, narrow-cast content. “We’re not so focused on what is the best thing to put on Tuesday at 8 o’clock,” says Holland.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSuccess is measured in viewership numbers proportional to the cost of production. A low-budget show that secures a loyal tranche of niche viewers may have high relative value; an expensive show that fails to catch on with a wider audience doesn’t add up. To be sure, Netflix wants as much viewership as possible. And it wants to wow critics and land awards. But for every \u003cem\u003eStranger Things\u003c/em\u003e, there are probably a dozen other programs that don’t garner large audiences or big headlines but still generate significant return on investment. But not \u003cem\u003eThe OA\u003c/em\u003e.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNetflix has always been a data-driven company. It’s not a hand-holding culture. That has always been true on the product side—the engineers, designers, and developers who work behind the scenes—and it’s true today on the content side. “Talent for hire”—like writers, directors, and actors—appreciate the freedom and the speed at which Netflix moves. From the very beginning, with \u003cem\u003eHouse of Cards\u003c/em\u003e, the company shocked the industry by snapping up entire seasons rather than just commissioning a pilot—the long-standing process by which Hollywood develops programs. And once a show is in development, there are typically no “network notes,” the copious feedback provided by television executives, to cater to.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image is-resized\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET1019.-Holland-Lisa.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"NET1019.

Showrunners grumble that executive shuffles at the company make it tough to hold on to an internal champion. There are so many projects in the works that it’s hard to stand out—and to get a decent budget. Contrary to its free-spending image, Netflix has a reputation in the industry as a frugal boss, at least on a day-to-day basis. “They’re always trying to save money and looking at the cheapest way to do things, even when that isn’t best for the long term. It’s a very ‘startup-y’ place,” says one TV writer currently working on a Netflix series who did not want to be named.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s another kind of stinginess at the company that has come under fire by many in the industry—Netflix’s reluctance to share its data. The company has a treasure trove of numbers that Nielsen, the ratings provider, would kill for. And yet it has historically kept this information hidden from the very people it commissioned to create content for its platform. That is a habit the company will likely need to kick, especially as competing platforms vie for the same talent.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“You think they’re not gonna tell Martin Scorsese how many people watched his ­movie?” says DelPiano, the former talent agent. The legendary director’s upcoming film, \u003cem\u003eThe Irishman\u003c/em\u003e, with a reported budget north of $150 million, launches on Netflix this November.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWorking with a name-brand director like Scorsese not only has marketing value for Netflix but also helps address one of the content team’s central priorities: “How do we make sure that we are continuously producing the most exciting and compelling stories and also ensuring that as a creative environment, we are the place that filmmakers want to come to do the best work of their lives?” says Lisa Nishimura, VP of independent film and documentary features at Netflix. She contends that emphasizing Netflix’s belief in art—not its tech prowess—is key in wooing creators.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNishimura joined Netflix in 2007, a relatively early hire who was brought on board to help build out the company’s library of licensed documentaries. In more recent years, she has spearheaded the company’s move to original “docuseries,” like \u003cem\u003eMaking a Murderer\u003c/em\u003e, and comedy programming, like Dave Chappelle’s stand-up specials.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNetflix’s strategy to court directors and writers is rooted in pragmatism. The explosion of competing streaming services means that writers, actors, and the like are in high demand—and in this new arms race for content, attracting talent is key. Paying them well and offering the right incentives and opportunities, is a must. But so is appealing to their sense of imagination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image is-resized\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MPW-RedLine-copy.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2700131\" width=\"650\" srcset=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MPW-RedLine-copy.jpg 2808w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MPW-RedLine-copy.jpg?resize=150,3 150w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MPW-RedLine-copy.jpg?resize=300,6 300w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MPW-RedLine-copy.jpg?resize=768,16 768w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MPW-RedLine-copy.jpg?resize=1024,22 1024w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MPW-RedLine-copy.jpg?resize=281,6 281w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MPW-RedLine-copy.jpg?resize=906,19 906w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MPW-RedLine-copy.jpg?resize=100,2 100w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MPW-RedLine-copy.jpg?resize=60,1 60w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MPW-RedLine-copy.jpg?resize=154,3 154w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MPW-RedLine-copy.jpg?resize=701,15 701w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MPW-RedLine-copy.jpg?resize=392,8 392w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MPW-RedLine-copy.jpg?resize=252,5 252w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MPW-RedLine-copy.jpg?resize=697,15 697w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MPW-RedLine-copy.jpg?resize=234,5 234w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MPW-RedLine-copy.jpg?resize=500,11 500w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MPW-RedLine-copy.jpg?resize=578,12 578w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MPW-RedLine-copy.jpg?resize=600,13 600w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MPW-RedLine-copy.jpg?resize=90,2 90w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MPW-RedLine-copy.jpg?resize=110,2 110w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MPW-RedLine-copy.jpg?resize=223,5 223w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MPW-RedLine-copy.jpg?resize=115,2 115w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MPW-RedLine-copy.jpg?resize=1007,22 1007w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MPW-RedLine-copy.jpg?resize=892,19 892w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2808px) 100vw, 2808px\" /\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eNow Playing: The Streaming Wars\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNetflix is the biggest name in streaming.

The diminutive star gushes when speaking about \u003cem\u003eMonarca\u003c/em\u003e.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWearing a crimson satin top that matches her lipstick underneath a mint green suit, her dark hair perfectly parted, Hayek doesn’t look like she just stepped off a plane. “We did it completely in Mexico and completely in Spanish,” says Hayek. “This show will be seen in more than 190 countries around the world. Everyone can relate to power or corruption or family drama or dealing with sexuality or parenthood.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIndeed, Netflix says its strategy isn’t to “Americanize” content for a global audience. Rather, it is trying to develop programming that appeals to particular regions, some of which will also appeal to a broader market because the stories tap into universal themes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“We are obviously a global platform, and every show will launch everywhere, right at the same time,” says Bela Bajaria, head of Netflix’s non–English language original programming. “But when we go into a country, it really is about the storytelling—a creator with a vision from that country.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBajaria, the former head of Universal Television, came to Netflix three years ago. The longtime entertainment industry exec is of Indian descent, was born in London, lived in Zambia, and moved to the U.S. at age 9. She says Netflix’s goal is to appeal to an increasingly global audience with an increasingly global slate. And the key to doing that is to have people on the ground in entertainment hubs around the world—not just in Hollywood. Netflix now has production hubs in London, Madrid, and Toronto and content teams on the ground in numerous other markets, including Mexico.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image is-resized\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NET1019.3-ladies..jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"NET1019.

A majority of Netflix’s user base now lies outside the U.S., and the vast majority of its growth today comes from foreign markets. While the company has all-but-saturated the U.S. market, its increasingly global footprint gives it room to grow. It also presents a sandbox that allows it to experiment in ways that aren’t possible when catering just to U.S. viewers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eExhibit A: On Sept. 20, Netflix debuted a crime drama called \u003cem\u003eCriminal\u003c/em\u003e that it launched in four different versions, each tailored for a specific country—France, Spain, Germany, and the U.K. The show isn’t just the same script in different languages. It is actually the same concept (three episodes, each consisting of an hour-long police interrogation) but with different, local actors and culture-specific scenarios. All four versions are available in all Netflix markets. That means a viewer in the U.K. can click on the French version—and maybe even like it better than the British one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe model, if it works, is an attractive one for Netflix. Because most U.S.-based television networks don’t have robust distribution channels in other countries, they have to license their content to existing networks in other regions. But Netflix controls a global pipeline to more than 190 countries—and, increasingly, to its own slate of programming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“If they can create content and globalize it, that makes for much better scale economics,” says Mark Mahaney, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets, who is bullish on Netflix’s prospects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, scaling content globally requires not just bridging cultural gaps but also getting the language right. And that isn’t always as straightforward as it might seem. In show biz, “subs and dubs” stands for subtitles and dubbing, the two methods by which dialogue is translated for global audiences. Netflix offers both for its users—every program it airs on its platform is simultaneously available dubbed into 10 languages and in more than 20 with subtitles. In much of the non-U.S. world, dubbing is preferred. But it is an art form that is hard to perfect—and very, very hard to scale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNetflix says it has a “content operations” team looking for innovative ways to address the subs-and-dubs challenge. But whatever it come up with is unlikely to be a whizbang solution cooked up by engineers. “There’s no easy technology fix for it,” says Bajaria. Like much of what Netflix is doing these days, it’s more art than science.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eA version of this article appears in the \u003ca href=\"https://www.magazine.store/fortune/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"October 2019 issue (opens in a new tab)\"\u003eOctober 2019 issue\u003c/a\u003e of Fortune as part of the\u0026nbsp;\u003ca rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://fortune.com/most-powerful-women/2019\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMost Powerful Women\u003c/a\u003e\u0026nbsp;package with the headline \u0026#8220;Once Upon a Time at Netflix.\u0026#8221;\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eMore must-read stories from \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—\u003ca rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://fortune.com/most-powerful-women/2019\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMost Powerful Women 2019\u003c/a\u003e: See who made the list\u003cbr\u003e—\u003ca rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"The world champions (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/09/23/us-womens-soccer-equal-pay/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe world champions\u003c/a\u003e of women\u0026#8217;s soccer—and equal pay\u003ca aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://fortune.com/longform/women-netflix-streaming-wars\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e—Keep these 10 \u003ca rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/09/23/mpw-2019-on-our-radar\" target=\"_blank\"\u003epowerful women on your radar\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e—\u003ca rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/09/16/pepsico-indra-nooyi-mpw-international/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFormer PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi\u003c/a\u003e aims to create a “sisterhood” of women leaders\u003cbr\u003e—\u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/longform/banking-finance-women-ceos-wall-street/\"\u003eWall Street has never had a woman CEO\u003c/a\u003e.

Krawcheck, then all of 37 years old, was chairman and chief executive officer of Sanford C. Bernstein, a prestigious institutional money management firm known for its no-nonsense equity research. At a time when “research” at the big Wall Street houses was too often suspect—compromised by the desire to please the firms’ lucrative investment banking clients—the dense, sparsely illustrated Bernstein reports had a reputation for fierce independence, if not purity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eKrawcheck, for her part, appeared to radiate both qualities. Whip smart, candid, and rigorous, she was by all accounts a natural leader. And after \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e put her on its cover—under the headline “\u003ca href=\"https://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2002/06/10/324541/index.htm\"\u003eIn Search of the Last Honest Analyst\u003c/a\u003e”—she began a steep ascent that seemed like it could land her in the corner office of a major bank. First, Citigroup CEO Sandy Weill hired her to run its SmithBarney unit. In 2004, Krawcheck became Citigroup’s CFO; then she was named the CEO of Citi’s Global Wealth Management.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThen, in 2008, she was out—abruptly fired after a high-profile disagreement with the parent bank’s new CEO. Krawcheck landed another top-tier job at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, but she lasted just two years in that role.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eKrawcheck’s flameout generated countless pages of commentary about Wall Street’s inhospitality to women. But the truly telling fact is this: In the ensuing decade, only a very few women in finance have come as close to the seat of power as she did. Unlike virtually every other industry, the biggest U.S. banks have never had a woman as CEO—and as \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e senior editor Claire Zillman details in her \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/longform/banking-finance-women-ceos-wall-street/\"\u003eprobing and thoughtful investigation\u003c/a\u003e in this issue, the corporate culture of Wall Street seems to work day in and out against that goal. True, banks and investment firms have publicly committed to diversity and recruited talented women by the tens of thousands. But Claire’s interviews with many of those women show just how far the sector has fallen short when it comes to altering all the ingrained habits, expectations, and “microdecisions” that leave women on the outside looking in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo put the banking sector’s outlier status in even starker perspective, there is one formidable data set: \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e’s 22nd annual ranking of the \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/most-powerful-women/2019\"\u003eMost Powerful Women in Business\u003c/a\u003e. As intact as the glass ceiling remains in much of corporate America, there are signs in this year’s list of some epic cracks. In retail, technology, and health care, women have continued to crash into corner suites. Since last year, they’ve claimed the top jobs at Accenture, Best Buy, and IT giant CDW for the first time, taking the helms of businesses with huge budgets and global reach. “We couldn’t believe how competitive the list is this year,” says senior editor Beth Kowitt, who once again shepherded the MPW ranking with features editor Kristen Bellstrom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are dozens of urgent reasons, both ethical and strategic, for companies to make their C-suites more diverse—in every way, not just in terms of gender. (See Kowitt’s profile of Starbucks chief operating officer Roz Brewer, publishing online on Sept. 25, for an example of how a fresh perspective can revitalize a struggling brand.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd for a timely parable on these themes, please turn to our cover story, “\u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/longform/women-netflix-streaming-wars\"\u003eMeet the Women Leading Netflix Into the Streaming Wars\u003c/a\u003e.” Senior writer Michal Lev-Ram introduces readers to five behind-the-scenes all-stars, all women, who are racing to develop new hits for the streaming giant.

For context, we estimate the carbon emissions we have avoided to date already amount to almost 16 million metric tons, increasing to 29 million metric tons over the course of the next 10 years (which equals the CO2 emissions for the nation of Denmark in 2017).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am also very pleased to announce the next generation PlayStation console will include the possibility to suspend gameplay with much lower power consumption than PS4 (which we estimate can be achieved at around 0.5 W). If just one million users enable this feature, it would save equivalent to the average electricity use of 1,000 US homes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom an operations point of view, we will complete a carbon footprint assessment of our gaming services and will report the energy efficiency measures we employ at our data centers. We are committed to informing consumers of energy efficient console set-up and use.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur commitments are not only related to hardware and operations, we are also keen to help inform people interested in sustainability goals. We have committed to working with the industry and climate experts to develop reference information for use by game developers that wish to include sustainability themes in games. In addition, we will investigate potential PS VR applications that can raise awareness of climate issues and climate experts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gaming community is diverse and growing at a fast pace. There is an undeniable opportunity for leaders in the games industry to take a stand and support the UN Environment team by communicating the importance of preserving natural resources for generations to come. At PlayStation, we believe games have the power to ignite social change through educating people, evoking emotions, and inspiring hope. We could not be more proud to be part of the Playing for the Planet Alliance and the commitments announced. We look forward to seeing what the industry can achieve together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/PSBlog/~4/XNXiKb756YM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"

Just last week, the theater company announced it would screen a taping of that production in cinemas across the United States.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd tonight, Waller-Bridge won her first-ever Emmy—for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series for \u003cem\u003eFleabag\u003c/em\u003e. “I’m properly shaking. Oh my god, look at her!” Waller-Bridge said, pointing to the trophy after taking the stage at the 71st Primetime Emmy Awards. “I find writing really, really hard and really painful,” she added. “I’d like to say, honestly, from the bottom of my heart, that the reason I do it is \u003cem\u003ethis\u003c/em\u003e,” she said, addressing both the massive auditorium crowd and audiences at home.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eFleabag\u003c/em\u003e, which Waller-Bridge created, wrote, and starred in, is a work of astounding wit and empathy. Over the course of two seasons, the series followed the trials and sporadic growth of its titular character, a \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/09/fleabag-review-amazon/500360/?utm_source=feed\"\u003edeeply complicated woman\u003c/a\u003e who struggles to reconcile her sex addiction and misanthropy with the demands of self-actualization. The writing is concise, sharp, and delightfully hilarious. In one Season 2 episode, \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/05/fleabag-season-2-a-complex-portrait-of-sisterhood/590248/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eFleabag’s sister\u003c/a\u003e (played by Sian Clifford, who was nominated for a Supporting Actress award for her performance), complains about an ugly haircut and exclaims, “I look like a pencil!”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe show’s second season presented a refreshing exploration of the sisters' relationship, and that tenderness extended beyond the script. Soon after Waller-Bridge’s writing win, the show’s director, Harry Bradbeer, was awarded a trophy of his own. After noting that “something like \u003cem\u003eFleabag \u003c/em\u003eonly comes along once in your life,” he expressed gratitude toward Waller-Bridge for trusting him with her vision: “Thank you for coming into my life like some kind of glorious grenade.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWaller-Bridge and \u003cem\u003eFleabag \u003c/em\u003emanaged to land another surprising win tonight. The auteur claimed the award for Outstanding Actress in a Comedy Series, beating out Julia Louis-Dreyfus, the much heralded star of \u003cem\u003eVeep\u003c/em\u003e, and Rachel Brosnahan, of the Emmy favorite (and fellow Amazon series) \u003cem\u003eThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.\u003c/em\u003e Naturally, Waller-Bridge approached this win with the same irreverence that animates her series: “I find acting really hard and really painful but it’s all about this,” Waller-Bridge said, jokingly echoing her earlier acceptance speech. “This means a huge, huge amount to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe appeal of Waller-Bridge’s work, whether \u003cem\u003eFleabag\u003c/em\u003e or \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/04/season-2-killing-eve-macabre-and-audacious-review/586525/?utm_source=feed\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eKilling Eve\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, stems in large part from its subtle yet unflinching examination of women’s interiority. Waller-Bridge’s characters are \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/05/killing-eve-and-the-riddle-of-why-women-kill/561074/?utm_source=feed\"\u003ecomplex\u003c/a\u003e, but they’re not written as psychological case studies. Fleabag, despite her self-hatred, is still allowed to feel good, to experience moments of satisfaction and breakthrough amid her suffering. Waller-Bridge relished writing the show’s small rebellions. “The thing I really got off on was putting a female character out there that was all-knowing about sex and one step ahead, who knew what the guys were thinking before they thought it and yet still played slightly dumb to them,” Waller-Bridge \u003ca href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2017/02/phoebe-waller-bridge-fleabag.html\"\u003etold \u003cem\u003eThe Cut\u003c/em\u003e in 2017\u003c/a\u003e. “Oh God, it brought me so much pleasure.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe actor and writer has never seemed naive about the importance of her work in a television landscape that remains dominated by men. As she said early during the ceremony, “It’s really wonderful to know a dirty, pervy, angry messed-up woman can make it to the Emmys.” Whether she was talking about herself or Fleabag was for viewers to decide.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/3QXOOYZDZFw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/3QXOOYZDZFw/","published":"2019-09-23T02:37:35Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-598579"},{"title":"\u003cem\u003eGame of Thrones’\u003c/em\u003e Muted Victory Lap at the Emmys","content":"\u003cp\u003eLOS ANGELES—“Soph!

An opening montage celebrating television as a medium used scenes from \u003cem\u003eThrones\u003c/em\u003e as its framing device. And an hour into the presentation, the cast members arrived on stage to celebrate the show with a scripted tribute. “As much as we wished the show could have gone on forever, our time had come,” the actor Maisie Williams, who played Arya Stark, read stoically from a teleprompter. “And tonight is a chance to once again thank all of those who watched.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eGame of Thrones\u003c/em\u003e tied its own record last night for most Emmys won by a series in a single season, scoring 12 trophies in total. Yet, the show lost in most of the major categories: Its finale failed to win for writing and directing, and among its 10 performance nominees, only one triumphed. In the end, 10 of its 12 record-tying honors had been picked up at the Creative Arts Emmys the weekend before.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/09/emmys-2019-phoebe-waller-bridges-big-night-fleabag/598579/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: A ‘ridiculous’ Emmys night for ‘Fleabag’\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Emmys delivered a clear message: \u003cem\u003eGame of Thrones \u003c/em\u003ewas a cultural monolith, but it wouldn’t be awarded for its final season’s technical and storytelling chops.

Last weekend, while scrolling through Grindr, I came across my therapist's profile. Although his profile pictures don’t show his face, I was able to tell that the profile belonged to him from some contextual clues and a distinctive tattoo I recognized from his publicly available Facebook pictures.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat really threw me for a loop was my therapist's “About Me” section: In it, he described in explicit detail the kinds of sexual encounters he was searching for, as well as the kind of person he hoped would fulfill a particular desire. While I understand that my therapist, also an out gay man, is an adult with his own life outside of his office, I was deeply unnerved by learning so much explicit information about a person whom I try not to think of in a sexual context. My sudden exposure to this intimate knowledge feels acutely unsettling given that a lot of our work together focuses on my anxieties and vulnerabilities regarding sex and relationships.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI know I need to address this issue with him, as I won't be able to conduct a single further session without acknowledging having seen his profile. I am at a complete loss as to how, though. Do I write an email or wait until our next face-to-face session? And even then, what can I possibly say? Part of me is terrified that he'll have an adverse reaction, or decide that we can no longer continue our therapeutic relationship. How do I approach this difficult situation?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnonymous\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDear Anonymous,\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLet’s begin with a straightforward truth: Many people have a natural curiosity about their therapists\u003cem\u003e. Who is this person\u003c/em\u003e \u003cem\u003ewith whom I’m sharing my most vulnerable self?\u003c/em\u003e Generally, patients know very little about their therapists’ outside lives, though sometimes therapists make intentional disclosures in the therapy room. For instance, depending on the circumstance, I might answer a question about whether I’m a parent, or even offer that information unsolicited if I feel it’s clinically relevant for a particular patient in a particular context.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut often patients want to know more, so they search for information online. I’m guessing that your therapist’s Facebook photos didn’t magically appear on your screen—you had to search for them. And that’s important, because your desire to know more about him will become part of the larger conversation you want to have about the Grindr profile, which I’ll get to in a moment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf course, you didn’t go searching for the Grindr profile—that was purely accidental. Unintended encounters between therapists and patients happen out in the world, too. I’ve run into patients everywhere from the checkout line at Target to bookstores and restaurants to Lakers games. What patients may not realize is that these unexpected encounters, as innocuous as they may seem, can be uncomfortable for the therapist as well. We aren’t used to being seen by our patients when we’re with our family or significant other—or, as happened to me, while wearing a bikini at the beach and, another time, in the dressing-room area of the bra section at a department store. In these cases, I generally ask in the next session what the experience was like for the patient. Some therapists wait for the patient to bring it up, but I’ve found that often not mentioning it makes it bigger, an elephant in the room, and acknowledging the encounter can feel like a relief—for both of us.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn your situation, though, your therapist isn’t aware of the encounter (and therefore won’t bring it up), and also it’s qualitatively different from the usual out-in-the-world encounter. You didn’t just see your therapist buying paper towels at Target, or even wearing a Speedo at the beach. You ran into him on Grindr and got a glimpse into his sexual psyche.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat’s a deeper level of disclosure and, yes, it’s awkward, and would be even if he weren’t your therapist. If that profile were your dentist’s or your boss’s, or if you were in college and it belonged to your professor, you’d probably still feel uncomfortable having seen it—maybe even so uncomfortable that you’d avoid this person as much as possible, switching to another dentist, for example.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat may seem like bad news, but in fact it’s the opposite. Since this \u003cem\u003eis\u003c/em\u003e your therapist and not your dentist or your boss, you have the opportunity to address it in a way you probably wouldn’t with other people. In fact, the best therapy often happens when things get uncomfortable, because the discomfort can surface important material that may have been buried (\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2018/03/dear-therapist-week-1/555812/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eas I have written about before\u003c/a\u003e). You might open this conversation by walking into your next session, plopping down on the couch, and saying something like: “So, this very awkward thing happened and I feel like we should talk about it.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYes, you’ll talk about Grindr, but what I suspect you’ll find is that the conversation will quickly shift its focus to the most fundamental aspect of your therapy: your relationship with your therapist. All the things that haven’t been said—that you searched and saw his Facebook photos (because you’re curious about him?), or that you “try not to think of him in a sexual context” (because you’re afraid that if you do, something bad might happen?), or that you’re worried he’ll get rid of you because of what you found (are you confusing your sexual shame with his?)—will be discussed in the context of the work you say you’re there to do: understanding more about your own sexuality and relationships. Part of that understanding will come from how you handle this moment in the therapeutic relationship, in all its glorious awkwardness.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe most likely outcome is that this conversation takes you to a new level in your own work, reducing your anxiety and increasing your tolerance for being vulnerable about sex and relationships. It’s also possible that even after having this conversation, you will find that you can’t get past this and ultimately decide to see another therapist. I doubt that will happen, but if it does, that’s okay. Either way, the experience of talking about sex in such a courageous way will push you forward—both in therapy and in life.\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eDear Therapist is for informational purposes only, does not constitute medical advice, and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

Over the course of the evening, the two \u003cem\u003eSaturday Night Live \u003c/em\u003ecomedians would occasionally saunter onstage, stand listlessly, and recite jokes as if they were being held hostage. This year’s Emmys, perhaps as a reaction to that lethargic affair, dispensed with hosts altogether, instead jumping from award to award with nary a transition. But if anything, this approach created a whole new problem: Rather than having one pair of awkward presenters, the ceremony ended up trotting out dozens.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEvery televised awards show leans on odd-couple celebrity pairings to hand out trophies, a job that requires reading scripted banter from cue cards to pad out the moment before announcing a list of names. But because the Emmys copied this year’s Oscars and decided not to hire a host, the awkward repartee was all that remained. The proceedings got so fetid that when James Corden took the stage to present a category, he offered to throw away whatever lines had been written for him and get right to business. The crowd roared its approval.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/09/emmys-2019-phoebe-waller-bridges-big-night-fleabag/598579/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: A ‘ridiculous’ Emmys night for ‘Fleabag’\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe point of an official emcee, who introduces an awards show with a long, jokey monologue and then occasionally bursts in to pep things up throughout the night, was much debated earlier this year. The Academy Awards, after struggling to find a host, \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/01/kevin-hart-ellen-oscars-and-phantom-apology/579475/?utm_source=feed\"\u003ehired and quickly dismissed Kevin Hart\u003c/a\u003e, then decided to go without an emcee for the first time in decades. The result was a little dry, but \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/02/oscars-2019-no-host-91st-academy-awards-presenters/583504/?utm_source=feed\"\u003ebrisk\u003c/a\u003e by Oscar standards and free of catastrophe, so it was largely deemed a success. But that decision made more sense for the Academy Awards; the movie industry doesn’t have the wide talent pool that the TV world has when it comes to hosting personalities.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis year’s Emmys featured a procession of people who could easily have taken the emcee gig. Stephen Colbert and Jimmy Kimmel took the stage together and joked at length about the importance of their jobs and what they could have brought to the show had they been hired. Ike Barinholtz and Maya Rudolph did an iffy, malapropism-filled double act as they pretended to be temporarily blind from LASIK surgery. Ken Jeong spent his five minutes onstage filming a TikTok. Seth Meyers was, somewhat bizarrely, called out only to eulogize the dearly departed HBO series \u003cem\u003eGame of Thrones \u003c/em\u003e(the show’s cast then lined up onstage to awkwardly convey their thanks as a group).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/09/the-plea-in-michelle-williams-emmys-speech/598582/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: The plea in Michelle Williams’s Emmys speech\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHalf of this year’s jokes were about how the Emmys needed saving, and that became a self-fulfilling prophecy. If any of the comedians I mentioned in the last paragraph had been handed a hosting gig, they could have brought in their own writers, crafted a real monologue, and given the broadcast some cohesion and personality. Instead, those performers were trotted out for a few minutes, handed some rote zingers, and forced to move on to the next thing. The ceremony didn’t get shorter as a result; it only became more bloated, thanks in part to a slew of dull montages, salutes to shows such as \u003cem\u003eThrones \u003c/em\u003eand \u003cem\u003eVeep\u003c/em\u003e, and appearances from the new cast of the Fox series \u003cem\u003eThe Masked Singer.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLast night’s Emmys should be a crucial lesson for awards shows going forward, especially with the Oscars race beginning this fall. Live television events such as these work only if they’re memorable; people don’t tune in just to see which group of millionaires got the golden statues and remembered to thank their agent this year. Proper hosts have a much better chance of generating well-crafted, enduring moments.

He has called for the disbandment of NATO, dubbing the international alliance a “\u003ca href=\"https://www.theredroar.com/2019/02/exclusive-corbyn-branded-eu-military-frankenstein-and-trashed-second-irish-referendum-in-unearthed-footage/\"\u003emilitary Frankenstein\u003c/a\u003e,” and opposed foreign intervention in Venezuela, Syria, and Ukraine, leading critics to suggest he has lent support to oppressive regimes in Caracas, Damascus, and Moscow. More recently, Corbyn faced backlash from both sides of the House of Commons for his \u003ca href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/15/salisbury-attack-conflict-britain-cold-war\"\u003ereluctance to blame Russia\u003c/a\u003e for its role in the nerve-agent attack in Salisbury last year.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWhile many of Corbyn’s views are well established, less clear are his views on some of the biggest foreign-policy challenges Britain will face, from grappling with a rising China to balancing ties between the United States and the EU—though the Labour leader has frequently criticized the Conservative government on matters of domestic policy, he has rarely spoken out on these foreign-policy issues. And then there is the question of how his known views will translate into policy were he to lead Britain’s next government. Though prime ministers have significantly more latitude to make foreign-policy decisions, there are limits to what can be done unilaterally. “The prime minister has to obtain support from his cabinet and indeed his party in Parliament,” Chalmers, the deputy director general at RUSI, said. “There are some red lines the parliamentary party would simply not accept, which would threaten the viability of such a government.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eNATO membership would likely be one such red line—even as Corbyn has refashioned Labour, the party apparatus largely remains deeply committed to Western defense and security institutions. (Thornberry has \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/MarrShow/status/863671880636551169\"\u003epublicly said\u003c/a\u003e Labour is committed to the defense alliance.) Continued support for Britain’s nuclear-weapons system, Trident, would be another. (The party’s defense spokesperson, Nia Griffith, \u003ca href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/defence/house/house-magazine/99697/nia-griffith-%E2%80%9C-next-labour-government-will-maintain-our\"\u003ehas said\u003c/a\u003e the party supports maintaining Britain’s independent deterrent.) So far, Corbyn has been willing to acquiesce on those issues. Though he has expressed support for scrapping Britain’s nuclear arsenal and has \u003ca href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/may/26/jeremy-corbyn-trident-labour-manifesto-commitment\"\u003epersonally opposed\u003c/a\u003e the continued funding of Trident, he pledged to honor the party’s decision to maintain the program, a promise that featured in the party’s 2017 election manifesto.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eCorbyn’s position on using nuclear weapons isn’t simply hypothetical. As prime minister, one of the first things he would be required to do is write his four letters of last resort, handwritten instructions to Britain’s military leaders on what should happen in the event that Britain is hit with a nuclear attack. When asked whether Corbyn could go about limiting the country’s nuclear capacity another way—say, by instructing the military not to employ nuclear weapons under any circumstances—Chalmers said we’ll likely never know. “The impact of [letters of last resort] can be overstated, not least because the tradition is they’re never publicized,” he said, adding: “It would be a test, I think, of whether Jeremy Corbyn was prepared to obfuscate on this in a way which previous prime ministers have done … It’s more about how he would talk about it, rather than the actual letter.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003caside class=\"callout-placeholder\" data-source=\"curated\"\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eBut perhaps the greatest impact a Corbyn premiership would have on Britain’s foreign policy is on which direction Britain decides to go post-Brexit, and whether it chooses to align more closely with its allies in Europe, with the Trump administration in the United States, or elsewhere. While both May and Johnson have prioritized courting President Donald Trump with the hopes of securing a post-Brexit trade deal with the United States, Corbyn has taken a more aggressive stance toward the American president, opting to skip a state dinner during \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2019/06/trump-britain/590917/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eTrump’s visit\u003c/a\u003e to Britain this year.

Though these differences haven’t proved enough to hinder the two countries’ deep defense and security partnership, some believe a Corbyn premiership would impose unprecedented strain on the alliance.

Though these figures don’t necessarily correlate with the number of parliamentary seats each party will secure, they suggest that Labour would almost certainly struggle to form a government on its own. Bob Kerslake, an independent member of the House of Lords and a former head of the British civil service who has been helping prepare the Labour Party for government since 2015, told me the most likely scenario is that Labour would lead “a minority government, acting with the support of the [Scottish National Party] and the Liberal Democrats,” smaller parties that share Labour’s opposition to a no-deal Brexit.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eBut such an arrangement wouldn’t be without its drawbacks.

At present, there is no fixed date for a general election, though Johnson’s position as a prime minister in charge of a minority government means one is likely in the near future. Britain is, at the same time, poised to leave the EU on October 31, though Parliament has passed a law forcing Johnson to seek a further extension if a deal with the bloc isn’t agreed upon. That leaves open the prospect that any future election might be held with Britain still a member of the EU, meaning the next steps on how to proceed would fall to the next government. Corbyn has already pledged that if elected, he would seek to renegotiate a deal of his own with Brussels that would keep Britain closely aligned to EU rules and regulations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eBut Parliament has already expressed its opposition to such a scenario—as well as virtually \u003ca href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2019/apr/01/brexit-latest-live-news-indicative-votes--brexiters-dismiss-customs-union-plan-as-unacceptable-as-mps-prepare-for-more-indicative-votes-live-new\"\u003eevery other one\u003c/a\u003e.

He could have as many as 57 backers, compared with Netanyahu\u0026#8217;s 55.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaverick politician Avigdor Lieberman, head of the mid-size Yisrael Beitenu party, controls the final eight seats, making him the key powerbroker. But he announced Sunday that he isn\u0026#8217;t endorsing either candidate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe endorsement by the Joint List, a bloc of four small Arab parties that controls 13 seats, marked a turning point in Israeli politics. Arab parties have traditionally refrained from endorsing a candidate for prime minister, and they have never sat in a coalition government, not wanting to be seen as legitimizing Israeli policies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough many Israeli Arabs remain angry at Gantz for leading the military\u0026#8217;s devastating war against Gaza militants in 2014, their fury toward Netanyahu runs much deeper. Netanyahu\u0026#8217;s campaign repeatedly accused the Arabs of trying to \u0026#8220;steal\u0026#8221; the election, drawing accusations of racism and incitement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is also deep-seated anger over a law passed by Netanyahu\u0026#8217;s government in 2018 that declared Israel to be the nation-state of the Jewish people. Arabs believe the law codifies discrimination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough the Arab parties are still expected to stay out of Gantz\u0026#8217;s future government, their endorsement reflects a growing desire of Israel\u0026#8217;s large Arab minority to take a more active role in shaping the country.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn an op-ed piece in The New York Times, Ayman Odeh, the leader of the Joint List, argued that his move should end Netanyahu\u0026#8217;s political career and provide a watershed moment for Israel\u0026#8217;s Arab minority.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;If the center-left parties of Israel believe that Arab Palestinian citizens have a place in this country, they must accept that we have a place in its politics,\u0026#8221; he wrote. \u0026#8220;There is no shared future without the full and equal participation of Arab Palestinian citizens.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNetanyahu reacted by saying: \u0026#8220;As we warned, the Arab parties that oppose Israel as a Jewish and democratic state and glorify terrorists recommended Gantz for prime minister.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Arab parties\u0026#8217; decision does not guarantee Gantz will be prime minister. The president usually appoints the candidate with the most supporters, but not necessarily. Rivlin has wide discretion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn last week\u0026#8217;s vote, Blue and White won 33 seats, while Likud took 31.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe deciding factor looks to be Lieberman, who is demanding a broad unity government with the two major parties that will be secular and exclude the ultra-Orthodox Jewish parties and Arabs. That appears to be the compromise emerging between Blue and White and Likud, though both are insisting upon leading it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComplicating matters is Blue and White\u0026#8217;s refusal to sit with Netanyahu because he faces a likely indictment on corruption charges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdeh said he is planning on becoming opposition leader in the case of a unity government. As the leader of the largest party in opposition, he would be entitled to the position, which includes meetings with visiting world leaders and access to sensitive security information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRivlin has not indicated which way he is leading. But he said he interpreted the will of the people as yearning for a \u0026#8220;stable\u0026#8221; government. \u0026#8220;And there can\u0026#8217;t be a stable government without the two big parties,\u0026#8221; the 80-year-old president said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast week\u0026#8217;s vote was Israel\u0026#8217;s second election in five months. Netanyahu was unable to form a coalition after April\u0026#8217;s balloting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn calling a new election, Netanyahu had hoped to secure a narrow majority of hard-line and religious parties that would grant him immunity from prosecution on charges that could include bribery, breach of trust and fraud. But now that possibility appears to be off the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIsraeli law does not require a sitting premier to resign if indicted. But if he is charged, as is widely expected, he will come under heavy pressure to step down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/time/topstories/~4/pGZm6M2uv_g\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/pGZm6M2uv_g/","published":"2019-09-23T01:21:35Z","guid":"http://time.com/?p=5683612"},{"title":"The Albanian Quake Has Had 340 Aftershocks and People Are Afraid to go Home","content":"\u003caside class=\"right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad\" id=\"right-rail__ad-5683614\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module video-2\" data-src=\"https://time.com/5683614/albania-earthquake-aftershocks/\" data-widget-id=\"SB_4\" data-ob-template=\"timemag\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTIRANA, Albania (AP) \u0026mdash; Fear and safety hazards kept many residents of Albania\u0026#8217;s capital of Tirana and the port city of Durres out of their homes Sunday after an earthquake the day before injured 105 people and damaged hundreds of buildings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlbania\u0026#8217;s Institute of Geosciences, Energy, Water and Environment said more than 340 aftershocks have followed the 5.8 magnitude earthquake that hit Saturday afternoon near Durres.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbout 600 houses, most built before 1990, suffered damage in the quake, which also temporarily knocked out power and water facilities in Tirana, Durres and some western and central districts, authorities said.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe U.S. Geological Survey and the European-Mediterranean Seismological Center recorded the rupture on Albania\u0026#8217;s western Adriatic Sea coast as a magnitude 5.6 quake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was felt along the western coast and far to the east.

Officials tied to SoftBank \u003ca href=\"https://time.com/5683452/wework-board-adam-neumann/\" \u003ewant Neumann to step down as CEO\u003c/a\u003e, according to reports over the weekend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoftBank and its Vision Fund are WeWork\u0026rsquo;s biggest investors, with a stake of around 29% in We Co., the company\u0026rsquo;s official name. That support is a key reason why this real-estate rental company fetched a $47 billion valuation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo SoftBank, WeWork was a unicorn on the rise. Its corporate peccadilloes, which largely revolve around corporate governance, appear to have been ignored by executives at the Japanese company: WeWork was a unicorn and SoftBank just had to be part of it. So SoftBank kept pouring in more money, just as it did with other great startups like Uber Technologies Inc., Didi Chuxing and Slack Technologies Inc. At one point SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son described WeWork as the next Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. in reference to the fortune he made from investing in Jack Ma\u0026rsquo;s Chinese e-commerce giant.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0026rsquo;t until WeWork filed its IPO prospectus in August that the rest of the world saw in clear daylight what SoftBank\u0026rsquo;s common sense-radar had failed to detect when it signed each check. As \u003ca href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-08-14/wework-ipo-shows-it-s-the-most-magical-unicorn\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy colleague Shira Ovide wrote at the time\u003c/a\u003e, the list of \u0026ldquo;transactions involving a company\u0026rsquo;s CEO or other insiders is astonishing for WeWork.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmong them: Neumann\u0026rsquo;s wife is one of two or three people who get to choose a successor if he is incapacitated; the CEO owns stakes in some of the office buildings that WeWork leases; and at least two members of Neumann\u0026rsquo;s family did work for the company\u0026rsquo;s Creator Awards, which its biggest outside shareholder committed $180 million to fund.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat outside shareholder is none other than SoftBank \u0026ndash; a stark reminder that Masayoshi Son and his team not only knew of these dealings, it actively enabled them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause these red flags have spooked other investors, WeWork is looking more like it\u0026rsquo;ll fetch $15 billion when it eventually lists. So \u003cem\u003enow\u003c/em\u003e SoftBank cares, to the tune of a $9 billion lower value on its stake. It\u0026rsquo;s too late to exit WeWork. But it\u0026rsquo;s not too late to exit Neumann.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComparisons to Uber are inevitable. Co-founder Travis Kalanick faced numerous complaints about his erratic management style and questionable judgment. SoftBank\u0026rsquo;s entry into into the ride-hailing giant\u0026rsquo;s capitalization table was part of the solution to a problem. Son bought out a lot of Kalanick\u0026rsquo;s stake, giving other shareholders and board members leverage to push out the CEO and replace him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn WeWork\u0026rsquo;s case, it may be that Son himself is wielding the cutlass. According to CNBC, his maneuver is seen by some as part of an effort to stop a planned IPO altogether. Last week I discussed why halting the IPO might be good for SoftBank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as a new CEO helped revive sentiment toward Uber, and prepare it for a successful IPO, Son is likely betting that simply getting rid of Neumann and pretending that will fix things should be enough to juice the valuation when a listing does eventually happen. And should installing a new CEO result in, say, a $25 billion valuation instead of $15 billion, then that would be a $3 billion win for SoftBank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet this recent maneuvering by SoftBank suggests the concern isn\u0026rsquo;t WeWork\u0026rsquo;s funky corporate structure, but that public-market investors \u003cem\u003edon\u0026rsquo;t like\u003c/em\u003e this funky corporate structure. It\u0026rsquo;s like a kid not being sorry for dipping his hand in the cookie jar, but for getting caught.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt tells us also that SoftBank is tone deaf. WeWork\u0026rsquo;s structure should have raised red flags even before it decided to pump billions into the company. It could have gone straight to Neumann and the existing board and pushed for change, because that\u0026rsquo;s the kind of power a big stack bully with a $100 billion checkbook wields.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, it looks like SoftBank\u0026rsquo;s biggest concern was the Vision Fund\u0026rsquo;s much-vaunted internal rate of return.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s very possible this WeWork saga will be a wake-up call to SoftBank. Maybe now they\u0026rsquo;ll be clear-sighted enough to spot landmines before they hit them \u0026ndash; instead of boldly barreling down the unicorn highway in the belief that speed negates any need for caution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut with plans for a second $100 billion Vision Fund, prospective investors will be asking if they want to bet on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/time/topstories/~4/PK9Xy_9glHM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/PK9Xy_9glHM/","published":"2019-09-23T11:38:06Z","guid":"http://time.com/?p=5683903"},{"title":"Australia Is Using New Technology to Catch Drivers on Phones","content":"\u003caside class=\"right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad\" id=\"right-rail__ad-5683862\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module\" data-src=\"https://time.com/5683862/australia-technology-drivers-driving-phones/\" data-widget-id=\"SB_2\" data-ob-template=\"timemag\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCANBERRA, Australia (AP) \u0026mdash; An Australian state is attempting to persuade people to put down their smartphones while driving by rolling out cameras to prosecute distracted motorists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNew South Wales Roads Minister Andrew Constance said Monday that Australia\u0026#8217;s most populous state is the first jurisdiction in the world to use such technology to punish drivers distracted by social media, text messages or phone calls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoad safety experts are alarmed at the growing prevalence of accidents involving drivers using smartphones on New South Wales roads.

Only Costa Rica has more cyclists suspended by the sport\u0026#8217;s world governing body than Colombia. The suspension added to doubts that first surfaced in 2017 after the World Anti-Doping Agency revoked the license of a government-run lab responsible for all doping tests in Colombia and the ban this year of the country\u0026#8217;s premier international team, Manzana Postobon, which prided itself on clean cycling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePart of the problem is the ease with which Colombian cyclists can find an artificial boost: at their local pharmacy.

And we\u0026#8217;ve seen some additional (mostly female) anger and (mostly male) self-flagellation since #MeToo started sweeping through the industry in the fall of 2017. Yet the negative vibes emanating from the Microsoft Theater, this time, felt different\u0026mdash;more mean-spirited and nihilistic than contrite. So many elements of the ceremony radiated apathy or derision toward TV in general. Presenter pairings often seemed random. Bill Hader\u0026#8217;s observation that \u0026#8220;a limited series is a show that was canceled\u0026#8221; dripped cynicism (even if, with so little competition, it was one of the funniest things said all night). Lennon\u0026#8217;s mostly inane jokes recalled the mocking narration on \u003cem\u003eLove Island\u003c/em\u003e (even if he did get in some good digs at Fox owners the Murdoch family after \u003cem\u003eSuccession \u003c/em\u003ewon a writing award).

I cringed watching Phoebe Waller-Bridge deliver boilerplate jokes while presenting an award because the lines she writes for herself\u0026mdash;and even her running acceptance-speech gag about how excruciating every part of her job on \u003cem\u003eFleabag \u003c/em\u003ehad been\u0026mdash;are so much better than what the Emmys writers scripted for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026#8217;s an argument to be made, I guess, that this was Fox honoring its roots as an irreverent broadcast upstart; Homer Simpson did kick off the show, after all. You wouldn\u0026#8217;t be wrong, either, to note that humility is \u003cem\u003ede rigueur\u003c/em\u003e for the entertainment industry these days. And yet, Fox wasn\u0026#8217;t shy about promoting its own fall lineup.

Maybe we were tasting the sour grapes of a network that \u003ca href=\"https://deadline.com/2019/05/tv-ratings-2018-2019-season-totals-viewers-demo-cbs-nbc-1202620062/\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003edidn\u0026#8217;t have a single nominee among the televised categories\u003c/a\u003e.

The cable channel was part of the 21st Century Fox stable that Disney acquired earlier this year.) Over the course of the past two decades, Peak TV has made the Emmys increasingly competitive; now, they\u0026#8217;re a race that the broadcast networks are no longer automatically positioned to qualify for, much less win.

They opted to dole out a single acting award to the most decorated actor in the show\u0026#8217;s cast. On Sunday night, Dinklage set a record for most wins in his category with a fourth trophy.

Or are his kids, while he understands exactly what’s going on? | HBO\u003c/small\u003e\n\n  \u003cp\u003eWinner: Rhea, of all people. Loser that thinks it’s a winner: Christmas.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp id=\"uoTGYA\"\u003eEven the best TV shows have off episodes, and one nice thing about \u003ca href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7660850/?ref_=nv_sr_1?ref_=nv_sr_1\"\u003eSuccession\u003c/a\u003e is the way it seems adept at scheduling those off episodes so they don’t get in the way of all of the drama in other installments. Such an episode is \u003ca href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10495518/?ref_=tt_eps_cu_n\"\u003e“Return,”\u003c/a\u003e a highly entertaining, incredibly gut-wrenching hour of television that, nevertheless, feels like a deliberately scheduled pause in season two’s unrelenting series of twists and turns. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"LXyXq4\"\u003eTo be clear, an episode like this is necessary every now and then. A show like \u003ca href=\"https://www.hbo.com/succession\"\u003eSuccession\u003c/a\u003e so easily uses up all of its oxygen if it’s breathing fire all of the time; it needs a chance to reposition the characters on the game board, remind us of their emotional states, and find ways to subtly twist the story in new directions. “Return” does all of that and then some.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"5Ovpfr\"\u003ePerhaps most importantly, it gives us a rich, full story about the emotional state of poor Kendall Roy, who is still living in the dark and terrible place he entered at the end of season one. His visit to Britain becomes the dark heart of this episode, and maybe the entire season. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"hrTDGN\"\u003eAll of which is to say that even if “Return” might be this season’s weakest episode so far, it is an episode that is making every move it makes with thoughtful intent. Whatever endgame season two is about to push toward seems very exciting indeed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ZEsxsV\"\u003eWith that, here are five winners and five losers from “Return,” as chosen by Vox critic at large Emily VanDerWerff and The Goods editor Meredith Haggerty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"zT7EPQ\"\u003eLoser: Kendall \u003c/h3\u003e\n  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\"Kendall confronts the truth.\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FykUEVTlRFBjFJ_7jB-EyLCXkmQ=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19222261/65ca9e602b6e354026b79f390a4b45f884786d7ca740f9ca94103bc1a5eff863106ce537c0b6f881474330de5c217dfe.jpg\"\u003e\n      \u003ccite\u003eHBO\u003c/cite\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003eKendall’s smile gradually retreats inside his body throughout this episode, and it’s really a sight to see.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"fzjIyj\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEmily: \u003c/strong\u003eKendall begins “Return” with a smile on his face.

And it especially abhors Kendall feeling anything other than abject, empty, gutted horror at the state of his life. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"JgaTFZ\"\u003eOf course, by “Succession,” I mean “Logan Roy,” the original monster man himself. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"A62PY4\"\u003eOne great thing about Succession this season is how successfully it’s lived in the shadow of everything that happened in the \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/8/5/17645354/succession-hbo-finale-interview-brian-cox-jeremy-strong?__c=1\"\u003eseason one finale\u003c/a\u003e, when Kendall failed to save the life of the waiter he got high with as their car crashed into a small lake. Kendall escaped, because he’s cursed to be the protagonist of a TV show. The waiter died, and his family briefly asked questions before everything was hushed up by the almighty power of money. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"YU3M62\"\u003eBut even though season two has existed in the aftermath of those events, they have only been referenced obliquely here and there until this episode, when Logan recruits Kendall to join him for a visit to the \u003cem\u003edead man’s family\u003c/em\u003e. Wandering about the family’s small home, Kendall looks like he might literally vomit up all of his guilt, but he somehow keeps it tamped down. And at all times, the camera keeps a steady eye on how this domestic space contains none of the trappings of wealth we’re used to seeing on this show.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"28D0T6\"\u003eTo its detriment, “Return” perhaps pushes a little too hard on the “These are just normal \u003cem\u003efolks!\u003c/em\u003e” button that morality plays about the evils of the rich have always pushed. But to its credit, it never really makes this theme text. It’s too focused on the way that Logan rubs Kendall’s nose in the bad thing he’s done, just to remind his son who’s boss. It’s chilling and eerie, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0834989/?ref_=nv_sr_1?ref_=nv_sr_1\"\u003eJeremy Strong\u003c/a\u003e has never been better. (See, Winner: Jeremy Strong below!)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"h6xKp5\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMeredith: \u003c/strong\u003eThere’s nothing worse than an episode where Kendall starts out happy and feeling cared about. Having “dick pic” chanted at him by Naomi is one of the nicest things we’ve ever seen happen to him. That feeling could never last! A win is as good as a loss!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"SQK8oe\"\u003eInstead of “being in a fucking Simon \u0026amp; Garfunkel song” (adorable) at the zoo with Naomi, he accompanies his father on a meaningless brainstorm en route to the house of the family of the waiter he watched die, which is really a back-breaker of a false pretense. What a normal place for an ideas sesh! And did Ken really think Logan was going to let him stay in the car? It makes so much more sense to have him stand in the hallway like a shame butler. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"OBIyHE\"\u003e“Monster man” really is the right description for Logan here; watching him clock Kendall’s joy and crush it with his own guilt and sin is basically a horror movie, but a really Catholic one. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"HwxnI1\"\u003eWinner: Rhea \u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"cxnwva\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMeredith: \u003c/strong\u003eIf \u003ca href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000456/?ref_=nv_sr_1?ref_=nv_sr_1\"\u003eHolly Hunter\u003c/a\u003e wasn’t playing a devious mastermind, what would we all even be doing here? After her firing by Nan Pierce last week, Rhea has integrated herself seamlessly into Logan’s inner circle. Very efficient! It’s probably clear to Kendall, Rome, God and everyone else that Rhea is playing some kind of game as soon as she appears on Logan’s plane, but it’s really obvious when she tells him Roman could be a good successor — just not yet. I’m sorry, whom?  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"O7CMlZ\"\u003eThe kids are convinced that Rhea and Logan are banging it out — an assumption bolstered by Rhea (“You must be fond of Marcia,” she needles Shiv, who tells her with irony that she appreciates Rhea checking in before fucking her father), Logan, and a little scene where Logan invites Rhea to sleep over. But Emily, you suspect there might be something more complicated at work, so I’ll let you talk more about that. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ivL3mB\"\u003eWhatever Rhea is doing, whether she’s in cahoots with Logan or playing him, she seemingly neutralizes her biggest threat — Shiv — through sheer networking. She wheedles our beautiful bobbed goddess into putting her name in for Pierce, which immediately gets back to Logan, who lashes out at Shiv. In the end, Rhea is the one sitting by Logan on the plane, looking like a pretty promising choice for Waystar Royco, at least until Roman’s “ready.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"dAJbAX\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEmily: \u003c/strong\u003eEven at last week, I apparently called the way Rhea had designs on the Waystar Royco job, I couldn’t quite appreciate that it was actually happening until it became clear just how thoroughly she had played every single last one of the Roys. Rhea ingratiates herself to Roman and Kendall by seeming to throw Shiv under the bus (though, to be clear, Shiv’s report is definitely the kind of insufferable that can only be managed by someone who has tasted a bite of power but not yet the whole apple). She (maybe?) sleeps with Logan. (More on this below.) She even sucks up to Shiv by offering her a job.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"S5Q0Rr\"\u003eThe Roys are deeply fucked up, to be sure, but Rhea correctly diagnoses what keeps them in power: the weird unity they have. Season two has quietly opened schisms between almost all of them — the Kendall/Shiv alliance seems strongest right now, and who’d have thunk? — and Rhea is right there, ready to pounce.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"uA5ZZ4\"\u003eI don’t know that this was Rhea’s ultimate goal, but even if it’s just a pivot out of a bad situation — namely, getting fired — it’s a pretty fantastic pivot. And Holly Hunter is clearly having a great time playing an uninhibited Rhea, who is just happy to be on the plane, on the way to see some theater. In an episode that focuses on one of Logan’s exes and overshadows his current wife, it’s fascinating to see a future potential former Mrs. Roy, maneuvering into a position where she’s gone from holding none of the cards to holding all of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"pRmQOA\"\u003eWinner: Mum\u003c/h3\u003e\n  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\"Caroline and Kendall share a late-night chat.\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fNOMf8y-WNLDixkGQcY8GKYKtrk=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19222264/6ee3eedfff2aa4d1cbc457845a8c6347a51be944d091e924529ef9c20885e6ff7ac6a9f6898b1364d4b77222b2e2d825.jpg\"\u003e\n      \u003ccite\u003eHBO\u003c/cite\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003eCaroline has what might have been a nice moment with her oldest son.

Roman (or “RoRo,” as his mother calls him) immediately gives up his whole hand, telling her the details of Logan’s best offer.

Preparing to serve Shiv and Rome shot-riddled pigeon — which she apologizes isn’t a giant steak with truffle fries — she asks, “So, should I be mother?” Honestly, please don’t!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"T45PPs\"\u003eWinner (thinks she’s a loser): Shiv \u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"zu8KMW\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEmily: \u003c/strong\u003eLook, we’re all Shiv fans here, to the degree that we should probably just start a spinoff called Glorious Shiv Roy Dot Com (a new site from Vox Media) or something like that. And Meredith, at least, believes that Shiv is a loser this week. I, however, like the idiot I am, think she continues to be the big winner of the whole season.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ssJdJy\"\u003eShiv has basically lost any shot she has at taking her father’s job, and Rhea has turned both Logan and Roman against her, and all seems dark right now. Plus, Rhea’s curt dismissal of the youngest Roy — “Shiv’s not as smart as she thinks she is” — is tailor-made to flatter these men while reducing the one absent woman to a puddle of self-doubt should Rhea’s cutting remark ever get back to her (and I have to assume it will). The Pierce job is probably a long-shot, \u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e she has to have a whole lunch where she thinks about her dad having sex. Plus, Christmas with her mom? No thanks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"nBi1LG\"\u003eBut what strikes me here isn’t that Shiv loses but why she loses — namely, Rhea correctly and clearly understands that Shiv is the greatest threat to whatever Rhea’s larger plans are, then takes action to remove her from the board entirely. And, c’mon. Logan isn’t going to leave his daughter out in the cold forever. Shiv has been on a roller coaster this season, but it’s one designed to keep the audience from seeing how strong her position truly is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"8GeCXL\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eShiv’s hair update: \u003c/strong\u003eRhea’s just jealous of the hair.

Lottery winners represent a great chance to explore whether increases in income make people happier. We know that there’s a well-established association between higher income and happiness, but it can be tricky to say for sure that it’s the higher income that causes happiness. Maybe happier people earn more money, or depressed people tend to earn very little money, or people with some general quality of life successfulness will be both happy and rich. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"yTfTvW\"\u003eLottery winners are selected at random, so they can help answer this question for us: Does money cause happiness? \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"nA7itH\"\u003eHere’s what we know about the effects of lottery winnings\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"fiQC6S\"\u003eThe first paper to take a serious look at the happiness of lottery winnings was a 1978 paper by Philip Brickman and colleagues, titled \u003ca href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/690806\"\u003e“Lottery winners and accident victims: Is happiness relative?”\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"A4F3Xw\"\u003eThe theory they were testing was that big life events didn’t affect happiness much. A big positive event, like winning the lottery, made smaller positive effects pale in comparison (and contributed less to happiness); similarly a big negative event, like a paralyzing accident, would not make people much sadder. They interviewed 29 accident victims, 22 lottery winners, and 22 people in the control group (meaning they didn’t win a lottery or get paralyzed in an accident). They indeed found that the lottery winners were not happier than the controls by a statistically significant amount. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"WVnHSY\"\u003eThat, the new paper by Oswald and Winkelmann argues, was their first mistake. Twenty-two lottery winners is simply not very many; the difference in happiness between them and the control group would have needed to be enormous for Brickman to find a statistically significant effect. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"SXxZjJ\"\u003eBut later studies of lottery winners found results suggesting that there is an effect on happiness. A \u003ca href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16949692\"\u003e2007 study in Britain\u003c/a\u003e, for example, found that the recipients of medium-sized lottery wins (between 1,000 and 120,000 pounds) “go on eventually to exhibit significantly better psychological health.” Their sample size is pretty small too — 137 observations — but six times as large as the sample size in the initial study. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"t2C84b\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://ftp.iza.org/dp4730.pdf\"\u003eAnother study\u003c/a\u003e found that lottery winners have better mental health — probably because they experience less financial stress — but may be in worse physical health, thanks to making riskier decisions. But a \u003ca href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00036846.2018.1494813\"\u003ecompeting study\u003c/a\u003e found that less-educated lottery winners have worse mental health after winning. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Cahpvj\"\u003eSo what on earth is going on?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"s1LUGp\"\u003eThe analysis by Oswald and Winkelmann is that nearly all of the research up to this point has been using samples that are too small to consistently detect real results. As a result, some of them have found results and some of them have found none; some have found results only for certain subgroups (like less-educated lottery winners) and some have found opposite results for different measures of wellbeing (like physical and mental health). But the confusion would all go away if we had enough data. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"7L0ek0\"\u003eThat’s where their own study comes in. “We have access to more winners with economically substantial winning amounts than almost any other study before us,” Oswald and Winkelmann argue. In part because people keep winning the lottery, the high-quality data from Germany used for many of these studies now has 617 lottery winners with significant earnings. (The country keeps good records on this.) That’s still not a very large sample size for complicated social science research, but it’s a whole lot better than 22, or even 137. (Counting only winnings of more than 2,500 Euros ($2,770), Oswald and Winkelmann are down to 342 winners to analyze.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"2buQFj\"\u003eUnlike many of the previous studies, they find, “All effects of interest are statistically significant.” Winning the lottery does make you happier. Winning more money has a more pronounced effect on your happiness. There’s certainly a lot more work to do in this vein, from testing non-German data sets to exploring how life satisfaction from a lotto win sticks around five or 10 years out. But if these results hold up, then the mysterious paradox that puzzled economists — why doesn’t winning money make people more happy? — might be solved. Winning money does actually make people more happy. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"DJeWKX\"\u003eThe early studies look likely to have fallen prey to a common problem in social science research — studies that aren’t powerful enough to detect effects even if there are some. A \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/3/14/11219446/psychology-replication-crisis\"\u003esurprising share of published studies are underpowered\u003c/a\u003e, meaning they collect so little data they wouldn’t find a result even if one was real. This can\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003elead to false negatives — like the result that lottery winnings don’t make people happy — and false positives, when the small sample size produces noise that is interpreted as a positive result. Making studies bigger tends to solve this, but it’s expensive — so underpowered studies are likely to plague research for some time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"V0dfsA\"\u003eSo the early research into the effects of the lottery may have gotten things wrong. But that’s not to say that every lottery winner is better off.\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eIt’s very plausible that a certain type of person is\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003evulnerable to ending up worse-off than they started (though it’s unwise to try to analyze too many subgroups of winners when you have a small sample size to start with; you’re nearly sure to turn up false positives in your results). There are certainly notorious stories of people who \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/03/terribly-sad-true-stories-lotto-winners/329903/\"\u003ewon the lottery and ended up\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2018/10/24/jack-whittaker-powerball-lottery-winners-life-was-ruined-after-m-jackpot/\"\u003emuch worse off than if they’d never won at all\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"eKw7FC\"\u003eBut on the whole, it looks like the obvious is usually true — having more money makes people less stressed and more satisfied with their life.

Smith’s physical obsession with coffee drags her out of the unsolvable candy wrapper mystery and into a Venice Beach restaurant she’d rather not be in, ordering kale and yams even though she wants steak and eggs. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"l1XXqM\"\u003e“The thing about dreams,” Smith recalls some random man explaining to her in a restaurant, “is that equations are solved in an entirely unique way, laundry stiffens in the wind, and our dead mothers appear with their backs turned.” Then she has coffee with cinnamon toast. On April Fool’s Day, she alludes to the presidential race, bringing up “the candidate” in the middle of a wandering prose poem about \u003cem\u003eAlice in Wonderland\u003c/em\u003e, dwelling on the Mad Hatter and the end of time, conceding that her logic is full of holes.\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eThen she explains how humidity has ruined her last can of Nescafé — coffee snatched away again, like Wile E. Coyote denied a bird dinner. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"IeMzp8\"\u003eAll three of Smith’s memoirs make it feel more possible to live a rich and moral life \u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"gJ0q70\"\u003eSmith’s first memoir, \u003cem\u003eJust Kids\u003c/em\u003e, which begins more or less with her arrival in New York\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eCity in the late 1960s and focuses on the years she spent living and collaborating with the photographer Robert Mapplethorpe, won the National Book Award in 2010.\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eWhen I first read it, I appreciated Smith’s skill with detail and mood, but resented her experience of the city: To me, it was another story about a New York I didn’t get to participate in. The one where rockstars roamed freely and starving artists could still afford studio space in Manhattan. The one with \u003ca href=\"https://www.cbgb.com/about\"\u003eCBGB\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"T8gtJw\"\u003eBut the problem with getting mad at Smith for having lived a life so much richer than the average person’s is that she’s also so gifted at sharing it. When she describes the best plate of huevos rancheros she’s ever had, for example, she tells a glittery, mythic story about nearly drowning in Acapulco in 1972, which also involves a ring of red hawks that may or may not have been about to kill her. (She was saved by a local chef, who proceeded to serve her the aforementioned eggs.) Someone does ask her if she’s making the story up and she tells them, emphatically, no, she didn’t even embellish. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"CaeDGz\"\u003eImagine a life you don’t have to embellish! Even reading about one makes the world shimmer with possibility, briefly, the way it seems to have done for Smith on cue. In a flashback, she remembers Pearlman telling her she should front a rock band, which she found far-fetched and “extreme” at the time. Then she remembers relaying the suggestion to Shepard, who looked her in the eye and said she could do anything. “We were all young then, and that was the general idea,” she writes. “That we could do anything.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-float-right\"\u003e\u003caside id=\"qKwWod\"\u003e\u003cq\u003e“We were all young then, and that was the general idea.

It’s about one woman’s 2016. It’s about getting older and seeing your loved ones die long before you — some of age, but more of disease and bad luck and \u003ca href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/1989/02/robert-mapplethorpe-aids-dominick-dunne\"\u003enegligence\u003c/a\u003e at the hands of an unfeeling country. Patti Smith is not a nostalgic narrator in the way we typically use the word; she’s much too smart to wish for the literal past. She comes off more like an artist whose life’s work was dreaming of a bolder and more interesting world, confronted now with the reality that many of the people around her did not want that world, and that they seem to have won out. To her credit, she doesn’t try to untangle why. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"3sclW0\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Year of the Monkey\u003c/em\u003e, while full of riddles and fantasies and characters who appear once and never again, or twice in a way that seems impossible, makes some strange sense by the time it’s done. Grief on a colossal, national scale has a way of making the most personal, quotidian sufferings feel small and unimportant. At the same time, it makes those typical human tragedies appear suddenly of a piece with the world around them, and part of the same chain of events — as though the election of Donald Trump really did thrust us into an alternate universe in which everything ripples with the nonsense of nightmare, and all of our heroes are dead. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"bdrwnX\"\u003eSmith starts the book believing in some dark magic, ends it paraphrasing the W.B. Yeats poem \u003ca href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43290/the-second-coming\"\u003e“The Second Coming,”\u003c/a\u003e which is perhaps more strongly associated with \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/10/25/16526428/joan-didion-documentary-center-will-not-hold-netflix\"\u003eJoan Didion’s famous essay\u003c/a\u003e about the crumbling of California utopianism than it is its original subject matter, the prophesied return of Christ. It’s clear she is worried sick over whether events are connected, and if so, how. But on Trump himself, Smith says very little. “The bully bellowed,” she writes of election night. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"hDAApb\"\u003eBy contrast, she writes beautifully of her friends, who have left her — as she expresses it in the epilogue — holding the bag. \u003c/p\u003e","url":"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/9/23/20839515/patti-smith-the-year-of-the-monkey-review","published":"2019-09-23T11:10:00Z","guid":"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/9/23/20839515/patti-smith-the-year-of-the-monkey-review"},{"title":"Avocado face masks, oat milk shampoo: how health food invaded the beauty aisle","content":"\u003cimg alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z_cFEHEnPeWrv4b8hO94iTQ-zUI=/23x0:1463x1080/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/65299229/Food_Beauty.0.png\" /\u003e\n\n  \u003csmall\u003eKombucha toner, oat milk shampoo, beet serum: health food is everywhere in the beauty aisle. | Sarah Lawrence for Vox\u003c/small\u003e\n\n\n  \u003cp\u003eThanks to a collective obsession with wellness and a growing concern about beauty product safety, brands are turning to trendy food ingredients — but do they actually do anything?\u0026nbsp;  \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp id=\"wnxXz5\"\u003eWhen you think of the beauty and personal care aisle at Walmart, images of deodorant, razors, and utilitarian lotion brands like Cetaphil and Jergens likely come to mind. But as of the end of August, you can also buy brightly colored bottles of skin care potions with descriptors like “super fruits watermelon hydrating juicy serum” and “honey manuka day gel cream” at the big box retailer. These products would not be out of place at Sephora or Anthropologie, based both on their looks and their ingredients. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"679JoG\"\u003eThe line of almost 30 skin care products, called \u003ca href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac\u0026amp;mid=2149\u0026amp;u1=vox\u0026amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fcp%2Fearth-to-skin%2F7286995\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eEarth to Skin\u003c/a\u003e, will be exclusive to the superstore, according to \u003ca href=\"https://www.allure.com/story/walmart-earth-to-skin-beauty-brand-products-shop\"\u003eAllure\u003c/a\u003e.

We now have kombucha toner and oat milk shampoo because of the collision of two major consumer moments: the pervasiveness of wellness culture, and the increasing fear that our beauty products are dangerous. And much like the dietary trends that many of these products are inspired by, there is often not a lot of truth to the claims about what they can do. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"CxMBvJ\"\u003eWhat foodie beauty looks like  \u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"lWrk4K\"\u003eTheresa Yee, a beauty editor at trend-forecasting agency \u003ca href=\"https://www.wgsn.com/en/\"\u003eWGSN\u003c/a\u003e, says her firm first identified the trend back in 2015. And she says it’s only “getting bigger.” Fermented ingredients, like kombucha, are newly trending in products. “And celery juice is the next matcha,” she says.\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eThis seems to be true, as gymnast Nastia Liukin just released a celery cream with \u003ca href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1516588\u0026amp;xs=1\u0026amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvolitionbeauty.com%2Fshop%2Fproducts%2Fcelery-green-cream%2F\u0026amp;referrer=vox.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eVolition\u003c/a\u003e, inspired by the celery juice her mom made for her growing up.

Pre-Olay, our ancestors smeared all sorts of edible stuff on their faces to beautify themselves. If you listened to the Dream podcast about MLMs, you know that Holiday Magic sold products in the ‘60s stuffed with fruity ingredients. Even after the dawn of high-tech skin care, edible ingredients still appeared in products, and a few years ago beauty hacks featuring DIY skin care were all the rage. You can find the stalwart (and much maligned by skin care enthusiasts) St. Ives apricot scrub on drugstore shelves, where it’s been since the 1980s. Aveeno’s brand has been based on the alleged skin-soothing properties of oatmeal since its inception. Fruits and grains are healthy. The beauty industry has relied on them off and on through the decades to promote the “goodness” of their products.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"djYH9z\"\u003eBut there are many more of them now, and they reflect the trendy foods people are eating. \u003ca href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac\u0026amp;mid=2417\u0026amp;u1=vox\u0026amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fbrand%2Fyouth-to-the-people\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYouth to the People\u003c/a\u003e’s whole skin care range uses these ingredients and includes a spirulina/blue algae/kale/spinach mask and kombucha toner. \u003ca href=\"https://www.aveeno.com/products/hair-care?utm_source=google\u0026amp;utm_medium=cpc\u0026amp;utm_campaign=GO-US-ENG-PS-Aveeno+Hair-BP-BM-RN-BRAND_CORE\u0026amp;utm_content=Core+-+Hair\u0026amp;utm_term=%2Baveeno+%2Bshampoo\u0026amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwqZPrBRBnEiwAmNJsNmjbuANTgVyjx0bpuDLbonLh6BJCd0eny3VAg9Zxv8GQ53RVZlJQyRoCQRwQAvD_BwE\u0026amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\u0026amp;ds_rl=1267934\"\u003eAveeno\u003c/a\u003e’s hair care range, launched at the beginning of this year, features collections highlighting oat milk blends, apple cider vinegar blends, blackberry quinoa, and fresh greens. \u003ca href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac\u0026amp;mid=2417\u0026amp;u1=vox\u0026amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fbanana-coconut-superfoods-shampoo-conditioner-hair-pack-P446343%3Ficid2%3Dproducts%2520grid%3Ap446343\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBriogeo\u003c/a\u003e offers shampoos and conditioners that include apple, banana, and coconut, packaged in bottles that look like drinkable yogurt.

But the term is pretty \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/10/31/18037756/superfoods-food-science-marion-nestle-book\"\u003emeaningless\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"xBqTlp\"\u003e“‘Superfood’ is an arbitrary definition. It’s a marketing term,” says David Tyrrell, a global skincare analyst at \u003ca href=\"https://www.mintel.com/blog/personal-care-market-news/foodie-skincare-gains-momentum\"\u003eMintel\u003c/a\u003e, a market research firm. But it’s been so pervasive for so many years that consumers now take it at face value. Beauty brands have capitalized on the halo of health these ingredients have to sell products in a new way. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"zoy9Rg\"\u003eUltimately, the origin of the trend goes back to the popularity of wellness in general. The elusive pursuit of wellness, which includes ingesting all sorts of herbs and plants via actual food or, increasingly, \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/4/9/17199164/beauty-vitamin-collagen-turmeric-biotin\"\u003esupplements\u003c/a\u003e, is now itself mainstream. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"S3YzXA\"\u003e“Consumers\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eunderstand the ingredients in food and understand they have benefits when you eat them. They are now looking for these ingredients in their beauty products,” Yee says, explaining that it’s a truism that what you eat reflects on the condition of your skin, so it would seem to make sense that putting healthy ingredients on your skin would do the same. Or at least that is what beauty brands assume consumers will think. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"GERjOy\"\u003eThe other factor that helped this trend take hold is the increasing \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2018/9/18/17866150/natural-clean-beauty-products-feinstein-cosmetics-bill-fda\"\u003edistrust\u003c/a\u003e that consumers have about the safety of beauty products, which are not as heavily regulated in the US as they are in other countries. “Clean” beauty is on the upswing, with brands starting to proclaim that they only use safe ingredients and retailers like Sephora and CVS policing ingredients they deem to be undesirable. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"KCXbqM\"\u003e“Consumers are overwhelmed by this concern that ingredients could be unsafe. At this juncture, consumers who use beauty products perceive natural ingredients are safer,” says Tyrell.

Plus, the words “natural” and “clean” are just as meaningless as “superfood,” with no officially sanctioned definition. But “pumpkin” and “pomegranate” are more familiar and comforting than “pentylene glycol” at this point. Products still contain these traditional compounds, but the natural stuff is what you’ll see in big print on the jar. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"f6V9U7\"\u003eGlow Recipe has roots in \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/1/17/17450044/korean-skin-care-10-step-routine\"\u003eKorean beauty\u003c/a\u003e, another factor influencing the trend. According to Mintel, Asian countries like South Korea, Japan, and China have incorporated ingredients like ginger and green tea into their beauty products for decades. South Korea also has a heritage of whimsical packaging that makes using the products fun. Tonymoly has a \u003ca href=\"https://tonymoly.us/collections/body/products/haeyo-mayo-hair-nutrition-mask\"\u003ehair mask\u003c/a\u003e product that looks like a squeeze bottle of mayo, and its hand cream packed in a jar shaped like a peach is beloved among its fans. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"8Sh8TJ\"\u003eGlow Recipe co-founder Sarah Lee calls the concept “skintertainment” and notes that “sensoriality” has always been important in K-beauty. “Pampering your skin and yourself should be enjoyable and fun, not a chore,” she says.

In the US, products are required to be listed in the order of concentration, from high to low, though ingredients present at 1 percent or less can be listed in any order. She says a rough rule of thumb is to search out the preservative ingredients, which are commonly compounds like phenoxyethanol, potassium sorbate, and ethylhexylglycerin.

Acids are well known and studied for their exfoliating properties and are used in tons of products now.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"30GZAW\"\u003eSo it’s not necessarily that the products don’t do anything. It’s just that sometimes they work in spite of — not because of — the tiny concentration of whatever superfood ingredient is touted on the label. So many products contain common ingredients like glycerin, which ultimately keeps skin hydrated better and more efficiently than any exotic jackfruit extract.

Unlike drugs, skin care makers don’t need to prove that something works. Some companies do send out completed products for clinical testing, so they can make claims like “reduces 30% of wrinkles in 60 days” or whatever, but that’s rare.

But it lost Directing (to the \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/8/31/17800832/ozark-season-2-review-recap-netflix-jason-bateman\"\u003eincredibly same-y visuals of \u003cem\u003eOzark\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e!) and it couldn’t manage to best Julia Garner (again of \u003cem\u003eOzark\u003c/em\u003e) in Supporting Actress or overcome its own network mate \u003cem\u003eSuccession\u003c/em\u003e in Writing. And that’s to say nothing of the lead acting races, where it was thought to have less of a chance at winning (it did, indeed, lose both, to \u003cem\u003eKilling Eve\u003c/em\u003e’s Jodie Comer and \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/9/22/20879262/emmys-2019-billy-porter-win-speech-pose\"\u003e\u003cem\u003ePose\u003c/em\u003e’s Billy Porter\u003c/a\u003e).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"lciX9D\"\u003eWhat has to be most galling to the folks behind \u003cem\u003eGame of Thrones\u003c/em\u003e is that a resounding night at the Primetime Emmys was supposed to be the best argument they’d have going forward against the idea that the final season was \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/5/27/18639229/game-of-thrones-finale-disappointing-the-iron-throne-recap\"\u003ekind of bad\u003c/a\u003e.

But then consider that Dinklage overcame two of his castmates to win his category, and that \u003cem\u003eGame of Thrones\u003c/em\u003e lost the Writing category (where it had but one nomination and when the scripts were by far the most criticized element of the final season).

But though six of her eight acting Emmys are for her starring role on \u003cem\u003eVeep\u003c/em\u003e, she didn’t win for the show’s final season of eligibility.

In 2017, the day after she won her sixth \u003cem\u003eVeep\u003c/em\u003e Emmy, she was diagnosed with breast cancer.

But after she lost the Emmy to Waller-Bridge, when she and the rest of the cast of \u003cem\u003eVeep\u003c/em\u003e arrived on stage to present a different award, she seemed to take it all in stride, cracking jokes in character as Selina Meyer: She lamented that she’d been told she’d be up there alone to present, and referred to co-star Timothy Simons as “Jonah,” his character’s name.

Roll the dough: On a lightly floured surface, divide the dough into equal-sized balls. Working with one ball of dough at a time, roll into a 8-inch wide circle. Transfer the first pizza to the tray and walk it over to your grill. Using the pastry brush, oil one side of the dough all over, then, working quickly and gently, place the dough, oil-side down, on the grill. Don\u0026#x2019;t touch it! Let it sit there for 30 seconds to 1 minute. It needs time to set. After about 30 seconds, brush oil on the exposed side. Once you see bubbles start to form, using a spatula, take a peek until the dough and check out the color. It should be golden and slightly charred. Flip it over! Now, carefully spoon about 1/4 cup of the mornay sauce all over in an even layer. Drizzle about 1/4 of the egg mixture over the top and let it sit for another 30 seconds, then add some bacon. Let it sit there until the egg has lightly set, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and sprinkle on some parsley. Crack over some pepper and zest on some lemon. Finish with some freshly grated Pecorino and repeat with the remaining dough and ingredients. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e Get recipes like this and more in the Munchies Recipes newsletter.

Venus clashes with Saturn, the planet of commitments, and you can really take your relationships seriously in a way that helps you garner respect.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cdiv class=\"article__media--image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1539034914646-taurus.jpeg\" alt=\"1539034914646-taurus\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e \u003ch2\u003e Taurus (April 19 - May 20)\u003c/h2\u003e \u003cp\u003eGetting into a habit is nice, isn\u0026#x2019;t it? Taurus, you are a sign that finds what you like and sticks to it. Seeing the same people everyday or eating your favorite food every meal brings you comfort. You\u0026#x2019;re a creature of habit. Libra season helps you master these habits in a way that takes you far. Your planetary ruler Venus clashes with Saturn, planet of time, and you can make a commitment to your health or work that allows you to have time to go out and see the world or even take on extracurricular studies. Maybe you can invest your time in a way that helps you take your skillset to the next level. The new moon on Saturday is a wonderful opportunity to make or break habits.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cdiv class=\"article__media--image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1539034930110-gemini.jpeg\" alt=\"1539034930110-gemini\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e \u003ch2\u003e Gemini (May 20 - June 21)\u003c/h2\u003e \u003cp\u003e After all of the housekeeping and self-care that Virgo season hath wrought, Libra season makes time for something more lighthearted. Of course taking care of your private life was fun, but now that you\u0026#x2019;re feeling a little more grounded, it\u0026#x2019;s time to invite your friends (or lovers) over to see your new space! The coming weeks are some of the most sparkly and creative times of the year\u0026#x2014;take on a new creative project or ask someone out around the new moon on Saturday. This is all about what makes you happy, and your friendships, too. Socializing is necessary for mental health, I\u0026#x2019;m sure you know, so nurture your friendships and prioritize your sex life.

As the sun moves into Libra, it occupies the sector of your chart that rules your home and family. Your private life becomes your primary focus as you ground yourself in your most precious relationships, be it with your family members or those you share a home with. The new moon in Libra is a great time to have a conversation with said partners to make sure you\u0026#x2019;re able to get the rest you need to live your life as the legend you are! Venus, the planet of love, clashes with taskmaster Saturn, and you\u0026#x2019;re making a pretty active change to be responsible more responsible toward others.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cdiv class=\"article__media--image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1539034953104-leo.jpeg\" alt=\"1539034953104-leo\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e \u003ch2\u003e Leo (July 22 - August 23)\u003c/h2\u003e \u003cp\u003eVirgo season had you taking a hard look at your financial situation, and now Libra season has you busy planning and thinking about how to support yourself. Your acquaintances, neighbors, and even people you encounter on your daily commute, are more important than you think, and can be a great resource to you. Both Venus and Mercury gently harmonize with lucky Jupiter, showing that you can say the right thing to be put in touch with a world of infinite possibility. You can charm and flirt your way into power very gracefully. Venus clashes with taskmaster Saturn, showing an important agreement or commitment to your wellness being made, whether it\u0026#x2019;s a role at work or something like a gym membership!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"article__media--image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1539034965147-virgo.jpeg\" alt=\"1539034965147-virgo\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e \u003ch2\u003e Virgo (August 23 - September 22)\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow that Virgo season is over, it\u0026#x2019;s time for you to consider the ways you can support yourself. Libra season highlights the relationships that would make you feel rich even if you were a trillion dollars in debt. This is also a good time to evaluate your relationship to money and the material world in general. Venus, the planet of love and money, clashes with responsible Saturn, which makes it a little easier to take your values seriously\u0026#x2014;being practical comes naturally. The new moon on Saturday shows a new and refreshed energy toward your finances, which can be an exhausting topic.

(Some cases involve other, smaller companies.) Plattenberger and his firm, TorHoerman Law, have mostly been filing e-cigarette lawsuits for clients who say they have contracted \u003ca href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/5gjq5a/some-e-cig-flavors-can-give-you-popcorn-lung-apparently-vgtrn\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ebronchiolitis obliterans (a.k.a. popcorn lung)\u003c/a\u003e, an obstruction of the lungs\u0026apos; smallest airways that can be caused by chemical particles. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e But they\u0026apos;re also entertaining the idea of pursuing other vape-proximal litigation: TorHoerman\u0026apos;s website already features an extensive outline overviewing potential consequences of using JUUL, and vaping in general. The number of calls, Plattenberger said, has been steadily growing amid the \u003ca href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ne8eqq/vaping-deaths-2019-is-vaping-safe\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eongoing panic over vape-linked deaths\u003c/a\u003e attributed to a seemingly new, mysterious ailment. (At the moment, he said, the firm probably fields in the range of 20 to 50 vape-related calls every day.) Plattenberger said he\u0026apos;d actually anticipated this moment for years. That is, doctors simply did not know what they were looking at when they came across vape-related lung illnesses in the past, he said, arguing the \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/06/health/third-death-vaping-related-disease.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003erecent spate\u003c/a\u003e of cases was less of a seemingly overnight explosion than a belated recognition by parents and clinicians. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e One thing\u0026apos;s for certain: The vape panic of 2019 is fresh, fertile, and potentially extremely lucrative ground for personal injury attorneys, who suggested it won\u0026apos;t just spur the government to go on a regulatory binge but could also produce millions of dollars for their clients and firms.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e Ned McWilliams, an attorney and shareholder at the Florida-based Levin Papantonio, where he focuses heavily on pharmaceutical litigation, echoed Plattenberger\u0026apos;s account. \u0026quot;I\u0026apos;ve been a lawyer for about 13 or 14 years now, and of all the projects I\u0026apos;ve ever worked on, I\u0026apos;ve never seen such an outpouring of people seeking help,\u0026quot; he said. \u0026quot;I\u0026apos;m not exaggerating when I say that I talk to at least 10 families a day.\u0026quot;\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e Attention from the press has exacerbated whatever potential litigants might have done on their own, unprompted, lawyers said.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e \u0026quot;I think lots of parents are seeing what\u0026apos;s going on in the news, and they\u0026apos;re going through their kids\u0026apos; backpacks, and they\u0026apos;re looking at what they thought was a USB stick and realizing it\u0026apos;s not a USB stick,\u0026quot; McWilliams continued. \u0026quot;That\u0026apos;s a story I hear quite a bit.\u0026quot;\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e Especially now that the FDA \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/09/health/vaping-juul-e-cigarettes-fda.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehas formally stated\u003c/a\u003e that JUUL broke federal regulations by explicitly targeting young people\u0026#x2014;an allegation it denies\u0026#x2014;parents and their nicotine-dependent children can more easily blame the vaping company for getting them hooked. The media seems to report a brand-new one every day: A Kansas man \u003ca href=\"https://www.kctv5.com/news/local_news/kansas-man-who-goes-through-juul-pods-a-week-files/article_d22f5b8c-d9a1-11e9-abfe-1b85cbff44cb.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehas filed a class-action lawsuit\u003c/a\u003e revealing that he goes through nearly five pods a day.

I\u0026apos;ve sued them in Florida. I\u0026apos;ve sued them in California. I\u0026apos;m suing them all over the place\u0026#x2014;and I\u0026apos;m suing the vape shops, too, who have sold these things to underage kids. How many cases will be in state court? That has a set of rules. How many cases will be in federal court? That has a set of rules. How many cases will be for addiction? \u003ci\u003e I can\u0026apos;t get off this stuff\u003c/i\u003e.

Yet all of the lawyers VICE spoke to emphasized their reluctance at solely blaming JUUL for the current health epidemic, and the company has long shunned the idea that it has gone after kids. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e \u0026quot;We have never marketed to youth and do not want any non-nicotine users to try our products,\u0026quot; Ted Kwong, a spokesperson for JUUL Labs, said in a statement. \u0026quot;These suits largely copy and paste unfounded allegations previously raised in other lawsuits, which we have been actively contesting for over a year. These cases are without merit, and we will defend our mission throughout this process.\u0026quot; \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e We\u0026apos;ll soon learn more about that.

He could have as many as 57 backers, compared with Netanyahu\u0026#8217;s 55.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaverick politician Avigdor Lieberman, head of the mid-size Yisrael Beitenu party, controls the final eight seats, making him the key powerbroker. But he announced Sunday that he isn\u0026#8217;t endorsing either candidate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe endorsement by the Joint List, a bloc of four small Arab parties that controls 13 seats, marked a turning point in Israeli politics. Arab parties have traditionally refrained from endorsing a candidate for prime minister, and they have never sat in a coalition government, not wanting to be seen as legitimizing Israeli policies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough many Israeli Arabs remain angry at Gantz for leading the military\u0026#8217;s devastating war against Gaza militants in 2014, their fury toward Netanyahu runs much deeper. Netanyahu\u0026#8217;s campaign repeatedly accused the Arabs of trying to \u0026#8220;steal\u0026#8221; the election, drawing accusations of racism and incitement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is also deep-seated anger over a law passed by Netanyahu\u0026#8217;s government in 2018 that declared Israel to be the nation-state of the Jewish people. Arabs believe the law codifies discrimination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough the Arab parties are still expected to stay out of Gantz\u0026#8217;s future government, their endorsement reflects a growing desire of Israel\u0026#8217;s large Arab minority to take a more active role in shaping the country.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn an op-ed piece in The New York Times, Ayman Odeh, the leader of the Joint List, argued that his move should end Netanyahu\u0026#8217;s political career and provide a watershed moment for Israel\u0026#8217;s Arab minority.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;If the center-left parties of Israel believe that Arab Palestinian citizens have a place in this country, they must accept that we have a place in its politics,\u0026#8221; he wrote. \u0026#8220;There is no shared future without the full and equal participation of Arab Palestinian citizens.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNetanyahu reacted by saying: \u0026#8220;As we warned, the Arab parties that oppose Israel as a Jewish and democratic state and glorify terrorists recommended Gantz for prime minister.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Arab parties\u0026#8217; decision does not guarantee Gantz will be prime minister. The president usually appoints the candidate with the most supporters, but not necessarily. Rivlin has wide discretion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn last week\u0026#8217;s vote, Blue and White won 33 seats, while Likud took 31.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe deciding factor looks to be Lieberman, who is demanding a broad unity government with the two major parties that will be secular and exclude the ultra-Orthodox Jewish parties and Arabs. That appears to be the compromise emerging between Blue and White and Likud, though both are insisting upon leading it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComplicating matters is Blue and White\u0026#8217;s refusal to sit with Netanyahu because he faces a likely indictment on corruption charges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdeh said he is planning on becoming opposition leader in the case of a unity government. As the leader of the largest party in opposition, he would be entitled to the position, which includes meetings with visiting world leaders and access to sensitive security information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRivlin has not indicated which way he is leading. But he said he interpreted the will of the people as yearning for a \u0026#8220;stable\u0026#8221; government. \u0026#8220;And there can\u0026#8217;t be a stable government without the two big parties,\u0026#8221; the 80-year-old president said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast week\u0026#8217;s vote was Israel\u0026#8217;s second election in five months. Netanyahu was unable to form a coalition after April\u0026#8217;s balloting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn calling a new election, Netanyahu had hoped to secure a narrow majority of hard-line and religious parties that would grant him immunity from prosecution on charges that could include bribery, breach of trust and fraud. But now that possibility appears to be off the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIsraeli law does not require a sitting premier to resign if indicted. But if he is charged, as is widely expected, he will come under heavy pressure to step down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/time/topstories/~4/pGZm6M2uv_g\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/pGZm6M2uv_g/","published":"2019-09-23T01:21:35Z","guid":"http://time.com/?p=5683612"},{"title":"The Albanian Quake Has Had 340 Aftershocks and People Are Afraid to go Home","content":"\u003caside class=\"right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad\" id=\"right-rail__ad-5683614\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module video-2\" data-src=\"https://time.com/5683614/albania-earthquake-aftershocks/\" data-widget-id=\"SB_4\" data-ob-template=\"timemag\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTIRANA, Albania (AP) \u0026mdash; Fear and safety hazards kept many residents of Albania\u0026#8217;s capital of Tirana and the port city of Durres out of their homes Sunday after an earthquake the day before injured 105 people and damaged hundreds of buildings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlbania\u0026#8217;s Institute of Geosciences, Energy, Water and Environment said more than 340 aftershocks have followed the 5.8 magnitude earthquake that hit Saturday afternoon near Durres.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbout 600 houses, most built before 1990, suffered damage in the quake, which also temporarily knocked out power and water facilities in Tirana, Durres and some western and central districts, authorities said.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe U.S. Geological Survey and the European-Mediterranean Seismological Center recorded the rupture on Albania\u0026#8217;s western Adriatic Sea coast as a magnitude 5.6 quake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was felt along the western coast and far to the east.

Officials tied to SoftBank \u003ca href=\"https://time.com/5683452/wework-board-adam-neumann/\" \u003ewant Neumann to step down as CEO\u003c/a\u003e, according to reports over the weekend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoftBank and its Vision Fund are WeWork\u0026rsquo;s biggest investors, with a stake of around 29% in We Co., the company\u0026rsquo;s official name. That support is a key reason why this real-estate rental company fetched a $47 billion valuation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo SoftBank, WeWork was a unicorn on the rise. Its corporate peccadilloes, which largely revolve around corporate governance, appear to have been ignored by executives at the Japanese company: WeWork was a unicorn and SoftBank just had to be part of it. So SoftBank kept pouring in more money, just as it did with other great startups like Uber Technologies Inc., Didi Chuxing and Slack Technologies Inc. At one point SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son described WeWork as the next Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. in reference to the fortune he made from investing in Jack Ma\u0026rsquo;s Chinese e-commerce giant.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0026rsquo;t until WeWork filed its IPO prospectus in August that the rest of the world saw in clear daylight what SoftBank\u0026rsquo;s common sense-radar had failed to detect when it signed each check. As \u003ca href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-08-14/wework-ipo-shows-it-s-the-most-magical-unicorn\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy colleague Shira Ovide wrote at the time\u003c/a\u003e, the list of \u0026ldquo;transactions involving a company\u0026rsquo;s CEO or other insiders is astonishing for WeWork.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmong them: Neumann\u0026rsquo;s wife is one of two or three people who get to choose a successor if he is incapacitated; the CEO owns stakes in some of the office buildings that WeWork leases; and at least two members of Neumann\u0026rsquo;s family did work for the company\u0026rsquo;s Creator Awards, which its biggest outside shareholder committed $180 million to fund.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat outside shareholder is none other than SoftBank \u0026ndash; a stark reminder that Masayoshi Son and his team not only knew of these dealings, it actively enabled them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause these red flags have spooked other investors, WeWork is looking more like it\u0026rsquo;ll fetch $15 billion when it eventually lists. So \u003cem\u003enow\u003c/em\u003e SoftBank cares, to the tune of a $9 billion lower value on its stake. It\u0026rsquo;s too late to exit WeWork. But it\u0026rsquo;s not too late to exit Neumann.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComparisons to Uber are inevitable. Co-founder Travis Kalanick faced numerous complaints about his erratic management style and questionable judgment. SoftBank\u0026rsquo;s entry into into the ride-hailing giant\u0026rsquo;s capitalization table was part of the solution to a problem. Son bought out a lot of Kalanick\u0026rsquo;s stake, giving other shareholders and board members leverage to push out the CEO and replace him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn WeWork\u0026rsquo;s case, it may be that Son himself is wielding the cutlass. According to CNBC, his maneuver is seen by some as part of an effort to stop a planned IPO altogether. Last week I discussed why halting the IPO might be good for SoftBank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as a new CEO helped revive sentiment toward Uber, and prepare it for a successful IPO, Son is likely betting that simply getting rid of Neumann and pretending that will fix things should be enough to juice the valuation when a listing does eventually happen. And should installing a new CEO result in, say, a $25 billion valuation instead of $15 billion, then that would be a $3 billion win for SoftBank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet this recent maneuvering by SoftBank suggests the concern isn\u0026rsquo;t WeWork\u0026rsquo;s funky corporate structure, but that public-market investors \u003cem\u003edon\u0026rsquo;t like\u003c/em\u003e this funky corporate structure. It\u0026rsquo;s like a kid not being sorry for dipping his hand in the cookie jar, but for getting caught.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt tells us also that SoftBank is tone deaf. WeWork\u0026rsquo;s structure should have raised red flags even before it decided to pump billions into the company. It could have gone straight to Neumann and the existing board and pushed for change, because that\u0026rsquo;s the kind of power a big stack bully with a $100 billion checkbook wields.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, it looks like SoftBank\u0026rsquo;s biggest concern was the Vision Fund\u0026rsquo;s much-vaunted internal rate of return.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s very possible this WeWork saga will be a wake-up call to SoftBank. Maybe now they\u0026rsquo;ll be clear-sighted enough to spot landmines before they hit them \u0026ndash; instead of boldly barreling down the unicorn highway in the belief that speed negates any need for caution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut with plans for a second $100 billion Vision Fund, prospective investors will be asking if they want to bet on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/time/topstories/~4/PK9Xy_9glHM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/PK9Xy_9glHM/","published":"2019-09-23T11:38:06Z","guid":"http://time.com/?p=5683903"},{"title":"Australia Is Using New Technology to Catch Drivers on Phones","content":"\u003caside class=\"right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad\" id=\"right-rail__ad-5683862\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module\" data-src=\"https://time.com/5683862/australia-technology-drivers-driving-phones/\" data-widget-id=\"SB_2\" data-ob-template=\"timemag\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCANBERRA, Australia (AP) \u0026mdash; An Australian state is attempting to persuade people to put down their smartphones while driving by rolling out cameras to prosecute distracted motorists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNew South Wales Roads Minister Andrew Constance said Monday that Australia\u0026#8217;s most populous state is the first jurisdiction in the world to use such technology to punish drivers distracted by social media, text messages or phone calls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoad safety experts are alarmed at the growing prevalence of accidents involving drivers using smartphones on New South Wales roads.

Only Costa Rica has more cyclists suspended by the sport\u0026#8217;s world governing body than Colombia. The suspension added to doubts that first surfaced in 2017 after the World Anti-Doping Agency revoked the license of a government-run lab responsible for all doping tests in Colombia and the ban this year of the country\u0026#8217;s premier international team, Manzana Postobon, which prided itself on clean cycling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePart of the problem is the ease with which Colombian cyclists can find an artificial boost: at their local pharmacy.

And we\u0026#8217;ve seen some additional (mostly female) anger and (mostly male) self-flagellation since #MeToo started sweeping through the industry in the fall of 2017. Yet the negative vibes emanating from the Microsoft Theater, this time, felt different\u0026mdash;more mean-spirited and nihilistic than contrite. So many elements of the ceremony radiated apathy or derision toward TV in general. Presenter pairings often seemed random. Bill Hader\u0026#8217;s observation that \u0026#8220;a limited series is a show that was canceled\u0026#8221; dripped cynicism (even if, with so little competition, it was one of the funniest things said all night). Lennon\u0026#8217;s mostly inane jokes recalled the mocking narration on \u003cem\u003eLove Island\u003c/em\u003e (even if he did get in some good digs at Fox owners the Murdoch family after \u003cem\u003eSuccession \u003c/em\u003ewon a writing award).

I cringed watching Phoebe Waller-Bridge deliver boilerplate jokes while presenting an award because the lines she writes for herself\u0026mdash;and even her running acceptance-speech gag about how excruciating every part of her job on \u003cem\u003eFleabag \u003c/em\u003ehad been\u0026mdash;are so much better than what the Emmys writers scripted for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026#8217;s an argument to be made, I guess, that this was Fox honoring its roots as an irreverent broadcast upstart; Homer Simpson did kick off the show, after all. You wouldn\u0026#8217;t be wrong, either, to note that humility is \u003cem\u003ede rigueur\u003c/em\u003e for the entertainment industry these days. And yet, Fox wasn\u0026#8217;t shy about promoting its own fall lineup.

Maybe we were tasting the sour grapes of a network that \u003ca href=\"https://deadline.com/2019/05/tv-ratings-2018-2019-season-totals-viewers-demo-cbs-nbc-1202620062/\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003edidn\u0026#8217;t have a single nominee among the televised categories\u003c/a\u003e.

The cable channel was part of the 21st Century Fox stable that Disney acquired earlier this year.) Over the course of the past two decades, Peak TV has made the Emmys increasingly competitive; now, they\u0026#8217;re a race that the broadcast networks are no longer automatically positioned to qualify for, much less win.

They opted to dole out a single acting award to the most decorated actor in the show\u0026#8217;s cast. On Sunday night, Dinklage set a record for most wins in his category with a fourth trophy.

However, many young people today are not being taught how to think critically, to reason, or even to understand our nation\u0026#8217;s founding principles. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBilly Planer founded Etgar 36 in 2002 in an effort to educate students on America’s history and to teach youth how to have meaningful discussions around critical issues. Planer joins The Daily Signal podcast to explain how Etgar 36\u0026#8217;s cross-country student journey accomplishes just that. Listen to the full episode of \u0026#8220;The Daily Signal Podcast\u0026#8221; or read a lightly edited transcript below. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://player.pippa.io/5d6086695cbc0d0a41f6a9c4?theme=default\u0026#038;cover=1\u0026#038;latest=1\" frameBorder=\"0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"318px\" allow=\"autoplay\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRob Bluey: We are joined by Billy Planer, the founder and director of Etgar 36.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBilly, thanks for joining us.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBilly Planer:\u003c/strong\u003e Thank you for having me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBluey: Well, Billy, Etgar 36 can be traced all the way back to 1995 when you began to take a group of youth on weekend trips to visit various cities around America, and through those experiences you learned about history and culture of that city. But you officially launched as a nonprofit in 2002 and since that time you\u0026#8217;ve traveled with hundreds of student groups with the goal of exposing them to various political thought leaders and philosophies on both sides of the aisle, and I\u0026#8217;m pleased to say that The Heritage Foundation was among one of your stops recently.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eSo share with us a little bit more about Etgar 36 and what you hope to accomplish.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePlaner:\u003c/strong\u003e Sure. So in this day and age of heated rhetoric and, you know, to make your point, you have to yell louder. And for me to be right, you have to be wrong and I have to demonize you. Really, the genesis of Etgar was, could we calm the speech, the debate in America, and could it be that we\u0026#8217;d just find the humanity in each other, that it\u0026#8217;s OK to disagree in this political correctness world. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI think sometimes we are afraid to disagree and what we try and teach the teenagers on our summer trip, which is the trip that goes all the way across America and they meet with opposing sides of debate—pro-life, pro-choice, pro-guns, and pro-gun control advocates—is it\u0026#8217;s OK to disagree. It\u0026#8217;s how you disagree that could be rude. It\u0026#8217;s not rude to disagree. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd in fact, I do believe part of the setup of America, part of the roll of the dice that our Founding Fathers added when they created this country, gave power to the people that we would engage with each other.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo there should be a vibrant debate. But where we\u0026#8217;ve gone to in this country is probably not where they wanted us to go, where we go to our tribal corners and just yell at each other or don\u0026#8217;t even talk to each other. We just shut down when speaking with somebody who has an opposing viewpoint. So that\u0026#8217;s what the trip is all about. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThen during the academic year, we take groups from seventh-graders, to empty nesters to people who haven\u0026#8217;t been in seventh grade for a long time on the civil rights trips to the Southeast, Atlanta, Montgomery, Birmingham, Selma, and engage in learning the history of the civil rights movement. But realize, that history is just prologue. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe are dealing with these issues today and what happens when we marginalize somebody? What happens when we make somebody \u0026#8220;the other\u0026#8221; instead of another human being? We see that playing out, unfortunately, throughout the decades since the civil rights movement. So that\u0026#8217;s really what the trips are all about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVirginia Allen:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eBilly, would you just tell us a little bit more about where you all go on the trips? Who are the people that you\u0026#8217;re talking with? What are the issues that you\u0026#8217;re really asking both young people and adults to engage around?\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003ePlaner:\u003c/strong\u003e On the summer trip with the teenagers, it\u0026#8217;s a five-week journey across America and we start in Atlanta and head all the way west, ending in San Francisco and then starting to head back east and then actually end the journey, end the trip in Washington, D.C. And that\u0026#8217;s when we meet with \u003ca href=\"https://www.heritage.org\"\u003eThe Heritage Foundation.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, the issue that we meet with The Heritage Foundation about is income and inequality and the gap between the have and the have nots or the 1%, 99%. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOn our summer trip, we had been talking about Occupy Wall Street, so we meet with The Heritage Foundation who explained the conservative right opinion on income inequality. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut in Boston, about three days before we met with United for a Fair Economy, [we] heard their side of the debate, which is we have to close the gap and how they want to close it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe meet with Guns and America every year I think. I often think, perhaps this is going to be the last time we have to talk about this, but our country keeps bringing the [gun] debate up. We meet in Denver, Colorado, with a man named Tom Mouser, his son was shot and killed at Columbine High School. Tom \u0026#8230; has gone on to become a major gun control advocate, and you see him on the news every time there\u0026#8217;s a shooting. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo we meet with him at Columbine High School, he tells his story and his views on guns and then we, two days later, we meet in Utah with Clarke Aposhin, who is the only person in America who is allowed to have a bump stock. He sued the government to keep his bump stock. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHe was a lobbyist with the NRA, now he\u0026#8217;s a lobbyist for gun rights in Utah. He is a gun safety instructor. So we have that debate. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe meet with Pro Life Texas and then we meet with Planned Parenthood to discuss the issue of abortion. So it\u0026#8217;s those kinds of debates going on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd then we also just deal with issues like hunger in America, literacy in America. We meet with a man in San Francisco who [was] 44 years old when he learned how to read because a person took one hour a week to work with him. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHe had been socially promoted through school back in the day and he just basically left school, got a job in construction. But when he hurt his back and realized he could not be in construction anymore, he had to find jobs, and this is where it gets scary. This is where we really try and teach the teenagers [that] we are all connected. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHere\u0026#8217;s a gentleman in San Francisco who was illiterate, but had a job working in a medical facility, making sure the right pills were going in the right bottles for your medicine. He couldn\u0026#8217;t read. He would just sort of count up letters and hope he was getting them right. Well, that impacts us. So we really talk about the fact that there are, as we call them, invisible people, people we may never know or see that impact our lives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo maybe it\u0026#8217;s best for all of us to help them have or make sure that they have the best life that they can have \u0026#8230; because it will impact us, in a way. Those are the type of work organizations and places we see. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0026#8217;re in Las Vegas and we meet with the SEIU [Service Employees International Union], the union out there, the hospitality and culinary union, and discuss and debate unions in America and whether they\u0026#8217;re effective and timely now. But we also see the work that goes on to teach the hotel employees because every night of the summer trip we are in a hotel and magically when the kids come back to their room, their room is cleaned up. And so they see the work and effort that goes into those jobs that we often take for granted.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBluey: Thank you for explaining the structure of the program. It is truly fascinating to hear more about how it all works. I\u0026#8217;m curious, though, can you [tell us] what one of those conversations is like \u0026#8230; after you talk to somebody who\u0026#8217;s in favor of gun control and then you talk to somebody who\u0026#8217;s on the complete opposite side of that? What are the interactions like between these speakers and the students?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePlaner:\u003c/strong\u003e The first four days of the trip are the civil rights through the Southeast. And on the fifth day we get to Dallas, Texas. And that is where the teens are going to meet with Pro Life Texas. And most of the teams will tell you that they consider themselves pro-choice. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI got to say \u0026#8230; I\u0026#8217;m not sure how much in-depth research they\u0026#8217;ve done to come up with that. I think it\u0026#8217;s more a gut level and also being a teenager that they feel that way. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd after the first four days of the civil rights [portion of the trip], we sit down the\u0026#8230; with Pro Life Texas and that meeting will be counterbalanced with Planned Parenthood later in the trip.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI sit and speak with the kids and say, the civil rights meetings with the people who worked with King, strategized with Dr. King, that sort of emotional politics, that\u0026#8217;s sort of easy to be engaged with and to stick your flag in the ground and say, \u0026#8220;I stand on the rights of equality. \u0026#8230; People should be able to sit where they want and go into restaurants.\u0026#8221;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0026#8217;s the easy stomach hit. Now we\u0026#8217;re going to get to the hard politics and those are the issues that we\u0026#8217;re confronting today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo as I tell them that night, \u0026#8220;Tomorrow you\u0026#8217;re going to meet with Pro Life Texas, and I want to change the way we think in America, what success is in a discussion and debate. Because this gentleman who was the executive director of Pro Life Texas, you\u0026#8217;re really not going to change his mind tomorrow. He\u0026#8217;s not really going to hear something from a 16-year-old where he\u0026#8217;s going to say, \u0026#8216;Oh, you know what? You are right. I am pro-choice now.\u0026#8217; So we need to get away from the idea that success is that he changes his mind or defeat is that we change our mind. But success could be that we engage in this discussion and can we at least see we don\u0026#8217;t have to \u0026#8230; agree with where he\u0026#8217;s coming from, but can we understand where he\u0026#8217;s coming from.\u0026#8221;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, can we make a human connection and see what is his life story? Where is he coming from? And for a lot of these teenagers to hear somebody basing life choices on religion, on the Bible, is a new phenomenon for them. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAll of a sudden it goes from what may have been a joke or a punchline of a joke to reality and they see, \u0026#8220;Oh, OK, so this person lives their life this way. I\u0026#8217;ve sort of dismissed that in the past offhandedly, but you know what? He\u0026#8217;s a good guy. I just disagree with him.\u0026#8221; So that\u0026#8217;s really the mindset that the kids go into the discussions with.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, we talk about, as we talked earlier about, the concept of it is OK to agree to disagree. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo the game that\u0026#8217;s going on is not what\u0026#8217;s going on with our media where whoever yells loudest wins, but the game in our discussions is, \u0026#8220;Can I take in the information that this speaker is giving to me, connect it with the information I already have in my head, the feelings and opinions I have in my head?\u0026#8221; \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd \u0026#8230; one of these things is going to happen: I\u0026#8217;m going to listen to them and go, \u0026#8220;You know what? They\u0026#8217;re right. I do see it that way,\u0026#8221; and change my opinion. No. 2, I\u0026#8217;m going to talk a little bit about [how] I think I can incorporate some of that. Some of that I cannot. Or three, I hear him, I understand what he\u0026#8217;s saying, but it\u0026#8217;s not where I am. \u0026#8220;Thanks for letting me challenge my own opinions, but I\u0026#8217;m going to stay where I am.\u0026#8221;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo that\u0026#8217;s what our debates are really all about. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThen we also talk about how to ask a question civilly. There\u0026#8217;s not going to be the gotcha moments that rarely happen. And in actuality, when the cameras aren\u0026#8217;t there and it\u0026#8217;s not scripted, it\u0026#8217;s actually rude. It\u0026#8217;s a conversation stopper. It\u0026#8217;s not continuing the conversation. And I believe that we\u0026#8217;ll be OK as long as we keep the conversation going, it\u0026#8217;s when we stop talking to each other that we\u0026#8217;re going to start to get in trouble.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAllen: Thank you for sharing that. That\u0026#8217;s such a powerful way to go about framing that discussion. Really simple, but incredibly profound. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCan you tell us about a particular student who you have seen be really impacted by the Etgar 36 experience?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePlaner:\u003c/strong\u003e The anecdotal evidence of the success of the trip \u0026#8230; there are so many. This was our 17th summer. So the oldest alumni are in their mid-, later 30s, I would say. And I hear from alumni all the time about being exposed to speakers. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, there was a young man who heard the gentleman I told you about in San Francisco, Leon Veal  , talk about his battle with illiteracy\u0026#8230; \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eLeon, once he learned how to read, actually went on to work for a program at the San Francisco Public Library called Project Read, where he now goes out into the community and gets people off the streets, into the vans or into the library to learn how to read. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e \u0026#8230; This is part of the story he tells, which is so powerful, it\u0026#8217;s the power of one person to make a difference. So that one person taught him how to read. He is now the ripple effect, he\u0026#8217;s teaching thousands to read. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo Leon told his story and this young man named Andrew sat through that meeting and decided that moment, \u0026#8220;I know I wanted to be a lawyer, go to law school, my path was set. I am changing that.\u0026#8221; And he is now a teacher because of that meeting. He\u0026#8217;s an English teacher in a school. So he changed his course of what he was going to learn in college and what his profession was going to be. And he\u0026#8217;s dedicated his life to education.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe see stories of that, of how what they choose to major in in college and what slant would they give to their profession that they were choosing to embark on already. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, some have gone on to have wanted to be lawyers and have gone on to become environmental lawyers or a labor [lawyer] because of some of the meetings that have happened here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen, overall, it\u0026#8217;s just been fantastic to hear that they will agree that we just need to talk, that \u0026#8230; especially in the last couple of years, they\u0026#8217;re still able to talk and remain friends with people who are voting differently than they do, while they\u0026#8217;re friends, while \u0026#8230; their other friends just can\u0026#8217;t be in a room with somebody that they disagree with. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo those are the impacts that we see, that it\u0026#8217;s OK and necessary and vital to speak to people who don\u0026#8217;t look like you, think like you, vote like you, love like you, pray like you. So that\u0026#8217;s really the strength of the trip.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBluey:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eWell, Billy, that\u0026#8217;s really refreshing to hear. As Virginia can attest, that\u0026#8217;s a recurring theme on The Daily Signal Podcast. We try to highlight examples like that and I\u0026#8217;m glad to hear there are so many people who\u0026#8217;ve participated that are serving as role models and bring that type of approach to how they lead their lives. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI wanted to ask you, tell us a little bit about the name Etgar 36, where did it come from?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePlaner:\u003c/strong\u003e \u0026#8230; Etgar is the Hebrew word for challenge. And at the time you went back to the very beginning, 1995, I was running youth groups at a synagogue and at the time we had a trip, an annual trip to Disney World in Florida. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe were based out in Atlanta and every year I would take a group of kids down to Disney World. They\u0026#8217;d meet up with other factors of this nationwide youth group. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI got to tell you, I would sit there and go, \u0026#8220;Ah, this is probably the least impactful thing I do.\u0026#8221; But the kids loved it, and you know, how could you not love getting away from home, going to see your friends, and playing all day at Disney World? As an educator, I was getting frustrated, I was like, \u0026#8220;I need to be doing more than this. We could and should be doing deeper, better programming than this.\u0026#8221;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the time, a few things were happening. I had read a book by a professor, Doug Brinkley, \u0026#8230; now you see him on the talk shows quite a lot. He was at Hofstra University at the time, and I read a book that he wrote called \u0026#8220;The Majic Bus\u0026#8221; where he took his students on a six-week trip around America teaching them about culture and history. And that really got into me this idea of being where things happen. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, on our summer trip we\u0026#8217;re at Kent State University and meeting with somebody who was shot that day 50 years ago this May, this coming May. He walks us around the campus and tells the story. And because as a student I found it much more powerful to see a picture than read about something and especially to be where something happened, to be able to look around and see what it looks like and feel the vibes going on, or to learn about rock and roll and be standing inside the studios where Elvis helped create this art form.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo the power of being somewhere I got from his book at the same time I was following the music group The Grateful Dead around the country during my free time and their lead singer, Jerry Garcia, just passed away. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePart of what I enjoyed about following them was traveling to a different city and understanding what made Seattle different from Memphis, different from Las Vegas, different from New York. It\u0026#8217;s getting harder and harder in this homogenization of America and cities to get that feel and difference.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I wanted to get my students to feel that, too, and to understand the power of travel. So being in my 20s I had the ego and the audacity to sit the kids down and say, \u0026#8220;OK, I\u0026#8217;m going to take away your Disney trip, and I\u0026#8217;m going to replace it with a trip where we\u0026#8217;re going to do a lot of learning and I want to challenge you to come on this trip. And I\u0026#8217;d like the idea of the challenge, the challenge of discovering your American identity, the challenge of understanding the culture and history of being an engaged citizen.\u0026#8221; \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eLuckily they said yes. I don\u0026#8217;t know what I would have done [if they hadn\u0026#8217;t]. We would not be speaking had these teenagers looked at me and said, \u0026#8220;No, we\u0026#8217;re not coming on that [trip].\u0026#8221; So I\u0026#8217;m very fortunate that they just followed me basically out the door and onto a bus and plane, and we went to a different city every year.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was in Chicago on our third trip, we were at the site of the 1968 Democratic convention riots in the park there and in Grant Park, and I was telling the teenagers the history of the riots, and then we listened to the Bob Dylan lyrics, \u0026#8220;The Times They Are a Changin\u0026#8217;.\u0026#8221; \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI had a student come up to me \u0026#8230; from the youth group and say, \u0026#8220;I\u0026#8217;m a Bob Dylan fan, but I have never really understood these lyrics the way I\u0026#8217;m understanding them right now. [It\u0026#8217;s] so clarifying.\u0026#8221; \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026#8217;s when it solidified to me the importance of being where something happened and bringing in history, culture, politics to really understand who we are as Americans. Because, once again, I will say I\u0026#8217;m a firm believer that our Founding Fathers, really the gamble they made was putting power to the people. I think that they were hoping and betting that we would take that responsibly. And that means being actively-engaged citizens and understanding what\u0026#8217;s going on all around us and what impacts us, how we impact everything.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo that\u0026#8217;s really how it started. And after the first few trips, \u0026#8230; the annual trip[s], one weekend a year I realized that\u0026#8217;s what I really liked doing. And in 2002 I put it together [and] incorporated it as a nonprofit. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThen in 2003 I ran my first summer trip, that was the 36-day summer trip. And right after that I got a phone call from a youth group in California that was coming to the South to do a civil rights trip and they had heard that my summer trip had a civil rights component to it and [they asked if I could] help them put it together. I eventually ended up running that for them and that became our winter program and the civil rights trips that we run.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAllen: It\u0026#8217;s so neat to hear about some of Etgar\u0026#8217;s history and just how far you all have come. As you do look to the future, what are your aspirations for Etgar 36?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePlaner:\u003c/strong\u003e I think right now, I\u0026#8217;ll be honest with you, we are overwhelmed with business right now, just keeping up with demand. As somebody very nicely said to me, \u0026#8220;America has caught up to the lessons that you\u0026#8217;ve been trying to teach of being engaged and the importance of speaking to people you disagree with.\u0026#8221; \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile we\u0026#8217;re seeing the divide in America growing stronger and stronger or wider and wider actually. I do think there is an undercurrent of people who have had enough of this and realize we have got to get along here, we have got to learn, we\u0026#8217;ve got to relearn now how to talk to each other. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo right now we are just growing as our civil rights trips during the school year are taking off and demand for the summer trip is rising, too. So we\u0026#8217;re just keeping that going. The beauty of the summer trip is that it is organic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs issues arise, we\u0026#8217;re able to incorporate them each year. So each year is a little different than the previous year because new issues come up, and I can only imagine the energy level that\u0026#8217;s going to be out there this coming summer leading into the 2020 election, it is going to be fantastic. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn \u0026#8230; summer 2016 we were fortunate enough, just coincidentally, we were in Cleveland during the Republican convention and we were in Philadelphia [during] the Democratic convention and able to walk around and engage with everybody out in the streets and the protesters and the activists. And that was just amazing. So the growth of Etgar is really sort of organic in that we are able to adjust and tweak as America adjusts and tweaks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBluey:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eAnd finally, Billy, if our readers have children of their own or they themselves are interested in applying, how do they go about doing that or learning more about Etgar 36?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePlaner:\u003c/strong\u003e Sure.

Both talk about our trips and what\u0026#8217;s going on there. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eLike I said, the demand has just gone through the roof now. \u0026#8230; Usually at this point for our summer trip, we may have one teen who signed up, whose brother or sister may have gone, [but] we\u0026#8217;re about a third full right now. We haven\u0026#8217;t even done any recruiting or information nights or sent out any information. So \u0026#8230; it\u0026#8217;s just the excitement out there for the work we\u0026#8217;re doing. It\u0026#8217;s so gratifying, but it\u0026#8217;s out there. And I really appreciate y\u0026#8217;all having me on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAllen: Absolutely.

For cars, having the wheels rotate in the opposite sense to the car's motion is an artifact.

A flat sheet of metal, hanging in the vacuum: the camera pans to see a single atom moving flat-out a few nanometers above the surface. The electrons surrounding the nucleus of the atom push the electrons in the metal away from the metal's surface, creating a kind of bow wave of charge in front of the nucleus and a wake of charge behind it. What we're looking at is the very picture of a quantum salt flat racer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe forces that generate the bow wave and wake are carried by virtual photons that are exchanged between the metal surface and the atom. In the exchange process, the atom will emit a steady stream of real photons in the direction of travel. The momentum kick from launching these photons slows the atom. This is, ultimately, friction for a single atom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1572219#p3\"\u003eRead 13 remaining paragraphs\u003c/a\u003e | \u003ca href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1572219\u0026comments=1\"\u003eComments\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"feedflare\"\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=-PI6oW2Mro4:Cn_He-pkaPw:V_sGLiPBpWU\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=-PI6oW2Mro4:Cn_He-pkaPw:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=-PI6oW2Mro4:Cn_He-pkaPw:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=-PI6oW2Mro4:Cn_He-pkaPw:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=-PI6oW2Mro4:Cn_He-pkaPw:qj6IDK7rITs\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=-PI6oW2Mro4:Cn_He-pkaPw:yIl2AUoC8zA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","url":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1572219","published":"2019-09-23T10:45:17Z","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1572219"}]},{"url":"https://gigaom.com/feed/","items":[{"title":"Voices in AI – Bonus: A Conversation with Hilary Mason","content":"\u003cp\u003e[voices_in_ai_byline]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eAbout this Episode\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://voicesinai.com/episode/bonus-episode-a-conversation-with-hilary-mason/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eOn this Episode of Voices in AI\u003c/a\u003e features Byron speaking with Hilary Mason, an acclaimed data and research scientist, about the mechanics and philosophy behind designing and building AI.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eListen to this episode or read the full transcript at \u003ca href=\"https://voicesinai.com/episode/bonus-episode-a-conversation-with-hilary-mason/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003ewww.VoicesinAI.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eTranscript Excerpt\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eByron Reese: This is Voices in AI, brought to you by Gigaom and I am Byron Reese.

She is the GM of Machine Learning at Cloudera, and the founder and CEO of Fast Forward Labs, \u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e the Data Scientist in residence at Accel Partners, \u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e a member of the Board of Directors at the Anita Borg Institute for Women in Technology, \u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e the co-founder of hackNY.org. That’s as far down as it would let me read in her LinkedIn profile, but I’ve a feeling if I’d clicked that ‘More’ button, there would be a lot more.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWelcome to the show, amazing Hilary Mason!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHilary Mason: Thank you very much. Thank you for having me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI always like to start with the question I ask everybody because I’ve never had the same answer twice and – I’m going to change it up: why is it so hard to define what intelligence is? And are we going to build computers that actually are intelligent, or they can only emulate intelligence, or are those two things the exact same thing?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis a fun way to get started! I think it’s difficult to define intelligence because it’s not always clear what we want out of the definition. Are we looking for something that distinguishes human intelligence from other forms of intelligence? There’s that joke that’s kind of a little bit too true that goes around in the community that AI, or artificial intelligence, is whatever computers can’t do today. Where we keep moving the bar, just so that we can feel like there’s something that is still uniquely within the bounds of human thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet’s move to the second part of your discussion which is really asking, ‘Can computers ever be indistinguishable from human thought?’ I think it’s really useful to put a timeframe on that thought experiment and to say that in the short term, ‘no.’ I do love science fiction, though, and I do believe that it is worth dreaming about and working towards a world in which we could create intelligences that are indistinguishable from human intelligences. Though I actually, personally, think that it is more likely we will build computational systems to \u003cem\u003eaugment \u003c/em\u003eand extend human intelligence. For example, I don’t know about you but my memory is horrible. I’m routinely absentminded. I do use technology to augment my capabilities there, and I would love to have it more integrated into my own self and my intelligence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYeah, did you know ancient people, not even that far back, like Roman times, had vastly better memories than we had? We know of one Roman general that knew the names of all 25,000 of his troops and the names of all their families. Yet, Plato wasn’t a big fan of writing for that very reason. He said that with writing, you’ve invented a system for reminding yourself but not for remembering anything. He predicted that once literacy was widespread, our memories would go to pot, and he was right. Like you, I can’t remember my PIN# half the time!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s incredible!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI guess my real question, though, is when you ask people \u003c/strong\u003e– “\u003cstrong\u003ewell, when will we have a general intelligence?” you have a range of answers. You have five years for—Elon Musk used that timeline and then to 500. Andrew Ng is worrying about such things as overpopulation on Mars. The reason the range is so high is nobody knows how to build a general intelligence. Would you agree with that?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, I would agree, and I would firmly state that I do not believe there is a technical path from where we are today to that form of general intelligence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou know that’s a fantastic observation because machine learning, our trick du jour, is an idea that says: ‘let’s take information about the past, study it, look for patterns, and project them into the future.’ That may not be a path to general intelligence. Is that what you’re saying?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat is what I’m saying. That we know how to build systems that look at data and make predictions or forecasts that infer things that we can’t even directly observe, which is remarkable. We do not know how to make systems that mimic intelligence in ways that would distinguish it from the systems or from humans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI’ve had 100 guests on this show – and they virtually all believe we could/can, with your caveat about the timeframe, create a general intelligence, even though they all agree we don’t know how to do it. The reason those two things are compatible is they have a simple assumption that is: humans are machines, specifically our brains are machines. You know how the thought experiment goes\u0026#8230; if you could take what a neuron did and model that and then did that a hundred billion times and figured out what the glial cells do and all that other stuff, there’s no reason you can’t build a general intelligence.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDo you believe people are machines, or our brains are purely mechanistic in the sense that there’s nothing about them that cannot be described with physics, really?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I do believe that, with the caveat that we don’t necessarily understand all of that physics, necessarily today. I do think there is a biological and physical basis for human intelligence, and that should we understand it well enough, we could possibly construct something that’s indistinguishable. But we certainly don’t understand it and we may need to invent entire new fields of physics before we would.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eListen to this episode or read the full transcript at \u003ca href=\"https://voicesinai.com/episode/bonus-episode-a-conversation-with-hilary-mason/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003ewww.VoicesinAI.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[voices_in_ai_link_back]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eByron explores issues around artificial intelligence and conscious computers in his new book \u003ca href=\"//amzn.to/2DFn672″\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eThe Fourth Age: Smart Robots, Conscious Computers, and the Future of Humanity\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://gigaom.com/2019/09/23/voices-in-ai-bonus-a-conversation-with-hilary-mason/","published":"2019-09-23T12:00:41Z","guid":"https://gigaom.com/?p=962367"}]},{"url":"https://scobleizer.com/feed","items":[]},{"url":"https://feeds.feedburner.com/oreilly/radar/atom","items":[]},{"url":"https://feeds.feedburner.com/blogspot/MKuf?format=xml","items":[{"title":"Simpler ways to drive growth across the customer journey with video","content":"","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/blogspot/MKuf/~3/ZWS89jPs7OU/","published":"2019-09-23T13:00:00Z","guid":"https://www.blog.google/products/ads/full-funnel-video/"},{"title":"Doing more to protect your privacy with the Assistant","content":"","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/blogspot/MKuf/~3/R5K6oXBc72k/","published":"2019-09-23T07:00:00Z","guid":"https://www.blog.google/products/assistant/doing-more-protect-your-privacy-assistant/"}]},{"url":"http://feeds.mashable.com/Mashable?format=xml","items":[{"title":"Billy Porter's powerful Emmys acceptance speech was a rallying cry for equality","content":"\n\n\u003cimg alt=\"\" src=\"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1051813%252Fae2c4910-869d-4d42-847b-3db55a8cc10c.jpg%252F575x323__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=ildzoXAnVzhsPt-bXpUPmDOxJIQ=\u0026amp;source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com\" /\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"float: right;

(Some of Kabbage\u0026#8217;s growth has come through partnerships, for example it works closely with the \u003ca href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/14/alibaba-taps-kabbage-to-loan-up-to-150k-to-smbs-after-it-quietly-acquired-opensky-to-ramp-in-north-america/\"\u003elikes of Alibaba\u003c/a\u003e in the US to provide financing for businesses on their platform; through white-label services; and through its own direct channels.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith Drum, Frohwein said that this was about identifying another problem area for businesses that aren\u0026#8217;t being met by current services, that SMBs have found to be a challenge in fixing themselves, but that sit outside of the kinds of problems that Kabbage itself is aiming to solve. Specifically, here it\u0026#8217;s about pulling together sales teams \u0026#8212; called \u0026#8220;Drummers\u0026#8221; on the platform \u0026#8212; to help market their products, either locally or further afield by using digital channels and the sales expertise they bring to the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the rise in internet usage, a lot of businesses have shifted their sales and marketing efforts to digital platforms, essentially managing the work themselves by way of Google AdWords campaigns, through Facebook and so on. One big reason for that has been because hiring sales people \u0026#8212; much less having them on the payroll \u0026#8212; has just felt like a financial and organizational step too steep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe idea behind Drum is to provide these businesses with a platform that lets both salespeople who have time or want to work on a project basis connect with businesses that might not want to take the step of full-time hires, but could use the expertise and human power of people to help them with sales. It borrows from the concept of the on-demand, gigging model made popular by many other enterprises, from \u003ca href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/17/super-raises-20m-to-fix-the-home-services-and-repairs-market-with-its-subscription-service/\"\u003ehome services\u003c/a\u003e through to \u003ca href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/11/uber-ab-5-independent-contractors/\"\u003etransportation\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/19/readying-an-ipo-postmates-secures-225m-from-private-equity-firm-gpi-capital/\"\u003efood delivery\u003c/a\u003e that have been built around contract-based work in specific fields.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile you can see some of the benefits of viewing the engagement of sales people in the context of an on-demand, gig economy model, it seems that there might also be drawbacks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI noted to Frohwein that matching a driver to a particular delivery may be less personality-specific than matching a salesperson to a particular sales job. However, it\u0026#8217;s a challenge that he believes is not as big as it seems because Drum will be able to size up the capabilities and experience of specific people to make them better matches for the businesses looking to retain their services (using AI-based tools). It\u0026#8217;s less like finding a perfect cultural fit, it seems, than finding the people with the right experience and administrative skills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;Most of the sales that happen won’t be for complex items,\u0026#8221; he predicted. \u0026#8220;They are products and services like floor refinishing or repairing roof, who are looking for a better way to sell what they do.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother potential issue might be the fact that some salespeople might prove to use approaches that are not ultimately the ones you would want to have for your own brand or business. Again, this is a problem Frohwein believes can be addressed. The platform will have ratings on it, and the idea will be that those that are not good at their jobs simply won\u0026#8217;t get business in the future. (In that regard, this is not unlike something like Airbnb, which mostly seems to work very well for people, with a few troubling hiccups among the many success stories.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next step past connecting businesses and salespeople is the third side of this three-sided marketplace. Drum aims to provide providing a platform for the products and services themselves to get sold, whether they are concert tickets, or roofing supplies. This will be developed over time, Frohwein said, and will serve to complement the work of the Drummers who might be working in physical, real-world sales as well as across digital channels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe main message is that it will be harnessing a large group of businesses that want to connect to customers, and salespeople who will be looking for platforms to sell their clients\u0026#8217; goods, and the platform will become one component of how that works \u0026#8212; again, addressing the fact that some of these businesses have not make the leap to e-commerce in part because they\u0026#8217;ve found the options out there today, which might include Amazon or eBay, not quite what they want.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;This is a huge opportunity to acquire customers and a huge number of direct brands that could use a physical last mile,\u0026#8221; said Frohwein. \u0026#8220;Today, they use things like email lists and Facebook but they could use boots on the ground and talking about their businesses and promoting them.\u0026#8221; He says he envisions most of the sales and help to come in the form of human, in-person selling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"feedflare\"\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=z4MZ8qURhAg:lIeSCgWyK9U:2mJPEYqXBVI\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=z4MZ8qURhAg:lIeSCgWyK9U:7Q72WNTAKBA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=z4MZ8qURhAg:lIeSCgWyK9U:yIl2AUoC8zA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=z4MZ8qURhAg:lIeSCgWyK9U:-BTjWOF_DHI\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=z4MZ8qURhAg:lIeSCgWyK9U:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=z4MZ8qURhAg:lIeSCgWyK9U:D7DqB2pKExk\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=z4MZ8qURhAg:lIeSCgWyK9U:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=z4MZ8qURhAg:lIeSCgWyK9U:qj6IDK7rITs\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/z4MZ8qURhAg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/z4MZ8qURhAg/","published":"2019-09-23T11:51:54Z","guid":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=1885018"},{"title":"Aptiv and Hyundai form new joint venture focused on autonomous driving","content":"\u003cp id=\"speakable-summary\"\u003eAutomaker Hyundai is forming a new joint venture with autonomous driving technology company Aptiv, with both parties taking a 50 percent ownership stake in the new company.

These new cameras make the jump to 2K resolution recording quality with HDR, up from 1080p with the Pro 2. Each camera features its own spotlight, too, which does exactly what you’d expect: flood the area in light. In addition, it allows color night vision — so, in theory, you’ll be able to make out colors and other details in the dead of night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ahttha\"\u003eAside from a bump up in image quality, a few other things have changed. The Pro 3 cameras have a 160-degree field of view, a slight but welcome improvement over the 130-degree field of view in the previous iteration. Arlo says that having conversations with people through the camera will be better now with the Pro 3, thanks to their full duplex microphones that allow for more natural back-and-forth chatter. Also, these cameras will be able to tilt, pan, and zoom in on a subject when it detects movement. \u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8hi1wp_cegvO0956NxbMbD0QdP8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19218073/arlo34.jpg\"\u003e\n      \u003ccite\u003eImage: Arlo\u003c/cite\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"cm04Em\"\u003eLike the Pro 2, the Pro 3 is IP65 weather-resistant, and Arlo’s IoT ecosystem support still includes Apple HomeKit, Amazon Alexa, and Google Assistant.

Arlo says that these cameras will be compatible with preexisting Arlo Ultra accessories as well as previous base stations. So if you just want one of these $199.99 cameras piecemeal, that’s available. This price is on par with the cost of Ring’s battery-powered Spotlight Cam and the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, but Arlo’s system requires a base station, and the others do not. Still, Arlo provides a higher resolution and some features you won’t find from Ring or Nest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"L9NZVg\"\u003eThe full system, which includes a Smart Hub and two cameras costs $499. That option will include a free three-month trial to Arlo Smart (it usually costs $9.99 per month), its service that keeps a rolling record of recordings.

However, once developed, the computers are expected to have huge implications for areas as diverse as cryptography, chemistry, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.

Although it was still far from being a practical computing device, IBM’s breakthrough was to make it much more reliable than previous quantum machines.

Alexa, Siri, and Google Assistant were all storing user utterances and having human reviewers listen to that audio to rate how accurately the assistants transcribed them. That data often included audio that wasn’t intended for the smart speakers at all, but was nevertheless accidentally recorded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-float-right\"\u003e\u003caside id=\"b8cVzi\"\u003e\u003cq\u003eAmazon, Google, and Apple have all had to make data privacy changes\u003c/q\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"hVWkjC\"\u003eGoogle, Amazon, and Apple all reacted differently to their individual scandals.

Soon it will add a hotword sensitivity option, which means you’ll be able to choose how clearly you have to enunciate “Hey Google” in order to turn on the smart speaker. If you are worried about accidental recordings, you’ll be able to turn it up, if you’re not, you can set it to be a little more forgiving.

Still, it has become an article of faith among Trump supporters that Biden got the chief prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, dismissed to derail a corruption investigation of a Ukrainian firm his son was paid to advise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut journalists at leading American news organizations \u0026#8212; including CNN, the New York Times, and the major broadcast networks \u0026#8212; have helped weaponize this disinformation by allowing Trump and Giuliani to repeat the baseless smear over and over, without promptly and accurately conveying that they are lying about what the former vice president did in Ukraine. So lies and misinformation have been broadcast nationwide, reaching millions of people who will never read subsequent fact-checks debunking them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis began in May, when Giuliani\u0026#8217;s embrace of the conspiracy theory was reported on the front page of the Times, in \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/01/us/politics/biden-son-ukraine.html\"\u003ean article\u003c/a\u003e that forced readers to wait until the nineteenth paragraph to find out that \u0026#8220;No evidence has surfaced that the former vice president intentionally tried to help his son by pressing for the prosecutor general’s dismissal.\u0026#8221; Even so, the Times politics reporter who interviewed Giuliani, Ken Vogel, \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/kenvogel/status/1123750935958904832\"\u003eclaimed on Twitter\u003c/a\u003e that this meant \u0026#8220;The BIDENS are entangled in a Ukrainian corruption scandal.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I reported at the time, the truth is not that hard to determine. There is little doubt that Biden’s son Hunter did benefit from his father’s position by securing a spot on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company in 2014, a legal but ethically dubious move. But when Joe Biden subsequently \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/urTk6O4c0mU\"\u003econveyed\u003c/a\u003e a threat from the Obama administration to withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees to Ukraine unless the chief prosecutor was dismissed, his intervention made it more rather than less likely that the oligarch who paid his son would be subject to prosecution for corruption.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s because one of the most prominent cases of official corruption that Shokin had failed to pursue was against a former environment and natural resources minister, Mykola Zlochevsky, who had oversight of all Ukrainian energy firms, including the largest independent gas company, Burisma, which he secretly controlled through shell companies in Cyprus. After Zlochevsky was forced from office in 2014 \u0026#8212; in the popular uprising that toppled a pro-Russian president, Viktor Yanukovych, and forced his political adviser, Paul Manafort, to look elsewhere for work \u0026#8212; Burisma appointed Hunter Biden to its board.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShokin’s reluctance to pursue Zlochevsky was loudly condemned by the Obama administration shortly before Biden traveled to Ukraine at the end of 2015.

A tipificação não é formalizada pelo Degase, mas é comum em muitas unidades, como aponta o relatório do Mecanismo Estadual de Prevenção e Combate à Tortura do Rio de Janeiro.

De acordo com o jovem, um agente que tinha desavenças com seu pai – então guarda municipal – o agrediu fisicamente durante quatro meses. “Quando ele me viu, a primeira coisa que lembrou foi do meu pai. Aí tudo o que ele queria fazer para se vingar, ele fazia”, conta. Fernando lembra que durante as manhãs, a cada três dias, ele era retirado de seu alojamento para receber o castigo. “Eu acordava todo dia cedo por causa do plantão dele. Ele me tirava de dentro do alojamento só para me bater.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eO medo o impediu de denunciar os abusos, até que, em uma visita, o pai percebeu os hematomas e o pressionou a explicar o que havia acontecido. A direção da unidade conversou sobre o caso e decidiu pelo afastamento do funcionário, como nos confirmou um socioeducador que trabalha no local. “Tirando esse agente, com os outros funcionários eu sempre preferi levar na boa, para não acontecer justamente o que rolou com esse”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnquanto Fernando esteve internado, o CAI-Baixada foi palco de duas rebeliões de internos.

Na segunda, havia um boato sobre possibilidade de fuga da unidade e, por isso, o rapaz chegou a trancar o alojamento em que estava para evitar que os colegas participassem do motim. Fernando teve medo de represálias dos agentes caso o plano desse errado. Aqueles que conseguissem fugir ainda corriam o risco de serem pegos por integrantes da facção Terceiro Comando Puro (TCP), que atuam no bairro. Os funcionários, segundo ele, aprovaram a atitude, e passaram a tratá-lo como exemplo para os demais. “Um ou outro tem a cabeça avoada e já quer estourar uma rebelião e tudo mais… Então, na verdade, é uma cadeia. Todo mundo sabe, só que usam outro nome para passar como se fosse uma vaselina. Não tem essa que é socioeducativo.

Sem ter falado com ninguém, DG permaneceu de cabeça baixa, ouvidos atentos e mãos algemadas. Quando questionado pela juíza sobre as acusações, confirmou o roubo. A sentença determinou a transferência do garoto para o Centro de Socioeducação Gelso de Carvalho, o Cense-GCA, antigo CTR, como o local ainda é chamando tanto pelos jovens que passaram por lá quanto pelos agentes que trabalham no local, e o agendamento de uma nova visita ao tribunal dias depois.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOs adolescentes \u003ca style=\"color: #c80000\" href=\"http://www.defensoria.rj.def.br/uploads/arquivos/d7f7e2bf705a45e892707c9d31d24000.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003epodem permanecer\u003c/a\u003e no Cense-GCA por até 72 horas enquanto aguardam pela audiência.

Foi no Gelso de Carvalho que DG conversou com profissionais e entendeu o que significava o Degase. “A gente só falava com o psicólogo quando chegava. A assistente social que perguntava teu nome, contato e pá. Ela explicava também o que ia acontecer com nós e das sentença que tinha, liberdade assistida, semiaberto\u0026#8230;”. O ECA determina diferentes sentenças de acordo com a gravidade do ato infracional ou a quantidade de vezes em que o adolescente já passou pelo sistema. No caso de DG, a juíza determinou que ele ficasse internado seis meses em regime de semiliberdade, situação em que os jovens passam a noite nas unidades de internação e saem para ir à escola durante o dia e retornam para dormir no centro.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo Degase, como em uma penitenciária comum, os alojamentos são divididos em alas de acordo com as facções ligadas ao tráfico de drogas ou às regiões da cidade onde vivem.

Contudo, os três dias de estadia máxima se multiplicam e viram 15, 20, 25. Foi o caso de DG. A segunda audiência ocorreu cerca de três semanas após sua chegada ao Degase.

Following the spill, Secwepemc land defenders blockaded the site to prevent miners from reopening the copper and gold mine. Walia helped liaise between the Secwepemc defenders and the miners. “These are Indigenous land defenders protecting their Indigenous economies,” she recalled telling the miners.

Wooden oil derricks from the 1920s, pumpjacks, and modern fracking rigs dot the landscape, showing the successive waves of resource development. A new fracking boom threatens the place known as Greater Chaco Landscape, a place of origin for many Indigenous peoples in the Southwest and Latin America, and the Diné people who currently call it home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe land is not only contaminated but also fragmented. A hodgepodge of extractive zones corresponds to a complex patchwork of legal jurisdictions in the “checkerboarded” area. In this part of the Navajo Nation, the Dawes Act, which subverted traditional land tenure systems in favor of allotting private property, parceled out land to individual Navajos and either sold off the “surplus” to white settlers or turned it into federal or state land. The fracking industry has exploited these divisions, and oil workers have exploited the loopholes of jurisdiction. This includes violent crimes against Indigenous women: According to a \u003ca href=\"http://www.uihi.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Missing-and-Murdered-Indigenous-Women-and-Girls-Report.pdf\"\u003erecent survey\u003c/a\u003e by a national non-profit dedicated to Indigenous health and social care, New Mexico ranked \u003cspan id=\"ask_the_editor_search_results\"\u003eNo. 1 \u003c/span\u003e in cases of murdered and missing Indigenous women and girls, and third in the nation for oil production.

lab’s visionary ‘food computer’ project may be ‘selling fantasy’ to millennials and donors","content":"\n                            \u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAn agriculture project at MIT Media Lab offers a grand vision of tailored homegrown food, but its present reality is poorly-working technology and a flashy show meant to secure funding from gullible sponsors, insiders say.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n                            \u003cp\u003eImagine a world where every family can grow fresh vegetables in a sealed high-tech box that controls every aspect of the process according to a \u0026lsquo;climate recipe\u0026rsquo; downloaded from some private enthusiast on another continent. And the result is far superior to that tasteless food you buy in a supermarket today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat is the vision of Caleb Harper, head of the Open Agricultural Initiative at the Media Lab ran by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, as described by himself in numerous public speeches and media appearances. The box, or \u003cem\u003e\u0026ldquo;food computer\u0026rdquo;\u003c/em\u003e as he prefers to call it, will be made from parts readily available on Amazon, the technology open source and easily hackable, and the exterior fully customizable to express the owner\u0026rsquo;s individuality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n    \n                                \n    \u003ciframe\n         width=\"560\"         height=\"315\"                src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/8YI569T0AMk\"\n        frameborder=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis rosy promise seems like a millennial\u0026rsquo;s dream and so far Harper\u0026rsquo;s project has received positive coverage and steady funding. It may also be pure fantasy meant to cover up an ugly reality. It seems \u003cem\u003e\u0026ldquo;food computers\u0026rdquo;\u003c/em\u003e are just ordinary hydroponic plant boxes with sensors that often don\u0026rsquo;t work. Plants shown in photos, and to potential donors given a tour of the lab, were bought elsewhere and placed in the boxes so as to appear as if they grew there, and some of the statements made by Harper were exaggerated or simply not true. At least that\u0026rsquo;s what some people familiar with his work told the media.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe underbelly of the Open Agricultural Initiative has been described by several expos\u0026eacute;s this month.

MIT Media Lab\u0026rsquo;s leadership was aware of the concerns, according to the Times.

The Arab bloc in Israel\u0026#8217;s parliament abandoned its usual hands-off stance Sunday and endorsed former military chief Benny Gantz for prime minister, potentially giving him the edge over hard-line incumbent Benjamin Netanyahu.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe historic move marked the first time in nearly three decades that the Arab parties backed a candidate for prime minster, reflecting their contempt for Netanyahu, who was accused of fomenting hatred of the Arabs during his re-election campaign.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;Benny Gantz is not our cup of tea,\u0026#8221;

But with the backing of the Arab parties, Gantz gained a slight advantage. He could have as many as 57 backers, compared with Netanyahu\u0026#8217;s 55.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaverick politician Avigdor Lieberman, head of the mid-size Yisrael Beitenu party, controls the final eight seats, making him the key powerbroker. But he announced Sunday that he isn\u0026#8217;t endorsing either candidate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe endorsement by the Joint List, a bloc of four small Arab parties that controls 13 seats, marked a turning point in Israeli politics. Arab parties have traditionally refrained from endorsing a candidate for prime minister, and they have never sat in a coalition government, not wanting to be seen as legitimizing Israeli policies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough many Israeli Arabs remain angry at Gantz for leading the military\u0026#8217;s devastating war against Gaza militants in 2014, their fury toward Netanyahu runs much deeper. Netanyahu\u0026#8217;s campaign repeatedly accused the Arabs of trying to \u0026#8220;steal\u0026#8221; the election, drawing accusations of racism and incitement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is also deep-seated anger over a law passed by Netanyahu\u0026#8217;s government in 2018 that declared Israel to be the nation-state of the Jewish people. Arabs believe the law codifies discrimination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough the Arab parties are still expected to stay out of Gantz\u0026#8217;s future government, their endorsement reflects a growing desire of Israel\u0026#8217;s large Arab minority to take a more active role in shaping the country.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn an op-ed piece in The New York Times, Ayman Odeh, the leader of the Joint List, argued that his move should end Netanyahu\u0026#8217;s political career and provide a watershed moment for Israel\u0026#8217;s Arab minority.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;If the center-left parties of Israel believe that Arab Palestinian citizens have a place in this country, they must accept that we have a place in its politics,\u0026#8221; he wrote. \u0026#8220;There is no shared future without the full and equal participation of Arab Palestinian citizens.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNetanyahu reacted by saying: \u0026#8220;As we warned, the Arab parties that oppose Israel as a Jewish and democratic state and glorify terrorists recommended Gantz for prime minister.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Arab parties\u0026#8217; decision does not guarantee Gantz will be prime minister.

Rivlin has wide discretion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn last week\u0026#8217;s vote, Blue and White won 33 seats, while Likud took 31.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe deciding factor looks to be Lieberman, who is demanding a broad unity government with the two major parties that will be secular and exclude the ultra-Orthodox Jewish parties and Arabs. That appears to be the compromise emerging between Blue and White and Likud, though both are insisting upon leading it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComplicating matters is Blue and White\u0026#8217;s refusal to sit with Netanyahu because he faces a likely indictment on corruption charges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdeh said he is planning on becoming opposition leader in the case of a unity government. As the leader of the largest party in opposition, he would be entitled to the position, which includes meetings with visiting world leaders and access to sensitive security information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRivlin has not indicated which way he is leading. But he said he interpreted the will of the people as yearning for a \u0026#8220;stable\u0026#8221; government. \u0026#8220;And there can\u0026#8217;t be a stable government without the two big parties,\u0026#8221; the 80-year-old president said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast week\u0026#8217;s vote was Israel\u0026#8217;s second election in five months. Netanyahu was unable to form a coalition after April\u0026#8217;s balloting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn calling a new election, Netanyahu had hoped to secure a narrow majority of hard-line and religious parties that would grant him immunity from prosecution on charges that could include bribery, breach of trust and fraud. But now that possibility appears to be off the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIsraeli law does not require a sitting premier to resign if indicted.

Dismisses EU Parliament’s ‘Biased’ Human Rights Resolution","content":"\u003cp\u003e“The biased, one-sided, unrealistic, and disappointing resolution against Iran is put to vote at a time when the United States of America is violating the rights of over 80 million people by imposing economic terrorism against Iran; however, this is ignored by members of the European Parliament,” Mousavi said in a Monday statement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMousavi said the adoption of the resolution shows the new members of the European Parliament are unfamiliar with ongoing developments in Iran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe spokesman noted that the anti-Iran accusations are mainly “based on incorrect and inauthentic information and certain purposeful media

legal obligation and a subject in line with the national interests and security,” he added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said the country has always strived to fulfil those obligations, and there is no need for spiteful and opportunistic emphases from others in this regard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe finally denounced the use of double standards when it comes to human rights and rejected the instrumental use of it against other countries, and said, “Adoption of such resolutions and measures runs counter to interaction with the European Union, and will definitely not be constructive.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe European Parliament on Thursday, September 19, adopted a resolution condemning the Islamic Republic\u0026#8217;s human rights record, calling on Tehran to end what it called \u0026#8220;suppression of women\u0026#8221;.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe new resolution was endorsed by 608 votes in favour, seven against and 46 abstentions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMembers of the European Parliament (MEPs) demanded all EU countries with a diplomatic presence in Iran to use all the diplomacy tools in their power to support and protect human rights defenders on the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMEPs also called on the Iranian authorities to immediately release all human rights defenders and journalists detained and
