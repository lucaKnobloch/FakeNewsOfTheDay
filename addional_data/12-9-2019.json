This recession differed from previous ones, however, because (1) the downturn was more extreme and (2) it generated long-lived effects in the economy. Perhaps this recession has had more persistent effects because it had been perceived as an extremely unlikely event. Many of us now question whether the Financial Crisis could repeat itself. Today, financial panic is a new reality that may be affecting the aggregate economy.\u003csup\u003e1\u003c/sup\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the consequences of the Great Recession is a change in perception: Such a large negative shock to the economy was unexpected (if not completely dismissed); and now we may expect (or at least believe it is more probable) that a similar event might occur. In short, the Great Recession caused a change in \u0026#8220;tail risk.\u0026#8221;\u003csup\u003e2\u003c/sup\u003e In this three-part series, I explore how changes in tail risk can affect the aggregate economy. Part 1 explains how the Great Recession made us reevaluate the way we think about tail risk. \u003ca href=\"http://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/economic-synopses/2019/08/06/tail-risk-part-2-the-missing-recovery-after-the-great-recession\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003ePart 2\u003c/a\u003e explores its consequences for the economy and discusses why an increase in tail risk can help us understand the slow recovery after the Great Recession. Part 3 shows how the decline of the risk-free rate might be a consequence of the increase in tail risk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy focus on tail risk? Perception can be everything: People observe new events and use them to inform their probability estimates. For example, if you haven\u0026#8217;t seen many bank runs, you think bank runs are very rare. However, when you see a bank run, you update your estimates and determine that bank runs are not as rare as you previously thought. As an analogy, imagine you see the outcome of many rolls of a die. You don\u0026#8217;t know how many sides the die has or if the sides are weighted. However, you\u0026#8217;ve seen numbers one through six come up many times, about equally, so you think this is a standard six-sided die. One time, though, a seven comes up. As a result, you revise your belief about this die and now think the die has at least seven sides. Even if you don\u0026#8217;t see a seven again, the knowledge that the number seven can be rolled stays with you. It would probably affect your willingness to bet on the outcome of a die roll, too. Seeing the Financial Crisis was like seeing a seven come up on what you thought was a six-sided die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://ritholtz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/fig1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003e\u003cimg class=\"alignnone wp-image-230694 size-full\" src=\"https://ritholtz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/fig1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"439\" height=\"457\" srcset=\"https://ritholtz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/fig1.jpg 439w, https://ritholtz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/fig1-288x300.jpg 288w, https://ritholtz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/fig1-250x260.jpg 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 439px) 100vw, 439px\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid tail risk or the perceived probability of a financial crisis increase after the Great Recession? There is evidence supporting the hypothesis that it did. Figure 1 shows an increase in tail risk as measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange SKEW Index (SKEW). SKEW is an index of tail risk in the S\u0026amp;P 500 constructed using option prices, and larger values of SKEW imply higher tail risk.\u003csup\u003e3\u003c/sup\u003e Figure 1 shows a clear rise since the Financial Crisis, with no subsequent decline.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://ritholtz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/fig2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003e\u003cimg class=\"alignnone wp-image-230695 size-full\" src=\"https://ritholtz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/fig2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"663\" height=\"376\" srcset=\"https://ritholtz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/fig2.jpg 663w, https://ritholtz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/fig2-300x170.jpg 300w, https://ritholtz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/fig2-250x142.jpg 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 663px) 100vw, 663px\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoogle search trends also show evidence of an increase in tail risk after the Great Recession.

The beer brewer had originally planned to raise $9.8 billion for the unit through an IPO in July but then suddenly scrapped the plan citing “prevailing market conditions.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eEven now, AB InBev remains cautious, saying in its statement, “No assurance can be given that this transaction will be completed and the decision to proceed will depend on a number of factors and prevailing market conditions.” However, a source with knowledge of the matter said the IPO will likely take place next week, with the unit listing on the Hong Kong stock exchange by the end of the month.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAB InBev cancelled its first attempt at an IPO for Budweiser APAC in July, prompting some speculation that the protests in Hong Kong, which by then had escalated from peaceful marches to violent clashes, had in some way dissuaded the beer brewer from listing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSimilar speculations were made last month\u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/21/amid-protests-hong-kongs-stock-exchange-may-lose-chance-at-alibaba-listing-again/\"\u003e when Alibaba\u003c/a\u003e reportedly postponed its Hong Kong listing, too. However, with protests still flaring across the city, it appears the beer brewer isn’t so concerned by the noise on the streets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;I would be very surprised if the protests had any bearing on AB InBev\u0026#8217;s decision,\u0026#8221; says Phil Gorham, Director of Research in Japan at Morningstar, where he covers AB InBev. \u0026#8220;I think \u0026#8216;prevailing market conditions\u0026#8217; means they have a price in mind and if they don\u0026#8217;t get that price, they\u0026#8217;ll yank the IPO again.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBudweiser APAC’s prospectus doesn’t confirm a target price for the IPO.

Since then, however, Budweiser APAC sold its Australian unit to Japan’s Asahi Breweries for $11.3 billion. In its\u003ca href=\"https://www1.hkexnews.hk/app/sehk/2019/2019051001/documents/sehk19091200022.pdf\"\u003e latest prospectus\u003c/a\u003e, Budweiser APAC downgraded 2018 revenues from Asia Pacific East, a region that previously included Australia, from $3.3 billion to $1.6 billion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHaving stripped out its Australian sales, the valuation of Budweiser APAC this time around will likely be below the $63 billion price tag AB InBev projected in July, which\u003ca href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/88bfa3aa-a498-11e9-a282-2df48f366f7d\"\u003e analysts said\u003c/a\u003e was over-inflated at the time. \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ab-inbev-asia-ipo/ab-inbev-set-to-revive-budweiser-asia-ipo-with-5-billion-float-sources-idUSKCN1VX0JM\"\u003eReuters\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/em\u003ereports the new IPO will seek to raise $5 billion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eEven at a lower price, the offering will be a welcome relief for Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX), which operates Hong Kong\u0026#8217;s bourse. \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/09/11/hong-kong-stock-exchange-london-lse-bid/\"\u003eLast year\u003c/a\u003e, Hong Kong was the number one destination for IPOs, with 125 companies raising a collective $36.5 billion.

The company\u0026#8217;s prospectus highlights China, South Korea, India and Vietnam as its four principal markets but, according to Gorham, without Australia the business is \u0026#8220;all about China.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eChina is  the world’s largest beer market by consumption, where a hearty 45.7 billion liters of suds were swilled last year. According to \u003ca href=\"https://blog.euromonitor.com/heineken-deal-with-china-resources/\"\u003eEuromonitor\u003c/a\u003e, in 2018 AB InBev had 16% of the market, where it owns China’s oldest beer brand, Harbin, which was founded in 1900. The cheap lager, named for the icy region where it’s brewed, makes up the majority of Budweiser APAC’s “core” product range in China. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs China’s beer drinkers continue to “premiumize,” however, the AB InBev subdivision will likely look to its higher-value offerings for growth. That includes brands such as Goose Island—a craft beer that AB InBev purchased in 2011 for $37 million and has\u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2017/03/16/china-craft-beer-ab-inbev/\"\u003e promoted aggressively\u003c/a\u003e in China, recently opening a \u003ca href=\"http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201802/03/WS5a757795a3106e7dcc13a988_1.html\"\u003ebrewery in the Hubei province\u003c/a\u003e to produce the brew locally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAB InBev\u0026#8217;s spending spree—particularly its 2016 \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2016/07/26/anheuser-busch-inbev-sabmiller-raises-offer/\"\u003epurchase of rival \u003c/a\u003eSab Miller for $100 billion—has left the company heavily in debt. Listing its APAC unit could help AB InBev deleverage but could also help the group pursue M\u0026amp;A opportunities across the region, Budweiser APAC noted in its original prospectus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;I think the long term strategy would have to be to expand into other markets in Southeast Asia but I think it’s about China right now. They have to get growth there and try to expand margins,\u0026#8221; Gorham says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eGorham doesn\u0026#8217;t think the listing is directly related to AB InBev\u0026#8217;s China interests and maintains that if the company doesn\u0026#8217;t get the valuation it wants, then it can wait. But with AB InBev reportedly seeking a significantly lower valuation for Budweiser APAC this time, investors will likely pick up the tab.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eMore must-read stories from \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—Deutsche Bank CEO on European Central Bank: \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/09/04/deutsche-bank-ceo-ecb-negative-rates/\"\u003e“Negative rates ruin the financial system”\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e—\u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/09/04/stock-market-september-worst-month-2019-trade-recession/\"\u003eSeptember is historically the worst month for stocks.\u003c/a\u003e Will 2019 follow the pattern?\u003cbr\u003e—Why the \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/09/02/next-recession-different-2008-great-recession/\"\u003enext recession\u003c/a\u003e may feel very different than 2008\u003cbr\u003e—Here’s what it would take to get to \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/09/01/china-trade-war-what-it-takes-win-win/\"\u003e“win-win” with China on trade\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e—\u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/09/02/why-zombie-companies-are-on-the-rise-and-could-pose-a-threat-to-the-u-s-economy/\"\u003e”Zombie” companies are on the rise\u003c/a\u003e–and they could pose a threat to the U.S. economy\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eDon\u0026#8217;t miss the daily \u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://cloud.newsletters.fortune.com/fortune/nloptin?nl=TERM_SHEET\u0026amp;source=LinkStack\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eTerm Sheet\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e, Fortune\u0026#8217;s newsletter on deals and dealmakers.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://fortune.com/2019/09/12/ab-inbev-budweiser-brewing-apac-ipo/","published":"2019-09-12T10:21:13Z","guid":"https://fortune.com/?p=2696406"},{"title":"The U.S. and China Are Easing Back on Trade War Tariffs as Talks Near","content":"\n\u003cp\u003eThe U.S. and China are taking baby steps to ease tensions in their trade war, as negotiators prepare for the resumption of face-to-face talks in Washington in the coming weeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOn Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump said he was\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-11/trump-delays-china-tariff-increase-by-two-weeks-until-oct-15\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003epostponing\u003c/a\u003e\u0026nbsp;the imposition of 5% extra tariffs on Chinese goods by two weeks, meaning Chinese officials can celebrate their Oct. 1 national day without a fresh escalation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, China is\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-12/china-is-considering-u-s-farm-imports-as-goodwill-before-talks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003econsidering\u003c/a\u003e\u0026nbsp;whether to permit renewed imports of American farm goods including soybeans and pork, according to people familiar with the situation, potentially taking some pressure off U.S. states with large numbers of Trump supporters.

Certain kinds of oil, for example, that has a different carbon footprint.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHis comments offer a response to increasingly severe criticism aimed at the entire oil industry over its contribution to man-made climate change.

The report will be issued before its next AGM in May 2020.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eStill, the plan may prompt questions about how selling assets to another producer can help curb global emissions. For example, Dudley said on the call that the\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-28/bp-redraws-its-american-map-in-historic-shift-south-from-alaska\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003esale\u003c/a\u003e\u0026nbsp;last month of BP’s oil and gas fields in Alaska helped it reduce its carbon footprint. But the buyer plans to invest more in the fields than BP would have, potentially increasing production and boosting emissions in the process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eDudley also pointed out the main drive of the Alaska sale was the fact those fields were struggling to compete for capital within BP because production there was unlikely to grow as much as at the company’s other projects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eDudley said he’s juggling with the challenge of investing in relatively low-return renewables businesses while maintaining the company’s large dividend. He took aim at those who didn’t acknowledge how beneficial it is when BP does invest in low-carbon technology, saying any assessment of its carbon footprint should probably include the emissions it avoids.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ll reduce the emissions from our operations, reduce the emissions from our products and come up with the new business models,” he said. “If you add all those figures up in reductions of greenhouse gas \u0026#8212; for example, we have a big solar business, a big bio-fuel, wind business \u0026#8212; you almost get no credit when you do those calculations.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile he has maintained the company’s business model already with with the Paris accord, he said having to issue a report to benchmark progress has caused the company to think further about its spending.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eCarbon Tracker\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eA\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-05/big-oil-spending-clashes-with-climate-goals-carbon-tracker-says\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003ereport\u003c/a\u003e\u0026nbsp;by Carbon Tracker last week said BP’s most polluting investments are the Zinia 2 project in Angola and the Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli development in Azerbaijan, and that neither are compatible with the Paris goals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“Our strategy is to produce advantaged barrels, which involves considering factors like whether they are economic to produce, low risk to bring to market and lower carbon from an emissions standpoint,” a BP spokeswoman said in response to the Carbon Tracker assessment. These “could help to push other more costly and high-carbon barrels out of the mix, just as gas can help to push coal out of the power mix.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBP is also seeking to divest assets because its debt is too high, Dudley said on the call, constraining his spending power. It has announced about $7 billion of a $10 billion disposal program linked to the purchase of shale fields from BHP Group Ltd. last year. An earlier plan to meet that target by selling older onshore gas fields was complicated by the price of natural gas falling, he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBP became the operator of the BHP fields in March, which has now caused other complications to the British company’s climate ambitions. Dudley said the level of flaring, the deliberate burning of methane at the place it’s produced, is “not right,” and he is working to reduce it.

I didn\u0026#8217;t expect to be doing squats and jogging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eYet, that\u0026#8217;s exactly what I found myself doing this week as I played \u003cem\u003eRing Fit Adventure\u003c/em\u003e, a new fitness game for the Switch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eLast week, many were left scratching their heads when Nintendo tweeted a short video of people using a new circular Switch accessory. As Nintendo just announced, the Ring-Con is an accessory for \u003cem\u003eRing Fit Adventure\u003c/em\u003e that senses how you position, push, and pull the ring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe game, which costs, $79.99 will be released Oct. 18. That price includes the game itself, the Ring-Con, and the Leg Strap, which is a Joy-Con (one of the Switch\u0026#8217;s controllers) that you wrap around your leg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0026#8217;ll need to buy two Joy-Cons, and of course a Switch, which are sold separately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis comes off the heels of Nintendo announcing the Switch Lite, a portable version of the Switch that doesn\u0026#8217;t hook up to televisions. While you can play the \u003cem\u003eRing Fit Adventure\u003c/em\u003e with the Switch Lite, the set up is not ideal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Ring-Con, along with the Leg Strap tracks your movements as you make your way through the game. The game features lots of jogging in place, especially in the story mode where you work through worlds to eventually defeat your opponent, Dragaux, a muscular dragon that represents the negative aspects of gym culture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn order to defeat Dragaux, you play through different worlds, leveling up and increasing your attack and defense stats until you can defeat him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMy test of the game was pretty mild, so I didn\u0026#8217;t break a sweat—but my heart rate did go up to around 90 beats per minute after one exercise and a little over a 100 after another. After each exercise the game allows you to track your heart rate and says how hard you worked and how many calories you burned. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can also increase the difficulty if you want a more intense work out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt first, \u003cem\u003eRing Fit Adventure \u003c/em\u003efeels like an update to the \u003cem\u003eWii Fit, \u003c/em\u003eof two console generations ago, or over 10 years ago. Wii Fit, which came with a balance board accessory, emphasized checking into the game and measuring your body mass index, or BMI.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, \u003cem\u003eRing Fit Adventure\u003c/em\u003e is a game first, an incentive to do fitness second.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat said, there are still quite a lot of fitness elements. There are strengthening, cardio, and yoga moves. It may have been in the middle of doing an overhead press though that I started to think: Who is this for?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNintendo, as a brand, tends to be very child and family-focused. I couldn\u0026#8217;t see preschoolers trying to work out, even if it meant defeating a purple dragon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, it\u0026#8217;s really not for preschoolers. Nintendo representatives noted that \u003cem\u003eRing Fit Adventure \u003c/em\u003eis geared toward those eight-years old and up. And for players on the younger end of that spectrum, the Ring-Con can be calibrated to offer a more appropriate difficulty level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eRing Fit Adventure \u003c/em\u003eis a nice option for those who want a game that allows for physical activity. It\u0026#8217;s easy to get a range of exercises in with the 40 moves in total, and the game allows for quick sessions through mini-games and other game modes like Quick Play.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026#8217;s also a Silent Mode for users with neighbors below or who want to make less noise when they would normally have to jog. Jogging will likely make noise on non-carpeted floors, and some parts require you to bring your knees up while jogging in place—creating a louder impact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the game is fun and provides an easy way to get exercise in, it\u0026#8217;s not a guaranteed success. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOther Switch accessories like the Labo kits, which are for games that involve building cardboard accessories, haven\u0026#8217;t met expectations with mediocre sales. \u003cem\u003eRing Fit Adventure \u003c/em\u003emight fare better as it has broader appeal, but it faced bigger obstacles than the \u003cem\u003eWii Fit \u003c/em\u003edid. \u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://fortune.com/2019/09/12/nintendo-switch-ring-fit-adventure/","published":"2019-09-12T12:15:47Z","guid":"https://fortune.com/?p=2696000"},{"title":"Nestlé, World’s Largest Food Supplier, Aims to Eliminate All Greenhouse Gas Emissions By 2050","content":"\n\u003cp\u003eNestlé, the world\u0026#8217;s largest food supplier, will aim to effectively eliminate green house gas emissions across its massive global supply chain by 2050, the company said Thursday, in an announcement timed to coincide with the United Nations\u0026#8217; Climate Action Summit later this month. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLeft unchecked, climate change could \u0026#8220;greatly affect the availability of land, and the way we eat and consumer food,\u0026#8221; said Magdi Batato, executive vice president and head of operations at the consumer food giant, on a call with reporters. \u0026#8220;No one is immune to the consequences.\u0026#8221; \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNestlé is No. 76 on \u003cem\u003eFortune\u0026#8217;s \u003c/em\u003eGlobal 500 ranking, with $93.5 billion in revenue in 2018.

As a result, detailed projects and potential costs were not yet available, said Batato, adding that the plan would nonetheless require investment. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBroadly, the 2050 target will include launching more plant-based food and drink products, moving to alternative packaging materials, increasing the reliance on renewable energy, initiating programs with farmers to shift land use, and further efforts to stop deforestation, he said.

Instead, it will shift how animal-based products are produced, including changing how agricultural acreage is used and dramatically increasing the milk yield of individual cows. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeef and dairy farming is one of the largest sources of global agricultural emissions, due to methane emissions but also due to the amount of food, water and land required to raise cows for meat or dairy production. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0026#8220;This will lead to a major shift in how our ingredients are produced and sourced, and therefore we will need our suppliers to be on this journey with us,\u0026#8221; Batato said.

Risk: Part 1, The Persistent Effects of the Great Recession","content":"\u003cdiv class=\"pf-content\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTail Risk: Part 1, The Persistent Effects of the Great Recession\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eby Julian Kozlowski\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Great Recession of 2007-09 was a deep downturn with long-lasting effects on credit markets, labor markets, and the aggregate economy. This recession differed from previous ones, however, because (1) the downturn was more extreme and (2) it generated long-lived effects in the economy. Perhaps this recession has had more persistent effects because it had been perceived as an extremely unlikely event. Many of us now question whether the Financial Crisis could repeat itself. Today, financial panic is a new reality that may be affecting the aggregate economy.\u003csup\u003e1\u003c/sup\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the consequences of the Great Recession is a change in perception: Such a large negative shock to the economy was unexpected (if not completely dismissed); and now we may expect (or at least believe it is more probable) that a similar event might occur. In short, the Great Recession caused a change in \u0026#8220;tail risk.\u0026#8221;\u003csup\u003e2\u003c/sup\u003e In this three-part series, I explore how changes in tail risk can affect the aggregate economy. Part 1 explains how the Great Recession made us reevaluate the way we think about tail risk. \u003ca href=\"http://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/economic-synopses/2019/08/06/tail-risk-part-2-the-missing-recovery-after-the-great-recession\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003ePart 2\u003c/a\u003e explores its consequences for the economy and discusses why an increase in tail risk can help us understand the slow recovery after the Great Recession. Part 3 shows how the decline of the risk-free rate might be a consequence of the increase in tail risk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy focus on tail risk? Perception can be everything: People observe new events and use them to inform their probability estimates. For example, if you haven\u0026#8217;t seen many bank runs, you think bank runs are very rare. However, when you see a bank run, you update your estimates and determine that bank runs are not as rare as you previously thought. As an analogy, imagine you see the outcome of many rolls of a die. You don\u0026#8217;t know how many sides the die has or if the sides are weighted. However, you\u0026#8217;ve seen numbers one through six come up many times, about equally, so you think this is a standard six-sided die. One time, though, a seven comes up. As a result, you revise your belief about this die and now think the die has at least seven sides. Even if you don\u0026#8217;t see a seven again, the knowledge that the number seven can be rolled stays with you. It would probably affect your willingness to bet on the outcome of a die roll, too. Seeing the Financial Crisis was like seeing a seven come up on what you thought was a six-sided die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://ritholtz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/fig1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003e\u003cimg class=\"alignnone wp-image-230694 size-full\" src=\"https://ritholtz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/fig1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"439\" height=\"457\" srcset=\"https://ritholtz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/fig1.jpg 439w, https://ritholtz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/fig1-288x300.jpg 288w, https://ritholtz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/fig1-250x260.jpg 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 439px) 100vw, 439px\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid tail risk or the perceived probability of a financial crisis increase after the Great Recession?

His loadout isn\u0026#8217;t just attached to his back; he seems to meticulously equip his suit and to carefully select attachments for his arms as well. How these different attachments and options affect his capabilities in the field remain to be seen, but it seems like it\u0026#8217;ll be worth it to get things just right before setting out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e2.

We see Sam taking some time to rest in the grass, with prompts for him to massage his shoulders, stretch his legs or sneak in a quick nap. He\u0026#8217;ll stop to play a tune from a quest-given harmonica or bathe in a Recharging Spring, prompting the BB to respond with appreciative coos and likes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e5.

He\u0026#8217;ll need to move swiftly to lob Hematic and EX Grenades (we\u0026#8217;ll let you guess what those are made from) or use the Anti-BT Handgun from a distance.

To get your appetite started and give you a glimpse into what you can expect from the demo, we have also prepared a new trailer and a host of new information \u0026amp; visuals to commemorate the occasion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QFtJOtCmv1Q?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026#8217;s a lot to digest and I think it all looks quite compelling if I may say so myself. I certainly hope you\u0026#8217;ll be just as excited by what you see as well. So, without further gloating from my end, let\u0026#8217;s jump into some of the noteworthy highlights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs you begin this adventure, we introduce you to a gorgeous new surrounding which we call \u0026#8220;The Village of Cursed Blossoms\u0026#8221;. This stage actually happens to be the opening level that you will embark on in Nioh 2 and as the name suggests, this habitat is an amalgamation of natural beauty and menacing peril. The theme of disparity plays a major role throughout Nioh 2. But, more on that later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"alignnone fullwidthelement size-full\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48717367781_6c9c8fc7c7_c.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg style=\"float: left; margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;\" src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48717367781_6c9c8fc7c7_c.jpg\" alt=\"GameTitle on PS4\" width=\"465\" height=\"262\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48717538497_f4a08e93a7_c.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48717538497_f4a08e93a7_c.jpg\" alt=\"Nioh 2 on PS4\" width=\"465\" height=\"262\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoing back to this beautiful opening stage, I do want to say that as developers creating a game founded on Japanese aesthetics, we\u0026#8217;ve always hoped to design a level covered by cherry blossoms in full bloom. So, it brings us great joy and satisfaction to finally see it become a reality on this project. Lucky for us, a well known area for sakura trees called Chidorigafuchi is right in our backyard next to the Team NINJA studio! This benefit allowed us to refine our visuals with great detail and accuracy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany of you have come to realize that Yokai are the essential cornerstone of this franchise. And we take careful consideration when adding in these mythical creatures into the game. Our selection process for implementing Yokai into the experience goes far beyond simply choosing the most popular or well known versions. Instead, we meticulously select each creature based on their unique characteristics to properly compliment specific integrations. This approach ultimately ensures a wide range of variation and scope to the action. Which is super important in keeping you guys engaged and challenged at all times!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"alignnone fullwidthelement size-full\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48717031763_84afe08d6d_c.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg style=\"float: left; margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;\" src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48717031763_84afe08d6d_c.jpg\" alt=\"GameTitle on PS4\" width=\"465\" height=\"262\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48717538787_ee26757c2e_c.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48717538787_ee26757c2e_c.jpg\" alt=\"Nioh 2 on PS4\" width=\"465\" height=\"262\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaking of Yokai, our latest demo features Mezuki- a terrifying beast adorned with a grotesque mug and wielding a deadly saw-like weapon. Its debut should make quite an impression with the players testing out their Yokai combat skills at the Tokyo Game Show. Word of advice for those looking to go toe-to-toe with Mezuki\u0026#8230; when in the Dark Realm, ruthless Yokai turn even more fierce and powerful. So, tread carefully and strike effectively within the DR.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition, players will also encounter smaller creatures called Sudama (Sudama are actually Kodama that turned Yokai) in The Village of Cursed Blossoms. As in their former incarnation, they are not violent but they display an unrelenting thirst for material possession. To provide some perspective, the image of the background from our key art represents the contrast between the world of men and the realm of Yokai, which is a central theme played out in the game and also the motivation behind our new half-breed protagonist. Given the basis for this duality, the Sudama was created as an antithesis to the Kodama.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"alignnone fullwidthelement size-full\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48717538937_ebd71cab80_c.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg style=\"float: left; margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;\" src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48717538937_ebd71cab80_c.jpg\" alt=\"GameTitle on PS4\" width=\"465\" height=\"262\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48717539107_e7e6833265_c.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48717539107_e7e6833265_c.jpg\" alt=\"Nioh 2 on PS4\" width=\"465\" height=\"262\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026#8217;s so much more I\u0026#8217;d like to share with you guys for Nioh 2, but I\u0026#8217;ll save it for next time. As we prepare to finalize the game and set our sights on the launch in early 2020, I want to leave you with a special message from our producer, Yasuda-san.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCreative Director \u0026#8211; Tom Lee\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u0026#8220;Since receiving the many feedbacks from the closed alpha session, we have been diligently working on the game with great enthusiasm. To be honest, we\u0026#8217;ve had to overcome many trials and errors during the process of designing Yokai action mechanics such as \u0026#8220;special moves\u0026#8221;, \u0026#8220;Yokai moves\u0026#8221; as well as the visual presentation of the \u0026#8220;Dark Realm\u0026#8221;. However, we are now quite satisfied with where we are at.

Here are some details we noticed:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 57%;\"\u003e\u003ciframe style=\"left: 0px; top: 0px; position: absolute;\" src=\"https://gfycat.com/ifr/dapperthatcoypu\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003ePreparation Is Key\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, we see Sam likely preparing for a mission by picking his equipment and balancing his cargo. His loadout isn’t just attached to his back; he seems to meticulously equip his suit and to carefully select attachments for his arms as well. How these different attachments and options affect his capabilities in the field remain to be seen, but it seems like it\u0026#8217;ll be worth it to get things just right before setting out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 57%;\"\u003e\u003ciframe style=\"left: 0px; top: 0px; position: absolute;\" src=\"https://gfycat.com/ifr/jitteryshockedamericanquarterhorse\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003ePlot Your Own Course\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore leaving the facility, Sam also takes a moment to examine the map, which can be shifted into a topographical view that takes all the area\u0026#8217;s hills, valleys, and bodies of water into account. Players can place markers to plot a specific course, as well as prepare necessary equipment like ladders, anchors, and boots for the journey ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 57%;\"\u003e\u003ciframe style=\"left: 0px; top: 0px; position: absolute;\" src=\"https://gfycat.com/ifr/snoopysparklingagama\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"mce_SELRES_start\" style=\"width: 0px; line-height: 0; overflow: hidden; display: inline-block;\" data-mce-type=\"bookmark\"\u003e﻿\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eYou’re Not The Only One Exploring This World\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile we’re pretty sure you won’t be bumping into direct contact with other players in this world, it seems you may come across things they’ve built or left behind.* There are clear signs of other travelers like yourself using equipment to cross gaps and scale mountains, making you the benefactor of their generous intrepidness. Be sure to leave them a like for their troubles \u0026#8212; it’s not yet known what purpose that serves, but at least it will make them feel deservedly appreciated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 57%;\"\u003e\u003ciframe style=\"left: 0px; top: 0px; position: absolute;\" src=\"https://gfycat.com/ifr/perkyidledodo\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eTreat Yourself\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven the responsibility placed on Sam’s shoulders, both literally and figuratively, Death Stranding encourages moments of tranquility and recuperation. We see Sam taking some time to rest in the grass, with prompts for him to massage his shoulders, stretch his legs or sneak in a quick nap. He’ll stop to play a tune from a quest-given harmonica or bathe in a Recharging Spring, prompting the BB to respond with appreciative coos and likes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 57%;\"\u003e\u003ciframe style=\"left: 0px; top: 0px; position: absolute;\" src=\"https://gfycat.com/ifr/earnestfarawayiberianmole\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eOn The Move\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam can move at different paces despite being loaded to the brim with cargo and equipment. We see Sam equip an “Active Skeleton” that lets him run faster and farther. He also pulls off some rather epic jumps despite his massive pack of cargo \u0026#8212; getting around should be a lot more interesting once you acquire one of these. We can also see Sam steal a MULE truck for a quick escape, and later on, ride a motorcycle, illustrating that traversal in Death Stranding can take many forms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 57%;\"\u003e\u003ciframe style=\"left: 0px; top: 0px; position: absolute;\" src=\"https://gfycat.com/ifr/flamboyantfreejunco\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eLighten The Load\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam can also equip a Floating Carrier: a hovering palette of sorts that Sam can pack cargo onto, and be pulled along behind him as he walks. This should make a big difference in terms of Sam\u0026#8217;s capacity to transport goods, speeding up deliveries and allowing for more flexibility should he come across lost cargo he doesn’t want to leave behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 57%;\"\u003e\u003ciframe style=\"left: 0px; top: 0px; position: absolute;\" src=\"https://gfycat.com/ifr/anyfixedibisbill\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThat Floating Carrier Can Carry You, Too\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater in the video we see Sam hop onto his empty Floating Carrier to zoom down from his high vantage point and stealthily approach a MULE camp. This sort of speedy, convenient traversal hints at multiple ways to approach a challenge, giving Sam an even more efficient way of getting down beyond the rope and ladders we’ve already seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 57%;\"\u003e\u003ciframe style=\"left: 0px; top: 0px; position: absolute;\" src=\"https://gfycat.com/ifr/easyuntidyirrawaddydolphin\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eDon’t Be A Drag\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam finds himself in danger in the second half of the footage, when his sensor alerts him to nearby activity. We see him struggle to shift his weight and break free from the BT’s tar covered grip, and eventually be dragged into combat with a more formidable foe. If running isn’t an option, as it appears in this section of gameplay, then removing packages to keep Sam lighter during combat is. He’ll need to move swiftly to lob Hematic and EX Grenades (we’ll let you guess what those are made from) or use the Anti-BT Handgun from a distance. Should you survive, don’t forget to grab your discarded cargo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 57%;\"\u003e\u003ciframe style=\"left: 0px; top: 0px; position: absolute;\" src=\"https://gfycat.com/ifr/handmadeappropriatechinesecrocodilelizard\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eMake Meaningful Connections\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam isn’t alone in the world of Death Stranding. We see him complete a couple deliveries throughout the new footage, one to return lost cargo and the other in which he approaches a larger facility and is met with a hologram version of one of its residents. Upon delivery completion, each facility representative greeted Sam to thank him for his trouble and allowed him to add their base to a larger sprawling Chiral Network. It seems these forged connections are at the heart of his journey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr width=\"75%\" /\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose are just some of the details we caught in the new footage.

So it brings us great joy and satisfaction to finally make it a reality in Nioh 2. Lucky for us, a well-known area for sakura trees called Chidorigafuchi is right next to the Team Ninja studio! This gave us the opportunity to refine our visuals with great detail and accuracy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYokai are an essential cornerstone of this franchise, and we take careful consideration when adding these mythical creatures into the game. When choosing new Yokai to implement, we go far beyond simply choosing the most popular or well-known versions. Instead, we meticulously select each creature based on their unique characteristics to effectively complement specific integrations. This approach ensures a wide range of variation and scope, which is super important in keeping players engaged and challenged!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48718601186_5ed4040512_o.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48718601186_d4a8d22824_h.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Nioh 2\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"center\"\u003e\u003csmall\u003e\u003cem\u003eUnveiling her true face and her Guardian Spirit, who is this woman who exhibits great hatred for yokai?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/small\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaking of Yokai, our latest demo features Mezuki \u0026#8212; a terrifying beast adorned with a grotesque mug and wielding a deadly saw-like weapon. Its debut should make quite an impression with the players testing their Yokai combat skills at TGS. One word of advice for those looking to go toe-to-toe with Mezuki: When in the Dark Realm, ruthless Yokai become even fiercer and more powerful. Tread carefully and strike effectively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlayers will also encounter smaller creatures called Sudama (Sudama are actually Kodama that turned into Yokai) in The Village of Cursed Blossoms. As in their former incarnation, they are not violent but they display an unrelenting thirst for material possessions. To provide some perspective, the background image in our key art represents the contrast between the world of men and the realm of Yokai, which is a central theme of the game and the motivation behind our new half-breed protagonist. Given this duality, the Sudama was created as an antithesis to the Kodama.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48718773752_dd44d9266a_o.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48718773752_b43e1daa71_h.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Nioh 2\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"center\"\u003e\u003csmall\u003e\u003cem\u003eMagami is a Guardian Spirit taking the shape of a wolf, and is known to be kin to the mountain spirits.

To be honest, we’ve had to overcome many trials and errors during the process of designing Yokai action mechanics such as “special moves,” “Yokai moves,” and the visual presentation of the “Dark Realm.” However, we are now quite satisfied with where we are at. It goes without saying that the improvements won’t stop until launch and we’ll continue to keep you updated with our progress.

Yet the Democratic presidential campaign remains largely a procession of speeches and photo ops. Tonight, in O’Rourke’s home state of Texas, 10 candidates will appear on the debate stage and again smack one another with heavily rehearsed answers, as if there’s much relevant or revelatory to be found in this performance art.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMuch of O’Rourke’s presidential campaign can seem like a rolling existential crisis, playing itself out via livestreams and the journal entries he posts on Medium. Now, O’Rourke says, he’s actually had an existential crisis—and he thinks the rest of the country should be having one too. For O’Rourke and his aides, his campaign can be divided into two phases: before the August 3 mass shooting that targeted Latino immigrants in his hometown of El Paso, and after. In the days that followed the violence, he told me in a recent interview, he was in such a dark place that he wondered how to go on, and even whether he should.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eO’Rourke says the shooting has given him a new kind of mission. But his challenge now is jamming his epiphany into the presidential race: explaining how El Paso changed him and why voters should care enough about that change to give him a second look, while sticking to his promise to campaign in forgotten parts of the country without insulting the picky and provincial residents in early-voting states. In the process, he needs to move the polls that have had him solidly in the low single digits since his initial post-campaign-launch burst in March. In a \u003ca href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/11/politics/cnn-poll-2020-democrats-renominate-trump/index.html\"\u003enational CNN poll\u003c/a\u003e released yesterday, he crept up to 5 percent, but he’s still far behind the leading candidates in the race.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“At a really deep, fundamental level, [the shooting] made me wonder what I’m doing, and what I’d ever been doing, or what \u003cem\u003ewe\u003c/em\u003e were doing,” O’Rourke told me last week as we rode the Bolt Bus from New York to Boston, in an interview that can be heard in full on \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/09/beto-on-the-bus/597556/?utm_source=feed\"\u003ethe \u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/09/beto-on-the-bus/597556/?utm_source=feed\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eRadio Atlantic \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/09/beto-on-the-bus/597556/?utm_source=feed\"\u003epodcast\u003c/a\u003e. “And this is probably not making sense, but—how could this happen? How could I have allowed this to happen, as a part of this country, as someone who held public office, as an El Pasoan?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn the trail, I’ve heard him tell a story that captures how he says he’s changed. In the spring of 2018, he was walking in El Paso in a local companion event to the national March for Our Lives, organized by students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. He was in Congress then, and running for Senate, a race he would go on to lose in November. Henry, his younger son, asked him why counterprotesters nearby were holding assault rifles. Hadn’t the whole day been about getting rid of those weapons? Henry asked.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“I said, ‘Ah, don't worry about that. These are very nice people and they're just trying to make a point. You know, under Texas law, they can do it, but don't worry about it. Don't give them any attention,’” O’Rourke told me last week, repeating the story. “What I should have said is ‘No, you're right, Henry: That is absolutely wrong, and there's nothing funny about that. And you're right to point this out and be disturbed by it, and you should be angry, and it should make you a little bit afraid, and it's a very natural reaction.’”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn this new phase of his candidacy, O’Rourke says he wants to live out the consequences of Donald Trump’s presidency. His campaign has been incorporating specific stops into his schedule: one of the towns in Mississippi where Immigration and Customs Enforcement recently raided food-processing plants; a community-leader roundtable in Charlottesville, Virginia, the site of the 2017 white-supremacist march; an LGBTQ synagogue in Manhattan; a mosque in New Hampshire. These stops, he says, make more sense than eating corn dogs and making speeches at the Iowa State Fair, which is what the other candidates did the weekend after the shooting. (O’Rourke had been slated to appear in Iowa as well, before canceling after the shooting.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“To quote Shakespeare—or Geddy Lee from Rush—I mean, we're all actors on that stage, and no one more so than perhaps somebody running for president.

I have to go do the things that I think are important.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eKick over the wall ’cause government’s to fall\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eHow can you refuse it? \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eLet fury have the hour, anger can be power\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eDo you know that you can use it?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe spent the bus ride talking about the El Paso shooting and what it meant to him, because these days, O’Rourke is always talking about the El Paso shooting and what it meant to him.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhy exactly were we having this conversation on a Bolt Bus? He’d been in Manhattan for CNN’s Climate Forum last week and was on his way to New Hampshire’s state Democratic Party convention. But why a bus, given that it meant five hours on the road, with a stop in New Haven and another at a roadside Burger King, where we tried the new no-meat Whopper? Well, he likes to keep moving, he told me, and he figured it would be as fast as a flight once he took into account the drive to the airport and time spent waiting there. (Short of major traffic on the way to LaGuardia or JFK, this probably wouldn’t have been quite true.) He was also saving the campaign money, he said, at $23 a ticket for him and five staffers. Plus, the bus trip would have a lighter carbon footprint than a flight. And he always likes to meet people on the road, such as the cashier at the Burger King, who told him he’d been in one of her dreams months ago.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/07/beto-orourke-2020-campaign/594937/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: Searching for Beto\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEven when there’s so much collective anger among Democrats to reflect, reflecting Democrats’ collective anger doesn’t make for much of a presidential campaign. At least, it never has before. It’s one thing to go viral for saying “This is fucked up” after the second mass shooting in Texas in August. It’s another to convince Americans that you have the power to change the country. As one woman shouted at O’Rourke during a campaign stop in a Boston bar last Thursday night: “What’s your vision? What are you going to do about it?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLater, standing in the brewery room behind the bar, O’Rourke told reporters that he welcomed his heckler: “People speaking honestly, hearing what they have to honestly say even before I finished my opening, folks engaging in the conversation, wanting to hear answers—I love that.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYet he has had trouble articulating why he is running for president. (That is, beyond his sense that he was “born to be in it,” a quote that \u003cem\u003eVanity Fair\u003c/em\u003e put on its March cover at the launch of his campaign and that haunted him for months after, despite his saying almost immediately post-publication that his words had been misconstrued.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the hospital rooms and memorial services in El Paso, O’Rourke thinks he’s found his real reason to run. On his trip to New Hampshire, I watched him try to express his new mind-set during his speech at the state convention in Manchester. In front of waves of black-and-white BETO signs, he tried to explain the shooting’s root causes, linking it to a larger legacy of injustice and hate—arguing that with so much trouble in America’s history, “sooner or later it was going to find us.” He concluded with a call for an overhaul of the immigration system, reparations for African Americans, and mandatory government buybacks of assault weapons. Many in the crowd seemed to lock in as he was speaking. Among them was Wendy Abbott, the Democratic chair in the town of Milton, who seemed to be listening intently for her next chance to clap.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“His passion, his compassion—it just hits,” Abbott told me. In recent months, she’d moved away from considering him someone she could vote for, but he’d brought her around. Former Vice President Joe Biden has a rationale for running, Abbott said. So does Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and other candidates too. “I think he has found his,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRalph Fuell, a retired human-resources manager from Warren, told me he saw a change too: “He’s more fiery now than the last time I heard him.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStill, O’Rourke’s speech didn’t sound like the kind of catering that many super-engaged early-state voters have come to expect; he wasn’t talking up local issues, or spending much time on the Democratic feel-goodery that some in the audience told me they were looking for. “New Hampshire hasn’t had one of these mass shootings, so we feel immune to it,” state Representative Mary Beth Walz told me after watching him speak. “We’re not. But people feel that way.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRival candidates and campaign aides, as well as a number of Democratic voters I spoke with at the convention, told me they see O’Rourke’s new approach as desperate and a little flimsy. He had this sudden revelation on guns and the impact of the Trump presidency just because of what happened in his hometown? He didn’t see before what’s upsetting him so much now? On Saturday afternoon in Manchester, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey raised those questions himself to reporters, noting, without naming names, that when he proposed a mandatory assault-rifle buyback months before El Paso, “I was attacked by some people in the Democratic primary for saying I was going too far. Now they’re coming on board.” O’Rourke disagreed with Booker at the time—and now he’s made buybacks a centerpiece of his response to the shooting.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eO’Rourke acknowledged to me that he doesn’t have a great answer for why he didn’t have this level of alarm before. “I could not help but be changed by El Paso. I don’t know that I'm alone in that,” he told me. “But, yeah, I think it’s a totally legitimate point.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn Manchester, I caught up with Representative Chris Pappas, a 39-year-old freshman Democrat in the U.S. House who disagrees with Trump on just about everything.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“I feel like we have a number of candidates who are speaking pretty authentically and effectively with the voters of New Hampshire, the voters of the country. Everyone has their own style, their own approach,” said Pappas, who is staying neutral in the race for now. “In New Hampshire we like to ensure that we can really have an honest conversation eye to eye with these candidates. He’s among those who are doing that in a nice way.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut, Pappas said, O’Rourke isn’t the only one alarmed about the country: “If you talk to most folks here, they have long understood what’s happening around us, the gravity of the situation we face, and the price of inaction.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhere O’Rourke’s campaign goes next depends on how many voters are seeing what he sees, and how many are looking for someone willing to talk about it like he does. He’s been mocked, especially by those tsk-tsking \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/08/beto-orourke-donald-trump-profanity-presidential-campaign/595801/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eall his cursing\u003c/a\u003e. But if the response to him at the bar in Boston, or the next night at a New Hampshire college, is any indication, he’s still resonating with the younger voters who helped make him a phenomenon in last year’s Texas Senate race.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen again, O’Rourke went unrecognized while standing on the sidewalk in Manhattan, waiting for the bus. A few hours later, when he did a livestream from the bus, talking about climate change and answering questions about whether he prefers the Beatles or the Rolling Stones for road music, most of the other riders did not seem to realize that they were three or four rows away from a presidential-campaign event. For all the cable-news coverage and tweets from political obsessives, most of the country hasn’t tuned in yet to the 2020 campaign.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo those ready to write him off, his going unnoticed would seem like proof of where his campaign stands these days.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eO’Rourke says he’s not concerned about that. He is “unique among the candidates,” he told me toward the end of our conversation on the bus, being “from the place that this president directs so much fear and hatred and racism” toward. “We don't have to apologize or be defensive or be on the back foot about this.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eYou don’t owe nothing, boy, get running.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/vBapNF-lRQY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/vBapNF-lRQY/","published":"2019-09-12T09:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-597895"},{"title":"The Crucial Question Dividing Pro-Impeachment Democrats","content":"\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eDemocrats clamoring to impeach President Donald Trump will score a victory of sorts this morning, when the House Judiciary Committee votes to launch a formal investigation that could result in the adoption of articles of impeachment for consideration by the full House.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eBut the panel’s expected decision to \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/08/us/politics/impeachment-investigation-trump.html\"\u003ebroaden its probe\u003c/a\u003e beyond the issues covered by former Special Counsel Robert Mueller has put a whole new question before the party: If Democrats decide to move against Trump, what exactly should they impeach him \u003cem\u003efor\u003c/em\u003e?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlthough impeachment backers are still far from the 218 votes they’d need to pass articles off the floor, a majority of House Democrats now favor launching a formal inquiry.

Unlike many of the allegations in the Mueller report, the Democrat added, “these are areas where the public has actually seen the conduct that is the subject of the investigation.

Thus far, the progressive presidential candidates are closer to President Obama’s worldview than their rhetoric lets on.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe progressive candidates have signaled their desire to pursue a policy in which the United States reduces its military commitments overseas—what is usually called a foreign policy of restraint. The interesting question, though, is whether that is possible at an acceptable cost. Outside of the Middle East, the answer is almost certainly no. If they were to go further toward adopting a strategy of restraint whereby the United States does much less militarily around the world, they would have to make major sacrifices on alliances, nuclear proliferation, and spheres of influence that no Democratic commander-in-chief seems likely to want to make.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/06/what-buttigieg-left-out-his-foreign-policy-speech/591502/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eThomas Wright: Buttigieg splits from the progressives on foreign policy\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"dropcap\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003eTwo candidates for president—Bernie \u003ca href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-political-scene/bernie-sanders-imagines-a-progressive-new-approach-to-foreign-policy\"\u003eSanders\u003c/a\u003e and Elizabeth \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/world/2019/5/7/18525841/elizabeth-warren-foreign-policy-ganesh-sitaraman\"\u003eWarren\u003c/a\u003e—have embraced the progressive foreign-policy label.

They oppose military intervention in Syria and Iraq. They support the Iran nuclear deal. They want to get tough with Saudi Arabia, going beyond simply ending U.S. support for the war in Yemen. Both favor an end to the war in Afghanistan and both have questioned the extent of ongoing operations against terrorist networks. Sanders and Warren do differ over Israel—Sanders is very critical of Israel and has questioned U.S. aid whereas Warren is generally seen as supportive of the alliance.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eHowever, when you drill down, the two presidential candidates are difficult to pin down on whether they oppose military intervention on principle or, if not, under what conditions they might support it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eSanders opposed the Vietnam War, the first Gulf War, and the Iraq War of 2003, as well as numerous U.S. interventions in Latin America and the Middle East.

She has been careful not to shed any light on her views on them since becoming a U.S. Senator. However, Warren does have a track record from when she entered politics in 2012. In Warren’s first-ever \u003ca href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/elizabeth-warren-national-security_n_4861778\"\u003espeech\u003c/a\u003e on foreign policy, at Georgetown University in 2014, she implicitly criticized Obama for not being sufficiently sensitive to civilian casualties in his drone strikes. In 2014, she \u003ca href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/international/216559-warren-destroying-isis-should-be-our-no-1-priority\"\u003esaid\u003c/a\u003e that the defeat of ISIS should be the Obama administration’s top priority but the United States should avoid getting dragged into a war. She \u003ca href=\"https://www.masslive.com/politics/2014/08/sen_elizabeth_warren_warns_abo.html\"\u003esupported\u003c/a\u003e Obama’s airstrikes in Iraq in 2014 while \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/19/world/middleeast/senate-approves-isis-bill-avoiding-bigger-war-debate.html\"\u003eopposing\u003c/a\u003e his plan to train and equip Syrian opposition forces.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eA Warren advisor, who spoke under the condition of anonymity to engage in a broad ranging discussion on the senator’s worldview told me that Warren sees force as a last resort, and that when it is employed, believes there should be an exit strategy, it should be limited, and it should be multilateral, preferably through the United Nations. It’s a position that sounds almost identical to Obama’s.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe 44th president was also deeply skeptical of military interventions but found himself drawn in. For instance, by 2014 Obama had pulled American troops out of Iraq and was holding fast against involvement in Syria. But the rise of ISIS, the beheading of hostages, and the fall of Mosul created a groundswell of public pressure to deal directly with the threat. It was a reminder that even a president skeptical of intervention is one terrorist attack away from getting involved. That dynamic will not change in 2021. A progressive president is unlikely to argue that the United States should be indifferent to an ISIS-style group in the Middle East that conquers territory or attacks Americans. Sanders’ track record suggests he is more pragmatic that he lets on.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere is little doubt that Sanders and Warren are sincere in their desire to prioritize diplomacy over the use of force but here too they have a dilemma: when it comes to preventing a rogue state from acquiring nuclear weapons, a credible threat to use force often creates the leverage necessary to get the other side to the table. In her book, Wendy Sherman writes about how the Obama administration deliberately deployed a bomb that could penetrate Iran’s underground enrichment facility, “backing up our diplomacy with the credible use of force.” Would Sanders and Warren do the same thing? If not, what’s their theory of building leverage? Matt Duss, who serves as Sanders’ foreign policy advisor, told me Sanders is “against large scale military interventions or the threat of them and would rely more on economic sanctions to create leverage for negotiations like those for the Iran nuclear deal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe second theme is that both of them draw a dramatic divide between democratic and authoritarian states. In a major address at Johns Hopkins SAIS, Sanders \u003ca href=\"https://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sanders-speech-at-sais-building-a-global-democratic-movement-to-counter-authoritarianism\"\u003esaid\u003c/a\u003e:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\r\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThere is currently a struggle of enormous consequence taking place in the United States and throughout the world. In it we see two competing visions. On one hand, we see a growing worldwide movement toward authoritarianism, oligarchy, and kleptocracy. On the other side, we see a movement toward strengthening democracy, egalitarianism, and economic, social, racial, and environmental justice. This struggle has consequences for the entire future of the planet—economically, socially, and environmentally.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eSanders went on to identify the authoritarian movement as including Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro, Russia’s Vladimir Putin, Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu, Saudi Arabia’s Mohammed Bin Salman, and President Trump, who Sanders sees as on the wrong side of the struggle between autocrats and democrats.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIn her \u003cem\u003eForeign Affairs\u003c/em\u003e essay, Warren \u003ca href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2018-11-29/foreign-policy-all\"\u003estruck\u003c/a\u003e a similar note:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e“Authoritarian governments are gaining power, and right-wing demagogues are gaining strength. Movements toward openness and pluralism have stalled. Inequality is growing, transforming rule by the people into rule by wealthy elites. And here in the United States, many Americans seem to accept—even embrace—the politics of division and resentment.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWarren has focused more on China than Sanders, although Sanders intends to address China more in the coming months.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eFor both candidates, the democracy-versus-autocratic-oligarchs framing is a way to kill several birds with one stone. It allows them to talk about the global economy as a rigged system and to fight inequality. It is a way of getting tough with Russia and China. It allows them to stand up for democracy and human rights. Most importantly of all, it allows them to paint Trump as part of a global problem.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eHowever, democracy-versus-autocracy is not a radical departure from traditional Democratic foreign policy. Both Sanders and Warren essentially accept the diagnosis of more hawkish Democrats that the United States is locked in a geopolitical struggle with authoritarian regimes, but they depart significantly on the prescription—they would both slash the defense budget and would switch the topic away from geopolitical rivalries and toward inequality, economic policy, and democracy. This sets up a fundamental contradiction—Sanders and Warren will be forced to choose between waging the struggle against autocrats or cutting the defense budget and deemphasizing military power.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://warontherocks.com/2019/04/the-emergence-of-progressive-foreign-policy/\"\u003eWriting\u003c/a\u003e in \u003cem\u003eWar on the Rocks\u003c/em\u003e, a longtime adviser to Warren, Ganesh Sitaraman, argues that there is no such contradiction. “When progressives use hawkish language,” he says, “they are doing so with respect to economic challenges, not with an eye toward military buildups and war.” The Warren advisor I spoke with said the senator is generally happy with America's traditional strategic role in Europe, through NATO, but that she would be taking a close look at the US military footprint in the Asia Pacific. Economic competition would be Warren’s primary focus with regard to China. They went on to say \"It's important to defend our systems and values; it is possible to engage in a robust defense of our system without ending up in a military conflict.\"\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/03/chris-murphy-donald-trump-progressive-foreign-policy/518820/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: Do liberals have an answer to Trump on foreign policy?\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eMany Democrats believe that diplomatic and economic tools are more benign and preferable to the deployment of troops and deterrence, so it is no surprise to see progressives embrace their use. But the reason why Russia and China have a problem with the western order has as much to do with soft power than hard power. It is the prospect of color revolutions, fed by a free press, open information networks, anti-corruption measures, and the wide appeal of democratic ideas that scares Moscow and Beijing the most, not tanks in Eastern Europe or aircraft carriers in the Pacific. Take the example of Hong Kong. China does not worry about western military intervention. What it views as a threat are statements of support for the protestors—exactly of the kind that both \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/BernieSanders/status/1163437741389930501\"\u003eSanders\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/ewarren/status/1160997167026376704?lang=en\"\u003eWarren\u003c/a\u003e issued. Even when it comes to hard power, China worries less about military interventions and more about the long term balance of power.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThere’s nothing wrong with using these measures to counter Russian and Chinese influence. (I’ve written regularly in support of them.) However, it’s important that we acknowledge this is a competitive and tough policy that incurs risk. Sanders and Warren give the impression they believe this choice is inherently more benign than the blob’s approach and that they can opt out of military competition. In truth, escalating political warfare while pulling back militarily could create an incentive for America’s rivals to test the United States. Deterring geopolitical aggression—whether in the South China Sea or Ukraine—will become a precondition for managing and limiting tensions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIf Sanders or Warren are elected, they will find themselves confronted with these questions immediately. Indeed, some progressives and commentators worry about precisely that. For instance, Daniel Bessner of the University of Washington and Udi Greenberg of Dartmouth University recently \u003ca href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/foreign-policy-progressive-good-evil/\"\u003ewrote\u003c/a\u003e in \u003cem\u003eThe Nation\u003c/em\u003e, “For all their ingenuity, both candidates sometimes insist that this moment is defined by a battle between good and evil. In doing so, they frame geopolitics in simplistic terms that undermine the left’s long-term goals.” Bessner has \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/17/opinion/democratic-party-cortez-foreign-policy.html\"\u003eargued\u003c/a\u003e for a more radical foreign policy agenda for Democrats akin to that espoused by Labour leader’s Jeremy Corbyn.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eOthers have argued that the Democrats are just offering up a new version of American hegemony. Janan Ganesh of \u003cem\u003eThe Financial Times\u003c/em\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/us/democrats-still-cling-to-idea-of-us-as-a-redemptive-force-in-the-world-1.3931316\"\u003elambasted\u003c/a\u003e Democrats for failing to question the assumptions of leadership and argued that on foreign policy they were “stranded in time.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eI put this to Matt Duss. He felt the critics were underplaying the extent of change on military intervention in the Middle East, as evidenced by Sanders’s work to stop the war in Yemen. He told me that when it comes to Europe and Asia, “there are no pre-baked plans but there is a willingness to ask fundamental questions, listen to new ideas, and to develop a new consensus.” \"Very little is sacrosanct\" he said.” He expressed the hope that organizations like the Quincy Institute would inject the Washington debate with a new vigor. Duss did make the point that Sanders is not an old style leftist. \"Some leaders are hostile to the very idea of American power, but Senator Sanders is not one of those” he said. “The question is when and how that power is deployed. American diplomacy, humanitarian and development aid are formidable tools, and he will work closely with allies to use those tools to create a more peaceful world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eTo understand why Sanders, Warren, and other Democrats are unlikely to embrace a foreign policy of restraint, it is useful to look at restraint’s intellectual origins. No one has thought more deeply about how to implement a strategy of restraint than academic realists—the school of thought within foreign policy that defines national interests narrowly, sees the world in terms of power politics, and believes that the United States is massively overextended in the world. If you read the realists closely, it’s clear that they believe restraint is only possible if the United States takes radical action—actions at which almost all progressives would balk.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIt’s hard to do less while maintaining America’s alliances in Europe and Asia. The academic realists who developed the theories of restraint understood this. For instance, in his 2015 book \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00KNPMS2A/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8\u0026amp;btkr=1\"\u003eRestraint\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e, the MIT professor Barry Posen argues that the United States should withdraw from NATO. Progressives understand how toxic this is, which is why they have rejected it. But, if presidents simply confine themselves to tough talk about how allies need to do more, they will be following the pattern set by Obama.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003eRealists also understand that one of the consequences of U.S. retrenchment is that former allies will get nuclear weapons. For the most part, realists are fine with that, publishing articles with titles like “More is Better.” Progressives tend to believe in arms control, and most would be horrified by the prospect of nuclear proliferation. But, preventing nuclear proliferation means being serious about extended deterrence.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/10/bernie-sanders-and-end-american-century/573001/?utm_source=feed\"\u003ePeter Beinart: Bernie Sanders offers a foreign policy for the common man\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eRealists recognize that retrenchment means accepting that America’s rivals will acquire and expand their own spheres of influence. They don’t see it as a problem up until the point that rivals appear poised to dominate their entire regions. Some progressives have come around to this idea. Writing in these pages, Peter Beinart \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/09/shield-of-the-republic-a-democratic-foreign-policy-for-the-trump-age/570010/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eargued\u003c/a\u003e that Sanders and other Democrats must accept that China is displacing the United States from part of Asia.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eSpheres of influence are incompatible with Sanders and Warren’s description of a struggle between authoritarianism and democracy, but even laying that aside, the approach is fraught with risk. The lines of such spheres are unclear and would be subject to constant revision, often through the use or threat of the use of force. If even China and Russia are entitled to their spheres, why not Japan, Britain, and Germany? And would the United States, particularly under a progressive president, seriously sit down with a Chinese or Russian leader and divide up the world over the objections of the smaller countries who would be served up?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIndeed, China’s rise has been so rapid that many realists are rethinking their previous support for restraint. Jennifer Lind, a professor at Dartmouth University, told me\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\r\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe ‘restraint’ school that emerged in the late 1990s counseled husbanding resources for the ‘main event’ of a regional peer competitor. Sadly no one listened to them; America’s power and position are weaker today as a result. But today we’re seeing an increasingly powerful and assertive China: grabbing resources, ignoring international law, militarizing the South China Sea. Its neighbors can’t or won’t balance. The question for the restraint school is, at what point does China become the main event—and how should US policy change when it does?\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor their part, progressives are also much more comfortable with ending the forever wars accommodating China’s rise. In January, a few months before he helped set up the Quincy Institute, Soros \u003ca href=\"https://www.georgesoros.com/2019/01/24/remarks-delivered-at-the-world-economic-forum-2/\"\u003egave\u003c/a\u003e an impassioned speech at Davos warning of “the mortal danger facing open societies from the instruments of control that machine learning and artificial intelligence can put in the hands of repressive regimes.” Soros called Xi Jinping “the most dangerous opponent of those who believe in the concept of open society.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eTrue restraint—whereby the United States significantly reduces its military commitments overseas—will be all but impossible for a Democratic president to achieve in a deliberate and orderly fashion. It would involve too many compromises of core principles. Progressive presidents will not want to pursue the destruction of the alliance system, acquiesce in nuclear proliferation, or embrace the imperialist notion of spheres of influence. They will be unable and unwilling to promise credibly never to intervene militarily.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIt is possible that Sanders and Warren find themselves stuck between the mainstream national security worldview they have articulated and their aspirations to opt out of geopolitical competition and military interventions. This could hobble the early years of their administration. Alternatively, they could embrace a practical and modest progressive approach. This would seek to pull back from the Middle East, keep the basic structure of America’s role in Europe and Asia intact while modernizing the military, sharpen the ideological divide with authoritarian states, and endeavor to change the world on specific issues, much as Obama did by opening up relations with Cuba, prioritizing climate change, and by playing a constructive role in international institutions. In this, much of the blob would agree. If Warren or Sanders emerges as the nominee, there will undoubtedly be tensions and disagreements with the Democratic foreign policy establishment, but this type of practical progressivism may form the basis for a rapprochement and avoidance of the kind of schism Trump brought to Republican foreign policy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/4ARo2nhQuvU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/4ARo2nhQuvU/","published":"2019-09-12T10:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-597823"},{"title":"The Private Option","content":"\u003cp\u003eWINSTON-SALEM, N.C.—In the span of 24 days in May 2017, two men died in Forsyth County’s jail. Both were fathers. Both were black. The first man, Deshawn Lamont Coley, had written request after request begging for his asthma inhaler—accurately predicting that his sporadic access to it was putting his life at risk. The second, Stephen Antwan Patterson, was found without a pulse about a week after he was booked with a blood-pressure reading that would likely have led any free person to the emergency room. The deaths came at an uncomfortable time for Forsyth County: Patterson died just four weeks before the Board of Commissioners sat down to decide whether to renew a contract with the private health-care company that had cared for the two men, then called Correct Care Solutions and now Wellpath, or sign with someone else.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat might have been a routine board meeting turned tense. “Correct Care Solutions makes the sheriff’s office look bad, makes the county look bad, makes the Department of Health look bad, and makes us commissioners look bad,” Everette Witherspoon, then a commissioner, declared. “So many people have blown up my phone about some of these incidents that it doesn’t even make any sense.” The following week, a regional vice president from Correct Care Solutions, Bill Kissel, showed up to try to massage the situation. It didn’t go well. Commissioners posed a series of questions. Had the company lost any lawsuits? “I am not aware, Commissioner,” Kissel replied, adding that legal claims are often settled before a trial. When would the county see the company’s plan for resolving issues that may have contributed to the deaths? “[That] would not be made public,” Kissel said. “In those eight years [that Correct Care Solutions had the contract for Forsyth County], how many deaths have we had in the jail? Do you know?” Witherspoon asked. “I don’t know offhand, sir,” Kissel said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn my review of Forsyth County’s videotaped meetings and in interviews with several commissioners, sheriff’s-office staff, and community members, it was clear that few seemed totally comfortable continuing to work with Correct Care Solutions. People entering jails are not necessarily society’s healthiest, often detoxing from substances or dealing with mental illness; a death in custody may not imply wrongdoing. But Patterson’s and Coley’s deaths were not a first in the jail under the care of the contractor. Two legal settlements were reached—one for $180,000, and the other for an undisclosed amount, about six months earlier, according to the \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://triad-city-beat.com/families-two-deceased-forsyth-county-inmates-settle-lawsuits/\"\u003eTriad City Beat\u003c/a\u003e—\u003c/em\u003ein the deaths of two other inmates, Dino Vann Nixon in 2013 and Jennifer McCormack Schuler in 2014. But Forsyth’s commissioners had exactly zero alternatives. After an exhaustive search for a contractor, starting almost an entire year earlier, the only entity that formally offered its services was Correct Care Solutions. So the board voted to award it an estimated $13.2 million contract for three more years. Only Witherspoon and one other commissioner voted against it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen I asked Patterson’s mother, Deborah Miles, whether she thought the jail’s health care should be privately run, her reaction was immediate: “No!

No, no, no. ’Cause it just becomes a meat market, just a moneymaking thing.” Her son was in jail over a couple of hundred dollars in unpaid child support, she added. “The horrible reason people are there is because they don’t have money to bail themself out for simple stuff! And so you get stuck there,” she said. Patterson’s eldest son and Coley’s mother are separately suing the contractor. (The company declined to comment on ongoing litigation.) Most people held in jails haven’t been convicted, and as of the end of 2017, black people were jailed at a rate of more than three times that of white people. Their charges, too, are often minor: traffic offenses, marijuana possession, petty theft. Put another way, every day, thousands of legally innocent people are stopped, searched, cuffed, booked, examined, locked up, and upended from their routines, families, homes, and jobs—all without their own medical supplies and prescriptions—to endure a few days, or more, in a jail. Many will eventually see their charges dismissed or pleaded down, if they are charged at all. But the correctional health-care industry depends on them. In a financial disclosure to investors, one publicly traded company, later acquired by Correct Care Solutions, listed reduced sentences, decriminalization, and relaxed enforcement among its top business risks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the months since Forsyth found itself with a single bidder for its inmate-health-care contract, the range of possible providers has shrunk even further. Last fall, H.I.G. Capital, a private-equity firm with more than $34 billion in equity capital under management, acquired Correct Care Solutions and combined it with a smaller company, Correctional Medical Group Companies. They named the combined company Wellpath. Kip Hallman, Wellpath’s president, told me the firm currently serves about 10 percent of the counties in the nation. That number might not seem large, but without knowing which counties, exactly—a detail the company doesn’t disclose—it’s impossible to say how many inmates it serves. What I do know is that Wellpath is now estimated to be the country’s largest correctional health-care company. It works in about 550 jails, prisons, and behavioral-health settings in 36 states across the United States and Australia, and cares for nearly 300,000 patients on a daily basis. There is no standard way to compare Wellpath’s performance with its competitors, firms such as Corizon Health and Armor Correctional Health Services. But Wellpath’s rapid ascent is emblematic of America’s booming $40 billion market for private correctional services of all kinds. Its predecessors, Correct Care Solutions and Correctional Medical Group Companies, are stark examples of the surging growth that’s possible with private-equity backing. In its newly grafted, sized-up form, Wellpath is at the beginning of another cycle, with bigger investors and bigger stakes than ever. To deliver returns to its investors, it must continue to grow.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"full-width\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" height=\"640\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/09/Jail_Exam_Room_Interior_Shot/19c42df37.jpg\" width=\"960\"\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"caption\"\u003eWellpath’s medical staffers operate out of exam rooms like this one in the Forsyth County jail. (Hunter Laughlin / Courtesy of Forsyth County Sheriff’s Office)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere’s very little research on the country’s correctional health-care market. To gain an understanding of the significance of Wellpath’s rise, I reviewed the minutes and videotape of dozens of county board meetings, pored over hundreds of pages of contracts and proposals, and, with help from \u003cem\u003eAtlantic \u003c/em\u003eresearchers, contacted more than 150 sheriff’s offices nationwide. Hallman responded in writing to most of my questions and followed up with a phone interview. What I’ve found is striking. Just a handful of firms serve the nation’s largest jails. A contractor deemed problematic can’t always be replaced. And once jails go private, it’s not necessarily easy to go back. With health care, lack of choice isn’t just a market problem, but a factor in the quality of the care patients receive. \u003ca href=\"https://www.sacbee.com/news/investigations/the-public-eye/article7249637.html\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Sacramento Bee\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e found that, over a 10-year period ending in 2014, people in custody at California county jails serviced by one private contractor died of suicide or drug overdose at a rate about 50 percent higher than at other county jails when adjusted for population. That contractor later became part of Wellpath, which disagrees with the \u003cem\u003eBee\u003c/em\u003e’s findings.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe H.I.G. fund that holds Wellpath plans to create value through “growth, performance improvement and synergistic add-on acquisitions,” according to the marketing jargon of a pitch to investors. The captain of one jail put it to me in more colorful terms: “The big dogs keep buying up the puppies.” Wellpath’s clients aren’t thrilled. “What if [Wellpath] walked away? Where would we be, right? So knowing that this is a symbiotic relationship: I need them—hopefully, they need me, right?” Bobby F. Kimbrough Jr., the sheriff of Forsyth County, told me. But, he conceded, the balance of power isn’t exactly equal. “If you’re the only dance in town, you can pretty much call your own shots,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAmerica’s roughly 3,200 jails held an average total of 731,300 people a day in 2016, and admitted more than 10 million people that year. The system is big and fragmented, and really, it’s not much of a system at all. Unlike prisons, which are run by state or federal agencies for people with longer sentences, jails are generally a local affair, often administered by sheriff’s offices. Since companies like Wellpath first started popping up in the late 1970s, they have figured out how to draw a profit from jails. They get involved when a jurisdiction issues a request for proposals (RFP), a standard government process for inviting contractors to bid on anything from construction projects to garbage pickup. Now more than half of Wellpath’s business comes from jails. Jails are an attractive sector, according to Moody’s Investor Service, because they involve higher margins compared with prisons.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the main services these companies provide is not medical care at all, but legal protection. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1976 that “deliberate indifference to serious medical needs of prisoners” was a violation of their constitutional right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment. Private firms thus helpfully offer to take the legal risk off localities’ shoulders, offering, in one company’s words, “safe and defensible care” (though, as Forsyth and others have learned, the legal risk is not gone).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/06/illinois-prisons-health-care/530400/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: Does bad health care constitute cruel and unusual punishment?\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCorrectional care is good business, especially as more counties have moved to privatize. In 1996, the industry’s largest company—which, after a merger in 2011, now goes by the name Corizon—was bringing in about $200 million in revenue, according to \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/26/nyregion/prisons-cut-costs-by-managed-care.html\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe\u003c/em\u003e \u003cem\u003eNew York Times\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. Wellpath’s new owner, in a press release, said the combined company is expected to bring in about $1.5 billion annually. Corizon’s revenue was pegged at about $1 billion in 2017, after several years of decline, according to estimates by PrivCo, a research firm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere is no systematic federal database of how jails provide health care—whether publicly, through a contract with a local hospital network, or with a for-profit correctional health-care company such as Wellpath. The National Commission on Correctional Health Care, an accrediting body for jails and prisons, told \u003ca href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/03/04/the-jail-health-care-crisis\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe\u003c/em\u003e \u003cem\u003eNew Yorker\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e that about 70 percent of the jails it inspects contract for medical care. To get a sense of how much of the market Wellpath and its competitors control, I sent a list of questions to the nation’s 50 largest sheriff’s offices. Forty-six responded with answers. Together, they care for about 132,000 inmates on a given day. Wellpath’s name stood out as by far the most common provider, contracting with 17 of the 27 offices that use a correctional health-care company for the bulk of their care. Several other companies came up once or twice each: Corizon, Armor, NaphCare, and Centurion Managed Care. A few others worked with regional firms. (One office refused to answer my questions about inmate health care without a Freedom of Information request; a Wellpath employee subsequently denied it on the grounds that the appropriate department had no relevant records.) The largest jails, such as Cook County’s in Chicago, tended to provide care in partnership with a local hospital system or the county’s health department.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eAtlantic \u003c/em\u003eresearchers and I contacted every sheriff’s office in North Carolina—100 in all. The companies that formed Wellpath had both held contracts in the state, and I wanted to get a sense of the combined company’s market share now. Thirty-seven offices spoke to us. Almost all contracted for their inmates’ care. A firm called Southern Health Partners held more contracts than Wellpath, though Wellpath works with many of the state’s most populous counties. A few local providers also cropped up. The industry’s consolidation is “scary,” said Major Shon Crisp, a jail administrator in Cherokee County, which used to work with a regional contractor before it was folded into Wellpath. He said he was unsure what he would do without his current contractor, Southern Health Partners.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMany states in the U.S. are without jail-inspection programs, and there is no national agency charged with systematically ensuring the quality of health care. The U.S. Department of Justice has the power to investigate possible civil-rights violations of the nation’s inmates, but it’s very rarely exercised. In the past two fiscal years, the department’s Civil Rights Division has opened only two investigations in the nation’s several thousand jails and prisons related to health care. One alleged that a jail in Virginia, which contracts with Wellpath, was providing constitutionally deficient medical and mental health care. (Hallman wrote that the company was in compliance in “all areas” as of January 2019.) The other is ongoing. Because there are no mandatory national standards, jail administrators can decide what care they think is good enough to meet the Supreme Court’s standards, said Carolyn Sufrin, an ob-gyn at Johns Hopkins University and the author of \u003cem\u003eJailcare\u003c/em\u003e, a book based on her research and experience as a physician in a San Francisco county jail. “The only de facto oversight system we have is litigation,” she said. All told, for many inmates, the only means of recourse—after filing a grievance slip—is to sue.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWellpath likely knows more about jail health care—and the changes prompted by its business model—than any government agency in the country. Yet it considers basic information, including health-care policies, training protocols, and its client list, to be trade secrets. In a proposal sent to one county several months before Wellpath was unveiled, Correct Care Solutions asserted that its litigation history was a trade secret. The cases filed against it are a matter of public record, but “without exhaustive efforts,” the company pointed out, “it would be nearly impossible” to compile a complete list. To find out where it has been sued in state court, you would have to call every county clerk in the nation—more than 3,200 in all.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn considering Wellpath’s history, decision makers tend to look at federal lawsuits, which can be accessed online. There, information of a certain kind is plentiful. Wellpath’s predecessor, Correct Care Solutions, had been sued at least 1,395 times in federal courts over the past decade, according to a document published by the Project for Government Oversight. Some of the lawsuits are surely frivolous. “We are being sued right now by somebody who says that when they came to jail, they had a million dollars in a box, and that box is missing,” Dudley Watts, Forsyth County’s longtime manager, told me. But José Saldana, the director of Release Aging People in Prison, pointed out that it costs money to file a civil-rights claim. In New York, where Saldana was incarcerated for 38 years, the price tag for prisoners to assert their right to adequate care is at least $350. “I don’t know of anybody who got $350 to throw away in the cage,” he said. Regardless, local governments are apparently disregarding whatever worries the lawsuits might raise, because they keep signing contracts with Wellpath—with seven local governments in 2019 so far, according to Hallman. Likewise, it does not seem to matter that “substandard care” on the part of the company has allegedly led to preventable deaths, according to a recent report by \u003ca href=\"https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2019/06/us/jail-health-care-ccs-invs/\"\u003eCNN\u003c/a\u003e. Wellpath “fundamentally disagree[s] with most of the assertions” in CNN’s reporting, Hallman wrote, disputing that there was any pattern of poor care. “While in the majority of these incidents, we believe our clinicians provided appropriate care, in some of them our clinicians used poor judgment or made mistakes, as all humans do,” he wrote.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn June, three days after the CNN report was published, the Westchester County, New York, Board of Legislators sat down to discuss a renewal of its contract with Wellpath. The board met just a day after a settlement was brokered with the family of Rashad McNulty, 36, who died of a heart attack in the county jail in 2013, after a Correct Care Solutions nurse accused him of faking his symptoms. In 2018, the county put out an RFP for the health-care contract at the Westchester County Jail, located about an hour’s drive from Midtown Manhattan. As \u003ca href=\"https://www.lohud.com/story/news/local/westchester/2019/04/12/westchester-county-jail-health-care-correct-care-correct-care-solutions-wellpath-tennessee-mcnulty/3237201002/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Journal News\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e first reported, only Wellpath and a subsidiary of NaphCare, a firm based in Birmingham, Alabama, responded. At a hearing, Damon Maher, a county legislator, vigorously questioned the county’s head jailer about the CNN report and other news stories. (“I’m sorry if I get a little emotional about people dying in their puke and in their piss!” Maher huffed when chastised for speaking out of turn.) Joseph Spano, the county’s correction commissioner, acknowledged that the media reports were disturbing—but suggested the jail would do no better with its one alternative to Wellpath. “You go and Google NaphCare, and you are going to see similar and alike stories,” Spano said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWestchester opted to renew its contract with Wellpath. “While we certainly do consider things like litigation histories and other national stories of interest, our main focus is our patients, [and] we know that we’re getting a good level of care,” Justin Pruyne, the deputy commissioner of correction, told me. But Maher told me he still has questions: What were the jail’s statistics on suicides and attempted suicides before and after Wellpath? What were the mortality rates? And what’s being done differently since “the McNulty disaster”?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eII.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt one point before it was rebranded as Wellpath, Correct Care Solutions put a human-resources employee in charge of supervising a nurse educator. By way of explanation for someone with no medical training taking on such a charge, she said in a deposition: “We were a small company that grew really fast.” That growth took off in 2010, when two private-equity firms invested in the company, and it proceeded to buy up several competitors. In 2018, H.I.G. Capital stepped in, buying Correct Care Solutions and combining it with another jail-health-care company in its portfolio. The fund in which H.I.G. holds Wellpath is expected to reap “attractive” returns for its investors, according to a heavily redacted pitch book I acquired through a public-records request. The possible scale of those returns, however, is unclear. Several pages discussing the firm’s “investment performance” are covered by large black boxes. But generally, the goal for firms such as H.I.G. is to double or triple their money from the time of the initial investment to when an asset is sold. The company’s strategy for building value for its investors, Hallman said, is not to reduce spending at individual facilities, but rather to do good-quality work and keep signing new contracts. In his written responses, Hallman added that the company expects to grow with “very limited reliance” on future acquisitions, but didn’t rule them out. H.I.G. did not respond to multiple requests for comment over several weeks. Hallman pointed out that while members of H.I.G. serve on the parent entity’s board of managers, responsibility for the day-to-day operations is held by the Wellpath management team.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“I think [H.I.G.’s] entire strategy is probably to build a monopoly,” said Bianca Tylek, the executive director of Worth Rises, a nonprofit that advocates against the privatization of corrections. She also pointed out that the entire correctional health-care market has been consolidating for about 10 years. Not all insiders agree—a Moody’s report on Wellpath called the industry “very fragmented”—but none were keen to talk about the industry. More than a dozen financial analysts and investment bankers either did not return my calls or, like Moody’s, agreed to be interviewed and later declined. What matters, though, is that Wellpath is poised to continue growing its market share when some jails are already hurting for choice. “Consolidation begets further consolidation,” said Sally Hubbard, the director of enforcement strategy at the Open Markets Institute. “Private equity is known for rolling up entire industries. Their strategy is to make industries and companies ruthlessly efficient and to extract more revenue from the business than there was before they acquired it … And that’s not really ideal when you’re talking about health care.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"u-block-center\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" height=\"788\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/09/Atlantic_prison_health_03_1/95a8c35b7.jpg\" width=\"630\"\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"credit\"\u003e(Alvaro Dominguez)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e)“At a personal level,” Hallman told me, “we don’t want people to be incarcerated.” But as long as imprisonment is a fact of American life, inmates will need care. One shouldn’t read too much into the disclosure by a public correctional company that reduced incarceration counts as a business risk, he said. “Personally and for our team, I don’t think any of us worry about that.”\u003cb\u003e \u003c/b\u003eWellpath’s purpose, he told me, is to serve marginalized patients. Despite the mission, some of his clients don’t like that the company makes money off it, I pointed out. Hallman said he wouldn’t challenge their moral views, but stands for something else: “I think we do this work better than most counties who do it themselves.” As a private firm, Wellpath has no obligation to share with the public how much money it makes, and Hallman wouldn’t give me details on what he or the company’s CEO earns. But if clients asked, would he share the profit margins with them? “Typically not,” Hallman told me. Some do request detailed cost information, which would give a sense of the company’s takeaway, and “it’s never embarrassing,” he said. “We’re not Google; we’re not making crazy amounts of money. We make a little bit of money at every site.” In fact, the profit margin is less than what most people would expect, Hallman told me. When I pressed for details, Hallman turned the question around. “What would you expect somebody like us would earn?” he asked me. “Probably like 9, 10 percent,” I ventured. “Okay. Not far off,” he said. “Is that crazy?” I asked, trying to calibrate his response. “No, you’re not far off,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2007/09/private-equity-deconstructed/306154/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: Private equity deconstructed\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSome of Wellpath’s customers have noticed changes since private equity got involved, and not just in their contractor’s shifting name. Captain Sean Stewart, the corrections-bureau division commander with the Pima County Sheriff’s Department in Tucson, Arizona, told me that when his county worked with a firm called Conmed, there was a reliably personal touch. After the company was bought by Correct Care Solutions, that largely went away. “It feels to me like when they get bigger, it’s more about the money than the service. It seems like if I’m short five or six nurses, the larger the company, the less in a hurry they were to try and hire those nurses,” he told me. In a 2015 federal contract audit of the Reeves County Detention Center in Texas, where one of Wellpath’s predecessors was contracted, the DOJ found there may have been a “potential financial incentive” for the company to leave positions vacant—as it did in 34 months of a 37-month period—because it was paid more for the required positions than it was forced to pay back for each one it left unfilled. “We never intentionally understaff to improve our financial results,” wrote Hallman, pointing to market factors outside the company’s control.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Federal Trade Commission and the DOJ, in their role as federal regulators, have not prevented Wellpath’s consolidation of the marketplace. Wellpath’s “combination was reviewed by the DOJ and the FTC through the Hart-Scott-Rodino process, and these agencies allowed the transaction to be completed,” Hallman wrote, referring to the federal requirement that large mergers and acquisitions be flagged for review by regulators before closing. (The DOJ told me that the FTC handled the deal; the FTC declined to comment.) That choice may have more to do with the government’s limited resources than with the company’s behavior, however. Regulators have to pick their battles, said Cory Capps, a partner with Bates White Economic Consulting who is focused on health care and who previously worked with the DOJ’s antitrust division. Capps told me that a strong antitrust case often features head-to-head competition between the merging firms, a limited number of other competitors, and high barriers for entering the market—exactly the circumstances when H.I.G. acquired Correct Care Solutions to create Wellpath. By then, H.I.G. was already the owner of Correctional Medical Group Companies, a firm offering similar services—so similar, in fact, that I found seven states in which the two firms directly competed for contracts before the acquisition. In at least two RFPs, the companies were the \u003cem\u003eonly\u003c/em\u003e two firms to bid. In writing and in our interview, Hallman rejected any characterization of Wellpath as a monopoly, and said the companies’ combination had no major impact on the market.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWellpath’s corporate structure apparently tripped up its employees in one case. To one client, Wellpath’s accounts-receivable department wrote: “As you may be aware, Correct Care Solutions, LLC recently merged with Correctional Medical Group Companies, Inc. to create Wellpath LLC.” About a month later, the county received a strange follow-up. “Although the two companies share a common ultimate owner,” Omar Mossallati, Wellpath’s director of corporate counsel, wrote, “please be advised that Correct Care Solutions, LLC has not, at any time, merged with Correctional Medical Group Companies, Inc. to create Wellpath LLC.” Instead, he wrote, Correct Care Solutions opted to change its name to Wellpath, and Wellpath and Correctional Medical Group Companies operate separately. The term to use is \u003cem\u003ecombination\u003c/em\u003e, Hallman said; they are separate entities that share a management team. “We are one company,” he told me. “Or, how do I say this right—we don’t work for one company, but we work for one united purpose.” No formal merger is planned.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe legalistic message seems to contradict the company’s new branding. In a video on Wellpath’s website, Jorge Dominicis, the company’s CEO, formerly of Correct Care Solutions, sits with Hallman, who ran Correctional Medical Group Companies before the creation of Wellpath. Both are well dressed, but casual; in suit jackets, but with their top shirt button undone. It’s friendly, approachable. “Wellpath is a better organization than either the two organizations were on their own,” says Hallman. “Absolutely,” says Dominicis, nodding. “The resources of both of these organizations complement each other, make us stronger as one organization—more expertise, more opportunity to cross-utilize best practices—and I think people who work and do what we do are passionate. This is, as I’ve said before, missionary work,” Dominicis says.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIII.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eForsyth County’s 1,016-bed jail is a ruddy, block-long building that matches the color of the red clay earth where it sits, surrounded by the government offices, courthouses, and fuchsia-bloomed crape myrtles of downtown Winston-Salem. From the jail, walk a few blocks northeast, and you’ll arrive at the Wake Forest Innovation Quarter, a mixed-use research center built in the old R. J. Reynolds Tobacco complex. The quarter is bordered with a cocktail bar, luxury loft apartments, a High Line look-alike, and the Wake Forest School of Medicine, the teaching branch of Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center, which provides the jail’s off-site, emergency care.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAbout a month after her son, Stephen Patterson, died in the county jail, Miles attended the meeting in which the commissioners debated the single bid for the inmates’ health care. Miles wanted to know how hard the county had worked to scout a local provider. With Wake Forest training doctors just a few minutes’ walk from the jail, why wouldn’t it take the contract? Watts, the county manager, told me the county tried to persuade local providers such as Wake Forest to bid on it. “We are a medical community, and we ought to be able to figure out how not to have to go to a big, multistate national provider,” he said. But there were no takers. Wake Forest did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLike Miles, Fleming El-Amin, the other Forsyth County commissioner who voted no, wanted a local contractor. Not only was the company getting too big, he told me, but it’s easier to hold accountable someone who’s your neighbor. He dismissed the company’s altruistic arguments. “It was a sales pitch, you know. I said, ‘Y’all quit lying.’ It’s all profit motives, it’s not a goodwill mission, it’s not a community-development issue,” he told me. El-Amin said he didn’t know the county was contracting for inmate health care when he first took office in early 2017. He assumed the county did it. He set about researching Correct Care Solutions, starting with Google—many a local official’s best source on its bidders. “I was shocked they were such a large company,” he recalled. El-Amin felt the single response to the county’s RFP wasn’t accidental. “Something else is happening.

That said, many RFPs \u003cem\u003eare\u003c/em\u003e very competitive, especially because the opportunity to compete comes up only every few years. They often elicit four bidders. “Competition is alive and well,” the company wrote. “I can’t remember a single bid that I’ve been a part of where we were the only bidder,” Hallman later elaborated. Some lawyers I spoke with wondered whether this competition might be bad for the quality of inmates’ health care, as the selection criteria of RFPs tend to focus on price, not quality. Or as Saldana, the nonprofit director, put it, “When they do a bidding, they get the lowest bidder, so that company has to keep the costs down. Just the way capitalism works alone would tell me that this might not be a good idea for us.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMacomb County, Michigan, received one bid in response to its RFP in 2015. It was the year after David Stojcevski, jailed for failing to appear in court for a traffic infraction, died in the county jail. Over 17 days, Stojcevski, 32, lost close to 50 pounds during withdrawal from prescribed benzodiazepines and opiates under the care of Correct Care Solutions. And it was Correct Care Solutions that submitted the single bid, though four entities came to a pre-bid meeting and tour. Questioned by Detroit’s Local\u003ca href=\"https://www.clickondetroit.com/news/defenders/macomb-county-sheriff-responds-to-concerns-about-woman-forced-to-give-birth-in-jail-cell\"\u003e 4\u003c/a\u003e, Macomb County Sheriff Anthony Wickersham told a reporter: “We had one bid. This is the contract. This is the company. It’s within our budget.” Wickersham declined an interview request, but a staffer in the county’s purchasing department was willing to take a guess at why only one contractor followed through with a bid: “Maybe they saw they [Correct Care Solutions] were there, and got scared away. I don’t know.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIV.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWholesale prison privatization has become a national political issue. New York has divested nearly $10 million of state pension funds from Geo Group and CoreCivic, the country’s heavyweight private prison operators, and largely banned them from the state. Entities as disparate as the American Federation of Teachers and JPMorgan Chase have worked to lessen their financial involvement. But conversations have largely avoided the question of whether private companies should provide correctional \u003cem\u003eservices\u003c/em\u003e, whether health care, food, or telephone calls. Companies like Wellpath are privatizing huge swaths of jail operations, but they are doing so quietly. Wellpath presents itself as a “healthcare company caring for under-served patients,” and writes on its website that it’s not in the “business of incarceration.” But is a jail still a public institution if key decision makers are employees of a private-equity-backed company beholden to its investors?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSome counties are beginning to question the move to go private, only to find it’s not so easy to go back. In 2013, after struggling for years to retain health-care staff at the downtown jail and the Milwaukee County House of Correction in Franklin, Wisconsin, a judge forced the county to privatize the inmates’ care. But 2016 was a jolt. Terrill Thomas, 38, died of dehydration in the jail after correctional staff had shut off the water in his cell. The county completed an audit in 2018 and found that Armor, the medical contractor for both facilities, had been routinely understaffing the jail and the House of Correction. (An Armor spokesperson said the company “held a difference of opinion” about its staffing levels.) “This is a core function. This is not laundry service,” Theodore Lipscomb Sr., chairman of the county Board of Supervisors, said at a finance-and-audit committee meeting in late 2018, as the county’s contract with Armor was set to end. “This is health care for thousands of people who are in your custody. You must get that right,” he added. On the table was a resolution he’d put forward to affirm the desire of the county board to return to publicly delivered care. The board voted in favor a week later. Lipscomb wanted the county to switch back immediately, he explained to me, but was told it would take two years to build the capacity. There are a few big hurdles, including the up-front investment needed to build an in-house program (and pay a contractor at the same time). The county will also have to pay for expensive legal insurance and figure out how to hire staff amid a shortage of nurses in the state. In the meantime, the county has switched to Wellpath.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"u-block-center\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" height=\"1008\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/09/HX1A3177_Edit_2/dda09479a.jpg\" width=\"672\"\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"credit\"\u003eBobby F.

He wants to return to publicly run care, but has doubts the county will be able to afford it. “Health care today is not like health care 20 years ago,” he told me. One particularly difficult hurdle for the county, he explained, would be getting its hands on an electronic medical-records system. That cost alone would be millions of dollars. Wellpath and other correctional companies tend to build their own, unlike many of the nation’s hospitals and clinics. “These companies do take advantage of governments that don’t understand [medicine],” Wasserman told me. (Wellpath believes this concern is unwarranted, because people with health-care experience serve on the selection committees of local governments.) “It’s tough for them to get to break into the industry, but once they’re in the industry, they’re gonna fly—they’re gonna make money,” he added. Asked whether he trusts Wellpath, Wasserman replied, “I trust them as far as I can throw ’em, and I can’t throw that far.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMilwaukee County’s administration is currently developing a possible model for self-operation. But if it wants to go back to publicly delivered care by 2021, when its initial contract with Wellpath is up, the county needs to allot the money for the 2020 budget cycle. That’s due to be hammered out this fall. In the meantime, the county is monitoring Wellpath’s operations, contracting with an external consulting organization for added muscle—something it never did with Armor.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eV.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen I met Kimbrough, the Forsyth County sheriff, he was only a few days out from major shoulder surgery. His right hand was bandaged around the thumb, where his surgeon had cut into it. To greet me, he outstretched his left hand to grasp the fingers of my right. He was technically off the clock, but was still getting in a few hours of work, dressed in a crisp white shirt, a dotted pink tie with a clip, and silver cuff links.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKimbrough was elected to his post for the first time in December 2018, after Coley’s and Patterson’s deaths, and the single bid. On the campaign trail, he kept hearing there was something seriously wrong with the health care at the jail. And so, after his swearing-in, ousting Wellpath was at the top of his to-do list. “I was ready to fire them,” Kimbrough told me. “I came in like, ‘Either y’all gonna fix this, or I’m gonna find somebody else,’ not knowing there’s nobody else to find. I looked around and came to my senses and realized, \u003cem\u003eLet’s rethink this. This ain’t really as bad as they making it out to be\u003c/em\u003e,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen his efforts to work with the company’s regional representative stalled—“I grew up in the microwave era; I want it now,” Kimbrough said with a laugh—he took a new approach. He walked the half block from his office to the jail and asked a Wellpath employee for the telephone number for the company’s head office. To the person who picked up, he said, “I want to speak to the man that calls the shots.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn March, Dominicis, the company’s CEO, and two other representatives came to Winston-Salem for a meeting. Kimbrough sat them down with about a dozen members of his command staff. “We’re an unhappy customer,” he recalled telling them. He reeled off complaints: Positions were going unfilled, and staff members were making errors distributing medications. “We just was throwing rocks at him. I actually felt bad,” Kimbrough said. But Dominicis “walked out like a champion,” Kimbrough said, and gave him his cellphone number. Kimbrough said he’s since seen a big improvement with the staffing issues and their relationship with Wellpath overall.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlso helping was a public-health nurse the county had installed to monitor Wellpath’s compliance with its contract. Previously, the sheriff’s office checked only whether the company was billing the correct amount, Major Robert Slater, the detention-bureau commander, told me, spotting errors such as a mistaken payment for a federal inmate’s care or getting billed twice for an ER visit. Lindsay Novacek, the public-health nurse, who has a doctorate in nursing practice, now tracks 11 “key clinical indicators,” which were written into the contract in 2017. “She holds Wellpath to the fire,” the jail’s commander of operational services, Captain Charlene Warren, told me. (Novacek was more diplomatic.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFew jail administrators seek independent monitoring, Marc Stern, a former medical director of the Washington State prison system and a faculty member at the University of Washington’s School of Public Health, told me. “They forget the private company doesn’t have a fiduciary responsibility to the sheriff—they have a fiduciary responsibility to their shareholders,” Stern said. And few can hold their contractor liable for lapses. In \u003ca href=\"https://www.pewtrusts.org/-/media/assets/2018/01/sfh_jails_inadvertent_health_care_providers.pdf\"\u003ea study\u003c/a\u003e of 81 RFPs for jail health care, the Pew Charitable Trusts found that less than a third included any performance requirements or penalties for failing to meet them. Forsyth modeled its monitoring program on Shelby County in Tennessee, whose officials declined interview requests, but who also found themselves with Correct Care Solutions after receiving a single bid. Stewart, the Arizona jail captain and an instructor with the National Institute for Jail Operations, said he tells jail administrators that they can’t just shake hands with their contractor and expect the arrangement to work out. “No! You have to \u003cem\u003ework\u003c/em\u003e the contract and demand you’re getting what’s in the contract,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/06/americas-largest-mental-hospital-is-a-jail/395012/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: America’s largest mental hospital is a jail\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLieutenant Christopher Marshall was tasked with taking El-Amin and me on a tour of the jail on my visit in July. First, we went to the dedicated medical wing. Other than a sign reading \u003cspan class=\"smallcaps\"\u003eINMATE BATHROOM\u003c/span\u003e and the fact that the chairs in the waiting area were a flimsy beige plastic, with no metal legs, it looked like an ordinary clinic. Through a door were an administrative area behind glass, a small pharmacy, and several offices. In each office was one or two tiny vertical windows. Pinned-up signs chirped Wellpath’s slogan (\u003cspan class=\"smallcaps\"\u003eALWAYS DO THE RIGHT THING!\u003c/span\u003e) and warned against \u003cspan class=\"smallcaps\"\u003eLOOK-ALIKE AND SOUND-ALIKE MEDICATIONS.\u003c/span\u003e Another featured a bull’s-eye and read \u003cspan class=\"smallcaps\"\u003eIN CASE OF EMERGENCY, BANG HEAD HERE.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the pharmacy, medical technicians prepare medications for “med pass”—when a Wellpath employee takes medications from cell to cell on a cart. Novacek now tracks something to do with the “initiation of essential medication.” I don’t know exactly what she’s monitoring, because Wellpath considers its specific performance metrics proprietary, so the county couldn’t tell me.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn each housing floor is a sparse medical-exam room, which removes the need for patients to be marched to the medical unit in the south tower for routine appointments. It’s in the exam room that every inmate should be getting a health assessment within 14 days of booking, an indicator I do know Novacek tracks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur final stop was a housing unit for men. At the edge of the cells, Marshall turned to me. “You look at everyone, make sure they’re okay,” he said, and walked along the rows, taking a brief look inside each cell and pausing for a second or so. “We don’t ever come out,” someone called. “Sure am hungry,” said someone else. Waiting for lunch to be passed out, many men were sitting on the floor of their cell in front of the door’s meal slot.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOutside the jail, El-Amin and I stood for a moment on the steps. “Use your journalistic eye to evaluate what you’ve seen today,” he said, giving me a hard look.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe county’s initial three-year contract with Wellpath is up in August 2020. Kimbrough told me the county will be renewing. Considering how much the relationship has improved, it isn’t a difficult decision, he said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe thing is, most jails don’t have a Kimbrough. Many sheriffs don’t have the time, the interest, or the resources to compel a CEO to get on a plane when a contract goes bad. So what happens when jurisdictions need a strong, involved leader (and a compliance monitor) just to get what they paid for? It means Wellpath can take advantage of the reality that most counties won’t realize it if they’re being shorted. The counties take a reactionary position. They often find out something is wrong only after a critical system failure, which usually takes the form of a dead inmate and inquiring local reporters. But a lot can be seriously wrong before someone dies.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWellpath’s leaders don’t see the firm as powerful. “We don’t feel like we drive anything other than our own business,” Hallman said. They’re just a health-care company that fills a need. If the public officials who oversee that need aren’t happy, they need merely say so. “They have the ability to fire us tomorrow,” Hallman said. But what will tomorrow bring? Will Wellpath’s success draw out new rivals to offer alternatives? Then firing Wellpath could be easy enough. Or will it be more like Forsyth County’s recent past, in which an active and empowered local government found it couldn’t fire the company even if wanted to? Wellpath’s investors are betting that bigger means better. They’re betting that the country’s love affair with privatization won’t sour anytime soon. But if the hundreds of counties that have handed off their health services decide that privatization didn’t fulfill its promises, it’s going to be hard to wrest this care from corporate hands.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003csmall\u003e\u003cem\u003eMadeleine Carlisle, Olivia Paschal, and Karen Yuan contributed reporting.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/small\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/VjScqISXJSk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/VjScqISXJSk/","published":"2019-09-12T11:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-597871"},{"title":"Why Me?","content":"\u003cp\u003eThe day after my 18th birthday, I boarded a plane and left Oakland for Los Angeles, where I was to announce on national TV which university I planned to attend in the fall.

I waited backstage for my introduction.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Despite living in the inner city, our next guest has made his own path to success, earning a 5.0 GPA and scoring a 2100 on his SATs.

From Oakland, California, please welcome 18-year-old Tunde Ahmad,” Ellen DeGeneres proclaimed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI gave Ellen a hug as I settled into the guest chair and started talking about how I’d learned to dance. I then shared a few details about my life and the steps I’d taken so that I—a kid from 98th Avenue, in East Oakland—could reach this privileged moment. I did my best to give a vivid sense not only of my years of hard work, but also of Oakland, the city I loved so much. With my parents beaming in the audience, I announced to the world that I'd be spending the next four years as a Bulldog; I was going to Yale. As Ellen began to talk about how expensive college would be, a man appeared onstage with a giant cardboard check from Shutterfly and gave me $15,000 to help me pay for school.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThroughout my life, family, friends, and community members have rooted for me. But in this particular moment, my mind was focused on just one person: my older brother, Azeem, who was at FCI Herlong, a federal prison, where, the next day, when the \u003cem\u003eEllen\u003c/em\u003e episode aired, I thought that he and his friends there would be celebrating me, their “lil homie.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEllen and I discussed how my brother had been shot during my junior year in high school. We quickly returned to positive conversation, not mentioning that right then, as I sat there on that stage, he was incarcerated. It was as though his life was a footnote in mine. But that’s not the case at all: In the five years since, I’ve realized that the significance of our story lies in our diametric outcomes, understood together.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor my brother, the day that \u003cem\u003eEllen\u003c/em\u003e episode aired was no celebration.

I was listening to Ellen interview him but I was also taking in my current situation. All the blacks were fixated on the screen, happy for me and patting me on the back; other racial groups looked on with hatred because they realized that it was my little brother when a picture of the two of us appeared on the screen. It was probably the most bittersweet moment of my life. I’m locked down in a concrete refrigerator for human beings, being stored for years at a time in these khaki uniforms printed with shelving numbers.

I was originally unclear about how and why he’d been taken into custody, but the Department of Justice later clarified: In \u003ca href=\"http://www2.oaklandnet.com/oakca1/groups/police/documents/pressrelease/oak035114.pdf\"\u003ea joint press release with the Oakland Police Department\u003c/a\u003e, it published the results of Operation Gideon III, a four-month effort to “target and remove violent offenders and to dismantle criminal organization and robbery crews operating in Oakland.” Its aim was “aggressively combating violent crime perpetrated by career criminals.” The operation resulted in the arrest of 60 suspects. My brother was one of them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe operation was hailed as a success in the media; one headline read: “Operation Gideon III Nets 60 Arrests of the Worst Criminals.” According to the coverage, my brother was something of a career criminal. This made no sense. At the time, he was just 19 years old, had graduated high school, and was working six days a week, alternating between day shifts at the Enterprise car-rental office and night shifts at UPS. He was living at home and saving money to start his own business. He had no criminal record.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo what was he arrested for? Azeem and a friend fell for an “opportunity” to make some money, an offer by someone they later learned was an undercover agent. In Azeem’s telling, he and his friend weren’t sure of what the job would be, but they showed up to see whether it was something they’d be interested in. Once they arrived at the meeting and were asked to commit a robbery of a fictitious stash house, they got into Azeem's car to leave because, as he has always said, they didn’t want any part of it. They were arrested as they were leaving. Federal agents had been surveilling Azeem and his friends for months, via phone taps, hidden cameras, and undercover agents. All they needed to do was provide evidence that he’d ever had knowledge of other criminal acts, or had made verbal agreements to commit a crime himself, regardless of whether he’d followed through with it.\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eProsecutors claimed that he knew about the robbery in advance, though Azeem says he did not.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe was charged with multiple counts, including conspiracy to distribute cocaine, conspiracy to commit robbery affecting interstate commerce, and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug-trafficking crime. Ultimately, he pleaded guilty to the count of conspiracy to commit robbery, because like many individuals in our penal system, he feared the possibility of serving a long sentence if he lost his case at trial. He accepted a sentence of 41 months in exchange for this plea.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI was later informed that my phone had also been monitored because my brother and I were on the same phone plan. How easy would it have been for me to have said the wrong thing in a message, or to have been riding in the car with my brother when they arrested him, or to have had any other minor slip-up that could have landed me in juvenile hall or prison? America’s criminal-justice system catches kids like me on a daily basis.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBefore my brother pleaded guilty, my family bailed him out on a house bond. That means we put a lien on our house through the court and signed an agreement that if my brother fled and didn’t attend his mandatory court dates, the state could take our property. Though this never came to pass, the prospect demonstrates the criminal-justice system’s potential detrimental effects on entire families’ economic stability.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn a Sunday in January 2013, while still out on bail, my brother asked me if I wanted to attend a family friend’s birthday party with him. I’d seen the friend the day before and had already wished her a happy birthday, so I decided to stay home and write an essay for my Advanced Placement U.S. History class instead. Around 7:30 p.m., I received a call that my brother had been shot when someone opened fire onto the porch where he and his friends were sitting. Five were wounded. Luckily, there were no fatalities. We still to this day do not understand what prompted the shooting.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe next month, his bail was revoked after failed drug tests, among other violations of his pretrial release agreement. Azeem had been out on bail for almost 10 months without having any bail-revoking infractions, and he says that the drugs he tested positive for were prescribed to him by his doctor as pain relief for his gunshot wounds. He was sent back to prison.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor black boys growing up in urban environments, staying out of the penal system is no easy task—not because we’re inherently troublesome, but because we are targeted by policies and tactics, such as Operation Gideon, that are meant to send us away. One mistake, and your entire life can be altered forever.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe fact is, my brother and I are far more similar than we are different. We are four years apart, but we grew up under the same roof, with the same two parents. We attended the same Oakland public schools, and played baseball and basketball on the same teams. Our parents instilled the same values in us, taught us both about the history of the black diaspora, and gave us both African names to reclaim our heritage and culture.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe are similarly intelligent, both academically and socially. Given the chance, Azeem would also have done well at Yale. Upon meeting us today, a stranger would have difficulty telling who had the Ivy League degrees (I later went to Columbia for graduate school) and who was formerly incarcerated.

The Greatest Generation—born in the early 20th century—first won the White House in 1960, when John F. Kennedy was 43. Baby Boomers—born after World War II—took over in 1992, when Bill Clinton was 46. By this precedent, Generation X was ripe for a president in 2016. Three of the early Republican front-runners—Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, and Scott Walker—would have entered the Oval Office in their 40s. But each faltered, and America replaced Barack Obama, a young Boomer, with Donald Trump, an older Boomer. Rather than choose a generational successor, America elected a candidate 15 years older than the president he replaced, the largest such jump in American history.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow Gen Xers have another shot. Many of the 2020 presidential contenders who sparked early enthusiasm—Cory Booker, Beto O’Rourke, Julián Castro, and Kamala Harris—were born between the mid-1960s and 1980, the span that defines Generation X. (Harris, born in 1964, is on its cusp.) But as of midsummer, with the exception of Harris, they were all below 5 percent in national polls. The result is a top tier of candidates that, in addition to Harris, includes three who are roughly Trump’s age—Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, and Elizabeth Warren—and Pete Buttigieg, a Millennial.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf a Gen Xer doesn’t win in 2020, there will be another chance in 2024. But by that time the field may be crowded with Millennials—born from 1981 to 1996—whose ranks include Buttigieg, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and rising Republican stars such as Representatives Dan Crenshaw and Matt Gaetz. Sandwiched between two larger and more politically consequential generations—Boomers and Millennials—Generation X may never produce a president at all.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis electoral weakness isn’t coincidental. It reflects an ideological problem. Rubio, Cruz, Walker, Booker, O’Rourke, Castro, and Harris all entered adulthood between the Reagan and Clinton eras, and launched their political careers around the turn of the millennium. That means they likely began forming their political beliefs at a time when the Republican Party had a strong pro-immigration wing and leading Democrats embraced free trade, tough anti-crime policies, and charter schools. Then, as they came closer to running for president, an ideological earthquake hit.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSince 2016, the Democratic Party has lurched left. Nativists have taken over the GOP. Among activists in both parties, views that were once mainstream are now widely reviled. Gen X politicians have responded by either downplaying or repudiating their prior positions. That’s unfortunate, because not everything that leading Republicans and Democrats believed before the parties reinvented themselves has been proved wrong. Gen X politicians could help check the hubris of the present—if only they would now defend what they once believed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"dropcap\"\u003eA\u003cspan class=\"smallcaps\"\u003eccording to \u003c/span\u003esocial\u003cspan class=\"smallcaps\"\u003e \u003c/span\u003escientists, events that occur while people are entering adulthood have a disproportionate influence on their political views. That doesn’t mean everyone who comes of age around the same time interprets those events in the same way. Rather, particular eras create particular intragenerational arguments. Think about the way Baby Boomers have spent their political careers debating the legacy of the Vietnam War.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe fight that has defined Generation X is between conservatives who came of age idolizing Ronald Reagan and liberals who came of age embracing Bill Clinton’s response to him. As ideological children of Reagan, who granted legal status to nearly 3 million undocumented immigrants, Cruz, Walker, and Rubio expressed sympathy for immigration before the 2016 election season. Cruz argued for doubling the cap on the number of immigrants America could admit every year; Walker supported a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants; and Rubio helped write a 2013 Senate bill to create a path to citizenship.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen, in 2015, Donald Trump—who, as a political neophyte, was largely unconstrained by \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/02/what-the-new-gop-crack-down-on-legal-immigration-reveals/553631/?utm_source=feed\"\u003etraditional Republican views on immigration\u003c/a\u003e—jumped to the top of the polls in the Republican presidential race by denigrating Mexican immigrants and demanding a wall to keep undocumented immigrants out. Finding themselves on the wrong side of a tectonic shift in the GOP, his Gen X competitors jettisoned their earlier views. Asked in a 2015 debate why \u003ca href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/transcript-of-the-2015-gop-debate-9-pm/\"\u003ehe no longer supported a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants\u003c/a\u003e—a position, the moderator noted, that he had held “from 2002 until as recently as 2013”—Walker responded that he had “listened to the American people.” Rubio said that although he had helped draft the 2013 Senate bill that provided a path to citizenship, he hadn’t expected it to become law. Cruz claimed that an amendment he’d supported to dramatically increase the number of H-1B visas for foreign workers had been a ploy to sabotage the passage of any immigration bill at all.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/02/why-immigration-divides/552125/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: How immigration became so controversial\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe insincerity was obvious, and it didn’t work.

That’s unfortunate. \u003ca href=\"https://www.nap.edu/read/23550/chapter/1\"\u003eComprehensive research suggests\u003c/a\u003e that while immigration imposes some fiscal costs, and disadvantages some Americans, it benefits the American economy as a whole.

Consider Beto O’Rourke’s and Julián Castro’s shifting stances on trade. By the time each ran for city council in their Texas hometowns of El Paso and San Antonio in the 2000s, they had witnessed the effects of the North American Free Trade Agreement, \u003ca href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/12/08/clinton-signs-nafta-into-law-dec-8-1993-1040789\"\u003ewhich Clinton had signed into law in 1993\u003c/a\u003e. Initially, El Paso saw low-wage manufacturing jobs go south of the border, but over time, as Texas and Mexico grew more economically intertwined, fortunes rebounded. A \u003ca href=\"https://www.dallasfed.org/~/media/documents/research/swe/2016/swe1604g.pdf\"\u003e2016 study by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas\u003c/a\u003e found that since NAFTA had gone into effect, average income levels in El Paso and other Texas border cities had come closer to those in the nation as a whole. And according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate in San Antonio, which averaged more than 6 percent in the three years prior to NAFTA taking effect (the Bureau’s data starts in 1990), has averaged about 5 percent in the 25 years since.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGiven the data, it’s not surprising that both O’Rourke and Castro hailed free trade before running for president. “Since the signing of NAFTA,” Castro declared in 2012, “San Antonio has blossomed into a major center of trade.” O’Rourke in 2015 voted to give Obama the authority to negotiate the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which, he said, offered the “chance for El Paso to capitalize on its growing status as a leading trade community.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/10/the-bipartisan-hesitation-on-trade/505556/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eas the Democratic Party has moved left\u003c/a\u003e, O’Rourke’s and Castro’s support for free trade has left them ideologically marooned. Castro now calls for renegotiating NAFTA, and has said he sympathizes with people who feel that many trade deals were “entered into with the concern of the big corporations first instead of the American worker.” O’Rourke wants to renegotiate it too, though not markedly, despite most studies showing that NAFTA has had a modestly positive overall impact on the American economy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/10/donald-trump-nafta-clinton/504914/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: Trump’s exaggeration of NAFTA’s lousiness\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKamala Harris’s retreat has been on truancy. In 2006, as San Francisco’s district attorney, she launched \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20101229161318/http://sfdistrictattorney.org/pdfs/SFDA.truancybrochure.pdf\"\u003ean initiative to reduce\u003c/a\u003e the number of students who chronically missed school without a valid excuse, a problem that, in the words of one 2005 study, had “reached epidemic proportions in urban academic settings.” The initiative was classically Clintonian, an effort to pair the two principles in which he grounded many of his policies: opportunity and responsibility. To help parents keep their kids in school, Harris created a hotline through which they could get referrals to services. Her office advertised the hotline on city buses that passed through neighborhoods where truancy rates were high. But she also sent a letter to parents warning them that truancy was against the law. Before prosecution, parents of truant children went through a lengthy, noncriminal process with school officials. But when that didn’t work, Harris’s office could bring them to court.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt the time, Harris’s tough-on-truancy policy fit the Democratic mood. Thirteen years later, it’s become a political liability. Numerous left-leaning commentators have slammed it as part of the criminalization of poverty that in recent decades has incarcerated vast numbers of young men of color. Progressives are right that the tough-on-crime policies of the Clinton era had devastating effects, and that Harris wrongly defended some of them. But her anti-truancy initiative—which she launched after studying data on the \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20101128001153/http://sfdistrictattorney.org/pdfs/SFDA.Truancy.White.Paper.FINAL.pdf\"\u003ecorrelation between truancy during childhood and crime later on\u003c/a\u003e—was designed to keep people \u003ci\u003eout of\u003c/i\u003e jail. And the effort appears to have kept kids in school: Between the 2007–08 and 2010–11 school years, the percentage of students in San Francisco public schools deemed chronically truant \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20190201181553/https:/www.dcyf.org/modules/showdocument.aspx?documentid=1145\"\u003efell from 4 to 2.5 percent\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/01/kamala-harris-truths-we-hold-review/579430/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: Kamala Harris’s political memoir is an uneasy fit for the digital era\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eProgressive critics might argue that Harris could have achieved those results without threatening parents with fines or jail. But she didn’t lock up any parents of truants; very few even paid a fine. In most instances, judges dismissed cases on the condition that the parents took actions to get their kid to school. Why did it take a court summons to get some families the help they needed? It’s called the “black-robe effect.” For some people, a judge’s demand carries more weight than a school administrator’s plea, even when they’re urging the same thing. In the hardest cases, giving people an opportunity to get help isn’t enough—demanding that they exercise responsibility is necessary too.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNonetheless, Harris has backpedaled. Although she declared in her 2009 book, \u003cem\u003eSmart on Crime\u003c/em\u003e, that “\u003ca href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=lTdcxnRTMUIC\u0026amp;q=fighting+truancy+might+well+be+the+single+most#v=snippet\u0026amp;q=fighting%20truancy%20might%20well%20be%20the%20single%20most\u0026amp;f=false\"\u003efighting truancy might very well be the single most important thing we can do to impact the future of crime\u003c/a\u003e,” the issue is absent from the criminal-justice section of her campaign website. This spring, she said she regrets the way other California prosecutors implemented a 2011 statewide anti-truancy law that she’d pushed. In the current ideological climate, Democrats won’t even defend Clintonian policies that they know have worked.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSomething similar has happened to Cory Booker on education. Booker, like Bill Clinton, once advocated for charter schools, which operate without many of the regulations that govern traditional public schools. After becoming mayor of Newark, New Jersey, Booker, according to \u003ci\u003eThe New Yorker\u003c/i\u003e, set out to make the city “the charter school capital of the nation.” Aided by an infusion of money from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and others, he made progress toward achieving that goal. From the 2009–10 to 2017–18 school years, the share of Newark students attending charter schools rose from 12 to 33 percent.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/07/the-verdict-on-charter-schools/397820/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: The verdict on charter schools?\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe data have been impressive. While achievement growth in math ended up flat, English gains in Newark schools have significantly improved since Booker launched his reforms, according to \u003ca href=\"https://cepr.harvard.edu/files/cepr/files/newark_ed_reform_report_synopsis.pdf\"\u003ea study by the Center for Education Policy Research at Harvard\u003c/a\u003e. (Although funded by what is now the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, the study—conducted by researchers at Harvard and Dartmouth—was peer-reviewed.) The study found that the movement of students from traditional public schools to higher-quality charters helped drive this progress. According to data from the Newark Board of Education, graduation rates have improved too. That finding is consistent with \u003ca href=\"http://urbancharters.stanford.edu/download/Urban%20Charter%20School%20Study%20Report%20on%2041%20Regions.pdf\"\u003ea 2015 study by the Center for Research on Education Outcomes\u003c/a\u003e at Stanford showing that students in urban charter schools perform substantially better than students in other urban public schools.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNonetheless, as Bernie Sanders’s socialist message has gained influence, the mood inside the Democratic Party has turned against charter schools. Sanders has proposed a halt to government funding of new charter schools. Even a relative moderate, Pete Buttigieg, has called for slowing their expansion, \u003ca href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/unchartered-territory-2020-democrats-back-away-charter-schools-n1014706\"\u003eaccording to NBC News\u003c/a\u003e. And Booker has dramatically muted his support for them; the education section of his campaign website makes no mention of charter schools. When Los Angeles teachers went on strike earlier this year, in part to protest the expansion of charter schools, \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/SenBooker/status/1085569347727343617\"\u003eBooker publicly supported them\u003c/a\u003e (though he didn’t link his support with their views on charter schools).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/12/school-choice-application-process/579043/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: When school choice means school’s choice\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"dropcap\"\u003eI\u003cspan class=\"smallcaps\"\u003et is laudable \u003c/span\u003ewhen politicians admit they were wrong to champion policies that have failed.

But new generations tend to overcompensate for the failures of their predecessors. In the 1960s, John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson were so eager to distinguish themselves from the isolationists of the 1930s that they forgot that an earlier generation’s skepticism of war—born from the disillusionment of World War I—had lessons to teach despite the necessity of World War II. Heeding those lessons might have kept America from losing 58,000 soldiers in Vietnam.\u003c/p\u003e\u003caside class=\"callout-placeholder\" data-source=\"curated\"\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter the economic woes of the Jimmy Carter years, Clinton-era New Democrats were so determined to prove that the party was not antibusiness that they deregulated Wall Street in ways that contributed to the 2008 financial crash. In the 1990s, many New Democrats also dismissed labor unions because of their belief in the free market. Today the pendulum has swung again, and Democrats eager for labor’s embrace are joining with teachers’ unions to oppose a charter-school movement that enjoys overwhelming support from African American and Latino Democrats.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs the in-between generation—old enough to have witnessed the Clinton era as adults but young enough to learn from its failures—Gen X Democrats could warn against the hubris of the present, as Ted Kennedy warned against Clinton’s endorsement of welfare reform in the 1990s and older foreign-policy thinkers like Reinhold Niebuhr and Walter Lippmann warned against Johnson’s escalations in Vietnam.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat matters most isn’t whether Gen X produces a president.

Their patients can\u0026rsquo;t speak or tell them what\u0026rsquo;s wrong, much like babies can\u0026rsquo;t communicate with their doctors. But unlike pediatricians, veterinarians frequently find themselves having to euthanize a patient with a treatable injury or illness because its caretaker can\u0026rsquo;t afford the remedy, which might include costly surgeries. \u0026ldquo;You can say you\u0026rsquo;re going to be stoic and put it out of your mind and say it\u0026#8217;s part of being a veterinarian,\u0026rdquo; says McCauley, an animal lover who has a dog and a cat in addition to his pig, \u0026ldquo;but the reality is over time, that weighs on you.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=\"pullquote\"\u003e\u0026#8220;It\u0026#8217;s not all puppies and kittens and wonderful experiences.

She quit the field most recently in 2013 and returned in 2015. \u0026ldquo;We go through veterinary school with the idea that we\u0026rsquo;re going to save lives,\u0026rdquo; McArthur says. \u0026ldquo;To have to turn around and push a plunger is difficult.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother soul-crushing aspect of the job that most other health professionals don\u0026rsquo;t have to deal with, veterinarians say, is constantly being asked to perform services or give out medications for free and then being cyberbullied or harassed if they don\u0026rsquo;t. In 2018, Americans spent more than $72 billion on their pets, and more than $18 billion was for vet care, according to the American Pet Products Association (APPA), a trade group. While some pet insurance plans may ease sudden expenses, only a small portion of pet owners opt to buy it. Pets live in nearly 85 million homes in the U.S., but only 2 million pets were insured in 2018, industry figures show. McCauley says he\u0026rsquo;d be asked to waive vet fees at least once a day. \u0026ldquo;When you\u0026rsquo;re not able to offer those free services and medications, you turn into the bad guy. They go online and they make you into the devil because you didn\u0026rsquo;t treat their cat for free,\u0026rdquo; he says. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s a horrible position that veterinarians are put in.\u0026rdquo; A 2014 \u003ca href=\"https://www.avma.org/News/JAVMANews/Pages/150915o.aspx\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003esurvey\u003c/a\u003e by the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) found one in five veterinarians were either cyberbullied by pet owners, who would write nasty reviews online or threaten their business, or knew a colleague who had been. \u0026ldquo;We have this tremendous fear that the mob is going to come after us online,\u0026rdquo; McArthur says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are also financial struggles, particularly for young people entering the field. Veterinary students in the U.S. graduated in 2018 with an average of $150,000 in debt, according to the AVMA. Yet data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows the median annual wage for veterinarians in 2018 was $93,830, and starting salaries are significantly much lower. When Dr. Molly McAllister, 43, of Portland, Oregon, first entered the field in 2004, she took a veterinarian job for $22,000 a year with $90,000 in debt from just veterinary school. \u0026ldquo;I was really well-educated on how to take care of animals. I was not well-educated on how to take care of myself,\u0026rdquo; she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile there is never a single cause of suicide, the myriad of risk factors can add up.

The data suggests nearly one in 10 U.S. veterinarians might suffer from serious psychological distress, yet only half are seeking help, says Dr. Jen Brandt, the AVMA\u0026rsquo;s director of wellbeing and diversity initiatives. Now, industry leaders are trying to change that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn Thursday, during National Suicide Prevention Week, Banfield Pet Hospital, one of the nation\u0026rsquo;s largest employers of veterinary professionals, announced a new training and awareness program for its more than 17,000 workers as well as a plan to close more than 1,000 of its clinics nationwide for a two-hour workshop to discuss mental health by early next year. As part of the training, Banfield is launching a 30-minute online course that teaches employees how to recognize warning signs of suicide among colleagues and the best ways to help them. The training course, which begins with a self assessment, will be available free online for anyone in the veterinary industry by Jan. 6, 2020.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa Stewart-Brown, a clinical social worker who developed the training, says she hopes the widespread discussions will help break the stigma associated with talking about mental health and offer at least one solution to a complex and multifaceted problem. \u0026ldquo;If we can teach people what it looks like when someone is in emotional distress, and we can teach them how to break through and connect with that person emotionally and compassionately and lead them to professional help, I know we will help,\u0026rdquo; she says. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s not all puppies and kittens and wonderful experiences.

The AVMA also offers a similar free one-hour online training course that helps veterinarians identify and refer at-risk colleagues. Tens of thousands of veterinarians have also found solace in Facebook support groups.

We have more than 5,000 stocks and 3,400 bond issuers in our portfolio, and the fund is designed to operate with a 100-year, multi\u0026shy;generational time frame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnlike investors with a shorter time horizon, we consider climate change to be a systemic risk affecting the entire range of our investments, one that can\u0026rsquo;t be eliminated simply through diversification.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe could certainly reduce the carbon footprint of our portfolio dramatically if we divested from certain carbon-intensive industries, but this would only result in a transfer of ownership to investors who are not as concerned about climate issues and thus would do little to contribute to a less carbon-intensive world. Our approach, rather, is to encourage companies with a large carbon footprint to adopt a more sustainable business model. I believe long-term investors have a duty to support corporate leadership that is embarking on a low-carbon transition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA better way for us to deal with climate change is to integrate environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues throughout our whole investment process. We require all our asset managers to include these criteria in their investment analysis and decisions. Our equity portfolio managers are also obligated to engage with the companies they invest in on critical environmental issues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition, over the past two years, Japan\u0026rsquo;s pension fund has been aggressively investing\u0026mdash;a total of around $32.8 billion as of the end of March 2019\u0026mdash;in funds that take into account ESG factors. Last year, we selected two climate-focused benchmark indices that incorporate two key elements: They seek out companies with high carbon efficiency within an industry. They also highly value companies that proactively disclose climate information. We don\u0026rsquo;t divest; we rebalance and engage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe recently began using ESG factors in making decisions for our bond portfolio as well. In partnership with the World Bank Group, we have worked to cultivate the green bond market. Encouragingly, we\u0026rsquo;ve seen signs that these bonds are becoming more mainstream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkeptics question the effect of ESG investment on financial performance, but we emphasize that climate change and other ESG-related risks materialize only over the long term. Assessing the financial validity of ESG investing over a span of only a few years is therefore misleading. Having said that, almost all our ESG indices have outperformed the market since inception.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince our ESG investment began in earnest in 2015, we are encouraged that our efforts have reverberated throughout the business community\u0026mdash;particularly in Japan, where many companies are making a dramatic push to improve their ESG profile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe GPIF of Japan will continue on this path, but we cannot do it alone. We call for deeper collaboration among shareholders, financiers and policy\u0026shy;makers everywhere.

If it can meet its vast potential for emission reduction, it will play an enormous role in tackling global climate change. The signs have been good. After suffering severe smog in 2011, the product of years of rising coal consumption, the Chinese government initiated a massive national action plan: halting the growth of coal consumption, improving air quality and helping the country limit emissions overall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, the economic slowdown and worsening trade war are risking a relapse. Some smog-stricken regions in China were found to have relaxed tight controls on polluting industries such as steel and cement in the second half of 2018, contributing to a rebound of smog last winter. The carbon market, the government\u0026rsquo;s primary climate-action plan, has been significantly downsized while coal consumption picked up again last year.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo what can China do now to stem emissions and remain a leader in the fight against climate change, while also maintaining socioeconomic development? Tap into the power of the market, from the bottom up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the world\u0026rsquo;s manufacturing hub, China is in a unique position to change the course of global emissions. In most industrial sectors, 75% of greenhouse-gas emissions are produced from the supply chains. In a globalized world, this means China\u0026rsquo;s emissions are generated to meet more than just its own rising demand. Research conducted by the Carbon Trust found that China is the world\u0026rsquo;s largest emitter in the apparel sector, but 72% of those emissions are essentially the responsibility of companies overseas where the products are exported and sold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eResponsibility for this division between manufacturing and products comes down to the private sector. In 2018, we at the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs (IPE) examined the climate actions of 118 IT and textile-industry brands sourcing from China to rank them by how green their supply-chain practices are. Apple and Nike tied for first place, and Chinese brands Lenovo and Huawei reached the top 30, but most brands did not take supply-chain carbon footprints into consideration. Barely any set supply-chain emission-reduction targets. Consequently, most of the top global brands may not be able to meet their climate commitments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThankfully, things are already changing. As China has expanded environmental transparency, some 70 multinational and local brands have applied the monitoring data compiled by IPE to motivate more than 8,000 suppliers to address regulatory violations. The country\u0026rsquo;s commitment to environmental transparency can incentivize companies to mitigate supply-chain emissions. Open carbon data not only enables businesses to set effective targets but also permits the public and investors to identify which are using best practices and which are racking up regulatory violations. To hold companies accountable, the state must also instigate high penalties for failing to disclose or falsifying this information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut those leading brands demonstrating responsible oversight of their supply chains show that the private sector can make significant contributions, even without those systems in place. As climate change worsens, government and businesses will need to work in tandem to break the global community out of its \u0026ldquo;business as usual\u0026rdquo; mind-set.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr /\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is one article in a series on the state of the planet\u0026rsquo;s response to climate change. \u003ca href=\"https://time.com/climate-change-solutions\" \u003eRead the rest of the stories\u003c/a\u003e and sign up for \u003ca href=\"https://cloud.newsletters.time.com/newsletters/?newsletter_name=climate\u0026amp;source=article-climate-footer\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eOne.Five, TIME\u0026#8217;s climate change newsletter.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/time/topstories/~4/h8CMM5XbiKg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/h8CMM5XbiKg/","published":"2019-09-12T11:16:25Z","guid":"http://time.com/?p=5669061"},{"title":"The Tech Innovations We Need to Happen if We’re Going to Survive Climate Change","content":"\u003caside class=\"right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad\" id=\"right-rail__ad-5669039\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module\" data-src=\"https://time.com/5669039/technology-fight-climate-change/\" data-widget-id=\"SB_2\" data-ob-template=\"timemag\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"inline-portrait_small_2x alignnone \"\u003e\u003cimg data-attachment-id=\"5675169\" data-permalink=\"https://time.com/5669039/technology-fight-climate-change/print-108/\" data-orig-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/blum.fc_.300.jpg?quality=85\" data-orig-size=\"2000,2554\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1568186644\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"Print\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Blum Illustration\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/blum.fc_.300.jpg?quality=85\u0026w=235\" data-large-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/blum.fc_.300.jpg?quality=85\u0026w=470\" src=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/blum.fc_.300.jpg?w=560\u0026#038;quality=85\u0026#038;h=715\" alt=\"\" height=\"715\"\u003e\n\u003cfigcaption class=\"image-caption\" \u003e\u003cspan class=\"credit\" \u003eHarry Campbell for TIME\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the 1970s, the U.S. Department of Energy poured money into making practical a miraculous technology: the ability to convert sunlight into electricity. Solar energy was a pipe dream, far too expensive and unreliable to be considered a practical power source. But yesterday\u0026rsquo;s moon shot is today\u0026rsquo;s reality. The expense of solar power has fallen more quickly than expected, with installations costing about 80% less today than a decade ago. Alternative energy (like wind and solar) is now often cheaper than conventional energy (like coal and gas). Last year, California generated 19% of its electricity from solar power, up from less than 1% just 10 years earlier. That growth is global. Solar-energy production worldwide has increased nearly 2,000% since 2009, but the U.S. is far from the leader. Of approximately 100 gigawatts of solar generation added in 2018, China accounted for 44 and the U.S. 11.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEliminating the carbon emitted in the production of electricity is a crucial step toward keeping the world from heating to dire levels.

Together, the two technologies have helped renewables leap from 9% of the U.S.\u0026rsquo;s electricity generation in 2008 to about 17% in 2018. Ongoing research and development is leading to continuous gains in how much power they produce. Wind operators are using artificial intelligence and improved weather forecasts to position their turbines for better performance, while solar-panel manufacturers are refining the use of new materials and processes to generate more electricity from smaller panels and drive down costs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"inline-portrait_small_2x alignnone \"\u003e\u003cimg data-attachment-id=\"5672633\" data-permalink=\"https://time.com/5669039/technology-fight-climate-change/federal-reserve-beige-book/\" data-orig-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/climate-change-technology-solar.jpg?quality=85\" data-orig-size=\"2400,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5.6\",\"credit\":\"Richard Vogel\",\"camera\":\"X-T3\",\"caption\":\"In this Aug. 8, 2019 photo a worker helps to install solar panels onto a roof at the Van Nuys Airport in the Van Nuys section of Los Angeles.

One solution is to improve the ability to move energy from where it\u0026rsquo;s produced to where it\u0026rsquo;s consumed by building new power lines, known as interconnectors, that can move energy across long distances between regional power grids. Another is to store excess energy for later use, using batteries. Lithium-ion cells\u0026mdash;used in mobile phones and electric cars\u0026mdash;are the best energy-storage technology we have right now, and their use both in homes and alongside power plants is expected to grow storage capacity tenfold by 2024. While the current storage technology works best for less than four hours, engineers are developing novel alternatives that can store energy for longer periods of time. A startup in Switzerland called Energy Vault uses surplus electricity gathered on windy days to stack large bricks into towers with automated cranes, then recaptures the kinetic energy generated when the bricks fall back to the ground. Other companies are storing electrical energy as heat in molten salt or pumping water into reservoirs for later use as hydropower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eNext-Generation Nuclear\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNuclear reactors have been providing zero-carbon power since the 1950s, and today supply 20% of the U.S.\u0026rsquo;s electricity and 11% of the globe\u0026rsquo;s. But safety and environmental concerns have increased the cost and complexity of nuclear power plants, and their construction has all but stopped in the U.S. (Only one new reactor has come online this century.) One strategy for reinvigorating the industry is to focus on smaller, simpler reactors that can be constructed in factories, produce less radioactive waste and require less day-to-day management. (Some will be designed to shut down automatically in case of disaster.) TerraPower, a Bellevue, Wash.\u0026ndash;based startup with backing from Bill Gates, is one of several companies aiming for commercial use in the next decade. Another, Terrestrial Energy, in Canada, is developing a design that uses molten salt to produce 195 megawatts per reactor, about one-fifth of conventional units.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut some scientists are looking even further into the future, with novel technologies. Commonwealth Fusion Systems, a startup in Cambridge, Mass., is working to use new superconducting materials to build a fusion power plant\u0026mdash;one that creates energy by combining atoms rather than dividing them, as in traditional nuclear. The project could take decades to fully commercialize but has the potential to revolutionize electricity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"inline-portrait_small_2x alignnone \"\u003e\u003cimg data-attachment-id=\"5672643\" data-permalink=\"https://time.com/5669039/technology-fight-climate-change/making-a-miniature-sun-on-earth/\" data-orig-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/climate-change-technology-fusion.jpg?quality=85\" data-orig-size=\"2400,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"Pallava Bagla\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark II\",\"caption\":\"SAINT-PAUL-LES-DURANCE, FRANCE -  AUGUST 7:  Workers make the Super Conducting magnets at an ITER facility which is part of a mega construction effort taking place in Southern France where countries are collaborating to create a miniature 'sun on earth' on August 7, 2019 in Saint-Paul-les-Durance, France.

The technology to do that, known as carbon capture and sequestration, involves removing carbon from the atmosphere and either physically storing it, often underground, or leveraging natural processes that capture and store it, as trees do. Engineers have been working on the challenge for decades, but costs remain high\u0026mdash;in part because there is no economic benefit to storing carbon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne way to change that would be to reuse the carbon as fuel, but that only delays its release; another would be a price on carbon itself. For engineers, it is a tantalizing area of research\u0026mdash;the ultimate moon shot\u0026mdash;because any breakthrough in capturing carbon, reusing carbon or storing it at a large scale would mitigate the potential catastrophe of allowing it to continue to heat the atmosphere. Life could not only go on\u0026shy;\u0026mdash;it could go on more or less as it has.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr /\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is one article in a series on the state of the planet\u0026rsquo;s response to climate change. \u003ca href=\"https://time.com/climate-change-solutions\" \u003eRead the rest of the stories\u003c/a\u003e and sign up for \u003ca href=\"https://cloud.newsletters.time.com/newsletters/?newsletter_name=climate\u0026amp;source=article-climate-footer\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eOne.Five, TIME\u0026#8217;s climate change newsletter.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/time/topstories/~4/39ZI7clJ2KM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/39ZI7clJ2KM/","published":"2019-09-12T11:15:44Z","guid":"http://time.com/?p=5669039"},{"title":"Hello From the Year 2050.

It\u0026rsquo;s 2050, and we have a moment to reflect\u0026mdash;the climate fight remains the consuming battle of our age, but its most intense phase may be in our rearview mirror. And so we can look back to see how we might have managed to dramatically change our society and economy. We had no other choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a point after 2020 when we began to collectively realize a few basic things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne, we weren\u0026rsquo;t getting out of this unscathed. Climate change, even in its early stages, had begun to hurt: watching a California city literally called Paradise turn into hell inside of two hours made it clear that all Americans were at risk. When you breathe wildfire smoke half the summer in your Silicon Valley fortress, or struggle to find insurance for your Florida beach house, doubt creeps in even for those who imagined they were immune.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo, there were actually some solutions. By 2020, renewable energy was the cheapest way to generate electricity around the planet\u0026mdash;in fact, the cheapest way there ever had been. The engineers had done their job, taking sun and wind from quirky backyard DIY projects to cutting-edge technology. Batteries had plummeted down the same cost curve as renewable energy, so the fact that the sun went down at night no longer mattered quite so much\u0026mdash;you could store its rays to use later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the third realization? People began to understand that the biggest reason we weren\u0026rsquo;t making full, fast use of these new technologies was the political power of the fossil-fuel industry. Investigative journalists had exposed its three-decade campaign of denial and disinformation, and attorneys general and plaintiffs\u0026rsquo; lawyers were beginning to pick them apart. And just in time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese trends first intersected powerfully on Election Day in 2020. The Halloween hurricane that crashed into the Gulf didn\u0026rsquo;t just take hundreds of lives and thousands of homes; it revealed a political seam that had begun to show up in polling data a year or two before. Of all the issues that made suburban Americans\u0026mdash;women especially\u0026mdash;\u0026shy;uneasy about President Trump, his stance on climate change was near the top. What had seemed a modest lead for the Democratic challenger widened during the last week of the campaign as damage reports from Louisiana and Mississippi rolled in; on election night it turned into a rout, and the analysts insisted that an under\u0026shy;appreciated \u0026ldquo;green vote\u0026rdquo; had played a vital part\u0026mdash;after all, actual green parties in Canada, the U.K. and much of continental Europe were also outperforming expectations. Young voters were turning out in record numbers: the Greta Generation, as punsters were calling them, made climate change their No. 1 issue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"inline-portrait_small_2x alignnone \"\u003e\u003cimg data-attachment-id=\"5673699\" data-permalink=\"https://time.com/5669022/climate-change-2050/climate-change-how-we-solved-climate-change-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/climate-change-how-we-solved-climate-change-1.jpg?quality=85\" data-orig-size=\"1787,2400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"climate-change-how-we-solved-climate-change-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/climate-change-how-we-solved-climate-change-1.jpg?quality=85\u0026w=223\" data-large-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/climate-change-how-we-solved-climate-change-1.jpg?quality=85\u0026w=447\" src=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/climate-change-how-we-solved-climate-change-1.jpg?w=560\u0026#038;quality=85\u0026#038;h=752\" alt=\"How We Solved Climate Change\" height=\"752\"\u003e\n\u003cfigcaption class=\"image-caption\" \u003e\u003cspan class=\"credit\" \u003eIllustration by David Doran (Background photo: Getty Images)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd when the new President took the oath of office, she didn\u0026rsquo;t disappoint. In her Inaugural Address, she pledged to immediately put America back in the Paris Agreement\u0026mdash;but then she added, \u0026ldquo;We know by now that Paris is nowhere near enough. Even if all the countries followed all the promises made in that accord, the temperature would still rise more than 3\u0026deg;C (5\u0026deg;F or 6\u0026deg;F). If we let the planet warm that much, we won\u0026rsquo;t be able to have civilizations like the ones we\u0026rsquo;re used to. So we\u0026rsquo;re going to make the changes we need to make, and we\u0026rsquo;re going to make them fast.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFast, of course, is a word that doesn\u0026rsquo;t really apply to Capitol Hill or most of the world\u0026rsquo;s other Congresses, Parliaments and Central Committees. It took constant demonstrations from ever larger groups like Extinction Rebellion, and led by young activists especially from the communities suffering the most, to ensure that politicians feared an angry electorate more than an angry carbon lobby. But America, which historically had poured more carbon into the atmosphere than any other nation, did cease blocking progress. With the filibuster removed, the Senate passed\u0026mdash;by the narrowest of margins\u0026mdash;one bill after another to end subsidies for coal and gas and oil companies, began to tax the carbon they produced, and acted on the basic principles of the Green New Deal: funding the rapid deployment of solar panels and wind turbines, guaranteeing federal jobs for anyone who wanted that work, and putting an end to drilling and mining on federal lands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince those public lands trailed only China, the U.S., India and Russia as a source of carbon, that was a big deal. Its biggest impact was on Wall Street, where investors began to treat fossil-fuel stocks with increasing disdain. When BlackRock, the biggest money manager in the world, cleaned its basic passive index fund of coal, oil and gas stocks, the companies were essentially rendered off-limits to normal investors. As protesters began cutting up their Chase bank cards, the biggest lender to the fossil-fuel industry suddenly decided green investments made more sense. Even the staid insurance industry began refusing to underwrite new oil and gas pipelines\u0026mdash;and shorn of its easy access to capital, the industry was also shorn of much of its political influence. Every quarter meant fewer voters who mined coal and more who installed solar panels, and that made political change even easier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs America\u0026rsquo;s new leaders began trying to mend fences with other nations, climate action proved to be a crucial way to rebuild diplomatic trust. China and India had their own reasons for wanting swift action\u0026mdash;mostly, the fact that smog-choked cities and ever deadlier heat waves were undermining the stability of the ruling regimes. When Beijing announced that its Belt and Road Initiative would run on renewable energy, not coal, the energy future of much of Asia changed overnight. When India started mandating electric cars and scooters for urban areas, the future of the internal-combustion engine was largely sealed. Teslas continued to attract upscale Americans, but the real numbers came from lower-priced electric cars pouring out of Asian factories. That was enough to finally convince even Detroit that a seismic shift was under way: when the first generation of Ford E-150 pickups debuted, with ads demonstrating their unmatched torque by showing them towing a million-pound locomotive, only the most unreconstructed motorheads were still insisting on the superiority of gas-powered rides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther easy technological gains came in our homes. After a century of keeping a tank of oil or gas in the basement for heating, people quickly discovered the appeal of air-source heat pumps, which turned the heat of the outdoors (even on those rare days when the temperature still dropped below zero) into comfortable indoor air. Gas burners gave way to induction cooktops. The last incandescent bulbs were in museums, and even most of the compact fluorescents had been long since replaced by LEDs. Electricity demand was up\u0026mdash;but when people plugged in their electric vehicles at night, the ever growing fleet increasingly acted like a vast battery, smoothing out the curves as the wind dropped or the sun clouded. Some people stopped eating meat, and lots and lots of people ate less of it\u0026mdash;a cultural transformation made easier by the fact that Impossible Burgers turned out to be at least as juicy as the pucks that fast-food chains had been slinging for years. The number of cows on the world\u0026rsquo;s farms started to drop, and with them the source of perhaps a fifth of emissions. More crucially, new diets reduced the pressure to cut down the remaining tropical rain forests to make way for grazing land.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn other words, the low-hanging fruit was quickly plucked, and the pluckers were well paid. Perhaps the fastest-growing business on the planet involved third-party firms that would retrofit a factory or an office with energy-efficient technology and simply take a cut of the savings on the monthly electric bill. Small businesses, and rural communities, began to notice the economic advantages of keeping the money paid for power relatively close to home instead of shipping it off to Houston or Riyadh. The world had wasted so much energy that much of the early work was easy, like losing weight by getting your hair cut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the early euphoria came to an end pretty quickly. By the end of the 2020s, it became clear we would have to pay the price of delaying action for decades.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor one thing, the cuts in emissions that scientists prescribed were almost impossibly deep. \u0026ldquo;If you\u0026rsquo;d started in 1990 when we first warned you, the job was manageable: you could have cut carbon a percent or two a year,\u0026rdquo; one eminent physicist explained. \u0026ldquo;But waiting 30 years turned a bunny slope into a black diamond.\u0026rdquo; As usual, the easy \u0026ldquo;solutions\u0026rdquo; turned out to be no help at all: fracked natural-gas wells were leaking vast quantities of methane into the atmosphere, and \u0026ldquo;biomass burning\u0026rdquo;\u0026mdash;\u0026shy;cutting down forests to burn them for electricity\u0026mdash;was putting a pulse of carbon into the air at precisely the wrong moment. (As it happened, the math showed letting trees stand was crucial for pulling carbon from the atmosphere\u0026mdash;when secondary forests were allowed to grow, they sucked up a third or more of the excess carbon humanity was producing.) Environmentalists learned they needed to make some compromises, and so most of America\u0026rsquo;s aging nuclear reactors were left online past their decommissioning dates: that lower-carbon power supplemented the surging renewable industry in the early years, even as researchers continued work to see if fusion power, thorium reactors or some other advanced design could work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe real problem, though, was that climate change itself kept accelerating, even as the world began trying to turn its energy and agriculture systems around. The giant slug of carbon that the world had put into the atmosphere\u0026mdash;more since 1990 than in all of human history before\u0026mdash;acted like a time-delayed fuse, and the temperature just kept rising. Worse, it appeared that scientists had systematically underestimated just how much damage each tenth of a degree would actually do, a point underscored in 2032 when a behemoth slice of the West Antarctic ice sheet slid majestically into the southern ocean, and all of a sudden the rise in sea level was being measured in feet, not inches. (Nothing, it turned out, could move Americans to embrace the metric system.) And the heating kept triggering feedback loops that in turn accelerated the heating: ever larger wildfires, for instance, kept pushing ever more carbon into the air, and their smoke blackened ice sheets that in turn melted even faster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis hotter world produced an ongoing spate of emergencies: \u0026ldquo;forest-fire season\u0026rdquo; was now essentially year-round, and the warmer ocean kept hurricanes and typhoons boiling months past the old norms. And sometimes the damage was novel: ancient carcasses kept emerging from the melting permafrost of the north, and with them germs from illnesses long thought extinct. But the greatest crises were the slower, more inexorable ones: the ongoing drought and desertification was forcing huge numbers of Africans, Asians and Central Americans to move; in many places, the heat waves had literally become unbearable, with nighttime temperatures staying above 100\u0026deg;F and outdoor work all but impossible for weeks and months at a time. On low-lying ground like the Mekong Delta, the rising ocean salted fields essential to supplying the world with rice. The U.N. had long ago estimated the century could see a billion climate refugees, and it was beginning to appear it was unnervingly correct. What could the rich countries say? These were people who hadn\u0026rsquo;t caused the crisis now devouring their lives, and there weren\u0026rsquo;t enough walls and cages to keep them at bay, so the migrations kept roiling the politics of the planet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"inline-portrait_small_2x alignnone \"\u003e\u003cimg data-attachment-id=\"5673698\" data-permalink=\"https://time.com/5669022/climate-change-2050/climate-change-how-we-solved-climate-change-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/climate-change-how-we-solved-climate-change-2.jpg?quality=85\" data-orig-size=\"1786,2400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"climate-change-how-we-solved-climate-change-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/climate-change-how-we-solved-climate-change-2.jpg?quality=85\u0026w=223\" data-large-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/climate-change-how-we-solved-climate-change-2.jpg?quality=85\u0026w=447\" src=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/climate-change-how-we-solved-climate-change-2.jpg?w=560\u0026#038;quality=85\u0026#038;h=753\" alt=\"\" height=\"753\"\u003e\n\u003cfigcaption class=\"image-caption\" \u003e\u003cspan class=\"credit\" \u003eIllustration by David Doran (Background photo: Getty Images)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were, in fact, two possible ways forward. The most obvious path was a constant competition between nations and individuals to see who could thrive in this new climate regime, with luckier places turning themselves into fortresses above the flood. Indeed some people in some places tried to cling to old notions: plug in some solar panels and they could somehow return to a more naive world, where economic expansion was still the goal of every government.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there was a second response that carried the day in most countries, as growing numbers of people came to understand that the ground beneath our feet had truly shifted. If the economy was the lens through which we\u0026rsquo;d viewed the world for a century, now survival was the only sensible basis on which to make decisions. Those decisions targeted not just carbon dioxide; these societies went after the wild inequality that also marked the age. The Green New Deal turned out to be everything the Koch brothers had most feared when it was introduced: a tool to make America a fairer, healthier, better-educated place. It was emulated around the world, just as America\u0026rsquo;s Clean Air Act had long served as a template for laws across the globe. Slowly both the Keeling Curve, measuring carbon in the atmosphere, and the Gini coefficient, measuring the distribution of wealth, began to flatten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026rsquo;s where we are today. We clearly did not \u0026ldquo;escape\u0026rdquo; climate change or \u0026ldquo;solve\u0026rdquo; global warming\u0026mdash;the temperature keeps climbing, though the rate of increase has lessened. It\u0026rsquo;s turned into a wretched century, which is considerably better than a catastrophic one. We ended up with the most profound and most dangerous physical changes in human history. Our civilization surely teetered\u0026mdash;and an enormous number of people paid an unfair and overwhelming price\u0026mdash;but it did not fall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople have learned to defend what can be practically defended: expensive seawalls and pumps mean New York is still New York, though the Antarctic may yet have something to say on the subject. Other places we\u0026rsquo;ve learned to let go: much of the East Coast has moved in a few miles, to more defensible ground. Yes, that took trillions of dollars in real estate off the board\u0026mdash;but the roads and the bridges would have cost trillions to defend, and even then the odds were bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCities look different now\u0026mdash;much more densely populated, as NIMBY defenses against new development gave way to an increasingly vibrant urbanism. Smart municipalities banned private cars from the center of town, opening up free public-transit systems and building civic fleets of self-driving cars that got rid of the space wasted on parking spots. But rural districts have changed too: the erratic weather put a premium on hands-on agricultural skills, which in turn provided opportunities for migrants arriving from ruined farmlands elsewhere. (Farming around solar panels has become a particular specialty.)

The defiant notion that we would forever overcome nature has given way to pride of a different kind: increasingly we celebrate our ability to bend without breaking, to adapt as gracefully as possible to a natural world whose temper we\u0026rsquo;ve come to respect. When we look back to the start of the century we are, of course, angry that people did so little to slow the great heating: if we\u0026rsquo;d acknowledged climate change in earnest a decade or two earlier, we might have shaved a degree off the temperature, and a degree is measured in great pain and peril. But we also know it was hard for people to grasp what was happening: human history stretched back 10,000 years, and those millennia were physically stable, so it made emotional sense to assume that stability would stretch forward as well as past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe know much better now: we know that we\u0026rsquo;ve knocked the planet off its foundations, and that our job, for the foreseeable centuries, is to absorb the bounces as she rolls.

In 2018, the region\u0026mdash;which spans Australia and the islands that make up Micronesia, Polynesia and Melanesia\u0026mdash;had its \u003ca href=\"https://www.ncdc.noaa.go\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003ethird warmest year\u003c/a\u003e on record. Many of the islands that make up this region are particularly vulnerable to rising temperatures and sea levels, two of the many consequences of climate change. If these places are lost under the waters or become uninhabitable, humanity will lose so much: wildlife, natural resources, unique cultures, languages and values. But the people who live there will lose everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom my experiences meeting refugees all around the world, whenever people are displaced, their first instinct is to seek a practical local solution inside their own country. Only when that is not sustainable do they usually cross a border. And even then, they tend to remain in their region.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbout 80% of all refugees\u0026mdash;people who have fled conflict or persecution in their countries\u0026mdash;are living in nations neighboring their nations of origin. Fewer than 1% of refugees are permanently resettled in foreign countries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe majority of refugees I have met want to return home and resume their lives. But what if there is no longer a home to go back to? What if your home is underwater? If the island where your family and people have lived for centuries has sunk under the rising oceans? Whom do you turn to for help? What happens to your culture, your livelihood, your citizenship and your country\u0026rsquo;s continued existence as a nation-state?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe are at a unique moment in history. As deserts advance, forests are felled, sea levels rise, and extreme weather events become more frequent and more destructive, we have a small window to identify the danger and work to bring order to chaos.

Our security is affected by global instability. And we have invested for generations in the development of poorer nations.

Climate-change effects increasingly interact with drivers of conflict, exacerbating refugee situations in countries like Chad, Sudan and Somalia. In such situations, refugee-law frameworks may apply. But ignoring our legal responsibilities toward refugees will only deepen human suffering and heighten global displacement. The new Global Compact on Refugees, adopted this year by the U.N. General Assembly, puts forward new international arrangements for sharing responsibility for refugees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInternational cooperation will also be key to preventing, mitigating and resolving climate-related displacement. Many people displaced by climate change do not qualify as refugees, but how they are treated will affect the future stability of the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTuvalu has called for a U.N. resolution to create a legal framework to protect the human rights and lives of migrants displaced by climate change.

The urgent message from our most vulnerable nations should inspire the rest of the world to act. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights\u0026mdash;the foundation of international human-rights law\u0026mdash;makes clear that the rights of the citizen of a small island state, or a herder in a drought-affected part of Africa, rank equally with yours or mine. Yet in practice, they don\u0026rsquo;t. It\u0026rsquo;s a form of discrimination hardwired so deeply into our world that we are largely unaware of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile we in America do not face the imminent prospect of our entire homeland and culture drowning under surging seas, as many young Pasifika, or Pacific islanders, do, our country has a far bigger voice in decisions affecting the future of the environment than the people for whom this is already an existential question.

In 1965, Revelle had warned President Lyndon Johnson of the mounting crisis. Measurements made by Revelle\u0026rsquo;s colleague Charles David Keeling from the top of Mauna Loa on the Big Island of Hawaii showed clearly that the increased burning of fossil fuels was leading to a dramatic rise in the concentrations of CO\u0026#8322; measurements in the atmosphere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"inline-portrait_small_2x aligncenter \"\u003e\u003cimg data-attachment-id=\"5672819\" data-permalink=\"https://time.com/5669047/al-gore-youth-climate-activists/time-cover-planet-earth-1989/\" data-orig-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/time-cover-planet-earth-1989.jpg?quality=85\" data-orig-size=\"1777,2400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"TIME-cover-planet-earth-1989\" data-image-description=\"pEndangered Earth, Planet of the Year, Jan. 2, 1989 cover/p\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/time-cover-planet-earth-1989.jpg?quality=85\u0026w=222\" data-large-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/time-cover-planet-earth-1989.jpg?quality=85\u0026w=444\" src=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/time-cover-planet-earth-1989.jpg?w=560\u0026#038;quality=85\u0026#038;h=756\" alt=\"TIME-cover-planet-earth-1989\" height=\"756\"\u003e\n\u003cfigcaption class=\"image-caption\" \u003e\u003cspan class=\"caption\" \u003eEndangered Earth, Planet of the Year, Jan. 2, 1989 cover\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeven years after that class, as a young, newly elected member of the U.S. House of Representatives, I asked what was being done about this emerging threat and found the most common answer was, \u0026ldquo;What threat?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring my first-ever congressional hearing on this crisis, I asked Dr. Revelle to be the leadoff witness, naively hoping when he spoke, those listening would have the same epiphany I had as an undergrad. When that didn\u0026rsquo;t happen, I asked myself for the first time an urgent question that has preoccupied me ever since: How can this crisis be made as clear to our nation and to the world as Revelle made it to me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNearly 40 years later, although we have made a great deal of progress, we are not yet gaining on the crisis. It is still worsening faster than we are mobilizing to confront it. The evidence is now even more overwhelming, of course, and Mother Nature has joined the discussion. The U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change recently issued its latest stark assessment, in which the world\u0026rsquo;s leading scientists warned we must undergo an urgent and rapid transformation of our civilization in order to avert the most catastrophic effects of a disrupted global climate system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHumanity is now spewing more than 110 million tons of global warming pollution every day into the exceedingly thin shell of atmosphere that surrounds our planet as if it were an open sewer. The extra heat energy being trapped on earth and exacerbated by man-made climate change is now equal to what would be released by 500,000 Hiroshima-class atomic bombs exploding on earth every single day, according to James Hansen, a leading climate scientist. And the knock-on consequences of all that extra heat energy is leading to increasingly dangerous threats to lives and livelihoods all around the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe past five years have been the hottest five years recorded since the world\u0026rsquo;s top weather and climate agencies started tracking global temperatures in the 1880s. This past July was the hottest month ever in recorded history. More than 90% of the extra heat is going into the oceans, and it is fueling supercharged hurricanes. Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria (all in 2017) caused as much as $265 billion in damages. Overall, weather disasters in 2017 and 2018 cost the global economy $653 billion\u0026shy;\u0026mdash;the costliest back-to-back years in history. Wildfires are worsening around the world, including across the American West, while farmers in the Midwest have dealt with periods of both catastrophic flooding and drought that destroyed crops and threatened the economic health of communities. Sea levels are rising at an accelerating rate as the melting of land-based ice in Greenland and Antarctica increases to record levels. The list goes on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut we must be on guard against despair, which is ultimately just another form of denial when the future of humanity is at stake. Yes, some losses are not recoverable. And yes, more damage is now inevitable no matter what we do. False hope is also a form of denial, but I remain optimistic that we still retain the ability to avoid the most catastrophic consequences of this crisis and save the future of humanity\u0026mdash;if we rise to the challenge and act urgently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"inline-portrait_small_2x alignnone \"\u003e\u003cimg data-attachment-id=\"5672481\" data-permalink=\"https://time.com/5669047/al-gore-youth-climate-activists/damage-from-hurricane-dorian-in-the-bahamas/\" data-orig-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/climate-change-al-gore-extreme-weather.jpg?quality=85\" data-orig-size=\"2400,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"The Washington Post\",\"camera\":\"NIKON Z 7\",\"caption\":\"MARSH HARBOUR, BAHAMAS - SEPTEMBER 7:\\rDejani Louistan, who was displaced by Hurricane Dorian, stands with the only belongings she managed to salvage  amid the destruction left in the Mudd neighborhood of Marsh Harbour, Bahamas on September 7, 2019.

Harking back to the great social movements in history\u0026mdash;women\u0026rsquo;s suffrage, civil rights, gay and lesbian rights\u0026mdash;youth activists are taking the lead. They are staging sit-ins at congressional offices, marching in the streets and protesting on college campuses. Above all, a growing number of students in many nations have been striking from school every Friday for more than a year to demand action on the climate crisis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe movement has been led by a 16-year-old Swedish student named Greta Thunberg, who captured the world\u0026rsquo;s attention with a groundbreaking speech at the U.N.\u0026rsquo;s annual gathering of world leaders in Poland last year. Thunberg speaks with startling clarity about the threat her generation faces and how political leaders have failed the test of leadership. Her words and advocacy embody the moral authority of youth activists who will bear the burden of the decisions previous generations make today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYouth activists have also been at the ground level of the Green New Deal resolution put forward by 29-year-old Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and longtime champion for climate action Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts. Many of the ideas included in the Green New Deal have been around for years, but they have never been packaged together with momentum rooted in the energy and fervor of a new generation of leaders. The Green New Deal has indisputably played a critical role in pushing the Democratic Party\u0026rsquo;s 2020 presidential candidates to propose concrete solutions to the issue at a scale that would have been unthinkable even just a few years ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"inline-portrait_small_2x alignnone \"\u003e\u003cimg data-attachment-id=\"5672484\" data-permalink=\"https://time.com/5669047/al-gore-youth-climate-activists/climate-demonstration-fridays-for-future/\" data-orig-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/climate-change-al-gore-climate-activists.jpg?quality=85\" data-orig-size=\"2400,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"picture alliance\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"29 March 2019, Berlin: The Swedish schoolgirl Greta Thunberg goes with Lisa Neubauer to the climate demonstration \\\"Fridays for Future\\\".

According to the AP/NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, 71% of Americans agree climate change is happening. And among youth, there has been a striking change among Republicans: A 2018 Pew Research poll shows millennial Republicans are more likely to endorse centrist environmental positions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the lessons of my years as a young member of Congress was that although change can sometimes come from the top, most often the biggest changes start at the grassroots level. Political leaders will pay attention if the calls to action are loud and persistent. Saving the future of humanity is a heavy burden for teenagers and 20-somethings to bear. But they are embracing the challenge as if their lives depend on it. The rest of us must follow their lead and act before it\u0026rsquo;s too late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr /\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is one article in a series on the state of the planet\u0026rsquo;s response to climate change. \u003ca href=\"https://time.com/climate-change-solutions\" \u003eRead the rest of the stories\u003c/a\u003e and sign up for \u003ca href=\"https://cloud.newsletters.time.com/newsletters/?newsletter_name=climate\u0026amp;source=article-climate-footer\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eOne.Five, TIME\u0026#8217;s climate change newsletter.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/time/topstories/~4/QJd2LKobNME\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/QJd2LKobNME/","published":"2019-09-12T11:15:25Z","guid":"http://time.com/?p=5669047"},{"title":"Climate Change Isn’t Just a Global Threat—It’s a Public Health Emergency","content":"\u003caside class=\"right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad\" id=\"right-rail__ad-5672636\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module\" data-src=\"https://time.com/5672636/climate-change-public-health/\" data-widget-id=\"SB_2\" data-ob-template=\"timemag\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"inline-portrait_small alignright \"\u003e\u003cimg data-attachment-id=\"5675174\" data-permalink=\"https://time.com/5672636/climate-change-public-health/print-109/\" data-orig-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/hollis.fc_.300.jpg?quality=85\" data-orig-size=\"2501,2756\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1568189636\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"Print\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Hollis illustration\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/hollis.fc_.300.jpg?quality=85\u0026w=272\" data-large-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/hollis.fc_.300.jpg?quality=85\u0026w=544\" src=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/hollis.fc_.300.jpg?w=280\u0026#038;quality=85\u0026#038;h=309\" alt=\"\" height=\"309\"\u003e\n\u003cfigcaption class=\"image-caption\" \u003e\u003cspan class=\"credit\" \u003eHarry Campbell for TIME\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere can be no discussion about climate change without a meaningful conversation about public health. As leading health experts have affirmed, the climate crisis is a threat multiplier, particularly for communities suffering from environmental injustice. For example, the Fourth National Climate Assessment, published in 2018 by a collaboration among 13 U.S. scientific agencies, highlights how higher temperatures, severe weather events and rising seas can contribute to heat-related cardiopulmonary illness, infectious disease and mental-health issues. Societal factors such as poverty, discrimination, access to health care and pre-existing health conditions make some populations even more vulnerable.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThousands of communities nationwide\u0026mdash;often low-income or with many residents of color\u0026mdash;that already face environmental risks constantly grapple with issues that others seldom encounter with the same intensity. These include exposure to air pollutants (like particulate matter and soot produced from burning fossil fuels) or soil and water contamination (caused by dumping coal ash or lead in the water supply). These same communities tend to be systematically targeted when corporations and regulators decide where to build hazardous-waste sites, power plants and waste incinerators. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t help that these populations often lack access to fresh produce, health insurance, affordable homes, public transportation and economic opportunities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClimate change is a public-health issue. It has been linked to chronic conditions, such as kidney disease, depression and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and can shove the body\u0026rsquo;s response to existing environmental assaults into overdrive. For example, people with asthma often experience more attacks during extreme heat and cold weather. As climate change continues to alter disease patterns and disrupt health systems, its effect on human health will become harder to ignore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA recent report by the Union of Concerned Scientists found that climate change is poised to increase extreme heat significantly in frequency and severity, leading to more public-health risks across the U.S. In the U.S., urban communities of color, often also low-income areas, are especially at risk, particularly those living in counties in the Southeast, which have the highest concentration of African Americans. The situation is similar for Latinx populations. In the U.S. and globally, those least responsible for climate change are already the first to bear the brunt of its health effects. Low-income communities often do not have the resources to voluntarily evacuate during extreme weather events.

The Israel Policy Forum (IFP), a Jewish American organization that advocates for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict said in a statement that annexation, no matter how partial, \u0026ldquo;would have disastrous consequences for Israel, its security, and its status as a Jewish and democratic state.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, Netanyahu\u0026#8217;s main election opponent, \u003ca href=\"https://time.com/5546771/benjamin-netanyahu-benny-gantz-israel-prime-minister/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eBenny Gantz\u003c/a\u003e and his Blue and White party issued no such condemnation and instead claimed ownership of the origin of the plan. \u0026ldquo;Blue and White have made clear that the Jordan Valley is part of Israel forever.

He called it an \u0026ldquo;empty promise\u0026rdquo; and said that he would replace with \u0026ldquo;actions and deeds.\u0026rdquo; It was not immediately clear what action Gantz intended to take on the Jordan Valley, and he did not use the word annexation or sovereignty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe timing of Netanyahu\u0026rsquo;s announcement so close to elections gives credence to Gantz\u0026rsquo;s claim that it is spin: fulfilling a long held ambition of some Israelis who see the occupied Palestinian territories as part of biblical Israel. Facing a shrinking coalition after failing to form a government in May and three corruption charges on which Israel\u0026rsquo;s attorney general said he would indict Netanyahu pending a hearing, the prime minister needs hard right support to bolster his chances of political survival. But Gantz\u0026rsquo;s Blue and White\u0026rsquo;s ambiguous response will \u0026ldquo;at a minimum\u0026rdquo; be interpreted as \u0026ldquo;not opposing [Netanyahu\u0026rsquo;s] annexation plans\u0026rdquo; says IPF director Michael Koplow, even if it falls short of giving them explicit assent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome 2.5 million Palestinians live in the West Bank, which Israel has controlled since it fought a war with its Arab neighbors in 1967. Hundreds of thousands of Israelis also populate West Bank settlements, which the overwhelming majority of the international community considers illegal.

Polling data from the Jerusalem-based Israel Democracy Institute indicates that 48% of Jewish Israelis and 11% of Arab Israelis would favor the extension of sovereignty over the Jordan Valley and the northern Dead Sea\u0026mdash;sometimes known as Area C\u0026mdash;if such a move if it were supported by Trump and his administration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGantz\u0026rsquo;s position is complicated by the fact that, like Netanyahu\u0026rsquo;s Likud party, he advocates Israel maintaining security control over the Jordan Valley. In an election season, effectively distinguishing security control from political control, in the form of annexation, is difficult, says IPF\u0026rsquo;s Koplow, and opposing Netanyahu\u0026rsquo;s statement runs the risk of conveying to the electorate that his party is willing to cede security control of the Jordan Valley. Nonetheless, Gantz\u0026rsquo;s ambiguity \u0026ldquo;was not very smart politics,\u0026rdquo; he adds. It\u0026rsquo;s unlikely to win over right-wingers drawn to ardently pro-annexationist parties, while at the same time turning those who oppose annexation away from his Centrist Blue and White party.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn Monday, Gantz told an audience in Tel Aviv that he would ideally form a unity government including Likud, the secular nationalist Yisrael Beiteinu and \u0026ldquo;maybe [center-left] Labor,\u0026rdquo; bolstering the perception that Blue and White differs from Likud in terms of personality rather than policy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor those on the political left, Gantz\u0026rsquo;s stance is symptomatic of the dearth of serious opposition to the politics Netanyahu has engendered.

The goal is faster boarding and departure, dispensing with those lap-scrutinizing walk-throughs flight attendants must perform.

Airbus has begun flight testing the connected cabin on its A350 test aircraft and plans to introduce it on the A321 family in 2021, followed by the larger, two-aisle A350 series two years later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs cool as all of this may seem to you, the passenger, it\u0026rsquo;s just another way for airlines to squeeze more profit out of operations. While data from these various areas will be sent to flight attendant tablets or smart phones in real time, the crunching of that data over time is where the real value lies. The connectivity Airbus envisions for its cabins will provide an enormous trove of information airlines can use to analyze and optimize in their never-ending quest for cost efficiencies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the time it takes a flight attendant to respond to a call button, to preferences for prosecco versus chardonnay, to which bathroom gets the most use\u0026mdash;the information can help optimize all aspects of flight. \u0026ldquo;You can make the service more attentive,\u0026rdquo; said Ronald Sweers, an Airbus cabin-products director. While the digital doodads are expected to simplify flight attendant workloads, their true value may lie in giving airlines more insights about what happens in the cabin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat space, Wuggetzer noted, is a virtual \u0026ldquo;black box\u0026rdquo; to carriers once the plane leaves a gate. But not for much longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAirbus also plans to offer airlines the option of cameras at each lavatory (on the outside, mind you) to count how many passengers are waiting, a feature which may help flight attendants redirect some of that traffic on larger jets. While certainly helpful to that man in 17C who had one too many sodas, the data will also show airlines the length of wait times on various flights, and on different aircraft types. More seriously, it can also alert a flight attendant that someone inside may be ill or need assistance, Wuggetzer said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crew will also be able to control features such as window shades and public address volume from their mobile devices. The system will know which overhead bin spaces are open, with green lights along the cabin, much like the lighting schemes used in parking decks to signal drivers toward unoccupied spaces. That should, in theory, speed boarding, Airbus says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs far as Airbus is concerned, the cabin\u0026rsquo;s platform is open so customer airlines can attach their own crew applications or other software, Sweers said.

For instance, a voter could rank Sen.

Kamala Harris, and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg) as options. The end results were quite similar for both versions, so this article will focus on the five-candidate version for simplicity’s sake. (The more extensive results for both versions are available \u003ca href=\"https://www.fairvote.org/democratic_primary_2020_poll\"\u003eat FairVote’s website\u003c/a\u003e.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"gtAD8U\"\u003eIn an initial tally counting only voters’ top-ranked choices, Biden leads the Democratic field with 33 percent, and is followed by Warren with 29 percent, Sanders with 20 percent, Harris with 10 percent, and Buttigieg with 8 percent, per the poll.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"68fr6d\"\u003eBut it turns out that respondents who initially favored Sanders and Harris prefer Warren over Biden, by about a two-to-one ratio. So once the field is narrowed to a head-to-head matchup of just Biden and Warren, and votes for the eliminated candidates are to whomever each voter ranked higher, Warren would lead Biden by 6 points. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"D6iJqy\"\u003eThe results are an interesting indication of how an outcome can change due to a different tallying system.

And lastly, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s “Squad” versus Nancy Pelosi; and Buttigieg’s favorite president, Abraham Lincoln. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"s61mAr\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSubscribe: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/podcast/id1011668648\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eApple Podcasts\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e | \u003ca href=\"https://www.google.com/podcasts?feed=aHR0cDovL2ZlZWRzLmZlZWRidXJuZXIuY29tL1JlY29kZS1EZWNvZGU%3D\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGoogle Podcasts\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e | \u003ca href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/47jQcyRcrM1EoV0sU39N9F?si=um-2BV2yRXCcfLno-ZHZkw\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSpotify\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e | \u003ca href=\"https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/vox/recode-decode\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStitcher\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e | \u003ca href=\"https://listen.tunein.com/recodedecodelisten\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTuneIn\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"V68ZBn\"\u003e\n\u003ciframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"200\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP4774027638\" width=\"100%\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"p4Dppy\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Ezra Klein Show\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e: \u003c/strong\u003eThere’s been plenty of discussion of Buttigieg’s biography, and of whether a midsize-city mayorship is appropriate experience for the presidency.

Ezra Klein caught her on a campaign swing through California to ask her about that meta-plan. The plan behind her plans. Warren’s easy fluency with policy is on full display here, but it’s her systematic thinking about the nature of power, and what it takes to redistribute it, that really sets her apart from the field.

Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal’s editorial board offered a more substantive reply to Maddow, claiming that the article is a relatively benign defense of “\u003ca href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/smearing-steven-menashi-11566761235\"\u003eIsrael as a liberal democracy and Jewish state\u003c/a\u003e” — and claiming that any senator who accepts her argument drifts too far towards the “anti-Israel fringe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"94PXp3\"\u003eThe Wall Street Journal is correct that the lion’s share of Menashi’s article is an academic defense of Israel against scholars who “argue that liberal democracy precludes the state from adopting a particularistic ethnonational identity.” Arraying himself against scholars who argue, in the words of one of Menashi’s antagonists, that Israel “remains distinctive among democratic states in its resort to ethnoreligious criteria with which to denominate and rank its citizens,” Menashi spends most of his article listing examples of other nations that also give favorable treatment to persons with a particular ethnonational identity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"KSQngu\"\u003eTo the extent that Menashi seeks to prove that many nations have a thread of ethnonationalism woven into their legal tapestry, his article is persuasive. He lists a wide array of laws — a Greek law that “grants automatic citizenship to ‘persons of Greek origin’ who volunteer for military service,” an Irish law creating a special process allowing persons “of Irish descent or Irish associations” to gain citizenship, and so forth — that give some degree of favorable treatment to people who can trace their family’s origins back to that nation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"uiyZMH\"\u003eNear the end of his article, however, Menashi diverges from his largely descriptive effort to normalize Israel, and suggests that ethnic diversity is itself harmful. “Social scientists have found that greater ethnic heterogeneity is associated with lower social trust,” he writes. “Ethnically heterogeneous societies exhibit less political and civic engagement, less effective governing institutions, and fewer public goods.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"2pB0iv\"\u003e“Surely,” he concludes with a flourish, “it does not serve the cause of liberal democracy to ignore this reality.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"4elDsv\"\u003eMenashi’s article does not lay out a policy agenda to deal with this “reality.” Should the government teach citizens about diverse cultures so that they are more accepting?

As the political scientist Paul Kens, a leading scholar of the \u003cem\u003eLochner\u003c/em\u003e opinion, writes, the revisionist view of \u003cem\u003eLochner\u003c/em\u003e is “\u003ca href=\"http://www.georgemasonlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/23_3_Millhiser.pdf\"\u003enot based on primary sources\u003c/a\u003e” and “neither the newspapers of the time, nor personal accounts, nor legislative journals indicate that any large or powerful business was involved in passing this legislation.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"RKlDXy\"\u003eThe point of this discussion about \u003cem\u003eLochner\u003c/em\u003e and the effort to revive it is not that Menashi endorses that effort. Rather, the point is that the article he wrote with Ginsburg embraces nearly all the premises of the \u003cem\u003eLochner\u003c/em\u003eians without explicitly reaching their conclusion. It is evidence that he supports a deeply radical agenda — one that could dismantle much of the New Deal and the Great Society — but not conclusive proof that he does so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"gFlE3x\"\u003eIf senators had more time to prepare for Menashi’s hearing, perhaps they could have probed deeper into the nominee’s views and answered the many questions raised by Menashi’s writings.

Founded in the 1930s, it’s still the government’s biggest, most expensive program. It does more than any other single program to lift households out of poverty and it’s probably the most popular aspect of the social safety net. It’s also been out of the political headlines in recent years, as once-raging debates about the program’s long-time sustainability have taken a back seat to clashes about health care, climate change, and various culture war topics. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"OCu5c8\"\u003eBut you can’t be the candidate who brags about having a plan for everything without a plan for Social Security, and Sen. \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/6/26/18715614/elizabeth-warren-2020-presidential-campaign-policies\"\u003eElizabeth Warren\u003c/a\u003e is out today with a dramatic proposal to expand benefits and make the tax base that funds the program sharply more progressive. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"oCPaQq\"\u003eWarren’s proposal, which would levy a payroll tax on income over $250,000 and on income from investments in order to boost retirees’ average benefits by about $200 a month, doesn’t come out of nowhere. The Massachusetts lawmaker \u003ca href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/elizabeth-warren-social-security_n_4298336\"\u003ehas been a proponent of expanding Social Security benefits\u003c/a\u003e since her first year in the Senate, and the idea that the government needs to do more to account for households’ basic financial needs \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/1/23/18183091/two-income-trap-elizabeth-warren-book\"\u003ehas been integral to her thinking\u003c/a\u003e since long before that. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"sylYQa\"\u003eBut the plan reflects both how far the contours of the national political dialogue of Social Security have transformed from where they were five to ten years ago, and raises some basic questions about how (if at all) Democrats can cut into Trump’s lead with older voters — and whether they ought to be trying. But more than that, it illustrates an important way that Warren’s view of the basic structure of economic policy differs from what we saw from Bill Clinton or Barack Obama — one that’s much less interested in targeting resources on the neediest and much more interested in the expansive possibilities that are unlocked by truly soaking the rich.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"rtKMbL\"\u003eThe basics of Social Security \u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"amUOSh\"\u003eThere are a lot of ins-and-outs to Social Security, but the basic contour of the program is that it’s funded by a flat-rate payroll tax, half of which is paid by employees and half of which is paid by employers. The tax applies exclusively to the first $132,900 of a worker’s income and it applies exclusively to \u003cem\u003ewage and salary\u003c/em\u003e income, so income from investments is excluded. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"3HApm5\"\u003eConsequently, someone really struggling to get by pays an identical tax rate to a person comfortably earning in the low six figures — and an affluent person will generally pay a \u003cem\u003elower\u003c/em\u003e rate than that, due to both the tax cap and the exclusion of investment income. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"k3No2C\"\u003eAt the same time, Social Security benefits are in most cases (there are some small categories like orphans for whom the formula is different) a function of how much tax you paid during your working years. The formula works so that benefits don’t increase fully proportionally with taxes paid, so the program does wind up being mildly redistributive. But Social Security as a whole is much less redistributive than the bulk of the federal government. Rather than collecting highly progressive income taxes and then targeting the benefits at the neediest, Social Security collects \u003cstrong\u003efrom \u003c/strong\u003ea broad and not-so-progressive tax base and then provides benefits to almost everyone. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"DHklsu\"\u003eIn wonkspeak, this is “social insurance” that provides everyone with security against the risk of their retirement savings evaporating due to bad luck or unexpectedly long lifespan with a small amount of redistribution tacked on. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"BCZslM\"\u003eBut the program is also not actuarially sound. A combination of growing life expectancy, slowing population growth, and slowing wage growth have created a situation where the program is \u003ca href=\"https://www.ssa.gov/oact/TRSUM/\"\u003escheduled to run out of money in 2035\u003c/a\u003e. In principle, the federal government could just keep paying benefits. The military doesn't have a dedicated source of tax revenue or a special trust fund, but Congress just keeps authorizing higher and higher defense budgets because that’s what they want to do. But under current law, when Social Security’s trust fund runs dry the government is supposed to sharply cut benefits to keep things on track. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Cf72xI\"\u003eWarren’s plan aims to address solvency, expand benefits, and make Social Security much more redistributive. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"STyNSe\"\u003eThe Warren Plan: More Social Security for everyone\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"7qaO2n\"\u003eThe centerpiece of Warren’s plan is a proposal to increase Social Security benefits for all current and future retirees by about $200 per month — a sizable increase from the \u003ca href=\"https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/quickfacts/stat_snapshot/\"\u003ecurrent average check of about $1,400 or so per month\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"8DJT7P\"\u003eWarren also wants to further address several longstanding progressive concerns about Social Security, including the idea that it unfairly treats the poorest workers, the disabled, and people (primarily women) who spent many of their prime working years out of the paid workforce shouldering family care responsibilities. Those groups would all get additional benefits enhancements over and above the basic large increase in benefits that Warren is promising. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"EuhWZn\"\u003eObviously the idea of making benefits more generous across the board, paired with additional special enhancements, runs contrary to the notion that the big problem with Social Security is looming insolvency. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"9eEGKy\"\u003eTo address that, Warren is proposing a rather hefty tax increase on the top 2 percent or so of the population. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli id=\"sU8fjy\"\u003eFirst, she wants to impose a 14.8 percent payroll tax (split evenly between workers and employers) on salaries above $250,000 a year. This would create a slightly odd program structure where the payroll tax phases out at $132,900 and then pops back into existence at $250,000. But the goal in creating that doughnut hole structure is to target the tax increase at the top 2 percent of American earners. \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli id=\"NKxVdZ\"\u003eSecond, she wants to also impose a 14.8 percent tax on the \u003cem\u003einvestment income\u003c/em\u003e of people earning over $250,000. \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"E9spBv\"\u003eIn combination, these proposals would change Social Security taxes from something that’s not really a big deal for truly wealthy Americans into one that is. And paired with the big and extremely broad increase in benefits, it also turns Social Security into a serious vehicle for redistribution — taking from the rich and giving broadly to the middle class. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"aGDXvk\"\u003eThe shifting politics of Social Security \u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"gt5PD3\"\u003eWarren’s proposal on this is distinctive, but it also reflects a larger shift in the larger political dialogue around Social Security. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"7XUauR\"\u003eIn the 1990s and 2000s the strong conventional wisdom around Social Security was that benefits needed to be \u003cem\u003ecut\u003c/em\u003e — at least for the upper middle class — and the only real debate was about how to structure those cuts. In his first term, President Barack Obama repeatedly offered to cut Social Security benefits in the context of a larger deal with congressional Republicans that would also raise taxes on the rich. His demand was that cuts be “balanced” with tax increases as part of an overall deficit reduction strategy, but the basic need for cuts was a core conviction. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"kkIcrk\"\u003eThen two things changed. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"H0vY4S\"\u003eOne is that left-of-center people became \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/4/19/11450466/expand-social-security\"\u003eincreasingly disillusioned with tax-subsidized savings accounts like 401(k) and IRAs\u003c/a\u003e as an approach to guaranteeing retirement security. In the 2016 cycle, \u003ca href=\"http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sanders-calls-on-congress-to-strengthen-and-expand-social-security\"\u003eBernie Sanders proposed increasing Social Security benefits\u003c/a\u003e (his bill, which Kamala Harris and Cory Booker have cosponsored, offers a more modest $112/month boost and does a bit less in terms of some of Warren’s more targeted enhancements as well), \u003ca href=\"http://www.vox.com/2015/8/22/9189675/martin-omalley-social-security\"\u003eMartin O’Malley proposed an even more ambitious plan\u003c/a\u003e to do the same, and \u003ca href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/04/can-elizabeth-warren-expand-social-security\"\u003eHillary Clinton responded with a more modest Social Security expansion\u003c/a\u003e plan. By June 2016, \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/6/1/11835510/obama-expand-social-security\"\u003eObama was on the expansion bandwagon too\u003c/a\u003e. Warren, meanwhile, had been \u003ca href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/04/can-elizabeth-warren-expand-social-security\"\u003epushing broadly for expansion\u003c/a\u003e, though without a specific plan. Her efforts, along with those of a cohort of like-minded progressive House members, helped play an important role in ultimately killing off Obama’s interest in further pursuing the balanced cuts approach. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"L62nmJ\"\u003eThe other big change was Donald Trump, who shocked the world by running to the right on immigration but breaking sharply with conservative orthodoxy to oppose any cuts to Social Security and Medicare. By breaking with conservative activists on these two crucial questions, Trump helped obtain a reputation as a \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/7/11/15941846/trump-moderate-republican\"\u003erelatively moderate Republican\u003c/a\u003e — a \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/7/2/20677656/donald-trump-moderate-extremism-penalty\"\u003ereputation that helped him win in 2016\u003c/a\u003e.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"d7JbmY\"\u003eThe many versus the few\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"dsxJDo\"\u003eOf course this program, like pretty much all the other big legislative proposals Democrats are rolling out in the 2020 cycle, is relatively unlikely to be enacted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"3T3pcy\"\u003eBut Warren’s Social Security pitch is a good guide to how she thinks about economic policy in general. The way both the Clinton and Obama administrations thought about the safety net was basically that tax revenue is scarce so it’s important to design programs that get the most bang for the buck in terms of helping the neediest. An across-the-board boost in Social Security benefits does not fare particularly well on this metric as a huge share of the new spending ends up going to households with average or above-average income and wealth levels. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"HVSLTN\"\u003eThe way Warren sees it, by contrast, is that the enormous run-up in inequality over the past 40 years creates a world in which economic resources are \u003cem\u003eplentiful — \u003c/em\u003ethey’ve just been captured by a small number of people at the very top. By taxing those people — and taxing them fairly heavily — you unlock the possibility of raising living standards for almost everyone. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"QECTBX\"\u003eUnder her social security plan, the poor do end up benefitting disproportionately in the sense that an extra $200 a month is a much bigger boost to those at the bottom of the income distribution than to those at the top. But fundamentally, it’s an effort to unify the interests of low-income people with those around the median and even with college-educated professionals in the 80th or 90th percentile — against the concentrated economic power of the very rich. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"qgsTMr\"\u003eThis is an idea you see reflected in the design of Warren’s Social Security plan, but also her approach to student debt relief, her interest in taxing billionaires’ accumulated wealth, and her fundamental conception of the structure of political conflict. What exactly that would mean for governance relative to the continuation of the Clinton-Obama approach would inevitably depend more on political circumstances than the details of campaign proposals. But it’s a striking difference in philosophies visible not just in the details of Social Security plans but in the basic view of what’s important in economic policy.\u003c/p\u003e","url":"https://www.vox.com/2019/9/12/20860672/elizabeth-warrens-social-security-expansion","published":"2019-09-12T12:00:00Z","guid":"https://www.vox.com/2019/9/12/20860672/elizabeth-warrens-social-security-expansion"}]},{"url":"https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml","items":[{"title":"Trump

The worldwide level of CO2 is currently averaging more than \u003ca href=\"https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-atmospheric-carbon-dioxide\"\u003e400 parts per million—\u003c/a\u003ethe highest amount by far in the last 800,000 years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Marra, a forest pathologist at the Experiment Station with a PhD in plant pathology from Cornell University, has documented from studying his fallen trees that internal decay has the capacity to significantly reduce the amount of carbon stored within.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis \u003ca href=\"http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aae2bf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eresearch\u003c/a\u003e, published in Environmental Research Letters late last year and funded by the National Science Foundation\u003cem\u003e,\u003c/em\u003e focused on a technique to see inside trees—a kind of scan known as tomography (the “T” in CAT scan.) This particular tomography was developed for use by arborists to detect decay in urban and suburban trees, mainly for safety purposes. Marra, however, may be the first to deploy it for measuring carbon content and loss associated with internal decay. Where there is decay there is less carbon, he explains, and where there is a cavity, there is no carbon at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What we’re suggesting is that internal decay in trees has just not been properly accounted for,” says Marra.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the first round of his research was a proof of concept that necessitated the destruction of 39 trees to show that tomography is accurate, his ultimate goal is a nondestructive technique to enable better assessments of carbon sequestration than those done annually by the \u003ca href=\"https://www.nrs.fs.fed.us/carbon/tools/#gtrnrs18\"\u003eUS Forest Service.\u003c/a\u003e Under the \u003ca href=\"http://bigpicture.unfccc.int/\"\u003eUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change\u003c/a\u003e, ratified in 1994, governments are required to report annual estimates of carbon holdings in all their managed lands. The most recent Forest Service figures show that US forests offset about 14% of the nation’s carbon emissions each year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Forest Service estimates that carbon makes up 48 to 50% of a tree’s biomass, so ones with decay will be less dense and therefore hold less carbon. But Marra contends that the visual signs monitored by the Forest Service, such as canopy and tree size, along with conspicuous problems such as lesions or cankers, don’t accurately reflect internal decay—a tree that looks healthy may have decay and one that appears problematic may be fine inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition, he says, foresters typically use a mallet to hammer a tree to register a sound that might indicate it’s hollow. “You know that there may be a hollow, but you don’t know how big the hollow is,” Marra says. As a result, he believes the government’s baseline data used to estimate carbon storage are not accurate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There are a lot of ways to improve our estimates of carbon being stored above ground in forests, and this decay component could certainly prove to be important,” says Andrew Reinmann, an ecologist and biogeochemist with the City University of New York’s Advanced Science Research Center. But, he added, “We haven’t really had the technology to explore this before—it’s still a little bit of an unknown.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=\"dropcap\"\u003eM\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"bolded\"\u003earra used\u003c/span\u003e a two-stage system for his research: sonic tomography, which sends sound waves through the tree, followed by electrical resistance tomography, which transmits an electric current. Both processes are necessary to fine-tune each other’s readings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe system, which costs about $25,000 and fits in a backpack, is cheap and small by scientific equipment standards. Each reading takes no more than a few minutes and computerized visual renderings of the results appear instantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarra experimented with three northern hardwoods—sugar maple, yellow birch, and American beech—and included more than two dozen of each, along with some control trees with no decay. The researchers analyzed the lower bole—the first two meters or so—of each tree, which is the oldest part and closest to the soil, where most decay-causing fungi would come from.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA dozen or so nails were tapped in a circle around the trunk and connected by cables to the tomograph; a sonic hammer then activated the system to get sound-wave measurements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the electric resistance tomography, a second set of nails was hammered between the first, and electrodes—plus and minus—were attached to each.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe various nail areas were painted in different colors to enable the computer renderings to be aligned later with photographs of the cookies after the trees were cut down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cookies, about 4 inches thick and which Marra called “the truth,” were only taken from where the measurements were made—the areas with the paint markings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe analyzed 105 cookies from the 39 trees taken down. In the 11 cases where tomography found no decay, the cookies revealed only one small cavity. In the 32 cases where incipient, or early, decay was detected, the cookies showed one additional cavity. The cookies confirmed the tomography results in 36 cases where active decay was found, though eight small cavities were also detected. Tomography correctly identified cavities in the remaining 26 cookies, meaning that it missed a total of 10 cavities among the 105 cookies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“One thing to sort of mitigate against this failure, if you want to call it that—these were very small cavities,” Marra says of the ones the tomography missed. “So they would have very little impact on a carbon budget.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen came the time-consuming process of measuring the actual amount of carbon in each tree. After air-drying the cookies for a year, the wood from 500 drilled holes was sent to a gas chromatography lab at the University of Massachusetts to determine the carbon levels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tomography and lab results were then combined to calculate how much carbon was stored in the lower boles and to contrast that with the levels if the trees had been solid wood. Those calculations took until 2017 to complete.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re looking at anywhere from a 195 to a 34% carbon loss” for an actively decaying tree among those studied, Marra says. “But any place there’s a cavity you’ve lost all of your carbon.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=\"dropcap\"\u003eT\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"bolded\"\u003ehe upshot\u003c/span\u003e of his five years of research, says Marra, is that accurate tomographic readings are possible in just a few minutes. “And what our tomography tells us is the carbon content,” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, Marra is aware that tomography is not a practical substitute for the Forest Service’s carbon estimate system—which itself is a clunky and labor-intensive slog. But it could provide a valuable way to augment those estimates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Those are very, very impressive results,’’ says Kevin Griffin, a tree physiologist at Columbia University and its Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. “They obviously have obtained a lot of precision in the techniques.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The results are important,” he adds, “but whether internal tree decay is the single most burning question? Probably not. There’s probably bigger fish to fry before we get there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmong them, he says are forest growth rates and overall tree health and age, as well as the impact of harvesting and other kinds of losses, including disease\u003cstrong\u003e.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tree’s architecture and height could also play large roles in carbon sequestration, says Reinmann of the City University of New York’s Advanced Science Research Center, as could the makeup of the forest landscape. His own research, for instance, found trees grow faster and have more biomass at the edge of fragmented forest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think they’re making a good point that we’re probably over-estimating” carbon storage levels, says Aaron Weiskittel, director of the University of Maine’s Center for Research on Sustainable Forests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven so, Weiskittel and others—including Marra—say the research needs to be scaled up to many more tree types and full forests. For his part, Marra would like to sample forests randomly with many more trees and controlling for factors including species, age, and soil characteristics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe goal, he says, is to develop a methodology for generating data to provide better carbon estimates for more than three tree types in one small part of the country.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We need to use tomography to refine models so we’re more accurately assessing the role that forests are playing as sequesterers or climate change mitigators,” Marra says. “We don’t want to be over-estimating the roles that they play.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis article was originally published on \u003ca href=\"https://undark.org\"\u003eUndark\u003c/a\u003e.

To begin with, it is made up entirely of musicians of Indian origin. Ms Jini says, “The Korean Orchestra is made up entirely of Koreans. The Chinese orchestra? Chinese musicians. If world over, the national orchestra has its own nationality why can’t the Indian orchestras?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ensemble ranging from age 15 to, well, 90, has the reputation of being a band of talented, devoted musicians, who travel long distances to arrive for rehearsals at Alexandra School from 7am until 8.30am, when school starts. Ms Jini beams as she says, “We invite guest conductors from Germany, England, Israel, Italy, Japan, Russia… They don’t charge to conduct the orchestra. They say, ‘This is something that doesn’t happen in any part of the world. How can young people be so interested?’”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"attachment_1706059\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"\u003e\u003cimg aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1706059\" class=\"wp-image-1706059 size-hero-m\" title=\"AYUSH PRASAD\" src=\"https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Pic-2.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;w=640\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"359\" srcset=\"https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Pic-2.jpg 1024w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Pic-2.jpg?resize=768,431 768w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Pic-2.jpg?resize=50,28 50w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Pic-2.jpg?resize=160,90 160w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Pic-2.jpg?resize=320,180 320w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Pic-2.jpg?resize=640,360 640w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Pic-2.jpg?resize=940,529 940w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /\u003e\u003cp id=\"caption-attachment-1706059\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"\u003eJini Dinshaw in action.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow can they be so interested? Earning a living can be challenging enough for a working musician who, like his predecessors, must play studio sessions, creating film or advertising scores. And it would be forgivable to imagine that our current cultural context has no room for Western classical music. Not only are most Western classical music performances crippled by a \u003ca href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/what-price-entertainment-after-july-1-heres-how-gst-will-impact-your-fun-time/articleshow/59288136.cms\"\u003elocal government tax\u003c/a\u003e of 25% (meant to counter the potential of Western classical undermining Indian music), the sparsely filled calendar must also contend with the popular belief that Western classical music is an elite pursuit. Associated traditionally with small, culturally exclusive communities like the Parsis and the Catholics, its reputation of having alien, often perplexing etiquette seems to carry the threat of audience members being outed as some sort of gauche bumpkin who clapped at the wrong moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut both musicians and attitudes have evolved keeping the legacy of Mumbai’s pluriculturalism steadfast. The orchestra is flexible and welcoming. Ms Jini says, “Our orchestra has played concertos with Indian instruments, played with sarod players, there is fusion, a dialogue between cultures.” Today, the BCO’s members mirror the city’s growing tribe of young musicians from diverse social, religious and economic backgrounds training in western classical music. Ms Jini taps out a list of music schools that have cropped up. Her only issue is that these schools are expensive and there is always the risk that once these young musicians grow up and get jobs, the music will be lost. Which is why the BCO trains musicians to play in an orchestra for free, for the love of music. No other school does that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"attachment_1706066\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"\u003e\u003cimg aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1706066\" class=\"size-hero-m wp-image-1706066\" src=\"https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/pic-3.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;w=640\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"853\" srcset=\"https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/pic-3.jpg 1600w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/pic-3.jpg?resize=768,1024 768w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/pic-3.jpg?resize=50,67 50w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/pic-3.jpg?resize=160,213 160w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/pic-3.jpg?resize=320,427 320w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/pic-3.jpg?resize=640,853 640w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/pic-3.jpg?resize=940,1253 940w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /\u003e\u003cp id=\"caption-attachment-1706066\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"\u003eJini Dinshaw: the gentle musician.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother challenge to accusations of being elite are BCO ticket prices. She says, “The \u003ca href=\"https://www.ncpamumbai.com/\"\u003eNational Centre for the Performing Arts\u003c/a\u003e (NCPA) charges in thousands.

Not just for people who go to ‘be seen’.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMs Jini adopts a slightly terse tone when mentioning the NCPA, a cultural centre in South Mumbai. Predating the centre, the BCO played there often, including at the inauguration of its Jamshed Bhabha Theatre and Tata Theatre. Today, dismissed as an amateur orchestra, they say they are no longer welcome to play there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt isn’t easy running a city orchestra. There have been times when BCO’s future has been clouded with uncertainty. Each time, Ms Jini has made sure it survived. Each time, a friend, a well-wisher, a patron, a secret benefactor has come forward – sending donations, musicians or a conductor. She has suffered a personal setback too. A stroke two years ago left Ms Jini with constant pain. Instead of leading the orchestra as she used to, she now plays the viola in the back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"attachment_1706072\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"\u003e\u003cimg aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1706072\" class=\"size-hero-m wp-image-1706072\" src=\"https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Pic-4.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;w=640\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" srcset=\"https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Pic-4.jpg 1024w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Pic-4.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Pic-4.jpg?resize=50,28 50w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Pic-4.jpg?resize=160,90 160w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Pic-4.jpg?resize=320,180 320w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Pic-4.jpg?resize=640,360 640w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Pic-4.jpg?resize=940,529 940w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /\u003e\u003cp id=\"caption-attachment-1706072\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"\u003eJini Dinshaw in action at a concert.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is 2019.

Which is unfortunately so lacking. After all god gave us music that we may pray without words. What is so evident is the lack of spiritual values in this world. This revulsion amongst different religions, communities, that exists, can be overcome with love of the arts. Let us dedicate ourselves to the true spirit of music.

But soon, that will be in direct contrast to its internet, which will be lightning-fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least that\u0026#8217;s what Guam-based telecommunications company GTA Teleguam is hoping. A new set of undersea internet cables will be laid both east and west of Guam over the next year or so. When it\u0026#8217;s done, not only will GTA be able to provide super-fast internet connections for Guam\u0026#8217;s 165,000 residents and businesses, but it may also speed up the digital connections between customers in Asia and data centers in the US.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe physical structure of the internet consists of \u003ca href=\"https://qz.com/657898/this-map-shows-the-explosive-growth-of-underwater-cables-the-power-the-global-internet/\"\u003ehundreds of undersea fiber-optic cables\u003c/a\u003e that crisscross the globe. As more people come online and do things that require lots of bandwidth, like stream movies and music, the world needs more cables to handle that demand. Because many of \u003ca href=\"https://blog.telegeography.com/where-are-the-worlds-cloud-data-centers-and-who-is-using-them\"\u003ethe data centers\u003c/a\u003e for many of the world\u0026#8217;s most popular sites and services are in the US, the cables between Asia (where a large portion of the internet\u0026#8217;s users are) and the US are particularly important.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInternet users found out just how important those undersea connections were in 2011, when a magnitude 9.0 earthquake off the coast of Japan—the same one that caused the accident at the Fukushima nuclear power plant—\u003ca href=\"https://www.submarinenetworks.com/news/cables-cut-after-magnitude-89-earthquake-in-japan\"\u003ecut multiple undersea cables\u003c/a\u003e that comprised the primary link between the US and Asia. The cables were painstakingly fixed over the course of several months, but \u0026#8220;that forced people to think about an alternate location [for new cables],\u0026#8221; Roland Certeza, GTA\u0026#8217;s CEO told Quartz.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGuam quickly came up as a natural alternative, Certeza says. There were already a few cables that connected the west coast of the US to Guam (via Hawaii), then on to the Philippines and Hong Kong. But as more cables were installed, it made sense to put them in other locations that could provide an alternative should natural disasters strike again in the Pacific Rim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCables that pass through Guam provide this optionality, ensuring that the connection between the US and Asia is never severed completely. But Certeza sees a few other advantages to having the global internet cables connect through Guam (instead of, say, bypassing it to stay on the ocean floor). The island provides a good stopping point where the cables, which require electricity to transfer data, can be powered up. And because Guam is a US territory, it\u0026#8217;s attractive to American businesses that might want to take advantage of its proximity to Asia and forthcoming fast internet speeds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGTA is one of the largest internet service providers (ISPs) on the island, after the Guam government privatized the company in 2005. Since then, it\u0026#8217;s more than doubled its profits, from $47 million in 2004 to $103 million in 2018, according to data shared with Quartz.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut GTA\u0026#8217;s customers don\u0026#8217;t just include residents and local businesses. The 210-square-mile island of Guam, a US protectorate, is also home to \u003ca href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/2018/12/guam-endangered-species-ecology-threatened-us-military-base-expansion/\"\u003etwo US military bases\u003c/a\u003e—a marine base and a navy base—and soon will be home to a marine base. To transmit all the data that the US military needs from Guam to, say, the Pentagon in Virginia, as well as to other military bases around the world, GTA (among the other ISPs that the military uses) needs to be able to provide more bandwidth than the island\u0026#8217;s population might suggest it would.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo GTA, in \u003ca href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/gta-and-rti-are-constructing-guams-first-neutral-cable-landing-station-and-data-center-300874340.html\"\u003epartnership with San Francisco-based cable owner RTI\u003c/a\u003e, invested in new cables.

Certeza says GTA wants to make Guam a destination for US-based tech companies to build their data centers.

As two scientists who have spent our careers studying AI, we can tell you that a large fraction of what’s reported is overhyped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConsider this pair of headlines from last year describing an alleged breakthrough in machine reading: “\u003ca href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/robots-can-now-read-better-humans-putting-millions-jobs-risk-781393\"\u003eRobots Can Now Read Better than Humans, Putting Millions of Jobs at Risk\u003c/a\u003e” and “\u003ca href=\"https://money.cnn.com/2018/01/15/technology/reading-robot-alibaba-microsoft-stanford/index.html\"\u003eComputers Are Getting Better than Humans at Reading\u003c/a\u003e.” The first, from Newsweek, is a more egregious exaggeration than the second, from CNN, but both wildly oversell minor progress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo begin with, there were no actual robots involved, and no actual jobs were remotely at risk. All that really happened was that Microsoft made a tiny bit of progress and put out a press release saying that “AI\u0026#8230;can read a document and answer questions about it as well as a person.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat sounded much more revolutionary than it really was. Dig deeper, and you would discover that the AI in question was given one of the \u003cem\u003eeasiest\u003c/em\u003e reading tests you could imagine—one in which \u003cem\u003eall\u003c/em\u003e of the answers were directly spelled out in the text. The test was about highlighting relevant words, not comprehending text.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuppose, for example, that I hand you a piece of paper with this short passage:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eTwo children, Chloe and Alexander, went for a walk. They both saw a dog and a tree. Alexander also saw a cat and pointed it out to Chloe. She went to pet the cat.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Microsoft system was built to answer questions like “Who went for a walk?” in which the answer (“Chloe and Alexander”) is directly spelled out in the text. But if you were to ask it a simple question like “Did Chloe see the cat?” (which she must have, because she went to pet it) or “Was Chloe frightened by the cat?” (which she must not have been, because she went to pet it), it would not have been able to find the answers, as they weren’t spelled out in the text. Inferring what isn’t said is at the heart of reading, and it simply wasn’t tested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMicrosoft didn’t make that clear, and neither did Newsweek or CNN.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePractically every time one of the tech titans puts out a press release, we get a reprise of this same phenomenon: minor progress portrayed as revolution. In another example, two years ago Facebook created a proof-of-concept AI program that could read a five-line summary of \u003cem\u003eThe Lord of the Rings\u003c/em\u003e and answer questions about where people and things ended up. (“Where was the Ring? At Mount Doom.”) The result was a slew of ridiculously over-enthusiastic articles, explaining how reading fantasy literature was the key to getting AI’s to read, with headlines like Slate’s “\u003ca href=\"https://slate.com/technology/2016/06/facebooks-a-i-researchers-are-making-bots-smarter-by-giving-them-memory.html\"\u003eFacebook Thinks It Has Found the Secret to Making Bots Less Dumb\u003c/a\u003e.” (They didn’t.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe consequence of this kind of over-reporting in the media? The public has come to believe that AI is much closer to being solved than it really is. So whenever you hear about a supposed success in AI, here’s a list of six questions you should ask:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStripping away the rhetoric, what did the AI system actually do here? (Does a “reading system” really read, or does it just highlight relevant bits of text?)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHow general is the result? (For example, does an alleged reading task measure all aspects of reading, or just a tiny slice of it? If it was trained on fiction, can it read the news?)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIs there a demo where I can try out my own examples? (If you can’t, you should be worried about how robust the results are.)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIf the researchers—or their press people—allege that an AI system is better than humans, then which humans, and how much better? (Was the comparison with college professors, who read for a living, or \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2018/01/amazon-mechanical-turk/551192/\"\u003ebored Amazon Mechanical Turk workers\u003c/a\u003e getting paid a penny a sentence?)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHow far does succeeding at the particular task actually take us toward building genuine AI? (Is it an academic exercise, or something that could be used in the real world?)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHow robust is the system? Could it work just as well with other data sets, without massive amounts of retraining? (For example, would a driverless car system that was trained during the day be able to drive at night, or in the snow, or if there was a detour sign not listed on its map?)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAI really is coming, eventually, but it is further away than most people think. To get a realistic picture, take everything you read about dramatic progress in AI with a healthy dose  of skepticism—and rejoice in your (for now) uniquely human ability to do so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis essay is adapted from\u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://rebooting.ai/\"\u003e Rebooting AI\u003c/a\u003e,\u003cem\u003e published this month by Pantheon.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://qz.com/1706248/six-questions-to-ask-yourself-when-reading-about-ai/","published":"2019-09-12T12:00:38Z","guid":"https://qz.com/1706248/auto-draft/"},{"title":"StarKist is on the hook for $100 million in tuna price fixing scheme","content":"\u003cimg width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/StarKist.jpeg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;w=1024\" class=\"attachment-medium_10 size-medium_10 wp-post-image\" alt=\"Tuna swimming.\" srcset=\"https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/StarKist.jpeg 4611w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/StarKist.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/StarKist.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/StarKist.jpeg?resize=160,90 160w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/StarKist.jpeg?resize=320,180 320w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/StarKist.jpeg?resize=640,360 640w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/StarKist.jpeg?resize=940,529 940w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/StarKist.jpeg?resize=1600,900 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 1961, the tuna processor StarKist created a cartoon character for its ads, a hip, beret-wearing, bespectacled fish who thought he was a perfect fit for the company\u0026#8217;s cans but was consistently rejected with a note lowered into the ocean on a hook saying, \u0026#8220;Sorry Charlie!\u0026#8221; Now it\u0026#8217;s StarKist that\u0026#8217;s on the hook.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"attachment_1707780\" style=\"width: 423px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"\u003e\u003cimg aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1707780\" class=\"size-hero-m wp-image-1707780\" src=\"https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-11-at-10.26.25-PM.png?w=413\" alt=\"\" width=\"413\" height=\"360\" srcset=\"https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-11-at-10.26.25-PM.png 413w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-11-at-10.26.25-PM.png?resize=50,44 50w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-11-at-10.26.25-PM.png?resize=160,139 160w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-11-at-10.26.25-PM.png?resize=320,279 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 413px) 100vw, 413px\" /\u003e\u003cp id=\"caption-attachment-1707780\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"\u003e\u003c!-- caption placeholder --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn Sept. 11, federal judge Edward Chen of California\u0026#8217;s Northern District fined StarKist the statutory maximum of $100 million for its role in a price fixing conspiracy.

From 2021 on, it will owe $21 million each year for four years. StarKist attorneys argued previously that the company could not afford the statutory maximum in light of other suits they face and likely civil penalties that will arise, asking to pay only $50 million. But at sentencing the San Francisco District Court judge appeared unmoved by the pleas for leniency, saying his review of the assets showed the company could make the penalty payments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlong with \u003ca href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/starkist-ordered-to-pay-100-million-fine-in-tuna-price-fixing-case-11568233353\"\u003ecompetitor fish processors\u003c/a\u003e Bumble Bee Foods and Chicken of the Sea, StarKist representatives between 2011 and 2013 discussed keeping prices high and raising consumer costs as demand for canned tuna was falling. The scheme came to light when Chicken of the Sea\u0026#8217;s attempt to buy Bumble Bee failed in 2015. Chicken of the Sea acted as a whistleblower, alerting federal regulators to the conspiracy—its witnesses told federal prosecutors that StarKist, with the largest market share, was essential to the success of the illegal scheme.

Simultaneously, when promoting someone to the role of CEO or hiring in a replacement from outside, board experience mattered to the board committee doing the hiring. Because most board members were male, most CEOs were male, and vice versa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut new research \u003ca href=\"https://hbr.org/2019/07/research-board-experience-is-helping-more-women-get-ceo-jobs\"\u003epublished in the Harvard Business Review\u003c/a\u003e suggests the pattern is changing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNamely, more women without CEO experience \u003ca href=\"https://qz.com/work/1340544/the-fortune-500-appointed-a-record-percentage-of-women-to-boards-in-2017/\"\u003eare being invited\u003c/a\u003e onto boards—likely due in part to \u003ca href=\"https://qz.com/work/1704313/who-is-weworks-first-female-board-member-frances-frei/\"\u003epublic pressure\u003c/a\u003e that big companies no longer be steered by men alone. In turn, this soon could help increase the still-thin ranks for female CEOs, as companies are increasingly using board experience as a proxy for an executives\u0026#8217; readiness to lead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAcademics from Georgetown University studied the 3,000 largest publicly traded US companies, identifying 140 female CEOs (about 4.6% of all the company chiefs). They eliminated founders as well as women who had inherited a family business, and randomly selected 100 of the remainder. They then paired those women with male CEOs of comparable companies, and studied both groups, looking at previous job roles and board experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe data showed two particular differences. When companies hired outsiders into the role of CEO, as opposed to promoting someone internally, the women who got hired were much less likely than the men to have previously served as the CEO of a public or private company: Half the men hired in had done so, compared to only 18% of the women. But women CEOs were much more likely to have had previous board experience. Almost 60% of the women who took over the CEO role at a public company had prior public company board experience, compared to 42% of the men. More than 20% of them had been on the board of a private company, compared to 12% of men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis doesn\u0026#8217;t prove that board experience was the reason the women were hired as CEOs. But the researchers think there\u0026#8217;s a strong case for correlation. \u0026#8220;First, as board members these women get into the executive network, thus when companies are looking to create a candidate pool for an outside CEO appointment, these women\u0026#8217;s names are more likely to be surfaced than if they had not been part of the board network,\u0026#8221; Catherine H. Tinsley, a management professor at Georgetown’s McDonough School of Business, tells Quartz. \u0026#8220;Second, board service gives these women opportunities to show their skills and leadership abilities to people outside their own firm.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe potential correlation could provide a steer both for women who are keen to lead companies, and companies wanting to help them graduate to the highest positions. Women themselves can actively seek board appointments, and a number of networks now exist to make this process smoother, like \u003ca href=\"https://www.womenonboards.net/en-au/home\"\u003eWomen on Boards\u003c/a\u003e, which \u003ca href=\"https://qz.com/work/1541458/australia-is-getting-close-to-30-women-on-company-boards/\"\u003ehelps match women\u003c/a\u003e in the UK and Australia with open board positions. Meanwhile, companies, the researchers note, can institute programs that help their female executives gain experience elsewhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe research, conducted by Tinsley with Kate Purmal, a senior industry fellow at the Georgetown University Women\u0026#8217;s Leadership Institute, comes at an interesting time for board composition. Europe has seen a concerted push for women to be better represented on boards: In the UK, \u003ca href=\"https://30percentclub.org/\"\u003ethe 30% Club\u003c/a\u003e, founded in 2010, pushes for 30% of board members to be female and has seen a significant shift in that direction. (As of September, female representation on FTSE 100 boards had reached 29.6%, according to the campaign\u0026#8217;s latest figures.) Some places have \u003ca href=\"https://qz.com/work/1408819/california-is-the-first-us-state-to-mandate-a-board-quota-for-women/\"\u003ebrought in quotas\u003c/a\u003e (see Norway and the state of California) while other advocates—the 30% Club included—push for more organic, company-led change as a more sustainable alternative.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the US, where 24% of board directors are women, companies that fail to diversify their boards are increasingly under scrutiny. Most recently WeWork, criticized for its all-male board ahead of its initial public offering, promised to \u003ca href=\"https://qz.com/work/1704313/who-is-weworks-first-female-board-member-frances-frei/\"\u003eappoint Harvard Business School professor Frances Frei\u003c/a\u003e to its board.

Obviously, that's not the case.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe truth about cannabis potency now and then is more complicated. Despite the political aims of the people hyping it, far from being a case for continued prohibition, stronger cannabis makes a far more potent argument for the drug's legalization and regulation. That's especially so at a time when THC, the primary psychoactive ingredient in weed, is being consumed in ways that—at least in the case of \u003ca href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_in/article/vb5v5a/what-we-know-about-the-vaping-chemicals-that-might-be-making-people-sick\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ecertain e-cigarettes or vapes\u003c/a\u003e—may be linked to dangerous lung problems.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOf course, any argument that weed has become more potent (and, by implication, more dangerous) assumes we actually know how strong it was in decades past. But most of the hard numbers on changes in cannabis potency come from the government's \u003ca href=\"https://pharmacy.olemiss.edu/marijuana/potency-monitoring-program/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePotency Monitoring Program\u003c/a\u003e, which has been run by the University of Mississippi since 1971 and is the only major lab focused on studying how it has changed historically. Their data relies on samples seized by law enforcement, which introduces variables that make accurate comparison over time—particularly in the early years—difficult. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFor one, the researchers only had access to about 150-200 samples per year in the early 1970s. With so few samples, the data could be based on unrepresentative ditchweed—not what most people were actually smoking.

Indeed, it is legal now to sell \u003ca href=\"https://nifa.usda.gov/industrial-hemp\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehemp\u003c/a\u003e that contains just a tad less—.3 percent—because it is so difficult to get high on something with so little punch. Clearly, there was some sort of error.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMahmoud ElSohly, a professor of pharmaceutics at the University of Mississippi and director of the school's Marijuana Project—which oversees the Potency Monitoring Program—noted another problem that makes the old data less reliable. Before he took charge in 1981, the DEA often didn’t provide samples in a timely fashion, he said. \"The samples were not sent to us until after the cases were disposed of legally,\" ElSohly explained, meaning they were often a few years old.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSince potency decays by roughly 10 percent per year, according to ElSohly, this means that those samples didn't really represent the real strength of the drug at the time that people actually bought and consumed it. \"The data you want to hang your hat on would start from 1981,\" he added. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAll of which is to say that any statements about \"your father's weed\" from the 1960s or 70s aren't likely based on reliable data.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn later years, ElSohly continued, the Project began to receive 2,000 to 4,000 samples, which are much more likely to represent a reasonable survey of what's present in a national market. The more recent data does show a clear rise—from around 4 percent THC in 1995 to around 16 percent in 2018, according to ElSohly. However, since 2014, the number of samples tested has declined again, due to both funding issues and the DEA's decreased focus on seizing a drug that is legal in many states, he noted.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eRising potency in and of itself isn't necessarily a problem, so long as people are aware of it. Just as the vast majority of people would never drink a giant beer glass full of whiskey or even wine the way they'd consume a shot of the hard stuff (you could actually \u003ca href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/exm7y4/how-much-can-you-drink-before-it-will-kill-you-991\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eoverdose\u003c/a\u003e), those who use other drugs tend to titrate—or modulate based on the intensity of the substance—their consumption. This means that with stronger drugs, people tend to consume less in order to get exactly as high as they prefer.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFascinatingly, the government actually \u003ca href=\"http://www.monitoringthefuture.org/pubs/monographs/mtf-vol1_2018.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"\u003etracks\u003c/a\u003e how high people say they get from taking drugs. If titration weren't occurring, this data should show a rise that corresponds with the true increase of potency over time. But, in reality, pot smokers titrate: while there was an upward trend for some years in the 1990s, the proportion of high school seniors who blazed and said they got \"very high\" when they smoked pot is virtually the same as it was in 1975. The number for 1975 was 25.5 percent; for 2018, it was 25.4.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eA somewhat concerning change, however, has occurred in terms of the chemical content of weed. While THC produces the sensation of being high, another substance, CBD, can modulate its effect. CBD has been found to \u003ca href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3797438/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ereduce\u003c/a\u003e the negative effects of THC, particularly in terms of its ability to produce paranoia and psychotic experiences—so much so that researchers have looked at CBD as a \u003ca href=\"http://healthland.time.com/2012/05/30/marijuana-compound-treats-schizophrenia-with-few-side-effects-clinical-trial/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003epotential\u003c/a\u003e antipsychotic medication with far fewer side effects than current drugs. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBut between 1995 and 2014, the THC:CBD ratio went in the wrong direction, ElSohly and his colleagues \u003ca href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4987131/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003efound\u003c/a\u003e.

Last month,\u003ci\u003e The Daily Mail\u003c/i\u003e published exclusive photos of Prince Andrew answering the door at Epstein’s former Upper East Side mega-mansion in 2010. And over the weekend, \u003ci\u003e The Sun\u003c/i\u003e reported that Epstein attended the 18th birthday party of Prince Andrew’s daughter Princess Beatrice in 2006, just days before Epstein was arrested on child-prostitution charges. To make matters even more complicated for the royal family, multiple outlets have reported that Prince Andrew hosted Epstein at royal residences like Windsor Castle more than once—he even \u003ca href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-49411215\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethrew a surprise birthday party\u003c/a\u003e for Epstein’s alleged madam, Ghislaine Maxwell, at Sandringham in 2000. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn short: Things are rough for Prince Andrew right now.

Days later, following the release of the video footage of him with Epstein in 2010, Buckingham Palace \u003ca href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-49390871\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ereleased a statement\u003c/a\u003e on the duke’s behalf. \"The Duke of York has been appalled by the recent reports of Jeffrey Epstein's alleged crimes,” it read. \"His Royal Highness deplores the exploitation of any human being and the suggestion he would condone, participate in or encourage any such behaviour is abhorrent.\" Only a few more days after that, the Prince would release \u003ci\u003eanother\u003c/i\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2019/08/24/uk/prince-andrew-epstein-statement-epstein-intl-gbr-scli/index.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003estatement\u003c/a\u003e about the matter, claiming that he saw Epstein “infrequently” over the last twenty years—despite being a guest at “a number” of his private residences—and that he was unaware of Epstein’s criminal behavior.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThen, Prince Andrew’s ex-wife Sarah Ferguson (herself the \u003ca href=\"https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-life/royals/the-highs-and-lows-of-sarah-ferguson/news-story/63e1ddeb90c5969c2bb49b9ea4e2d242\" target=\"_blank\"\u003esubject of multiple scandals\u003c/a\u003e over the years) came to his defense.

As they clash with Balamb Garden, Squall enters the rival school to confront the sorceress, but not before—wait for it—seeing some really weird shit.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e Like, say, a walkable ice rink that may lead to random encounters with hockey players! But nothing in this game is what it appears to be. They’re monsters called Slappers, and they are a real hockey team using skate formations to attack your party. “Stick, Formation M! Go!!!” and “We have heart! Go Galbadia!” are two of my favorites.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e Elsewhere in the lobby, a three-headed dog aptly named Cerberus appears as an optional boss battle. He offers his services to you as a Guardian Force upon defeat, but there’s no explanation as to why this terrifying, drooling creature is hanging out by the entrance. Cerberus is just straight up chilling in the lobby. Students and faculty walking around like nothing’s wrong. After taming the three-headed GF, the last task is to go fight the headmaster’s wife in a lecture hall.

His dedication to Rinoa defies the ordinary. True love is chasing down your possessed girlfriend in a space station. Real romance is accepting your partner after she unsealed a war criminal sorceress from a cryogenic tomb. Oh yes. Of course they go to outer space.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e The reason they go to space is—unsurprisingly—complicated. Squall is taking a comatose Rinoa to the Lunar Base Space Station (please say that aloud quickly) in hopes that Ellone, his estranged, unofficial sister who can send people’s consciousnesses back in time, can help Rinoa.

It’s totally OK that she helped unleash a geyser of moon monsters onto her home planet. The happy couple looks over their shoulders and find an abandoned spaceship in perfect condition. They share a romantic moment after wiping out the alien couples inhabiting the ship, and piloted the ship home. It’s called the Ragnarok, shaped like a red dragon and plays chipper music.

Obviously.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e When Squall and his friends travel to Ultimecia’s time, they tumble through past, present, and future to get to her castle. From there, an elaborate and violent game of \u003ci\u003e Home Alone \u003c/i\u003eensues. Booby traps and powerful monsters lurk in every corner of this woman’s Baroque-themed house.

Trying to assassinate a sorceress during a parade, thwarting and surviving a missile attack, fighting a monster living in the school basement, launching into outer space. There’s almost no time for anyone to notice how weird all the little details are. There are flashy battles, dramatic CGI sequences, and so much humor—intentional and not—that it makes the game’s quiet moments hit so much harder. By the time the game comes to a close, everyone’s been through \u003ci\u003e so much\u003c/i\u003e.

Their patients can\u0026rsquo;t speak or tell them what\u0026rsquo;s wrong, much like babies can\u0026rsquo;t communicate with their doctors. But unlike pediatricians, veterinarians frequently find themselves having to euthanize a patient with a treatable injury or illness because its caretaker can\u0026rsquo;t afford the remedy, which might include costly surgeries. \u0026ldquo;You can say you\u0026rsquo;re going to be stoic and put it out of your mind and say it\u0026#8217;s part of being a veterinarian,\u0026rdquo; says McCauley, an animal lover who has a dog and a cat in addition to his pig, \u0026ldquo;but the reality is over time, that weighs on you.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=\"pullquote\"\u003e\u0026#8220;It\u0026#8217;s not all puppies and kittens and wonderful experiences.

She quit the field most recently in 2013 and returned in 2015. \u0026ldquo;We go through veterinary school with the idea that we\u0026rsquo;re going to save lives,\u0026rdquo; McArthur says. \u0026ldquo;To have to turn around and push a plunger is difficult.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother soul-crushing aspect of the job that most other health professionals don\u0026rsquo;t have to deal with, veterinarians say, is constantly being asked to perform services or give out medications for free and then being cyberbullied or harassed if they don\u0026rsquo;t. In 2018, Americans spent more than $72 billion on their pets, and more than $18 billion was for vet care, according to the American Pet Products Association (APPA), a trade group. While some pet insurance plans may ease sudden expenses, only a small portion of pet owners opt to buy it. Pets live in nearly 85 million homes in the U.S., but only 2 million pets were insured in 2018, industry figures show. McCauley says he\u0026rsquo;d be asked to waive vet fees at least once a day. \u0026ldquo;When you\u0026rsquo;re not able to offer those free services and medications, you turn into the bad guy. They go online and they make you into the devil because you didn\u0026rsquo;t treat their cat for free,\u0026rdquo; he says. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s a horrible position that veterinarians are put in.\u0026rdquo; A 2014 \u003ca href=\"https://www.avma.org/News/JAVMANews/Pages/150915o.aspx\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003esurvey\u003c/a\u003e by the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) found one in five veterinarians were either cyberbullied by pet owners, who would write nasty reviews online or threaten their business, or knew a colleague who had been. \u0026ldquo;We have this tremendous fear that the mob is going to come after us online,\u0026rdquo; McArthur says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are also financial struggles, particularly for young people entering the field. Veterinary students in the U.S. graduated in 2018 with an average of $150,000 in debt, according to the AVMA. Yet data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows the median annual wage for veterinarians in 2018 was $93,830, and starting salaries are significantly much lower. When Dr. Molly McAllister, 43, of Portland, Oregon, first entered the field in 2004, she took a veterinarian job for $22,000 a year with $90,000 in debt from just veterinary school. \u0026ldquo;I was really well-educated on how to take care of animals. I was not well-educated on how to take care of myself,\u0026rdquo; she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile there is never a single cause of suicide, the myriad of risk factors can add up. A \u003ca href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6405a6.htm\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003esurvey\u003c/a\u003e of more than 11,000 U.S. veterinarians in 2014 found 9% had current serious psychological distress, 31% had experienced depressive episodes, and 17% had experienced suicidal ideation since leaving veterinary school. The data suggests nearly one in 10 U.S. veterinarians might suffer from serious psychological distress, yet only half are seeking help, says Dr. Jen Brandt, the AVMA\u0026rsquo;s director of wellbeing and diversity initiatives. Now, industry leaders are trying to change that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn Thursday, during National Suicide Prevention Week, Banfield Pet Hospital, one of the nation\u0026rsquo;s largest employers of veterinary professionals, announced a new training and awareness program for its more than 17,000 workers as well as a plan to close more than 1,000 of its clinics nationwide for a two-hour workshop to discuss mental health by early next year. As part of the training, Banfield is launching a 30-minute online course that teaches employees how to recognize warning signs of suicide among colleagues and the best ways to help them. The training course, which begins with a self assessment, will be available free online for anyone in the veterinary industry by Jan. 6, 2020.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa Stewart-Brown, a clinical social worker who developed the training, says she hopes the widespread discussions will help break the stigma associated with talking about mental health and offer at least one solution to a complex and multifaceted problem. \u0026ldquo;If we can teach people what it looks like when someone is in emotional distress, and we can teach them how to break through and connect with that person emotionally and compassionately and lead them to professional help, I know we will help,\u0026rdquo; she says. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s not all puppies and kittens and wonderful experiences. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of pain involved.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBanfield\u0026rsquo;s program is one of many being designed for struggling veterinarians and being implemented across veterinary hospitals, schools and communities nationwide. The AVMA also offers a similar free one-hour online training course that helps veterinarians identify and refer at-risk colleagues. Tens of thousands of veterinarians have also found solace in Facebook support groups. In 2014, McArthur, the California vet who struggled with euthanasia, founded \u003ca href=\"https://www.nomv.org\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eNot One More Vet\u003c/a\u003e, an online veterinary support group, days after the suicide of Sophia Yin, a popular and pioneering veterinarian who specialized in animal behaviors.

Our approach, rather, is to encourage companies with a large carbon footprint to adopt a more sustainable business model. I believe long-term investors have a duty to support corporate leadership that is embarking on a low-carbon transition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA better way for us to deal with climate change is to integrate environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues throughout our whole investment process.

Last year, we selected two climate-focused benchmark indices that incorporate two key elements: They seek out companies with high carbon efficiency within an industry. They also highly value companies that proactively disclose climate information. We don\u0026rsquo;t divest; we rebalance and engage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe recently began using ESG factors in making decisions for our bond portfolio as well.

If it can meet its vast potential for emission reduction, it will play an enormous role in tackling global climate change. The signs have been good. After suffering severe smog in 2011, the product of years of rising coal consumption, the Chinese government initiated a massive national action plan: halting the growth of coal consumption, improving air quality and helping the country limit emissions overall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, the economic slowdown and worsening trade war are risking a relapse. Some smog-stricken regions in China were found to have relaxed tight controls on polluting industries such as steel and cement in the second half of 2018, contributing to a rebound of smog last winter. The carbon market, the government\u0026rsquo;s primary climate-action plan, has been significantly downsized while coal consumption picked up again last year.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo what can China do now to stem emissions and remain a leader in the fight against climate change, while also maintaining socioeconomic development? Tap into the power of the market, from the bottom up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the world\u0026rsquo;s manufacturing hub, China is in a unique position to change the course of global emissions. In most industrial sectors, 75% of greenhouse-gas emissions are produced from the supply chains. In a globalized world, this means China\u0026rsquo;s emissions are generated to meet more than just its own rising demand. Research conducted by the Carbon Trust found that China is the world\u0026rsquo;s largest emitter in the apparel sector, but 72% of those emissions are essentially the responsibility of companies overseas where the products are exported and sold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eResponsibility for this division between manufacturing and products comes down to the private sector. In 2018, we at the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs (IPE) examined the climate actions of 118 IT and textile-industry brands sourcing from China to rank them by how green their supply-chain practices are. Apple and Nike tied for first place, and Chinese brands Lenovo and Huawei reached the top 30, but most brands did not take supply-chain carbon footprints into consideration. Barely any set supply-chain emission-reduction targets. Consequently, most of the top global brands may not be able to meet their climate commitments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThankfully, things are already changing. As China has expanded environmental transparency, some 70 multinational and local brands have applied the monitoring data compiled by IPE to motivate more than 8,000 suppliers to address regulatory violations. The country\u0026rsquo;s commitment to environmental transparency can incentivize companies to mitigate supply-chain emissions. Open carbon data not only enables businesses to set effective targets but also permits the public and investors to identify which are using best practices and which are racking up regulatory violations. To hold companies accountable, the state must also instigate high penalties for failing to disclose or falsifying this information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut those leading brands demonstrating responsible oversight of their supply chains show that the private sector can make significant contributions, even without those systems in place. As climate change worsens, government and businesses will need to work in tandem to break the global community out of its \u0026ldquo;business as usual\u0026rdquo; mind-set.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr /\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is one article in a series on the state of the planet\u0026rsquo;s response to climate change. \u003ca href=\"https://time.com/climate-change-solutions\" \u003eRead the rest of the stories\u003c/a\u003e and sign up for \u003ca href=\"https://cloud.newsletters.time.com/newsletters/?newsletter_name=climate\u0026amp;source=article-climate-footer\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eOne.Five, TIME\u0026#8217;s climate change newsletter.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/time/topstories/~4/h8CMM5XbiKg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/h8CMM5XbiKg/","published":"2019-09-12T11:16:25Z","guid":"http://time.com/?p=5669061"},{"title":"The Tech Innovations We Need to Happen if We’re Going to Survive Climate Change","content":"\u003caside class=\"right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad\" id=\"right-rail__ad-5669039\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module\" data-src=\"https://time.com/5669039/technology-fight-climate-change/\" data-widget-id=\"SB_2\" data-ob-template=\"timemag\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"inline-portrait_small_2x alignnone \"\u003e\u003cimg data-attachment-id=\"5675169\" data-permalink=\"https://time.com/5669039/technology-fight-climate-change/print-108/\" data-orig-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/blum.fc_.300.jpg?quality=85\" data-orig-size=\"2000,2554\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1568186644\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"Print\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Blum Illustration\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/blum.fc_.300.jpg?quality=85\u0026w=235\" data-large-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/blum.fc_.300.jpg?quality=85\u0026w=470\" src=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/blum.fc_.300.jpg?w=560\u0026#038;quality=85\u0026#038;h=715\" alt=\"\" height=\"715\"\u003e\n\u003cfigcaption class=\"image-caption\" \u003e\u003cspan class=\"credit\" \u003eHarry Campbell for TIME\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the 1970s, the U.S. Department of Energy poured money into making practical a miraculous technology: the ability to convert sunlight into electricity. Solar energy was a pipe dream, far too expensive and unreliable to be considered a practical power source. But yesterday\u0026rsquo;s moon shot is today\u0026rsquo;s reality. The expense of solar power has fallen more quickly than expected, with installations costing about 80% less today than a decade ago. Alternative energy (like wind and solar) is now often cheaper than conventional energy (like coal and gas). Last year, California generated 19% of its electricity from solar power, up from less than 1% just 10 years earlier. That growth is global. Solar-energy production worldwide has increased nearly 2,000% since 2009, but the U.S. is far from the leader. Of approximately 100 gigawatts of solar generation added in 2018, China accounted for 44 and the U.S. 11.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEliminating the carbon emitted in the production of electricity is a crucial step toward keeping the world from heating to dire levels. It is also among the most straightforward, largely thanks to the innovations of the past few decades, which were driven by a combination of ingenuity, research funding and policy incentives. Innovation is not enough to avert the worst consequences of climate change, but there are solutions at hand that are commonplace and cost-effective. We desperately need more.

Together, the two technologies have helped renewables leap from 9% of the U.S.\u0026rsquo;s electricity generation in 2008 to about 17% in 2018. Ongoing research and development is leading to continuous gains in how much power they produce. Wind operators are using artificial intelligence and improved weather forecasts to position their turbines for better performance, while solar-panel manufacturers are refining the use of new materials and processes to generate more electricity from smaller panels and drive down costs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"inline-portrait_small_2x alignnone \"\u003e\u003cimg data-attachment-id=\"5672633\" data-permalink=\"https://time.com/5669039/technology-fight-climate-change/federal-reserve-beige-book/\" data-orig-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/climate-change-technology-solar.jpg?quality=85\" data-orig-size=\"2400,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5.6\",\"credit\":\"Richard Vogel\",\"camera\":\"X-T3\",\"caption\":\"In this Aug. 8, 2019 photo a worker helps to install solar panels onto a roof at the Van Nuys Airport in the Van Nuys section of Los Angeles.

Around the world, France, Sweden, Norway, Portugal and the U.K., among others, have set similar goals. Achieving that with solar and wind power alone is tricky because of their \u0026ldquo;intermittency\u0026rdquo;\u0026mdash;the times when the sun doesn\u0026rsquo;t shine and the wind doesn\u0026rsquo;t blow. One solution is to improve the ability to move energy from where it\u0026rsquo;s produced to where it\u0026rsquo;s consumed by building new power lines, known as interconnectors, that can move energy across long distances between regional power grids. Another is to store excess energy for later use, using batteries. Lithium-ion cells\u0026mdash;used in mobile phones and electric cars\u0026mdash;are the best energy-storage technology we have right now, and their use both in homes and alongside power plants is expected to grow storage capacity tenfold by 2024. While the current storage technology works best for less than four hours, engineers are developing novel alternatives that can store energy for longer periods of time. A startup in Switzerland called Energy Vault uses surplus electricity gathered on windy days to stack large bricks into towers with automated cranes, then recaptures the kinetic energy generated when the bricks fall back to the ground. Other companies are storing electrical energy as heat in molten salt or pumping water into reservoirs for later use as hydropower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eNext-Generation Nuclear\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNuclear reactors have been providing zero-carbon power since the 1950s, and today supply 20% of the U.S.\u0026rsquo;s electricity and 11% of the globe\u0026rsquo;s. But safety and environmental concerns have increased the cost and complexity of nuclear power plants, and their construction has all but stopped in the U.S. (Only one new reactor has come online this century.) One strategy for reinvigorating the industry is to focus on smaller, simpler reactors that can be constructed in factories, produce less radioactive waste and require less day-to-day management. (Some will be designed to shut down automatically in case of disaster.) TerraPower, a Bellevue, Wash.\u0026ndash;based startup with backing from Bill Gates, is one of several companies aiming for commercial use in the next decade. Another, Terrestrial Energy, in Canada, is developing a design that uses molten salt to produce 195 megawatts per reactor, about one-fifth of conventional units.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut some scientists are looking even further into the future, with novel technologies. Commonwealth Fusion Systems, a startup in Cambridge, Mass., is working to use new superconducting materials to build a fusion power plant\u0026mdash;one that creates energy by combining atoms rather than dividing them, as in traditional nuclear. The project could take decades to fully commercialize but has the potential to revolutionize electricity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"inline-portrait_small_2x alignnone \"\u003e\u003cimg data-attachment-id=\"5672643\" data-permalink=\"https://time.com/5669039/technology-fight-climate-change/making-a-miniature-sun-on-earth/\" data-orig-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/climate-change-technology-fusion.jpg?quality=85\" data-orig-size=\"2400,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"Pallava Bagla\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark II\",\"caption\":\"SAINT-PAUL-LES-DURANCE, FRANCE -  AUGUST 7:  Workers make the Super Conducting magnets at an ITER facility which is part of a mega construction effort taking place in Southern France where countries are collaborating to create a miniature 'sun on earth' on August 7, 2019 in Saint-Paul-les-Durance, France.

The technology to do that, known as carbon capture and sequestration, involves removing carbon from the atmosphere and either physically storing it, often underground, or leveraging natural processes that capture and store it, as trees do. Engineers have been working on the challenge for decades, but costs remain high\u0026mdash;in part because there is no economic benefit to storing carbon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne way to change that would be to reuse the carbon as fuel, but that only delays its release; another would be a price on carbon itself. For engineers, it is a tantalizing area of research\u0026mdash;the ultimate moon shot\u0026mdash;because any breakthrough in capturing carbon, reusing carbon or storing it at a large scale would mitigate the potential catastrophe of allowing it to continue to heat the atmosphere.

The engineers had done their job, taking sun and wind from quirky backyard DIY projects to cutting-edge technology. Batteries had plummeted down the same cost curve as renewable energy, so the fact that the sun went down at night no longer mattered quite so much\u0026mdash;you could store its rays to use later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the third realization? People began to understand that the biggest reason we weren\u0026rsquo;t making full, fast use of these new technologies was the political power of the fossil-fuel industry. Investigative journalists had exposed its three-decade campaign of denial and disinformation, and attorneys general and plaintiffs\u0026rsquo; lawyers were beginning to pick them apart. And just in time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese trends first intersected powerfully on Election Day in 2020. The Halloween hurricane that crashed into the Gulf didn\u0026rsquo;t just take hundreds of lives and thousands of homes; it revealed a political seam that had begun to show up in polling data a year or two before. Of all the issues that made suburban Americans\u0026mdash;women especially\u0026mdash;\u0026shy;uneasy about President Trump, his stance on climate change was near the top. What had seemed a modest lead for the Democratic challenger widened during the last week of the campaign as damage reports from Louisiana and Mississippi rolled in; on election night it turned into a rout, and the analysts insisted that an under\u0026shy;appreciated \u0026ldquo;green vote\u0026rdquo; had played a vital part\u0026mdash;after all, actual green parties in Canada, the U.K. and much of continental Europe were also outperforming expectations. Young voters were turning out in record numbers: the Greta Generation, as punsters were calling them, made climate change their No. 1 issue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"inline-portrait_small_2x alignnone \"\u003e\u003cimg data-attachment-id=\"5673699\" data-permalink=\"https://time.com/5669022/climate-change-2050/climate-change-how-we-solved-climate-change-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/climate-change-how-we-solved-climate-change-1.jpg?quality=85\" data-orig-size=\"1787,2400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"climate-change-how-we-solved-climate-change-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/climate-change-how-we-solved-climate-change-1.jpg?quality=85\u0026w=223\" data-large-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/climate-change-how-we-solved-climate-change-1.jpg?quality=85\u0026w=447\" src=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/climate-change-how-we-solved-climate-change-1.jpg?w=560\u0026#038;quality=85\u0026#038;h=752\" alt=\"How We Solved Climate Change\" height=\"752\"\u003e\n\u003cfigcaption class=\"image-caption\" \u003e\u003cspan class=\"credit\" \u003eIllustration by David Doran (Background photo: Getty Images)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd when the new President took the oath of office, she didn\u0026rsquo;t disappoint. In her Inaugural Address, she pledged to immediately put America back in the Paris Agreement\u0026mdash;but then she added, \u0026ldquo;We know by now that Paris is nowhere near enough. Even if all the countries followed all the promises made in that accord, the temperature would still rise more than 3\u0026deg;C (5\u0026deg;F or 6\u0026deg;F). If we let the planet warm that much, we won\u0026rsquo;t be able to have civilizations like the ones we\u0026rsquo;re used to. So we\u0026rsquo;re going to make the changes we need to make, and we\u0026rsquo;re going to make them fast.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFast, of course, is a word that doesn\u0026rsquo;t really apply to Capitol Hill or most of the world\u0026rsquo;s other Congresses, Parliaments and Central Committees. It took constant demonstrations from ever larger groups like Extinction Rebellion, and led by young activists especially from the communities suffering the most, to ensure that politicians feared an angry electorate more than an angry carbon lobby. But America, which historically had poured more carbon into the atmosphere than any other nation, did cease blocking progress. With the filibuster removed, the Senate passed\u0026mdash;by the narrowest of margins\u0026mdash;one bill after another to end subsidies for coal and gas and oil companies, began to tax the carbon they produced, and acted on the basic principles of the Green New Deal: funding the rapid deployment of solar panels and wind turbines, guaranteeing federal jobs for anyone who wanted that work, and putting an end to drilling and mining on federal lands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince those public lands trailed only China, the U.S., India and Russia as a source of carbon, that was a big deal. Its biggest impact was on Wall Street, where investors began to treat fossil-fuel stocks with increasing disdain. When BlackRock, the biggest money manager in the world, cleaned its basic passive index fund of coal, oil and gas stocks, the companies were essentially rendered off-limits to normal investors. As protesters began cutting up their Chase bank cards, the biggest lender to the fossil-fuel industry suddenly decided green investments made more sense. Even the staid insurance industry began refusing to underwrite new oil and gas pipelines\u0026mdash;and shorn of its easy access to capital, the industry was also shorn of much of its political influence. Every quarter meant fewer voters who mined coal and more who installed solar panels, and that made political change even easier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs America\u0026rsquo;s new leaders began trying to mend fences with other nations, climate action proved to be a crucial way to rebuild diplomatic trust. China and India had their own reasons for wanting swift action\u0026mdash;mostly, the fact that smog-choked cities and ever deadlier heat waves were undermining the stability of the ruling regimes. When Beijing announced that its Belt and Road Initiative would run on renewable energy, not coal, the energy future of much of Asia changed overnight. When India started mandating electric cars and scooters for urban areas, the future of the internal-combustion engine was largely sealed. Teslas continued to attract upscale Americans, but the real numbers came from lower-priced electric cars pouring out of Asian factories. That was enough to finally convince even Detroit that a seismic shift was under way: when the first generation of Ford E-150 pickups debuted, with ads demonstrating their unmatched torque by showing them towing a million-pound locomotive, only the most unreconstructed motorheads were still insisting on the superiority of gas-powered rides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther easy technological gains came in our homes. After a century of keeping a tank of oil or gas in the basement for heating, people quickly discovered the appeal of air-source heat pumps, which turned the heat of the outdoors (even on those rare days when the temperature still dropped below zero) into comfortable indoor air. Gas burners gave way to induction cooktops. The last incandescent bulbs were in museums, and even most of the compact fluorescents had been long since replaced by LEDs. Electricity demand was up\u0026mdash;but when people plugged in their electric vehicles at night, the ever growing fleet increasingly acted like a vast battery, smoothing out the curves as the wind dropped or the sun clouded. Some people stopped eating meat, and lots and lots of people ate less of it\u0026mdash;a cultural transformation made easier by the fact that Impossible Burgers turned out to be at least as juicy as the pucks that fast-food chains had been slinging for years. The number of cows on the world\u0026rsquo;s farms started to drop, and with them the source of perhaps a fifth of emissions. More crucially, new diets reduced the pressure to cut down the remaining tropical rain forests to make way for grazing land.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn other words, the low-hanging fruit was quickly plucked, and the pluckers were well paid. Perhaps the fastest-growing business on the planet involved third-party firms that would retrofit a factory or an office with energy-efficient technology and simply take a cut of the savings on the monthly electric bill. Small businesses, and rural communities, began to notice the economic advantages of keeping the money paid for power relatively close to home instead of shipping it off to Houston or Riyadh. The world had wasted so much energy that much of the early work was easy, like losing weight by getting your hair cut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the early euphoria came to an end pretty quickly. By the end of the 2020s, it became clear we would have to pay the price of delaying action for decades.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor one thing, the cuts in emissions that scientists prescribed were almost impossibly deep. \u0026ldquo;If you\u0026rsquo;d started in 1990 when we first warned you, the job was manageable: you could have cut carbon a percent or two a year,\u0026rdquo; one eminent physicist explained. \u0026ldquo;But waiting 30 years turned a bunny slope into a black diamond.\u0026rdquo; As usual, the easy \u0026ldquo;solutions\u0026rdquo; turned out to be no help at all: fracked natural-gas wells were leaking vast quantities of methane into the atmosphere, and \u0026ldquo;biomass burning\u0026rdquo;\u0026mdash;\u0026shy;cutting down forests to burn them for electricity\u0026mdash;was putting a pulse of carbon into the air at precisely the wrong moment. (As it happened, the math showed letting trees stand was crucial for pulling carbon from the atmosphere\u0026mdash;when secondary forests were allowed to grow, they sucked up a third or more of the excess carbon humanity was producing.) Environmentalists learned they needed to make some compromises, and so most of America\u0026rsquo;s aging nuclear reactors were left online past their decommissioning dates: that lower-carbon power supplemented the surging renewable industry in the early years, even as researchers continued work to see if fusion power, thorium reactors or some other advanced design could work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe real problem, though, was that climate change itself kept accelerating, even as the world began trying to turn its energy and agriculture systems around. The giant slug of carbon that the world had put into the atmosphere\u0026mdash;more since 1990 than in all of human history before\u0026mdash;acted like a time-delayed fuse, and the temperature just kept rising. Worse, it appeared that scientists had systematically underestimated just how much damage each tenth of a degree would actually do, a point underscored in 2032 when a behemoth slice of the West Antarctic ice sheet slid majestically into the southern ocean, and all of a sudden the rise in sea level was being measured in feet, not inches. (Nothing, it turned out, could move Americans to embrace the metric system.) And the heating kept triggering feedback loops that in turn accelerated the heating: ever larger wildfires, for instance, kept pushing ever more carbon into the air, and their smoke blackened ice sheets that in turn melted even faster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis hotter world produced an ongoing spate of emergencies: \u0026ldquo;forest-fire season\u0026rdquo; was now essentially year-round, and the warmer ocean kept hurricanes and typhoons boiling months past the old norms. And sometimes the damage was novel: ancient carcasses kept emerging from the melting permafrost of the north, and with them germs from illnesses long thought extinct. But the greatest crises were the slower, more inexorable ones: the ongoing drought and desertification was forcing huge numbers of Africans, Asians and Central Americans to move; in many places, the heat waves had literally become unbearable, with nighttime temperatures staying above 100\u0026deg;F and outdoor work all but impossible for weeks and months at a time. On low-lying ground like the Mekong Delta, the rising ocean salted fields essential to supplying the world with rice. The U.N. had long ago estimated the century could see a billion climate refugees, and it was beginning to appear it was unnervingly correct. What could the rich countries say? These were people who hadn\u0026rsquo;t caused the crisis now devouring their lives, and there weren\u0026rsquo;t enough walls and cages to keep them at bay, so the migrations kept roiling the politics of the planet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"inline-portrait_small_2x alignnone \"\u003e\u003cimg data-attachment-id=\"5673698\" data-permalink=\"https://time.com/5669022/climate-change-2050/climate-change-how-we-solved-climate-change-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/climate-change-how-we-solved-climate-change-2.jpg?quality=85\" data-orig-size=\"1786,2400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"climate-change-how-we-solved-climate-change-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/climate-change-how-we-solved-climate-change-2.jpg?quality=85\u0026w=223\" data-large-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/climate-change-how-we-solved-climate-change-2.jpg?quality=85\u0026w=447\" src=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/climate-change-how-we-solved-climate-change-2.jpg?w=560\u0026#038;quality=85\u0026#038;h=753\" alt=\"\" height=\"753\"\u003e\n\u003cfigcaption class=\"image-caption\" \u003e\u003cspan class=\"credit\" \u003eIllustration by David Doran (Background photo: Getty Images)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were, in fact, two possible ways forward. The most obvious path was a constant competition between nations and individuals to see who could thrive in this new climate regime, with luckier places turning themselves into fortresses above the flood. Indeed some people in some places tried to cling to old notions: plug in some solar panels and they could somehow return to a more naive world, where economic expansion was still the goal of every government.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there was a second response that carried the day in most countries, as growing numbers of people came to understand that the ground beneath our feet had truly shifted. If the economy was the lens through which we\u0026rsquo;d viewed the world for a century, now survival was the only sensible basis on which to make decisions. Those decisions targeted not just carbon dioxide; these societies went after the wild inequality that also marked the age. The Green New Deal turned out to be everything the Koch brothers had most feared when it was introduced: a tool to make America a fairer, healthier, better-educated place. It was emulated around the world, just as America\u0026rsquo;s Clean Air Act had long served as a template for laws across the globe. Slowly both the Keeling Curve, measuring carbon in the atmosphere, and the Gini coefficient, measuring the distribution of wealth, began to flatten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026rsquo;s where we are today. We clearly did not \u0026ldquo;escape\u0026rdquo; climate change or \u0026ldquo;solve\u0026rdquo; global warming\u0026mdash;the temperature keeps climbing, though the rate of increase has lessened. It\u0026rsquo;s turned into a wretched century, which is considerably better than a catastrophic one. We ended up with the most profound and most dangerous physical changes in human history. Our civilization surely teetered\u0026mdash;and an enormous number of people paid an unfair and overwhelming price\u0026mdash;but it did not fall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople have learned to defend what can be practically defended: expensive seawalls and pumps mean New York is still New York, though the Antarctic may yet have something to say on the subject. Other places we\u0026rsquo;ve learned to let go: much of the East Coast has moved in a few miles, to more defensible ground. Yes, that took trillions of dollars in real estate off the board\u0026mdash;but the roads and the bridges would have cost trillions to defend, and even then the odds were bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCities look different now\u0026mdash;much more densely populated, as NIMBY defenses against new development gave way to an increasingly vibrant urbanism. Smart municipalities banned private cars from the center of town, opening up free public-transit systems and building civic fleets of self-driving cars that got rid of the space wasted on parking spots. But rural districts have changed too: the erratic weather put a premium on hands-on agricultural skills, which in turn provided opportunities for migrants arriving from ruined farmlands elsewhere. (Farming around solar panels has become a particular specialty.) America\u0026rsquo;s rail network is not quite as good as it was in the early 20th century, but it gets closer each year, which is good news since low-carbon air travel proved hard to get off the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat\u0026rsquo;s changed most of all is the mood. The defiant notion that we would forever overcome nature has given way to pride of a different kind: increasingly we celebrate our ability to bend without breaking, to adapt as gracefully as possible to a natural world whose temper we\u0026rsquo;ve come to respect. When we look back to the start of the century we are, of course, angry that people did so little to slow the great heating: if we\u0026rsquo;d acknowledged climate change in earnest a decade or two earlier, we might have shaved a degree off the temperature, and a degree is measured in great pain and peril. But we also know it was hard for people to grasp what was happening: human history stretched back 10,000 years, and those millennia were physically stable, so it made emotional sense to assume that stability would stretch forward as well as past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe know much better now: we know that we\u0026rsquo;ve knocked the planet off its foundations, and that our job, for the foreseeable centuries, is to absorb the bounces as she rolls. We\u0026rsquo;re dancing as nimbly as we can, and so far we haven\u0026rsquo;t crashed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr /\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is one article in a series on the state of the planet\u0026rsquo;s response to climate change. \u003ca href=\"https://time.com/climate-change-solutions\" \u003eRead the rest of the stories\u003c/a\u003e and sign up for \u003ca href=\"https://cloud.newsletters.time.com/newsletters/?newsletter_name=climate\u0026amp;source=article-climate-footer\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eOne.Five, TIME\u0026#8217;s climate change newsletter.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/time/topstories/~4/e0HRj3AuIkw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/e0HRj3AuIkw/","published":"2019-09-12T11:15:38Z","guid":"http://time.com/?p=5669022"},{"title":"Angelina Jolie: Climate Change Is Already Displacing Millions of People.

In 2018, the region\u0026mdash;which spans Australia and the islands that make up Micronesia, Polynesia and Melanesia\u0026mdash;had its \u003ca href=\"https://www.ncdc.noaa.go\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003ethird warmest year\u003c/a\u003e on record. Many of the islands that make up this region are particularly vulnerable to rising temperatures and sea levels, two of the many consequences of climate change. If these places are lost under the waters or become uninhabitable, humanity will lose so much: wildlife, natural resources, unique cultures, languages and values. But the people who live there will lose everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom my experiences meeting refugees all around the world, whenever people are displaced, their first instinct is to seek a practical local solution inside their own country.

Climate-change effects increasingly interact with drivers of conflict, exacerbating refugee situations in countries like Chad, Sudan and Somalia. In such situations, refugee-law frameworks may apply.

In 1965, Revelle had warned President Lyndon Johnson of the mounting crisis.

Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change recently issued its latest stark assessment, in which the world\u0026rsquo;s leading scientists warned we must undergo an urgent and rapid transformation of our civilization in order to avert the most catastrophic effects of a disrupted global climate system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHumanity is now spewing more than 110 million tons of global warming pollution every day into the exceedingly thin shell of atmosphere that surrounds our planet as if it were an open sewer.

And the knock-on consequences of all that extra heat energy is leading to increasingly dangerous threats to lives and livelihoods all around the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe past five years have been the hottest five years recorded since the world\u0026rsquo;s top weather and climate agencies started tracking global temperatures in the 1880s. This past July was the hottest month ever in recorded history. More than 90% of the extra heat is going into the oceans, and it is fueling supercharged hurricanes. Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria (all in 2017) caused as much as $265 billion in damages. Overall, weather disasters in 2017 and 2018 cost the global economy $653 billion\u0026shy;\u0026mdash;the costliest back-to-back years in history. Wildfires are worsening around the world, including across the American West, while farmers in the Midwest have dealt with periods of both catastrophic flooding and drought that destroyed crops and threatened the economic health of communities.

They are staging sit-ins at congressional offices, marching in the streets and protesting on college campuses. Above all, a growing number of students in many nations have been striking from school every Friday for more than a year to demand action on the climate crisis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe movement has been led by a 16-year-old Swedish student named Greta Thunberg, who captured the world\u0026rsquo;s attention with a groundbreaking speech at the U.N.\u0026rsquo;s annual gathering of world leaders in Poland last year. Thunberg speaks with startling clarity about the threat her generation faces and how political leaders have failed the test of leadership. Her words and advocacy embody the moral authority of youth activists who will bear the burden of the decisions previous generations make today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYouth activists have also been at the ground level of the Green New Deal resolution put forward by 29-year-old Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and longtime champion for climate action Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts. Many of the ideas included in the Green New Deal have been around for years, but they have never been packaged together with momentum rooted in the energy and fervor of a new generation of leaders. The Green New Deal has indisputably played a critical role in pushing the Democratic Party\u0026rsquo;s 2020 presidential candidates to propose concrete solutions to the issue at a scale that would have been unthinkable even just a few years ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"inline-portrait_small_2x alignnone \"\u003e\u003cimg data-attachment-id=\"5672484\" data-permalink=\"https://time.com/5669047/al-gore-youth-climate-activists/climate-demonstration-fridays-for-future/\" data-orig-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/climate-change-al-gore-climate-activists.jpg?quality=85\" data-orig-size=\"2400,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"picture alliance\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"29 March 2019, Berlin: The Swedish schoolgirl Greta Thunberg goes with Lisa Neubauer to the climate demonstration \\\"Fridays for Future\\\".

According to the AP/NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, 71% of Americans agree climate change is happening. And among youth, there has been a striking change among Republicans: A 2018 Pew Research poll shows millennial Republicans are more likely to endorse centrist environmental positions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the lessons of my years as a young member of Congress was that although change can sometimes come from the top, most often the biggest changes start at the grassroots level. Political leaders will pay attention if the calls to action are loud and persistent. Saving the future of humanity is a heavy burden for teenagers and 20-somethings to bear. But they are embracing the challenge as if their lives depend on it.

As leading health experts have affirmed, the climate crisis is a threat multiplier, particularly for communities suffering from environmental injustice. For example, the Fourth National Climate Assessment, published in 2018 by a collaboration among 13 U.S. scientific agencies, highlights how higher temperatures, severe weather events and rising seas can contribute to heat-related cardiopulmonary illness, infectious disease and mental-health issues. Societal factors such as poverty, discrimination, access to health care and pre-existing health conditions make some populations even more vulnerable.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThousands of communities nationwide\u0026mdash;often low-income or with many residents of color\u0026mdash;that already face environmental risks constantly grapple with issues that others seldom encounter with the same intensity. These include exposure to air pollutants (like particulate matter and soot produced from burning fossil fuels) or soil and water contamination (caused by dumping coal ash or lead in the water supply). These same communities tend to be systematically targeted when corporations and regulators decide where to build hazardous-waste sites, power plants and waste incinerators. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t help that these populations often lack access to fresh produce, health insurance, affordable homes, public transportation and economic opportunities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClimate change is a public-health issue. It has been linked to chronic conditions, such as kidney disease, depression and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and can shove the body\u0026rsquo;s response to existing environmental assaults into overdrive. For example, people with asthma often experience more attacks during extreme heat and cold weather. As climate change continues to alter disease patterns and disrupt health systems, its effect on human health will become harder to ignore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA recent report by the Union of Concerned Scientists found that climate change is poised to increase extreme heat significantly in frequency and severity, leading to more public-health risks across the U.S. In the U.S., urban communities of color, often also low-income areas, are especially at risk, particularly those living in counties in the Southeast, which have the highest concentration of African Americans. The situation is similar for Latinx populations. In the U.S. and globally, those least responsible for climate change are already the first to bear the brunt of its health effects. Low-income communities often do not have the resources to voluntarily evacuate during extreme weather events. In addition, economic and mental-health consequences abound when communities are displaced by environmental disasters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe need policy changes that drive a just transition to a clean-energy economy and protect vulnerable communities from the impacts of climate change. At-risk communities should be given access to economical renewable energy; programs for affordable, climate-friendly heating or cooling options; and strong resilience measures to better cope with climate impacts. This, coupled with an ongoing honest dialogue and a principled partnership between decisionmakers and vulnerable populations, is fundamental to move forward toward a better, safer world as we work to tackle the mounting climate crisis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr /\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is one article in a series on the state of the planet\u0026rsquo;s response to climate change. \u003ca href=\"https://time.com/climate-change-solutions\" \u003eRead the rest of the stories\u003c/a\u003e and sign up for \u003ca href=\"https://cloud.newsletters.time.com/newsletters/?newsletter_name=climate\u0026amp;source=article-climate-footer\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eOne.Five, TIME\u0026#8217;s climate change newsletter.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/time/topstories/~4/xYPtW-3k-IA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/xYPtW-3k-IA/","published":"2019-09-12T11:15:10Z","guid":"http://time.com/?p=5672636"},{"title":"These Charts Show How High Sea Levels Will Rise if Antarctica’s Ice Continues to Melt","content":"\u003caside class=\"right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad\" id=\"right-rail__ad-5669021\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module video-2\" data-src=\"https://time.com/5669021/antarctica-ice-melt-sea-level-rise/\" data-widget-id=\"SB_4\" data-ob-template=\"timemag\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHumans were not around to see Antarctica in the good times, tens of millions of years ago, when it was home to palms and baobab trees, reptiles and marsupials.

For now, Antarctica is buried under a layer of ice that averages 7,100 ft. deep\u0026mdash;or 1.3 miles.

But Gantz\u0026rsquo;s Blue and White\u0026rsquo;s ambiguous response will \u0026ldquo;at a minimum\u0026rdquo; be interpreted as \u0026ldquo;not opposing [Netanyahu\u0026rsquo;s] annexation plans\u0026rdquo; says IPF director Michael Koplow, even if it falls short of giving them explicit assent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome 2.5 million Palestinians live in the West Bank, which Israel has controlled since it fought a war with its Arab neighbors in 1967. Hundreds of thousands of Israelis also populate West Bank settlements, which the overwhelming majority of the international community considers illegal. The Trump Administration is yet to comment publicly on Netanyahu\u0026rsquo;s hint that its peace plan would green light annexing the Jordan Valley, but precedent suggests it might.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrump broke with decades of U.S. policy to recognize \u003ca href=\"https://time.com/5276129/jerusalem-embassy-gaza-protests-what-to-know/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eJerusalem\u003c/a\u003e as Israel\u0026rsquo;s capital and moved the American embassy to the city Palestinians also regard as their future capital. And shortly before Israel\u0026rsquo;s April elections, Trump recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, a rocky plateau Israel also captured in the war of 1967. In a June interview with The New York \u003cem\u003eTimes\u003c/em\u003e U.S. ambassador to Israel David Friedman has \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/08/world/middleeast/israel-west-bank-david-friedman.html\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003esaid Israel has \u0026ldquo;the right\u0026rdquo; to annex\u003c/a\u003e at least some of the West Bank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his announcement Tuesday, Netanyahu said the Trump Administration\u0026rsquo;s peace plan, which he said would be released days after the election, would provide a \u0026#8220;historic opportunity\u0026#8221; for annexation. Polling data from the Jerusalem-based Israel Democracy Institute indicates that 48% of Jewish Israelis and 11% of Arab Israelis would favor the extension of sovereignty over the Jordan Valley and the northern Dead Sea\u0026mdash;sometimes known as Area C\u0026mdash;if such a move if it were supported by Trump and his administration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGantz\u0026rsquo;s position is complicated by the fact that, like Netanyahu\u0026rsquo;s Likud party, he advocates Israel maintaining security control over the Jordan Valley. In an election season, effectively distinguishing security control from political control, in the form of annexation, is difficult, says IPF\u0026rsquo;s Koplow, and opposing Netanyahu\u0026rsquo;s statement runs the risk of conveying to the electorate that his party is willing to cede security control of the Jordan Valley. Nonetheless, Gantz\u0026rsquo;s ambiguity \u0026ldquo;was not very smart politics,\u0026rdquo; he adds. It\u0026rsquo;s unlikely to win over right-wingers drawn to ardently pro-annexationist parties, while at the same time turning those who oppose annexation away from his Centrist Blue and White party.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn Monday, Gantz told an audience in Tel Aviv that he would ideally form a unity government including Likud, the secular nationalist Yisrael Beiteinu and \u0026ldquo;maybe [center-left] Labor,\u0026rdquo; bolstering the perception that Blue and White differs from Likud in terms of personality rather than policy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor those on the political left, Gantz\u0026rsquo;s stance is symptomatic of the dearth of serious opposition to the politics Netanyahu has engendered. The Prime Minister \u0026#8220;wants to annex and then create a \u003cem\u003ede jure\u003c/em\u003e Apartheid and Gantz wants a permanent occupation\u0026#8221; says Avener Gvaryahu, CEO of Breaking the Silence, a group of former Israeli soldiers that advocates for an end to the occupation. \u0026#8220;But both are basically saying there will not be an independent Palestinian state.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/time/topstories/~4/hlUsP43HidQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/hlUsP43HidQ/","published":"2019-09-12T12:54:50Z","guid":"http://time.com/?p=5674409"},{"title":"The Next Generation of Airbus Aircraft Will Track Your Bathroom Visits","content":"\u003caside class=\"right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad\" id=\"right-rail__ad-5675566\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module\" data-src=\"https://time.com/5675566/airbus-airplane-bathroom-tracker/\" data-widget-id=\"SB_2\" data-ob-template=\"timemag\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=\"article--attribution\"\u003e(Bloomberg) \u0026mdash; \u003c/span\u003eAttention airline bathroom loiterers: The next generation of \u003ca href=\"https://time.com/5529439/airbus-a380-retired/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eAirbus aircraft\u003c/a\u003e will track how long you\u0026rsquo;ve been in there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s all part of an effort to make commercial cabins a digitally aware domain. The program is Airbus\u0026rsquo;s bid to raise the Internet of Things \u0026mdash; that buzz-phrase for connected household gadgets\u0026mdash;to cruising altitude.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Airbus Connected Experience aims to give flight attendants a more detailed survey of the cabin, with sensors for such critical data as when bathroom soap is running low and how much toilet paper remains in each bathroom. But the rethinking of the passenger environment doesn\u0026rsquo;t just stop with the lavatory. At each seat, your belt will signal red for unbuckled and green when fastened. The goal is faster boarding and departure, dispensing with those lap-scrutinizing walk-throughs flight attendants must perform. The crew will also have access to information on what\u0026rsquo;s onboard and where, like which galley carts contain specific meals, such as preorders or vegetarian selections.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s not a concept, it\u0026rsquo;s not a dream: It\u0026rsquo;s reality,\u0026rdquo; Ingo Wuggetzer, Airbus\u0026rsquo;s vice president of cabin marketing, said Tuesday at an aviation trade show in Los Angeles. Airbus has begun flight testing the connected cabin on its A350 test aircraft and plans to introduce it on the A321 family in 2021, followed by the larger, two-aisle A350 series two years later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs cool as all of this may seem to you, the passenger, it\u0026rsquo;s just another way for airlines to squeeze more profit out of operations. While data from these various areas will be sent to flight attendant tablets or smart phones in real time, the crunching of that data over time is where the real value lies. The connectivity Airbus envisions for its cabins will provide an enormous trove of information airlines can use to analyze and optimize in their never-ending quest for cost efficiencies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the time it takes a flight attendant to respond to a call button, to preferences for prosecco versus chardonnay, to which bathroom gets the most use\u0026mdash;the information can help optimize all aspects of flight. \u0026ldquo;You can make the service more attentive,\u0026rdquo; said Ronald Sweers, an Airbus cabin-products director. While the digital doodads are expected to simplify flight attendant workloads, their true value may lie in giving airlines more insights about what happens in the cabin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat space, Wuggetzer noted, is a virtual \u0026ldquo;black box\u0026rdquo; to carriers once the plane leaves a gate. But not for much longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAirbus also plans to offer airlines the option of cameras at each lavatory (on the outside, mind you) to count how many passengers are waiting, a feature which may help flight attendants redirect some of that traffic on larger jets. While certainly helpful to that man in 17C who had one too many sodas, the data will also show airlines the length of wait times on various flights, and on different aircraft types. More seriously, it can also alert a flight attendant that someone inside may be ill or need assistance, Wuggetzer said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crew will also be able to control features such as window shades and public address volume from their mobile devices. The system will know which overhead bin spaces are open, with green lights along the cabin, much like the lighting schemes used in parking decks to signal drivers toward unoccupied spaces. That should, in theory, speed boarding, Airbus says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs far as Airbus is concerned, the cabin\u0026rsquo;s platform is open so customer airlines can attach their own crew applications or other software, Sweers said. Many large carriers have customized or proprietary software for such onboard tasks as catering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;The feedback we heard from airlines was, \u0026lsquo;OK, Airbus, we don\u0026rsquo;t believe you\u0026rsquo;re able to give us an application that will work with our systems,\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; Sweers said on the trade show floor, discussing the galley equipment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/time/topstories/~4/2RBEFe7i9uM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/2RBEFe7i9uM/","published":"2019-09-12T12:43:42Z","guid":"http://time.com/?p=5675566"},{"title":"Influenza Season Has Barely Begun, But a California Child’s Death Is Already Being Classified as ‘Flu-Associated’","content":"\u003caside class=\"right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad\" id=\"right-rail__ad-5675467\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module video-2\" data-src=\"https://time.com/5675467/california-pediatric-flu-death-vaccine/\" data-widget-id=\"SB_4\" data-ob-template=\"timemag\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA September pediatric flu death in California serves as a stark reminder that \u003ca href=\"https://time.com/5386037/flu-shot-october-2018/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003egetting vaccinated early\u003c/a\u003e can save lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePublic-health officials in Riverside County, Calif. announced this week that a recently deceased 4-year-old child from Perris, who had underlying health issues, tested positive for influenza.

The CDC recommends that children ages six months to eight years, who require two doses of the flu vaccine, should get their first shot \u0026#8220;as soon as possible after the vaccine becomes available,\u0026#8221; since they must wait at least four weeks to get the second dose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#8217;s also especially important that young children get vaccinated, since they are both particularly susceptible to serious flu complications, and more responsive to the vaccine than adults.

She\u0026#8217;s the president and CEO of Americans United for Life. Catherine, thank you so much for being with us today.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCatherine Glenn Foster:\u003c/strong\u003e It\u0026#8217;s a pleasure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003edel Guidice: So, to start off, can you talk about Americans United for Life, its mission, and what you guys are doing right now?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFoster: \u003c/strong\u003eAbsolutely. So we were founded in 1971, two years before Roe v. Wade struck down life-affirming laws nationwide, and introduced this nationwide regime of abortion-on-demand. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd what we do is work in the state houses, in Congress, in the courts, in the public, to educate people and to pass laws relating to life—life-affirming laws—and then pushing back on some of these threats to life that we\u0026#8217;ve seen introduced in a few states recently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003edel Guidice: You guys have been busy. I know you recently conducted a poll on public opinion of late-term abortion, as well as Planned Parenthood funding—Title 10 funding—which is essentially family planning funding. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat were the findings of this poll that you guys did?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFoster:\u003c/strong\u003e Sure, well we found out that 80% of Americans overall, and two-thirds of even self-described pro-choice Americans, oppose late-term abortion. They oppose these abortions that are taking place when the children are viable, when the children are capable of feeling pain, and when the risk to the mother is so much greater, exponentially greater risk that we\u0026#8217;ve seen as the pregnancy progresses, and as the child is growing. A risk of death even. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so, two-thirds of even self-described pro-choice Americans oppose that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe have a ways to go. We have a a third of pro-choice Americans still to reach. But that already shows us that most Americans agree on some of the fundamentals about life—whether we\u0026#8217;re talking about abortion, or the full spectrum of life issues that we deal with at Americans United for Life. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMost Americans are in agreement when you start getting down into the actual policy questions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003edel Guidice: And it\u0026#8217;s interesting, because if you were to be following Planned Parenthood on social media anywhere, you would never know numbers like that existed, that two-thirds of these Americans are actually pro-life. So, that\u0026#8217;s interesting that you guys have found that, and I\u0026#8217;m glad you\u0026#8217;re sharing that. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou have your own personal story about what led you into the pro-life movement. Can you talk a little bit about your own story?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFoster:\u003c/strong\u003e Absolutely. You know, I had never really thought much about abortion until it confronted me personally. My best friend in seventh grade was pro-life and would talk about it, and her whole family was pro life. And it was this beautiful witness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut I didn\u0026#8217;t really know what abortion was. It was one of those things that, it was just sort of in the background, and so I didn\u0026#8217;t really connect with that. And it didn\u0026#8217;t really come up in my thinking again until I was 19 years old myself, and I was a sophomore at college, and I found myself unexpectedly pregnant. Had no idea where to turn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0026#8217;t know there was a pro-life movement, hadn\u0026#8217;t been exposed to that at all. All I knew was that I had this one friend, and I didn\u0026#8217;t even think about that really. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026#8217;m just thinking, what do I do? Where do I go? I wish that I had felt comfortable to tell my mother. I did tell her just a few weeks later, but I just \u0026#8230; I was sitting there struggling in the campus health clinic right after I found out. I thought, I would love to tell her. I\u0026#8217;m afraid to tell her because I just don\u0026#8217;t want to disappoint her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0026#8217;t think she would be angry. I just, I didn\u0026#8217;t want to disappoint her. And no one said, \u0026#8220;Oh, let\u0026#8217;s call your mom,\u0026#8221; or, \u0026#8220;Who do you need to call? What can we do to help you? Let\u0026#8217;s hold hands. I\u0026#8217;ll put my arm around you. We\u0026#8217;ll find resources. You\u0026#8217;re strong enough, you\u0026#8217;re smart enough, you can do it.\u0026#8221; \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAll of those things that, now, I know I would say to a woman, and I do say to women who are facing these situations. No one was saying that, no one pointed me toward a pregnancy center. No one helped me along that journey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so I was left to just Google late at night, or search, I think it was AskJeeves or something at the time. And I\u0026#8217;m just searching on the internet: What do I do? Where do I go? \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I found abortion clinics, abortion facilities online. And so I picked the second-cheapest one I could. I\u0026#8217;m thinking, \u0026#8220;OK, maybe it\u0026#8217;s a little bit safer than the absolute cheapest.\u0026#8221; And I made an appointment for that Saturday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI knew that it would have to be fast because I was bonding. I was walking around campus. I was wearing my boyfriend\u0026#8217;s oversized sweatshirt, and I was actually talking with my baby as I was walking. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut I went into that facility because I didn\u0026#8217;t know where else to turn. I didn\u0026#8217;t feel like there was any other choice. Small Christian college, what do you do? I had no idea who to tell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so I walked in. And from the moment I walked in that door, nothing restored my choice, my autonomy, my sense of empowerment. It was just stripped from me over, and over, and over by everything that happened behind those closed doors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003edel Guidice: Wow. So what was your journey to healing, and also talk about what had happened in your past, and your journey into the pro-life movement. What did that look like?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFoster: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, so healing was tough. You know, in the facility itself, it was, again, just so dis-empowering. Asking questions, not getting answers, not being given real information. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eStep one is you pay, and then all of a sudden you\u0026#8217;re given a pill and then they\u0026#8217;re doing the ultrasound. And I said, \u0026#8220;Well, can I see the ultrasound? I want to see my child. I\u0026#8217;m still trying to make a decision here.\u0026#8221; And they said, \u0026#8220;No, it\u0026#8217;s against policy.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then going forward from there, they said that, in fact, my child wasn\u0026#8217;t even old enough. And I said, \u0026#8220;Well there\u0026#8217;s my answer. OK, I\u0026#8217;m gone, I\u0026#8217;m out of here, keep the money.\u0026#8221; \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd they said, \u0026#8220;Well, let\u0026#8217;s check again,\u0026#8221; and they check again. And they said, \u0026#8220;Well, old enough after all.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then on the actual table I changed my mind. And I tried to get up, and I said, \u0026#8220;Let me go,\u0026#8221; again, \u0026#8220;Just keep the money, but this is wrong for me.\u0026#8221; And they ended up sending more people in and held me down and forcibly aborted me. So there were layers of trauma to heal from.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0026#8217;t \u0026#8230; I mean, every woman has a different path and a different journey, and it\u0026#8217;s so difficult for so many of us. But mine, and frankly I\u0026#8217;ve talked to so many other women, represented other women who had similar experiences of not being given information, not being allowed to see our ultrasounds, being held down, all of these aspects of it. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo I was sobbing. I was screaming. I was sobbing. They were trying to make me shut up. I was the last patient to leave the clinic alive that day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMy boyfriend drove me back to college, an hour and a half or so away. And I just, I remember lying in bed for days, not wanting to move, not knowing how to go on. It was incredibly traumatic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then I just sat up one day and I said, \u0026#8220;I have to \u0026#8230; I can\u0026#8217;t go back to karate, I\u0026#8217;ve got my pass for that. You can\u0026#8217;t do quite the same things that I was planning on for this semester, but I have to pull myself together and find some way forward.\u0026#8221; \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd a few weeks later I told my mom. She was telling me about her good friend\u0026#8217;s daughter who had gotten pregnant, and I said, \u0026#8220;Yeah, it really, it\u0026#8217;s happening a lot. Right?\u0026#8221; And she said, \u0026#8220;Catherine, is there something you want to tell me?\u0026#8221; And I said, \u0026#8220;Yeah, there is.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I told her. And she was as loving and understanding as almost every mom is, no matter how scared we are. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, I was talking to someone just recently, a few months ago, and she shared this perspective. Because I had always kind of been in my own perspective in this, because there\u0026#8217;s so much to unpack there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she said, \u0026#8220;You know how much your mom must have hurt that you didn\u0026#8217;t feel like you could go to her?\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I said, \u0026#8220;I\u0026#8217;m sorry, I have to stop the conversation right now. I\u0026#8217;m going to call my mom, give me like five minutes.\u0026#8221; And I called my mom up in the middle of this interview. And I said, \u0026#8220;Mom, I\u0026#8217;m so sorry. I wish that I had done better.\u0026#8221; And she started crying, and she just [said], \u0026#8220;I forgive you, I do. I wish that you had just felt like you could come to me.\u0026#8221; \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBecause it was not any kind of an abusive relationship. There was no reason for me to think \u0026#8230; I just, I didn\u0026#8217;t want to disappoint her. But so much of life is that. You find a way forward through difficult journeys, and we would have found a way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo she helped me find counseling. I started going to counseling at a local center, a pregnancy center where my parents live, in Johnson City, Tennessee. And that was very healing in a lot of ways. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then I just, I kept going. I graduated college. I went and got a master\u0026#8217;s, and I started working. And it never occurred to me that I would come back here, until I just felt this calling to go to law school.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I followed that path. And during orientation I was in this talk, this orientation talk on health care law, this introductory conversation. I\u0026#8217;m there in the front row, very excited about it. I\u0026#8217;m thinking like \u0026#8220;24,\u0026#8221; if any of your listeners ever watched \u0026#8220;24,\u0026#8221; Jack Bauer—I\u0026#8217;m thinking like bio-terrorism and, I don\u0026#8217;t know, cool things like that. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo I\u0026#8217;m very excited about about this health care law kind of thing, and all the different ways that health care and biological issues impact people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd all of a sudden, sitting in that talk, I just \u0026#8230; it hit me. No, you\u0026#8217;re going to be dealing with abortion. You\u0026#8217;re going to be dealing with euthanasia, and the spectrum of life issues, and just protecting and valuing life, and making sure that people are able to really experience the dignity that we all have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003edel Guidice: Wow. That is beautiful. Thank you so much for sharing that.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWell, House Republicans on Tuesday held a hearing to make a case for a bill to protect babies who survive abortions. And given your own personal story, I can imagine you have some heavy insight on this. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHouse Democrats have blocked Republicans 80 times from voting on this bill. Why do you think this legislation is so controversial?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFoster:\u003c/strong\u003e This legislation, first of all, should not be controversial. Let\u0026#8217;s just start there. For some reason it\u0026#8217;s become it, but it shouldn\u0026#8217;t be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis is something that we all should be able to agree on, and in the past, so often we\u0026#8217;ve seen that agreement, that consensus from both sides of the aisle. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, this is a bill that\u0026#8217;s needed. We know that there are babies who are born alive during an abortion. We know that they are, at that point, outside the womb. We\u0026#8217;re not talking about an abortion anymore, we\u0026#8217;re talking about two separate human beings. Two separate individuals in two separate places, not one inside the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd these are people who both deserve medical care and treatment. And yet, some people seem to think that at that point it should still be a decision between a woman and her doctor. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I think there are a lot of reasons for that, why people may think that. It\u0026#8217;s about that commitment, you might say, to the abortion cause. Because if you draw a line, really, I think any place but conception, at that point it\u0026#8217;s very hard to draw a line anywhere else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIs it viability? Well, that can change. And we\u0026#8217;re talking about percentages there. Is it heartbeat? Is it when the child has fingernails or toenails? What point is it along that line? Is it when there\u0026#8217;s a 50% chance of survival, or an 80, or a 95 or \u0026#8230; There\u0026#8217;s just, there isn\u0026#8217;t any point that really makes sense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so you see certain politicians get caught up, I think, in defending something that, in some cases, they don\u0026#8217;t even necessarily want to be defending. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut when you look at their backing, when you look at the party platform, and the pressure that you\u0026#8217;re seeing. In so many cases, the political pressure again from some elements, when again, the majority of the American public is not in favor of this—80% of people overall oppose this idea of infanticide, oppose even late-term abortions. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd when you have two thirds of self-described pro-choice Americans opposing late-term abortions, opposing infanticide, you can see how out of touch that perspective is. And you start thinking, \u0026#8220;Well, OK, let\u0026#8217;s track this back. Let\u0026#8217;s figure out how we got there, and how certain people got there, to where they\u0026#8217;re defending what seems to be utterly indefensible.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003edel Guidice: Well, we\u0026#8217;re starting to see these numbers in states across the country. There are more pro-life convictions. Nine states this year have passed laws putting restrictions on abortions. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0026#8217;m just curious what your thoughts are on what\u0026#8217;s been happening in states like Ohio and Alabama, where they are passing pro-life legislation.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFoster:\u003c/strong\u003e Sure, yeah. If you look nationwide, we are seeing such an incredible time for life. We\u0026#8217;re seeing about 60 pro-life bills passed into law every single year since 2011. We\u0026#8217;re seeing more than ever before. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, in just this year alone, we\u0026#8217;ve seen 46 states introduce life-affirming laws, and 58 bills were passed in 22 states already. If you look at the spectrum of life-affirming law, this is really where we should be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBecause what we\u0026#8217;re looking at is a situation where people who are on both sides, introducing bills on both sides of the life issue, are looking at certain key markers. They\u0026#8217;re looking at, first and foremost, arguably, the makeup of the Supreme Court, and the federal bench generally. And seeing shifts there, some shifts that could be very encouraging for life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAlso looking at polling—and we\u0026#8217;ve been talking about polling, and these shifts toward life. These shifts, especially after New York, when so many people, so many folks just said, \u0026#8220;OK, if New York, if that kind of absolutely radical law \u0026#8230; attacking life, attacking the dignity of human life is what pro-choice looks like, then we want no part of that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so we saw, in one month, from just before to just after the New York bill passed into law, I saw about a 10-point swing in the percentage of Americans who call themselves pro-life. We saw a dramatic increase in the percentage of Democrats who call themselves pro-life after New York. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it\u0026#8217;s no surprise, when people are celebrating the death of innocent human beings, the most disenfranchised, vulnerable members of our communities. It\u0026#8217;s no surprise, when they\u0026#8217;re lighting up New York pink and cheering for something that is such an attack on human life. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so when you look at the Supreme court, when you look at the polls, and most of all, when you look at the abortion rate itself, the fact that it is now the lowest it\u0026#8217;s been since 1972, the year before Roe was passed into law \u0026#8230; So, the abortion rate now, when abortion is generally legal in America, is now the same as it was in 1972, when it was legal in just a few states.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat is a dramatic shift. It\u0026#8217;s down 50% since 2006. And even more than that, the rate of of abortion within the unintended pregnancies, that has dropped dramatically. And so, even women who didn\u0026#8217;t plan to get pregnant, weren\u0026#8217;t trying to get pregnant, may not even know how they ended up quite in this situation, they are still choosing life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWith the technology that we have, with the scientific advances and the medicine, we\u0026#8217;re seeing more and more women choose life as they get this awareness, and they\u0026#8217;re looking for holistic solutions, and true, life-affirming care. And they want consistency. They want authenticity. They don\u0026#8217;t want, \u0026#8220;OK, well these people deserve life, these don\u0026#8217;t.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so the abortion rate is down. And so, with that, and the polling, and the Supreme court, both sides are looking at these markers and they\u0026#8217;re saying, \u0026#8220;Well, hang on, if this is going on, then before long the abortion issue may be returning to the states. Roe may be overturned, and the abortion issue may be returning to the states.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd at that point, that\u0026#8217;s when we can make so much more progress, even. We would expect some states, like New York, to go the direction that they are. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0026#8217;re not giving up there. We are fighting there. We were fighting back against the bad laws. We were advancing the good bills. We are doing everything that we can, but it\u0026#8217;s predictable that some states would go that way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eEven though the abortion rate in New York is dropping as well, even though the polling in New York is just the same. But we would see, based on the politics there, we would see states going that way. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe would see other states like Alabama going the other way, and heading toward life-affirming laws. And it\u0026#8217;s so exciting to see other states going in that direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, most of the states are in the middle. Most of the states would have some laws that would be life-affirming, some limitations on abortion, some protections for women\u0026#8217;s health and safety. But they wouldn\u0026#8217;t go quite so [far] as either in New York or Alabama.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so, this is when we have this real opportunity. And so, right now we\u0026#8217;re doing the work. We at Americans United for Life, we\u0026#8217;re laying the groundwork so that we can get that test case to overturn Roe, so that we have the framework of laws in place for once Roe is overturned and it goes back to the states. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so you\u0026#8217;re seeing these conditional laws being passed, so that as soon as Roe\u0026#8217;s overturned, that law goes into effect. The condition is that Roe\u0026#8217;s overturned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, these laws are just saving lives now. You know, right now lives are being saved, 2 million lives saved just from the Hyde Amendment, not to mention all of the pro-life laws that are getting passed. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so that\u0026#8217;s millions of people who are here in the world today thanks to, in large part, the life-affirming laws that we\u0026#8217;ve been able to pass, thanks to the pregnancy centers that I wasn\u0026#8217;t aware of when I was 19 years old. Thanks to the sidewalk counselors, thanks to all of these different aspects that are coming together to educate and to build a more life-affirming America.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003edel Guidice: Thank you so much for sharing that perspective. You mentioned New York, and how they\u0026#8217;ve passed aggressive pro-abortion laws. I know Illinois is another state that has passed laws taking away some prohibitions on late-term abortions. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you think this says about the direction of pro-abortion advocates, and where they\u0026#8217;re trying to go now that they\u0026#8217;re seeing this groundswell of pro-life efforts and legislation?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFoster:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, I think we\u0026#8217;re looking at those few certain states where they think it\u0026#8217;s, if I could say, low-hanging fruit for them, where [we] think, \u0026#8220;OK, they have the political structure in place, they have what they need to pass these laws.\u0026#8221; And where there are, just like in any political system, there\u0026#8217;s so many different things that people are focusing on and thinking of. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so in some of these states, maybe the citizens, the people who live there, they might not hold their elected officials as accountable on the life issue as on some other issues, even though, again, the polling is showing that there\u0026#8217;s a lot of consistency nationwide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0026#8217;re not talking about 50% of Americans, very pro-life, 50% of Americans, very pro-choice. We\u0026#8217;re talking about most Americans agreeing on at least rolling back abortion to the end of the first trimester. You know, 75% of Americans want it rolled back at least to that point, which requires overturning Roe. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut until that point, Planned Parenthood, certain other lobbying groups [like] Planned Parenthood Action and these different groups, are looking at states like New York and Illinois, and planning for what happens once Roe is overturned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so they\u0026#8217;ve targeted obviously New York, [as] we saw with with Gov. [Andrew] Cuomo. We saw what happened in Virginia with Gov. [Ralph] Northam there, and that, no real word for it, disaster, debacle, everything that went on there. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then Delegate [Kathy] Tran there, who you could even see her discomfort when she was having to defend, really, infanticide in front in this hearing. And you could see that she was not comfortable with that, I think we could all kind of tell. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eGov. Northam saying, \u0026#8220;Oh, well if the child is born alive, then that\u0026#8217;s a decision between a woman and her doctor about whether to provide care for this living, breathing, separate child, not any more within the woman\u0026#8217;s body.\u0026#8221; \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026#8217;s what we need to be talking about, is highlighting these kinds of extreme bills that are being introduced, and sadly, at times, even passed into law. Because it is indefensible. It is indefensible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so I don\u0026#8217;t think it was surprising for many of us, at least many of us who work on these issues, when just a few short days later after Gov. Northam\u0026#8217;s interview became public, that it also became public that in fact he had worn blackface, and disenfranchised so many, so many people in the American public in our communities. [A] huge percentage of the American population that he said, \u0026#8220;Well, [they\u0026#8217;re] lesser. Not quite enough. Not quite the same.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003edel Guidice: Such a double standard.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFoster:\u003c/strong\u003e Exactly. Exactly. And he offended 100% of us. I mean, who wasn\u0026#8217;t offended by what came out, with really our apparently top three Democrats in Virginia? Just absolutely appalling. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so, it\u0026#8217;s not surprising. When you\u0026#8217;re willing to disenfranchise some, everyone really is at risk. And certainly that applies to the case of newborn babies, in the case of Gov. Northam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003edel Guidice: Well, looking at what happened to the former CEO of Planned Parenthood in July, she was abruptly fired. And it was reportedly because she wasn\u0026#8217;t zealous enough in pushing Planned Parenthood\u0026#8217;s abortion agenda. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you think this says about the future of Planned Parenthood?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFoster:\u003c/strong\u003e I think that, first of all, this isn\u0026#8217;t the first time this has happened. This is not the first time that they have doubled down on abortion as a central part of their platform. It happened multiple times before, in fact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they had a shakeup at the top, back a few decades ago, when they said no, every single affiliate, not necessarily every facility, but every affiliate grouping would have to perform abortions, even the ones who didn\u0026#8217;t want to. And so, all of the affiliates are trying to scramble and sometimes merge, or come up with these creative solutions to do that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn this case, it felt even more personal. I feel like, I know here we\u0026#8217;re talking about a physician, an accomplished physician. A woman. A woman who\u0026#8217;s also a minority, and someone who has such experience and such depth there. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut she wasn\u0026#8217;t pro-abortion enough for them. She wasn\u0026#8217;t supporting abortion enough. She wasn\u0026#8217;t political enough for them. And even though, when her tenure began, she did begin talking about abortion openly, and saying abortion is health care. Even so, that was not enough for them. They wanted someone more political, someone who was going to be pushing abortion even more. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so, it was really tragic, because she was someone who just \u0026#8230; she was so much more than an idealogue. She really, she brought her heart to that role, and she believed in it. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd we had some disagreements, but she was willing to reach out to the life community, to find common ground, and we did have so much common ground when it comes to issues like health care, that it was devastating. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd especially, I would say, even more so because of her experience with miscarriage, and knowing that she has lost a child and been through that experience. And then to have her ousted like that. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt was, I know it was painful for many of us. We\u0026#8217;re just, we\u0026#8217;re looking at this, and it\u0026#8217;s hard to imagine it. You just, you just feel terrible for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003edel Guidice: Well Catherine, thank you so much for being with us today on The Daily Signal podcast.

For example, a 2016 decision by the 9th Circuit court reinterpreted a 1997 court settlement to rule that when adults enter the country illegally, any child accompanying them must be released from immigration agencies’ custody within 20 days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e The U.S. asylum system is also easy to game. Many who enter illegally are able to pass the initial “credible fear” hearing and get released into the U.S. – but very few end up being granted asylum. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWith an easy-to-game asylum process and loopholes for bringing children to the border, the U.S.’s ability to manage its border and adjudicate claims was being overwhelmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Trump administration tried to plug these weaknesses through policies such as zero tolerance (also known as family separation), but these solutions were far from ideal and received widespread pushback. The administration ended them and began releasing anyone caught with a child. And so it became clear that because of the loopholes, bringing a child to the southern border was the golden ticket into the U.S. for illegal immigrants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe result was that the number of family units (adults with children) and unaccompanied children coming to the border spiked. In May, the U.S. reached a high of more than\u0026nbsp;140,000 individuals who were caught crossing illegally or turned back at legal ports of entry. That was\u0026nbsp;up from around 52,000 in May 2018 and just 20,000 in May 2017.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eImportantly, 70 percent are now family units or unaccompanied children, versus 40 percent in 2018 and just\u0026nbsp;over 20 percent in 2017, according to\u0026nbsp;Customs and Border Protection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWith a humanitarian disaster unfolding before our eyes, the Trump administration asked\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/house-of-representatives\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eCongress\u003c/a\u003e\u0026nbsp;to fix this untenable situation. Unfortunately, the progressive majority in the House refused. As a result, these loopholes remain embedded in our laws and court decisions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Trump administration, however, has refused to go along with this chaos. Over the past year, it\u0026nbsp;has published multiple policies and regulations to try to address the weaknesses in our laws. It has:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e1.

Decreased the availability of bond for asylum seekers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e3.

By not giving asylum seekers and those with children quick release into the U.S., the federal government is increasingly deterring illegal immigrants from making the dangerous journey in the first place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Wall Street Journal reports that apprehensions and those turned back at ports of entry declined to around 64,000 in August – less than half of May’s total, though still about 17,000 higher than in August 2018.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eYes, illegal immigration tends to naturally fall in the summer\u0026nbsp;as the heat discourages migrants from making the journey. But the fall over the past few months is sharper than previous years. Clearly, the new policies are having an impact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut it’s also clear that the policies themselves are not perfect. Some run afoul of other immigration laws; some may be excessively severe; most can’t address the entirety of the problem; and all such policies are ultimately temporary and can be undone by future administrations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Congress fiddles, the administration continues to reach for the tools at its disposal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eA far better solution would be legislation to fix these loopholes in a more permanent and measured way. Until calmer heads on the left can agree that illegal immigration should be stopped, imperfect solutions are better than none at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eOriginally published on \u003ca href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/border-patrol-arrests-immigration-policies\"\u003eFox News\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe post \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.dailysignal.com/2019/09/11/yes-border-patrol-arrests-are-down-but-our-immigration-policies-still-need-work/\"\u003eYes, Border Patrol Arrests Are Down But Our Immigration Policies Still Need Work\u003c/a\u003e appeared first on \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.dailysignal.com/\"\u003eThe Daily Signal\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://www.dailysignal.com/2019/09/11/yes-border-patrol-arrests-are-down-but-our-immigration-policies-still-need-work/?utm_source=rss\u0026utm_medium=rss\u0026utm_campaign=yes-border-patrol-arrests-are-down-but-our-immigration-policies-still-need-work","published":"2019-09-12T00:40:04Z","guid":"https://www.dailysignal.com/?p=561657"}]},{"url":"https://thinkprogress.org/feed","items":[]},{"url":"https://www.msnbc.com/feeds/latest","items":[{"title":"Is Congress currently conducting impeachment inquiry or not?

People just don't buy them anymore—especially in the US, where buyers have voted with their wallets for the higher seating position and compromised dynamic ability of the crossover. Which makes Audi's decision to finally bring its spicy RS6 Avant wagon to the US all the more remarkable. Truth be told, the news that one of the fastest wagons was US-bound actually slipped out of Audi HQ a little under a month ago, and since the model was on display at this year's Frankfurt auto show, it seemed wise to go take a closer look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe RS6 is a product of Audi Sport, the company's racing arm. Audi Sport takes the company's track-honed knowledge and also applies it to variants of the brand's more mundane models. More often than not, this results in some truly sublime automobiles which defy Audi's traditional reputation for building attractive cars that just aren't fun to drive; compare a \u003ca href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2015/11/a-retina-display-for-the-road-the-clever-new-2016-audi-tt-reviewed/\"\u003eTT\u003c/a\u003e to a \u003ca href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/09/audi-sports-rs3-and-tt-rs-the-same-engine-but-very-different-cars/\"\u003eTT-RS\u003c/a\u003e, for vivid proof of this.

A lot of the big stories about automotive technology at the moment seem to be focused on autonomous vehicles for private usage, but that leaves a large \u0026#8212; and largely legacy \u0026#8212; market in the form of fleet management and commercial vehicles. That\u0026#8217;s not to say it\u0026#8217;s been completely ignored, however.

Unnamed existing investors also participated.

(NEA had also been an investor but has more recently sold its stake.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmartDrive has been around since 2005 and focuses on a couple of key areas. Tapping data from the many sensors that you have today in commercial vehicles, it builds up a picture of how specific truckers are handling their vehicles, from their control on tricky roads to what gears and speed they are using as they go up inclines, and how long they idle their engines. The resulting data is used both to provide a better picture to fleet managers of that performance, and to highlight specific areas where the trucker can improve his performance, and how.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnalytics and data provided to customers include multi-camera 360-degree views, extended recording and U-turn triggering, along with diagnostics on specific driver performance. The company claims that the information has led to more satisfaction among drivers and customers, with driver retention rates of 70% or higher and improvements to 9 miles per gallon (mpg) on trips, versus industry averages of 20% driver retention and 6 mpg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is an exciting time at SmartDrive and in the transportation sector overall as adoption of video-based telematics continues to accelerate,” stated Steve Mitgang, SmartDrive CEO, in a statement. “Building on our pioneering video-based safety program, our vision of an open platform powering best-of-breed video, compliance and telematics applications is garnering significant traction across a diverse range of fleets given the benefits of choice, flexibility and a lower total cost of ownership. The investment from TPG Sixth Street Partners and our existing investors will fuel continued innovation in areas such as computer vision and AI, while also enhancing sales and marketing initiatives and further international expansion.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe focus for SmartDrive seems to be on how drivers are doing in specific circumstances: it doesn\u0026#8217;t seem to focus on whether there could have been better routes, or if better fleet management could have resulted in improved performance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“SmartDrive is a market leader in the large and expanding transportation safety and intelligence sector and we are pleased to be investing in a growing company led by such a talented team,” noted Bo Stanley, partner and co-head of the Capital Solutions business at TPG Sixth Street Partners, in a statement. “SmartDrive’s proprietary data analytics platform and strong subscriber base put it in a great position to continue to capitalize on its track record of innovation and the broader secular trend of higher demand for safer and smarter transportation.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"feedflare\"\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=bruovjXck-Y:bdojMuAZez0:2mJPEYqXBVI\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=bruovjXck-Y:bdojMuAZez0:7Q72WNTAKBA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=bruovjXck-Y:bdojMuAZez0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=bruovjXck-Y:bdojMuAZez0:-BTjWOF_DHI\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=bruovjXck-Y:bdojMuAZez0:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=bruovjXck-Y:bdojMuAZez0:D7DqB2pKExk\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=bruovjXck-Y:bdojMuAZez0:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=bruovjXck-Y:bdojMuAZez0:qj6IDK7rITs\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/bruovjXck-Y\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/bruovjXck-Y/","published":"2019-09-12T12:52:30Z","guid":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=1880709"}]},{"url":"https://www.theverge.com/rss/full.xml","items":[{"title":"HTC’s new Vive Cosmos VR headset arrives on October 3rd for $699","content":"\u003cimg alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dOlej6E0oDcxJ-LIK9KXr-jI2F4=/0x0:1320x880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/65230499/vivecosmos.0.jpg\" /\u003e\n\n\n  \u003cp id=\"kNZDbP\"\u003eHTC is releasing its PC-powered Vive Cosmos VR headset next month. Originally unveiled earlier this year at CES, the Cosmos is HTC’s latest bid at a mainstream VR headset. Unlike the original HTC Vive, the Cosmos doesn’t require external sensors and uses fully tracked motion controllers. HTC has also upgraded the LCD panels, with a combined 2,880 x 1,700 resolution, a 110-degree field-of-view, and even a 90Hz refresh rate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"6AGwNa\"\u003eHTC is using inside-out tracking on the Cosmos, and the headset also includes flip-up goggles so you can take a break from VR without having to remove the entire headset. The biggest new addition is a modular faceplate that allows you to customize the headset over time with extra functionality.

One devastating technique involves your homeless buddy launching himself into the air, taking a swig of god-knows-what from a bottle, and raining down hellfire on your unfortunate gangster opponents. Kasuga’s RPG infatuation also occasionally causes him to view regular human enemies as distorted, hulking monsters, much to his friends’ confusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"VY8cqZ\"\u003eI’m sure there will still be people who are disappointed at the move to what is essentially turn-based combat, but \u003cem\u003eLike a Dragon\u003c/em\u003e’s battles feel as dynamic as the series has ever been. The camera shifts smoothly from party members to combatants with cinematic framing, and everything plays out quickly so that the transitions from exploration to battles don’t feel jarring. Today’s demo wasn’t anywhere near enough time to evaluate the depth of the system, but I’m optimistic that it’ll be a fun new twist on \u003cem\u003eYakuza\u003c/em\u003e combat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"W4UyTc\"\u003eYou can see how it works in this new gameplay trailer:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"LUAZQS\"\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"\u003e\u003ciframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2rabEooWDC4?rel=0\" style=\"border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"encrypted-media; accelerometer; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"KKpJRv\"\u003eWatch that trailer long enough and you’ll come across details of \u003cem\u003eLike a Dragon\u003c/em\u003e’s new side activities, which look to be the most extensive in the series to date.

The company is working on a new news tab, and humans are going to edit it. Facebook is negotiating to pay publishers what are essentially licensing fees for news content — offering welcome and much-needed direct compensation to organizations that have struggled to compete with the Facebook-Google digital advertising duopoly. The new tab, which seems to be roughly modeled on Apple’s relatively uncontroversial \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/25/18277103/apple-news-subscription-service-launch-price-release-date-event-2019\"\u003enews service\u003c/a\u003e, will task editors with picking the day’s most important stories and organizing them.

In a copy of the letter obtained exclusively by National Review, Senators Josh Hawley (Mo.), Ted Cruz (Texas), Kevin Cramer (N.D.), and Mike Braun (Ind.) condemn what they call Facebook’s “pattern of censorship” and call on the group to submit to an external audit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ND0zqL\"\u003eAt the end of last month, Facebook notified Live Action that fact-checkers had given a “false” rating to two videos shared by the group’s president Lila Rose. One featured Rose herself and the other featured Dr. Kendra Kolb, a board-certified neonatologist; both videos included the claim that abortion is not medically necessary. After bestowing a “false” rating on the videos, Facebook prevented Rose and Live Action from promoting or advertising content and alerted users who had shared the two videos that they had spread “false news.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"e3IPLL\"\u003eThe \u003cem\u003eReview\u003c/em\u003e story omits some key context. Facebook didn’t fact-check Live Action itself; the fact-check was conducted by Science Feedback, a partner with domain-area expertise. \u003ca href=\"https://healthfeedback.org/claimreview/lila-rose-claim-that-abortion-is-never-medically-necessary-is-inaccurate-it-is-necessary-in-certain-cases-to-preserve-mothers-life-young-america-foundation/\"\u003eYou can read the fact-check here\u003c/a\u003e. The reviewers’ rationale for labeling the post in question false is straightforward. In the video under review, Rose says “abortion is never medically necessary.” In fact, it sometimes is. The reviewers write:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp id=\"BX8gIE\"\u003ePhysicians who evaluated this claim found it to be inaccurate. They explained that there are many medical conditions, such as \u003ca href=\"https://www.preeclampsia.org/health-information/about-preeclampsia\"\u003epre-eclampsia\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.preeclampsia.org/health-information/hellp-syndrome\"\u003eHELLP syndrome\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000900.htm\"\u003eplacenta previa\u003c/a\u003e, in which abortion could become medically necessary in order to save the life of the mother. Incidentally, abortion is medically defined as a \u003ca href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/abortion.html\"\u003eprocedure to end a pregnancy\u003c/a\u003e – this definition does not change depending on the reasons for an abortion, i.e. whether the procedure is motivated by an unwanted pregnancy or medical emergency or some other situation has no effect on its medical definition. However, Lila Rose redefines the meaning of abortion to exclude the cases when abortion is medically necessary in order to bolster her claim that “abortion is never medically necessary”. This is akin to the \u003ca href=\"https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/No_True_Scotsman\"\u003eNo True Scotsman\u003c/a\u003e fallacy in which the definition of a word/phrase is modified from its actual meaning to make a point. For example, Rose claims that treating an ectopic pregnancy is not an abortion, even though termination of the pregnancy is the result of the procedures that treat ectopic pregnancies.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"A9BkAl\"\u003eI trust the physicians on these points; the senators don’t. (The fact that one of the physician reviewers has performed abortions makes the fact-check more credible to me, not less.) But set aside your own beliefs on abortion for the moment, if you can. How can Facebook avoid charges of “bias” when the entire nature of editorial decision-making is to privilege one set of views over another?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Clt24s\"\u003eIt can’t, of course. Charges of bias are here to stay — and I imagine we’ll see many more Congressional hearings on the subject as lawmakers attempt to work the new refs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ALVC09\"\u003eEspecially because working the refs ... works. Here’s what Facebook had to say when I asked about the senators’ complaint:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp id=\"WQMQa7\"\u003e“Posts by Live Action and Lila Rose were fact-checked by a third party, independently certified by the International Fact Checking Network. We have been in touch with the IFCN which has opened an investigation to determine whether the fact checkers who rated this content did so by following procedures designed to ensure impartiality. While the IFCN investigates, we are removing the relevant fact checks and have communicated this to the members of the US Senate who brought this specific concern to our attention.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"npet9H\"\u003eSo one letter from Congress later, Rose’s false claim that abortions are never medically necessary is now free to circulate on Facebook until further notice. You can probably imagine what lesson the senators will take away from this. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"9rHqu6\"\u003eWhat happens when a story about abortion that senators dislike appears prominently in the new news tab? Will Facebook respect its editors’ news judgment and back them up? Or will it bow to the sensitivities of lawmakers? I understand the reluctance to let tech platforms shape the boundaries of public discourse. But I’d still rather have journalists deciding which journalism people should read than congressmen.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"oRw61e\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Ratio\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"X3e0QJ\"\u003e  \u003cstrong\u003eTrending down: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/11/technology/california-gig-economy-bill.html?action=click\u0026amp;module=Top%20Stories\u0026amp;pgtype=Homepage\u0026amp;utm_campaign=The%20Interface\u0026amp;utm_medium=email\u0026amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter\"\u003eCalifornia lawmakers approved a bill that requires app-based companies like \u003cstrong\u003eUber\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eLyft\u003c/strong\u003e to treat contractors as employees\u003c/a\u003e.

It sounds like a typical role-playing game, but \u003cem\u003eRing Fit Adventure\u003c/em\u003e is far from typical. You don’t explore and battle by using buttons and joysticks: instead, you exercise your way through a lush fantasy landscape. It’s like \u003cem\u003eWii Fit \u003c/em\u003ecrossed with \u003cem\u003eFinal Fantasy\u003c/em\u003e, and it \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/18/17253574/nintendo-labo-review-switch-learning-diy\"\u003esits alongside Labo\u003c/a\u003e as one of Nintendo’s most unexpectedly interesting experiments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"JoPPWV\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eRing Fit Adventure\u003c/em\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20851907/nintendo-new-motion-control-experience-switch-fitness-joy-con-controller-tease-september-12\"\u003ewhich Nintendo teased last week\u003c/a\u003e, launches in October for the Switch. It consists of three main pieces. There’s the game itself and two accessories: a leg strap and a flexible ring that Nintendo has dubbed the Ring-Con, which is essentially a high-tech resistance band. In order to use both, you need to slot a Joy-Con controller inside of each, and then you control the game primarily through your movements. I played through multiple sections of the game earlier this week, and the most surprising thing was how expansive and cohesive the experience felt. Yes, it’s exhausting and will make you sweat, but it’s also a large, fleshed-out adventure at the same time. And those two seemingly disparate elements never felt at odds with each other during my time with the game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"7KHaMJ\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eRing Fit Adventure\u003c/em\u003e is the first fitness-focused game I’ve ever played with an actual story. You play as a hero dressed like a gym rat, and you partner up with a sentient ring named Ring to fight off an incredibly swole purple dragon in a leotard, who is infecting the fantasy realm with darkness. (Nintendo says that the dragon was designed to represent the negative aspects of gym culture, like ultra competitiveness. In other words, he’s a fantastical bro.) The experience is structured sort of like a \u003cem\u003eSuper Mario\u003c/em\u003e game, as you go through a series of levels spread across different settings, punctuated by boss battles.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\"Ring Fit Adventure\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WS9ua_02aEiJwlDrwJKEt2cn2sM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19191044/Screen_5_copy.jpg\"\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"xbnOeF\"\u003eSo how exactly does a fitness adventure RPG work? First, you wrap the leg strap around your left leg, and then hold the ring in front of you sort of like a steering wheel. Each level is on rails, with a few branching paths to explore. To move forward, you jog on the spot, and you turn by pointing the ring in whatever direction you want. To move faster, you simply jog faster. If you reach an obstacle to jump over, you point the ring down, squeeze it to gain power, and then release in time to jump. As you run, you can shoot bursts of air to smash crates, which again is done by quickly squeezing the ring and pointing at your target. You can also vacuum up coins hidden in each level by stretching out the ring to suck them in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"e0wLYA\"\u003eIt can get intense even though the levels last just a few minutes; I found myself sweating after just two of them. You never really stop moving, and doing the various ring-related activities while simultaneously jogging is a decent workout. Things get even more challenging when you factor in the battles. They work sort of like a classic Japanese role-playing game. You’ll see an enemy in the level, and as soon as you touch it you’ll be thrust into turn-based combat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"TY6ENe\"\u003eTo attack, you can choose from a variety of exercises. To do one attack, I had to hold squats for a few seconds, following on-screen instructions, while another involved doing yoga-style poses on the ground. After a few reps, you then switch to defense: in order to fend off attacks, you stand, press the ring against your abdomen, and hold, forming a shield to absorb your enemy’s barrage. This repeats until either you or the bad guys are defeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"uJQUIR\"\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"\u003e\u003ciframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/F1orju1NsN8?rel=0\" style=\"border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"encrypted-media; accelerometer; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"iRaiGN\"\u003eFrom what I played, the RPG elements felt fairly deep. While I only had access to four attacks initially, you’re able to unlock more throughout the game, each color coded to match the type of exercise, like shoulders, legs, or cardio. Each color is strong against similarly colored enemies, essentially forcing you to switch up your routine and not focus exclusively on any one area of your body. A Nintendo rep told me that if you played for an hour a day, it’d take between three to four months to finish the campaign.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"fZXjDG\"\u003eDuring my time with the game, the accessories worked perfectly. The leg strap is simple enough, reminiscent of the strap from the 2009 Wii fitness game \u003cem\u003eEA Sports Active\u003c/em\u003e. I had to retighten the velcro strap a few times after vigorous jogging, but it was comfortable enough. The main attraction, though, is the aptly named Ring-Con. The Switch’s Joy-Con controller slots into it much the way it slides into the Switch itself. It’s a solid piece of kit that you can work hard; during certain portions of the game I had to really squeeze it, and it held up nicely.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\"Ring Fit Adventure\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V6WVluj6kaqwq3eMQYECPIL47KI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19191047/Tree_Pose.jpg\"\u003e\n      \u003ccite\u003ePhoto: Nintendo\u003c/cite\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ecB7Z2\"\u003eThere are two removable pads where your hands rest, and Nintendo says they’re washable, so you don’t have to worry too much about sweaty palms. The ring has sensors to keep track of your movements, while the Joy-Con’s IR sensor is used to measure your heartbeat after each level; you simply place your thumb over the sensor and hold it for a few seconds. (Nintendo says that the game will be compatible with the upcoming portable-only Switch Lite, but you’ll need to purchase separate Joy-Con, making it a somewhat pricey option.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"bWbNXd\"\u003eThere’s more to \u003cem\u003eRing Fit Adventure \u003c/em\u003ethan just the story mode. Outside of that, it starts to resemble something closer to a traditional fitness game.

I played one that was essentially whack-a-mole, except you had to hit moles in a circular level by rotating the ring to find them, and either squeezing or stretching the ring to squash them. Another was called “Squattery” and was exactly what the name implies: you do pottery by squatting. Squats would lower or raise your position on a lump of clay, and you could then squeeze the ring to shape it. The goal was to match a predetermined shape as closely as possible. It’s \u003cem\u003every\u003c/em\u003e hard. Thanks to a high score leaderboard, this mode feels almost like a fitness-oriented party game. \u003cem\u003eMario Party\u003c/em\u003e, but with cardio.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"MTIvi7\"\u003eDespite the generic name, \u003cem\u003eRing Fit Adventure\u003c/em\u003e looks and feels like a premium Nintendo experience.

Here are two examples of some of the smaller touches I noticed:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli id=\"1aLaTj\"\u003eThe game has a “quiet” mode, so that if you live in an apartment or want to play at night without waking anyone, you can do a series of squats instead of jogging to move through the levels.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli id=\"2uWXmo\"\u003eThe game offers fairly intuitive feedback during adventure mode. When you’re doing your workout correctly — jogging at the right speed, or following exercise instructions properly — your character’s hair will catch fire. The bigger the fire, the better you’re doing.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"maD5Oe\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eWii Fit\u003c/em\u003e remains one of Nintendo’s best-selling games. The original Wii titles sold a combined 43 million copies, and it’s clear the company wants to tap into that sizable market with \u003cem\u003eRing Fit Adventure\u003c/em\u003e. (Companies like Microsoft have attempted, \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/27/12044116/microsoft-xbox-fitness-shutdown\"\u003eand largely failed\u003c/a\u003e, to replicate that success.) The difference here, though, is that \u003cem\u003eRing Fit Adventure\u003c/em\u003e is much more of a typical video game, which could potentially help it reach not only fitness fans, but the millions of traditional Nintendo fans who already own a Switch. It’s a chance for the increasingly broad Switch audience to get even bigger. More than that, though, it feels quintessentially Nintendo: it’s unexpected, strange, and — most importantly — fun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"5XScqi\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eRing Fit Adventure\u003c/em\u003e launches on the Switch on October 18th for $79.99, including both the game and

sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe’re increasingly relying on artificial intelligence (AI) to automate elements of our daily lives, from issuing reminders to follow-up with important work tasks to regulating the temperature of our homes. Already, automation has started to take over jobs in the manufacturing sector, and with the explosion of AI on the near horizon, millions of people are worried their jobs, too, could be taken by a sufficiently sophisticated machine (or algorithm).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAI has innumerable benefits, namely saving time and increasing reliability and safety, but it also comes with downsides. AI could \u003ca href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/08/21/artificial-intelligence-a-tool-or-a-threat-to-cybersecurity/\"\u003eintroduce new security vulnerabilities\u003c/a\u003e into otherwise secure systems, and realistically could replace or displace millions of white-collar jobs once thought irreplaceable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo should you be thinking about the prospect of being replaced by an AI-driven algorithm? And if so, is there a way for you to AI-proof your career?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eThe High-Level View: AI Is Coming\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet’s start with a high-level assessment of the future of AI. AI is going to continue to advance, at rates that continue accelerating well into the future. In 2040, we may look back on the AI available today the same way our ubiquitous-internet-enjoying culture looks back on the internet of 1999.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEssentially, it’s conceivable that one day, far into the future, automation and AI will be capable of handling nearly any human responsibility. It’s more a question of when, not if, the AI takeover will be complete. Fortunately, by then, AI will be so embedded and so phenomenally powerful, our access to resources will be practically infinite and finding work may not be much of a problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut setting aside those sci-fi visions, it’s realistically safe to assume that AI will soon start bridging the gap between blue-collar and white-collar jobs. Already, automated algorithms are starting to handle responsibilities in journalism, pharmaceuticals, \u003ca href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/07/27/is-ai-going-to-benefit-hr-in-future/\"\u003ehuman resources\u003c/a\u003e, and law—areas once thought untouchable by AI.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn short, yes, you should be thinking about how AI will affect your career.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWhat AI Can’t Do Well\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat said, AI isn’t a perfect tool. AI and automation are much better than humans at executing rapid-fire, predictable functions, but there are some key areas in which AI tends to struggle, including:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbstract brainstorming and problem solving. \u003c/strong\u003eIf the problem is straightforward and puzzle-like, AI can likely solve it much better than a human. But humans are equipped with far superior abstract thinking capabilities. We, for lack of a better term, “think outside the box,” and can apply novel ideas to various situations. Accordingly, for the foreseeable future, we’ll likely remain better artists and more innovative problem solvers.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHuman interactions.\u003c/strong\u003e While there are some teams working on developing AI assistants (and even therapists) that can replicate basic human interactions, the fact remains people prefer to engage with other people, at least in certain industries. For example, when you’re buying a new home, you’ll want to have a real conversation with a \u003ca href=\"https://www.realestateu.tv/how-to-become-a-real-estate-agent-in-pennsylvania/\"\u003equalified real estate agent\u003c/a\u003e, and when you’re struggling with a mental health issue, you’ll want to speak with a human being sitting across from you. Accordingly, jobs that are heavily dependent on human interaction will likely be protected for some time.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSituations with many (or unpredictable) variables.\u003c/strong\u003e AI performs best in situations with firm, unbreakable rules, and the fewer rules there are, the better. When you get into situations with an increasing number of variables, or when those variables become unpredictable, AI begins to struggle. Accordingly, the higher up the management chain you go, the less likely it is that AI will be capable of handling the responsibilities.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eReplacement or Displacement?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou should also consider the question of whether AI has the potential of truly replacing your job, or simply displacing it. There are experts on both sides of the argument here, and different industries and different positions may come to different conclusions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFearing the rise of new technology isn’t a new concept; people have been afraid of losing their jobs to machines for hundreds of years. We often use the term “luddite” to describe someone who’s irrationally afraid of (or reluctant to use) new technology, but the term originates as a way of describing textile workers who were afraid that textile machines would make their work irrelevant. We look back on this phase of industrialization with some degree of humor. We know that most workers weren’t replaced by machines; instead, they simply began to use the machines as part of their jobs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis could be the near future for many positions; rather than having entire positions and businesses replaced by machines, individuals and organizations will be \u003ca href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/08/27/how-to-tame-artificial-intelligence-a-brief-guide-for-business/\"\u003eembracing and integrating AI\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven so, if you’re worried about the future of your career due to the pressure created by AI, there are some strategies you can adopt to AI-proof your career.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eAI-Proofing: Learning to Love the Machine\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of your best options is \u003ca href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/08/27/why-now-is-the-time-for-marketers-to-embrace-ai/\"\u003elearning to embrace AI\u003c/a\u003e, rather than trying to fight or avoid it. Business owners are going to be incentivized to integrate AI as much as possible in their enterprises, but they’re going to need help to do it. If you position yourself to take advantage of AI to make your own position more valuable, you’re going to strongly benefit from AI—rather than just being threatened by it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can put yourself in a better position by learning more about the up-and-coming AI applications in your industry, and becoming more knowledgeable about their integration. In some industries, you may even be able to learn more about developing and modifying AI systems. If you feel your job is truly under threat, you could change careers altogether, learning development and working on AI systems of your own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eAI-Proofing: Incorporating AI-Challenging Skills\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can also work to AI-proof your career by incorporating more skills into your work that are challenging for AI. There are several ways you could hypothetically do this. For starters, you could make a vertical move; advancing to more managerial and leadership positions will make it harder for AI to encroach on your territory. Supervisory and management roles require juggling many unpredictable variables, and sometimes engaging in abstract thinking. AI systems tend to struggle with these types of responsibilities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou could also make a horizontal move, learning new skills in your current role or changing industries to a position that’s less likely to be threatened by an automated algorithm. For example, you could try to transition to a role that involves more direct human interactions, or you could go back to school to start a new career in a field that’s less likely to automated in the near future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eAI-Proofing: Diversifying Your Career\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo matter how far you think ahead or how thoroughly you brainstorm, the future of AI is still somewhat unpredictable. It may encroach on far more jobs than we originally thought, or may turn out to be an entirely negligible threat. Either way, you can improve your career trajectory by diversifying your skillset, and diversifying your potential career options.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, you might start learning new marketable skills in many different categories—even if they don’t directly apply to your current career.

Already, automation has started to take over jobs in the manufacturing sector, and with the explosion of AI on the near horizon, millions of people are worried their jobs, too, could be taken by a sufficiently sophisticated machine (or algorithm).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAI has innumerable benefits, namely saving time and increasing reliability and safety, but it also comes with downsides. AI could \u003ca href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/08/21/artificial-intelligence-a-tool-or-a-threat-to-cybersecurity/\"\u003eintroduce new security vulnerabilities\u003c/a\u003e into otherwise secure systems, and realistically could replace or displace millions of white-collar jobs once thought irreplaceable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo should you be thinking about the prospect of being replaced by an AI-driven algorithm? And if so, is there a way for you to AI-proof your career?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eThe High-Level View: AI Is Coming\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet’s start with a high-level assessment of the future of AI. AI is going to continue to advance, at rates that continue accelerating well into the future. In 2040, we may look back on the AI available today the same way our ubiquitous-internet-enjoying culture looks back on the internet of 1999.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEssentially, it’s conceivable that one day, far into the future, automation and AI will be capable of handling nearly any human responsibility. It’s more a question of when, not if, the AI takeover will be complete. Fortunately, by then, AI will be so embedded and so phenomenally powerful, our access to resources will be practically infinite and finding work may not be much of a problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut setting aside those sci-fi visions, it’s realistically safe to assume that AI will soon start bridging the gap between blue-collar and white-collar jobs. Already, automated algorithms are starting to handle responsibilities in journalism, pharmaceuticals, \u003ca href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/07/27/is-ai-going-to-benefit-hr-in-future/\"\u003ehuman resources\u003c/a\u003e, and law—areas once thought untouchable by AI.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn short, yes, you should be thinking about how AI will affect your career.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWhat AI Can’t Do Well\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat said, AI isn’t a perfect tool. AI and automation are much better than humans at executing rapid-fire, predictable functions, but there are some key areas in which AI tends to struggle, including:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbstract brainstorming and problem solving. \u003c/strong\u003eIf the problem is straightforward and puzzle-like, AI can likely solve it much better than a human. But humans are equipped with far superior abstract thinking capabilities. We, for lack of a better term, “think outside the box,” and can apply novel ideas to various situations. Accordingly, for the foreseeable future, we’ll likely remain better artists and more innovative problem solvers.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHuman interactions.\u003c/strong\u003e While there are some teams working on developing AI assistants (and even therapists) that can replicate basic human interactions, the fact remains people prefer to engage with other people, at least in certain industries. For example, when you’re buying a new home, you’ll want to have a real conversation with a \u003ca href=\"https://www.realestateu.tv/how-to-become-a-real-estate-agent-in-pennsylvania/\"\u003equalified real estate agent\u003c/a\u003e, and when you’re struggling with a mental health issue, you’ll want to speak with a human being sitting across from you. Accordingly, jobs that are heavily dependent on human interaction will likely be protected for some time.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSituations with many (or unpredictable) variables.\u003c/strong\u003e AI performs best in situations with firm, unbreakable rules, and the fewer rules there are, the better. When you get into situations with an increasing number of variables, or when those variables become unpredictable, AI begins to struggle. Accordingly, the higher up the management chain you go, the less likely it is that AI will be capable of handling the responsibilities.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eReplacement or Displacement?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou should also consider the question of whether AI has the potential of truly replacing your job, or simply displacing it. There are experts on both sides of the argument here, and different industries and different positions may come to different conclusions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFearing the rise of new technology isn’t a new concept; people have been afraid of losing their jobs to machines for hundreds of years. We often use the term “luddite” to describe someone who’s irrationally afraid of (or reluctant to use) new technology, but the term originates as a way of describing textile workers who were afraid that textile machines would make their work irrelevant. We look back on this phase of industrialization with some degree of humor. We know that most workers weren’t replaced by machines; instead, they simply began to use the machines as part of their jobs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis could be the near future for many positions; rather than having entire positions and businesses replaced by machines, individuals and organizations will be \u003ca href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/08/27/how-to-tame-artificial-intelligence-a-brief-guide-for-business/\"\u003eembracing and integrating AI\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven so, if you’re worried about the future of your career due to the pressure created by AI, there are some strategies you can adopt to AI-proof your career.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eAI-Proofing: Learning to Love the Machine\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of your best options is \u003ca href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/08/27/why-now-is-the-time-for-marketers-to-embrace-ai/\"\u003elearning to embrace AI\u003c/a\u003e, rather than trying to fight or avoid it. Business owners are going to be incentivized to integrate AI as much as possible in their enterprises, but they’re going to need help to do it. If you position yourself to take advantage of AI to make your own position more valuable, you’re going to strongly benefit from AI—rather than just being threatened by it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can put yourself in a better position by learning more about the up-and-coming AI applications in your industry, and becoming more knowledgeable about their integration. In some industries, you may even be able to learn more about developing and modifying AI systems. If you feel your job is truly under threat, you could change careers altogether, learning development and working on AI systems of your own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eAI-Proofing: Incorporating AI-Challenging Skills\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can also work to AI-proof your career by incorporating more skills into your work that are challenging for AI. There are several ways you could hypothetically do this. For starters, you could make a vertical move; advancing to more managerial and leadership positions will make it harder for AI to encroach on your territory. Supervisory and management roles require juggling many unpredictable variables, and sometimes engaging in abstract thinking. AI systems tend to struggle with these types of responsibilities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou could also make a horizontal move, learning new skills in your current role or changing industries to a position that’s less likely to be threatened by an automated algorithm. For example, you could try to transition to a role that involves more direct human interactions, or you could go back to school to start a new career in a field that’s less likely to automated in the near future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eAI-Proofing: Diversifying Your Career\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo matter how far you think ahead or how thoroughly you brainstorm, the future of AI is still somewhat unpredictable. It may encroach on far more jobs than we originally thought, or may turn out to be an entirely negligible threat. Either way, you can improve your career trajectory by diversifying your skillset, and diversifying your potential career options.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, you might start learning new marketable skills in many different categories—even if they don’t directly apply to your current career. You could also start taking on a small collection of different side gigs. That way, if any of your income streams or skills come under threat, you can easily transition to something else. This approach leaves you with the most flexibility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvidence that your job could be feasibly replaced by a sufficiently powerful AI algorithm or machine is mixed, but AI is certainly going to become more sophisticated in the future. If you’re worried about the future of your career, or if you just want to maximize your potential over the next few decades, the aforementioned strategies can all help you “AI-proof” your career, at

After the reconnaissance team finished surveilling the airfield, Marines with Echo Company, Battalion Landing Team, 2nd Battalion,1st Marines, vertically inserted via MV-22B Osprey tiltrotor aircraft from the USS Wasp (LHD 1) more than 250 miles away, rapidly seizing the objective in just over one hour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter perimeter security was set at the airfield, a CH-53E Super Stallion air-delivered three crates with the Helicopter Expeditionary Refueling System equipment necessary to establish a FARP.

Rockets are fired straight away from containers. Each disposable container holds 6 rockets. Rockets can be stored in containers without any maintenance for up to ten years. Vehicle carries two such containers with a total of 12 rockets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe MLRS launcher unit comprises an M270 launcher loaded with 12 rockets, packaged in two six-rocket pods or two pods for MGM-140 ATACMS surface-to-surface missiles. Mounted on a stretched Bradley chassis, the launcher is a highly automated self-loading and self-aiming system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout leaving the cab, the crew of three: a driver, gunner and section chief can fire up to 12 MLRS rockets in fewer than 60 seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRockets can be fired individually or in ripples of two to 12. Accuracy is maintained in all firing modes, because the computer re-aims the launcher between rounds. The MLRS computerized fire control system enables a reduced crew, or even a single Soldier to load and unload the launcher. A portable boom control device and cable hook assembly is used for loading and unloading. The fire control computer allows firing missions to be carried out either manually or automatically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_45434\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-45434\"

Climate-change effects increasingly interact with drivers of conflict, exacerbating refugee situations in countries like Chad, Sudan and Somalia. In such situations, refugee-law frameworks may apply. But ignoring our legal responsibilities toward refugees will only deepen human suffering and heighten global displacement. The new Global Compact on Refugees, adopted this year by the U.N.

Dozens of privately and publicly funded rewilding projects have popped up across the continent. Europeans are reviving coastal habitats like Wallasea in the U.K., reversing the drainage of peatland bogs in Germany and replanting forests in the Scottish Highlands. The projects not only sequester carbon but also boost biodiversity and help the land adapt to the changing climate by preventing floods and wildfires.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdvocates of nature restoration say those benefits give rewilding an edge over simple tree planting, which has been popular with European governments for decades. From 2005 to 2015, Europe\u0026rsquo;s forest cover grew by the equivalent of 1,900 football fields every day, as the E.U. spent several billion euros to fund tree planting, often on farmland that had been abandoned because of changing agricultural practices in places like France and Italy. Some of that was reforestation, using native species to restore forests to what they were before, but much of it was so-called afforestation, the planting of many of one species of tree where there was none before, in regular lines. Many afforested trees are regularly cut down and used to produce timber, paper or biofuel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRewilding advocates say afforestation, while offering similar carbon-sequestration capacity to reforestation, offers little benefit to wildlife and carries risks. Studies have found that the large-scale planting of nonnative trees in Canada and China have disturbed natural ecosystems, worsened wildfires and depleted groundwater levels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, other landscapes have been neglected. \u0026ldquo;I think politicians like planting trees because it\u0026rsquo;s a very clear, simple action,\u0026rdquo; says Timon Rutten, head of enterprise at Rewilding Europe, a Netherlands-based NGO that oversees nature-restoration schemes from Portugal to Bulgaria. \u0026ldquo;But peatlands, wetlands and grasslands are just as good or sometimes even better at storing carbon.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"video-container\"\u003e\u003cvideo id=\"brightcove-player-6084989351001\" data-video-id=\"6084989351001\" data-account=\"293884104\" data-player=\"SJa0Thl7\" data-embed=\"default\" controls preload=\"auto\" class=\"video-js responsive-video\"\u003e\u003c/video\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNorthern European countries shelter large expanses of peatlands\u0026mdash;sometimes called moors, bogs or mires\u0026mdash;that perhaps offer the greatest opportunity for natural climate mitigation. The plants that grow on the surface of peatlands sequester, or absorb, carbon dioxide as they grow. When they die, the decomposing plants do not leach carbon back into the atmosphere but get buried in waterlogged bogs, compressing into a new layer of peat. These habitats cover about 3% of the globe but contain more stored carbon than all other kinds of vegetation on earth combined. They sequester 370 million metric tons of CO\u0026#8322; per year. But 15% of the world\u0026rsquo;s peatlands have been drained for agricultural use, or so that their peat could be burned to power generators, emitting carbon dioxide in the process. The dried-out peatland that\u0026rsquo;s left behind then releases stored carbon into the atmosphere; peatlands now account for \u003ca href=\"https://www.iucn.org/resources/issues-briefs/peatlands-and-climate-change\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003ealmost 6% of annual global human-caused carbon emissions.\u003c/a\u003e E.U.-funded rewilding projects in Finland, the U.K. and Germany are rewetting peatlands to turn them back into carbon sinks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRewilding advocates are competing for investment with more modern negative-emissions technologies. Dozens of companies are developing carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, in which machines use chemical processes to filter CO\u0026#8322; out of the air. The gas is then used to make products or stored underground, removing it from the atmosphere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwiss startup Climeworks, for example, scrubs CO\u0026#8322; from the air at plants in Italy, Switzerland and Iceland, \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/12/magazine/climeworks-business-climate-change.html\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003eat a cost of $500 to $600 per metric ton of CO\u0026#8322;.\u003c/a\u003e It is then sold for use in greenhouses, soda manufacturing and biofuel production, or stored in rocks deep underground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut most IPCC plans for preventing more than 1.5\u0026deg;C of warming include a different kind of CCS: bioenergy and carbon capture and storage (BECCS), which should account for the majority of negative emissions by the end of the century. BECCS power stations burn trees and plants\u0026mdash;which have sequestered carbon while growing\u0026mdash;to produce electricity, then trap the resulting CO\u0026#8322; emissions. The U.K. government has invested $32 million in domestic BECCS projects, including the first pilot program to launch in the E.U., the \u003ca href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-47163840\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003eDrax power station in the U.K.\u003c/a\u003e, which went online in February.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCurrently, these high-tech methods for removing carbon from the atmosphere are expensive and so have limited reach. Rewilding, at least at the moment, is cheaper and more proven.

The mudflats and salt marshes at Wallasea currently bury around 1,200 metric tons of CO\u0026#8322; a year\u0026mdash;the equivalent of the per capita emissions of only around 200 Brits in 2018.

Now, as concerns mount about the impact of climate change on the Sahel, the semiarid band of grassland south of the Sahara that is already one of the most impoverished regions on earth, the Great Green Wall is filling a new role. The goal now, say its designers, is to transform the lives of millions living on the front line of climate change by restoring agricultural land ruined by decades of overuse; when done, it should provide food, stem conflict and discourage migration. When the project is completed in 2030, the restored land is expected to absorb some 250 million metric tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, the equivalent of keeping all of California\u0026rsquo;s cars parked for 3\u0026frac12; years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver the course of a week, the volunteers descending upon the Senegalese village of Mbar Toubab will try to turn 494 acres of barren land into another forested brick in the Great Green Wall. There is only one problem: the annual rains have yet to arrive, and without them, none of the seedlings will take root. \u0026ldquo;The rain used to come in June. Here we are in August, and still there is no rain,\u0026rdquo; says El Hadj Goudiaby, who has spent the past nine years overseeing Great Green Wall projects in Mbar Toubab for Senegal\u0026rsquo;s forestry department. How is it possible, he asks, to grow trees to combat climate change if climate change is making it impossible to grow trees?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe answer may have more to do with changing attitudes than changing the landscape. When people think of potential fixes for global warming, they tend to focus on big projects. But if human activity is at the root of climate change, whether it be the carbon emissions of the industrialized world or the overgrazing of the Sahel, then that is where the solution lies as well. Environmentalists celebrate the Great Green Wall for its epic territorial ambition, but its biggest impact will come from allowing people to meet their needs without destroying nature in the process. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"inline-portrait_small_2x alignnone \"\u003e\u003cimg data-attachment-id=\"5671279\" data-permalink=\"https://time.com/5669033/great-green-wall-africa/senegal-great-green-wall-02/\" data-orig-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/senegal-great-green-wall-02.jpg?quality=85\" data-orig-size=\"2400,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5.6\",\"credit\":\"Jane Hahn\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark III\",\"caption\":\"Land in Mbar Toubab, Senegal, which was plowed in anticipation of the planting of seedlings for the Great Green Wall\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1564922554\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"24\",\"iso\":\"2000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.000125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"climate-change-senegal-great-green-wall-02\" data-image-description=\"pLand in Mbar Toubab, Senegal, which was plowed in anticipation of the planting of seedlings for the Great Green Wall./p\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/senegal-great-green-wall-02.jpg?quality=85\u0026w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/senegal-great-green-wall-02.jpg?quality=85\u0026w=600\" src=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/senegal-great-green-wall-02.jpg?w=560\u0026#038;quality=85\" alt=\"Land in Mbar Toubab, Senegal, which was plowed in anticipation of the planting of seedlings for the Great Green Wall\" class=\"size-portrait_small_2x wp-image-5671279\" srcset=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/senegal-great-green-wall-02.jpg?w=560\u0026amp;quality=85 560w, https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/senegal-great-green-wall-02.jpg?w=1120\u0026amp;quality=85 1120w, https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/senegal-great-green-wall-02.jpg?w=150\u0026amp;quality=85 150w, https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/senegal-great-green-wall-02.jpg?w=300\u0026amp;quality=85 300w, https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/senegal-great-green-wall-02.jpg?w=768\u0026amp;quality=85 768w, https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/senegal-great-green-wall-02.jpg?w=600\u0026amp;quality=85 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px\"\u003e\n\u003cfigcaption class=\"image-caption\" \u003e\u003cspan class=\"credit\" \u003eJane Hahn for TIME\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"caption\" \u003eLand in Mbar Toubab, Senegal, which was plowed in anticipation of the planting of seedlings for the Great Green Wall.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Sahara isn\u0026rsquo;t expanding so much as the Sahel is shrinking, destroyed by decades of overgrazing, climate-change-induced drought and poor farming practices that have stripped the once lush grasslands of the fertile topsoil needed to regenerate. Cattle herders resort to the few remaining trees for animal fodder, denuding the landscape even further in a downward spiral of desertification. Planting trees not only reduces carbon on a global scale\u0026mdash;research in the journal Science estimates planting more than 2 billion acres of trees could remove two-thirds of all the emissions that human activity has pumped into the atmosphere since the Industrial Revolution\u0026shy;\u0026mdash;it also recharges the water table and creates micro\u0026shy;climates that increase local rainfall. (For more on rewilding and carbon reduction, \u003ca href=\"https://time.com/5669025/rewild-land-europe/\"  rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eclick here.\u003c/a\u003e) But if pastoralists have nothing to feed their herds in the time it takes those trees to mature, they are likely to use the saplings, starting the cycle all over again. Which is why, though it may not sound like much, the solution to climate change in the Sahel starts with getting grass to grow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;If we can solve people\u0026rsquo;s problems by improving their living conditions now,\u0026rdquo; says Goudiaby, \u0026ldquo;they will be able to help themselves by protecting the trees that protect their future.\u0026rdquo; After all, stopping global warming isn\u0026rsquo;t about saving the planet; the earth will survive no matter how much the climate changes. It\u0026rsquo;s about saving humanity. One way to do that is by helping those who are most vulnerable to what chaos we have already created.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust 25 miles south of Mbar Toubab, near the village of Koyli Alpha, 50-year-old Dienaba Aka pulls her heavily laden donkey cart to the side of the road. She and her extended family have spent the day cutting grass in a \u0026ldquo;forage bank\u0026rdquo; managed by the national Great Green Wall agency. For the past eight months, the 1,700-acre field has been fenced off to let the grass, along with 250,000 saplings, grow undisturbed by the cattle, sheep and goats that roam free in this region. The field reopened in July, and now herders pay $1.70 a day to harvest the waist-high grass for their cattle until the rains bring new grazing opportunities. For Aka, the idea of a grass \u0026ldquo;bank\u0026rdquo; is a radical departure from an itinerant childhood spent following the family herd in search of forage. Now she can feed her cattle in the lean season without stripping trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"inline-portrait_small_2x alignnone \"\u003e\u003cimg data-attachment-id=\"5671289\" data-permalink=\"https://time.com/5669033/great-green-wall-africa/weeding-in-koyli-alpha/\" data-orig-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/senegal-great-green-wall-03-1.jpg?quality=85\" data-orig-size=\"2400,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"Jane Hahn\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark III\",\"caption\":\"Weeding in Koyli Alpha\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1564784636\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"30\",\"iso\":\"640\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0002\",\"title\":\"Weeding in Koyli Alpha\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"climate-change-senegal-great-green-wall-03\" data-image-description=\"pWeeding in Koyli Alpha./p\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/senegal-great-green-wall-03-1.jpg?quality=85\u0026w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/senegal-great-green-wall-03-1.jpg?quality=85\u0026w=600\" src=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/senegal-great-green-wall-03-1.jpg?w=560\u0026#038;quality=85\" alt=\"Weeding in Koyli Alpha\" class=\"size-portrait_small_2x wp-image-5671289\" srcset=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/senegal-great-green-wall-03-1.jpg?w=560\u0026amp;quality=85 560w, https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/senegal-great-green-wall-03-1.jpg?w=1120\u0026amp;quality=85 1120w, https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/senegal-great-green-wall-03-1.jpg?w=150\u0026amp;quality=85 150w, https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/senegal-great-green-wall-03-1.jpg?w=300\u0026amp;quality=85 300w, https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/senegal-great-green-wall-03-1.jpg?w=768\u0026amp;quality=85 768w, https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/senegal-great-green-wall-03-1.jpg?w=600\u0026amp;quality=85 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px\"\u003e\n\u003cfigcaption class=\"image-caption\" \u003e\u003cspan class=\"credit\" \u003eJane Hahn for TIME\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"caption\" \u003eWeeding in Koyli Alpha.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAka, like women from many villages in the region, has been planting trees for the GGW project since 2012. She earns $96 during the six-week planting season. It\u0026rsquo;s good money, she says, but most women do it because they have been told it will bring back the rain, which in turn brings the grass that feeds their livestock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is another advantage to forage banking, Aka says, gazing proudly at her two 10-year-old nieces perched atop several bags of recently cut grass. \u0026ldquo;Before\u0026shy; the Great Green Wall, the kids had to go with us when we took the cattle to graze. Now they can stay in school.\u0026rdquo; In Mbar Toubab, the fees collected from last year\u0026rsquo;s forage bank paid for solar panels to power classrooms. This year they will cover construction of a dormitory for students who live too far to walk every day. The circular investment is part of the plan, says Goudiaby. \u0026ldquo;If we can make the children aware of the consequences of our actions today, they will teach the next generation.\u0026rdquo; \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe seedlings in Senegal\u0026rsquo;s reforesting projects are usually locally sourced and selected for their drought resistance and hardiness. Thorny desert acacias carry their own protection from grazing animals, and in the dry season they shed their leaves to conserve moisture. Once baobabs take root, they are long-lived even under drought conditions. Their bark can be used to make rope, their leaves are edible, and their foot-long fruit can either be juiced or ground up and roasted to make a coffee-like drink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFruit trees are often overlooked in reforestation schemes that prioritize hardiness, and that needs to change, says Ali Haider, the incoming director of Senegal\u0026rsquo;s Great Green Wall agency. \u0026ldquo;If you give someone a tree that she doesn\u0026rsquo;t need, she won\u0026rsquo;t take care of it.\u0026rdquo; Give her something she values instead, he says, something she can cook, sell or use for medicine. \u0026ldquo;Then she will protect it because it improves her life.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of Senegal\u0026rsquo;s GGW agency projects do just that on a grand scale, like investing in gum arabic plantations for export. Since Senegal\u0026rsquo;s first sapling in the Great Green Wall took root in 2008, the national agency says it has planted 18 \u0026shy;million trees on 99,000 acres of restored land. Nine market gardens are up and running, and three times as many forage banks are keeping cattle fed in the lean season. Gazelles, jackals, desert tortoises and songbirds\u0026mdash;not seen in the region for years\u0026mdash;are returning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of that amounts to very little compared with the scale of the overall problem, says Chris Reij, a senior fellow at the World Resources Institute who has been working on desertification in the Sahel since 1978. Even if 99,000 acres have been reforested in Senegal, a figure he thinks is likely inflated, the acreage of forested land disappearing because of logging, agri\u0026shy;culture and construction in other parts of the country is many times higher, he says. \u0026ldquo;So unless you do something about that, you are still losing the battle.\u0026rdquo; Nor does he think massive plantations are the solution. The survival rate of planted trees in arid regions like the Sahel hovers around 20%. \u0026ldquo;If all the trees that have been planted in the Sahel since 1980 had survived, it would look like the Amazon by now,\u0026rdquo; he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoudiaby concedes that planting trees on the edge of the Sahara may not be the most cost-effective solution to climate change. But given time, he says, it works. Over the nine years he has been working the plots of Mbar Toubab, he estimates a 70% survival rate. A walk through one of the earliest plantations in the area does show signs of progress. Some of the trees are 10 ft. to 12 ft. tall, and though it\u0026rsquo;s not exactly a forest, it\u0026rsquo;s certainly not barren land either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"inline-portrait_small_2x alignnone \"\u003e\u003cimg data-attachment-id=\"5671290\" data-permalink=\"https://time.com/5669033/great-green-wall-africa/senegal-great-green-wall-04/\" data-orig-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/senegal-great-green-wall-04-1.jpg?quality=85\" data-orig-size=\"2400,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4.5\",\"credit\":\"Jane Hahn\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark III\",\"caption\":\"enegal- El Haji Gouebiaby, Base Chief for the Great Green Wall, stands beside a growing lemo; a base chief for the Great Green Wall tends to a lemon tree in Mbar Toubab\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1564924179\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"24\",\"iso\":\"2000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.000125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"climate-change-senegal-great-green-wall-04\" data-image-description=\"pEl Haji Gouebiaby, Base Chief for the Great Green Wall, stands beside a growing lemon tree in Mbar Toubab. /p\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/senegal-great-green-wall-04-1.jpg?quality=85\u0026w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/senegal-great-green-wall-04-1.jpg?quality=85\u0026w=600\" src=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/senegal-great-green-wall-04-1.jpg?w=560\u0026#038;quality=85\" alt=\"enegal- El Haji Gouebiaby, Base Chief for the Great Green Wall, stands beside a growing lemo; a base chief for the Great Green Wall tends to a lemon tree in Mbar Toubab\" class=\"size-portrait_small_2x wp-image-5671290\" srcset=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/senegal-great-green-wall-04-1.jpg?w=560\u0026amp;quality=85 560w, https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/senegal-great-green-wall-04-1.jpg?w=1120\u0026amp;quality=85 1120w, https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/senegal-great-green-wall-04-1.jpg?w=150\u0026amp;quality=85 150w, https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/senegal-great-green-wall-04-1.jpg?w=300\u0026amp;quality=85 300w, https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/senegal-great-green-wall-04-1.jpg?w=768\u0026amp;quality=85 768w, https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/senegal-great-green-wall-04-1.jpg?w=600\u0026amp;quality=85 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px\"\u003e\n\u003cfigcaption class=\"image-caption\" \u003e\u003cspan class=\"credit\" \u003eJane Hahn for TIME\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"caption\" \u003eEl Haji Gouebiaby, Base Chief for the Great Green Wall, stands beside a growing lemon tree in Mbar Toubab. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReij argues it would be more cost-effective to restore the original grasslands, which are almost as good at capturing carbon. Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger, for example, are fencing off large areas to allow the land to recover from the effects of overgrazing over time. In agricultural areas, farmers are being taught to plant around existing trees and sprouts, rather than plowing them over. The result, says Reij, \u0026ldquo;has been mind-blowing,\u0026rdquo; with 12 million acres regreened in Niger over the past 30 years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one approach is better than the other, says Ibrahim Thiaw, the executive secretary of the U.N. Convention to Combat Desertification. Whether countries plant trees or promote grasslands, the end result is 21 African nations are working together to combat climate change and make people\u0026rsquo;s lives better in the Sahel. His biggest concern is that so far, only 15% of the proposed area has been restored. Some of the delays are because of a lack of funding. Senegal spends $200 million a year on planting and caring for its section of the wall; poorer nations of the alliance can\u0026rsquo;t afford even that. Only half the $8 billion pledged for the project has come through, largely because other climate emergencies are drawing attention away from the Sahel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLong-term, says Thiaw, the impact of climate change on one of the world\u0026rsquo;s most impoverished regions will have global repercussions. Some 150 million people live in the Sahel, nearly two-thirds under age 25, and the region has the highest birth rate in the world. The World Bank predicts climate change will force about 85 million sub-Saharan Africans to migrate, many to under-resourced urban enclaves in the region, while a significant number will attempt the deadly passage to Europe and the Gulf countries in search of opportunity. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s a time bomb,\u0026rdquo; says Thiaw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ciframe title=\"Africa\" aria-label=\"Locator Maps\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/9u83x/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"600\" height=\"907\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe immediate risks are equally troubling. Across the region, governments have lost local control to extremist groups such as Boko Haram, al-Qaeda and the Islamic State. Some 4.2 million people have been displaced by drought and conflict, particularly in the region bordering Lake Chad, which used to supply fresh water and livelihoods to nearly 30 million people but has shrunk by 90% because of climate change and overuse. The lack of economic prospects provides rich recruiting prospects for Boko Haram, which can dangle employment and goods that are otherwise unavailable. Dennis Garrity, the Drylands ambassador to the U.N. Convention to Combat Desertification, likens conditions in the Sahel to those in the impoverished, ungoverned swaths of Pakistan and Afghanistan that were the font of global terrorism two decades ago. \u0026ldquo;The Sahel is not only the area most vulnerable to climate change in the world, it is also the region where terrorism and extremism are growing most rapidly,\u0026rdquo; he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rains finally came to Mbar Toubab on Aug. 19, a full month later than the year before. There wasn\u0026rsquo;t much, but it was enough for the volunteers to get started, and by the time they left, 88,000 seedlings had been carefully set into the ground. The irony of people flying in from as far away as Hong Kong to plant trees to combat climate change, which is exacerbated in part by transcontinental flights, is not lost on Goudiaby. \u0026ldquo;Maybe they are making up for climate sins they have committed back in their home countries,\u0026rdquo; he proposes, a kind of climatic reparation. The countries of the Sahel contribute least to global warming, yet they reap the worst repercussions of the wealth generated by more industrialized nations. It only seems fair, he says, that members of those nations come to Senegal to pay their debts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr /\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is one article in a series on the state of the planet\u0026rsquo;s response to climate change. \u003ca href=\"https://time.com/climate-change-solutions\" \u003eRead the rest of the stories\u003c/a\u003e and sign up for \u003ca href=\"https://cloud.newsletters.time.com/newsletters/?newsletter_name=climate\u0026amp;source=article-climate-footer\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eOne.Five, TIME\u0026#8217;s climate change newsletter.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/time/world/~4/LYZLfagdMz8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/world/~3/LYZLfagdMz8/","published":"2019-09-12T11:14:36Z","guid":"http://time.com/?p=5669033"},{"title":"Israel’s Netanyahu Vowed to Annex a Large Part of the West Bank.

The Israel Policy Forum (IFP), a Jewish American organization that advocates for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict said in a statement that annexation, no matter how partial, \u0026ldquo;would have disastrous consequences for Israel, its security, and its status as a Jewish and democratic state.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, Netanyahu\u0026#8217;s main election opponent, \u003ca href=\"https://time.com/5546771/benjamin-netanyahu-benny-gantz-israel-prime-minister/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eBenny Gantz\u003c/a\u003e and his Blue and White party issued no such condemnation and instead claimed ownership of the origin of the plan. \u0026ldquo;Blue and White have made clear that the Jordan Valley is part of Israel forever. Netanyahu drafted a plan to cede the Jordan Valley in 2014,\u0026#8221; the party said in a statement shortly after Netanyahu\u0026#8217;s announcement. \u0026#8220;We are happy that the Prime Minister has come around to adopt the Blue and White plan to recognize the Jordan valley.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGantz, a retired Israel Defense Force (IDF) general, went on to describe Netanyahu\u0026rsquo;s vow as spin designed to divert the electorate\u0026rsquo;s attention from Gaza rocket attacks. He called it an \u0026ldquo;empty promise\u0026rdquo; and said that he would replace with \u0026ldquo;actions and deeds.\u0026rdquo; It was not immediately clear what action Gantz intended to take on the Jordan Valley, and he did not use the word annexation or sovereignty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe timing of Netanyahu\u0026rsquo;s announcement so close to elections gives credence to Gantz\u0026rsquo;s claim that it is spin: fulfilling a long held ambition of some Israelis who see the occupied Palestinian territories as part of biblical Israel. Facing a shrinking coalition after failing to form a government in May and three corruption charges on which Israel\u0026rsquo;s attorney general said he would indict Netanyahu pending a hearing, the prime minister needs hard right support to bolster his chances of political survival. But Gantz\u0026rsquo;s Blue and White\u0026rsquo;s ambiguous response will \u0026ldquo;at a minimum\u0026rdquo; be interpreted as \u0026ldquo;not opposing [Netanyahu\u0026rsquo;s] annexation plans\u0026rdquo; says IPF director Michael Koplow, even if it falls short of giving them explicit assent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome 2.5 million Palestinians live in the West Bank, which Israel has controlled since it fought a war with its Arab neighbors in 1967. Hundreds of thousands of Israelis also populate West Bank settlements, which the overwhelming majority of the international community considers illegal. The Trump Administration is yet to comment publicly on Netanyahu\u0026rsquo;s hint that its peace plan would green light annexing the Jordan Valley, but precedent suggests it might.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrump broke with decades of U.S. policy to recognize \u003ca href=\"https://time.com/5276129/jerusalem-embassy-gaza-protests-what-to-know/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eJerusalem\u003c/a\u003e as Israel\u0026rsquo;s capital and moved the American embassy to the city Palestinians also regard as their future capital. And shortly before Israel\u0026rsquo;s April elections, Trump recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, a rocky plateau Israel also captured in the war of 1967. In a June interview with The New York \u003cem\u003eTimes\u003c/em\u003e U.S. ambassador to Israel David Friedman has \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/08/world/middleeast/israel-west-bank-david-friedman.html\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003esaid Israel has \u0026ldquo;the right\u0026rdquo; to annex\u003c/a\u003e at least some of the West Bank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his announcement Tuesday, Netanyahu said the Trump Administration\u0026rsquo;s peace plan, which he said would be released days after the election, would provide a \u0026#8220;historic opportunity\u0026#8221; for annexation. Polling data from the Jerusalem-based Israel Democracy Institute indicates that 48% of Jewish Israelis and 11% of Arab Israelis would favor the extension of sovereignty over the Jordan Valley and the northern Dead Sea\u0026mdash;sometimes known as Area C\u0026mdash;if such a move if it were supported by Trump and his administration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGantz\u0026rsquo;s position is complicated by the fact that, like Netanyahu\u0026rsquo;s Likud party, he advocates Israel maintaining security control over the Jordan Valley. In an election season, effectively distinguishing security control from political control, in the form of annexation, is difficult, says IPF\u0026rsquo;s Koplow, and opposing Netanyahu\u0026rsquo;s statement runs the risk of conveying to the electorate that his party is willing to cede security control of the Jordan Valley. Nonetheless, Gantz\u0026rsquo;s ambiguity \u0026ldquo;was not very smart politics,\u0026rdquo; he adds. It\u0026rsquo;s unlikely to win over right-wingers drawn to ardently pro-annexationist parties, while at the same time turning those who oppose annexation away from his Centrist Blue and White party.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn Monday, Gantz told an audience in Tel Aviv that he would ideally form a unity government including Likud, the secular nationalist Yisrael Beiteinu and \u0026ldquo;maybe [center-left] Labor,\u0026rdquo; bolstering the perception that Blue and White differs from Likud in terms of personality rather than policy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor those on the political left, Gantz\u0026rsquo;s stance is symptomatic of the dearth of serious opposition to the politics Netanyahu has engendered.

Iran Can Benefit from Bolton’s Dismissal","content":"\u003cp\u003eFoad Izadi has, in an interview with the Entekhab daily, weighed in on the reasons behind the dismissal of Bolton, and its possible benefits for Iran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe expert says Bolton’s dismissal can be good news for Iranians.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The reality is that within the US government, there was no one more hardline than him in opposition to Iran, and now, the inefficiency of Bolton’s anti-Iran policies may prompt the person replacing him to move toward reforming his policies,” said the analyst.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElsewhere in his interview, Izadi expressed his opinion about how much of a positive signal Bolton’s dismissal can be for US-Iran talks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So far, there has been no official more hardline than Bolton with regards to Iran,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Based on a report by New Yorker, the concern of this American politician over the past 20 years has been to topple the Islamic Republic of Iran,” Izadi noted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There is no official in the United States who has more animosity toward Iran than Bolton does. Now, the same person who claimed Iran will not survive to see its 40th anniversary, didn’t [remain in office enough to] see his second anniversary of becoming the White House national security advisor,” he added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The issue of having a meeting with [Iranian President Hassan] Rouhani is another issue, and it somehow seems incorrect to link it to the dismissal of the US national security advisor,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe analyst further noted that the major reason behind Bolton’s removal is the inefficiency of the consultations he gave to US President Donald Trump. Moreover, the most important case handled by Bolton was that of Iran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bolton had said the Islamic Republic of Iran would not [survive to] see its 40th anniversary, and had evaluated the US withdrawal from the JCPOA as a reason to make Tehran retreat and give concessions,” said Izadi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bolton had predicted that either Iran’s political system would be toppled, or the country would agree to give major concessions,” added the analyst.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He even called for military action in dealing with Iran and evaluated such a move as being very easy; however, the ongoing developments, especially Iran’s downing of a US drone, showed all options that he had in mind, even military action, were wrong,” the expert said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Izadi, Bolton’s policies vis-à-vis Venezuela also failed. Bolton believed US pressure would lead to the ouster of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and bring Western-backed Juan Guaido to power, but his predictions failed to come true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll these developments, said the analyst, led Trump to arrive at the conclusion that Bolton was not efficient enough as a national security advisor, which is an important position in the US.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe post \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ifpnews.com/how-iran-can-benefit-from-boltons-dismissal\"\u003eHow Iran Can Benefit from Bolton’s Dismissal\u003c/a\u003e appeared first on \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ifpnews.com\"\u003eIran Front Page\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://ifpnews.com/how-iran-can-benefit-from-boltons-dismissal","published":"2019-09-12T07:19:44Z","guid":"https://ifpnews.com/?p=151315"},{"title":"Trump Considering French Plan to Give Iran $15bn Credit Line","content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: #0000ff;\"\u003e\u003ca style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-flirts-with-dollar15-billion-bailout-for-iran-sources-say\"\u003eThe Daily Beast\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e, an American news and opinion website, quotes four sources with knowledge of Trump’s conversations with Macron as saying that Trump has hinted he is actively considering a French plan to extend a $15 billion credit line to the Iranians if Tehran comes back into compliance with the nuclear deal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Two of those sources said that State Department officials, including Secretary Mike Pompeo, are also open to weighing the French proposal, which would effectively ease the economic sanctions regime that the Trump administration has applied on Tehran for more than a year,” the report said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe deal put forth by France would compensate Iran for oil sales disrupted by American sanctions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe $15 billion credit line would be guaranteed by Iranian oil.
