First, on May 29th, the FDIC released industry results for the first quarter of 2019.  Within that release, the FDIC said the Official Problem Bank List held 59 institutions with assets of $46.7 billion.  Second, the Enloe State Bank, Cooper, Texas ($36.7 million) failed on Friday, May 31st.  This is the first failure since January 2018, stretch of 15 months.  Notable about this failure is that the Enloe State Bank, founded in June 1928 and supervised by the FDIC, is that it does not appear that FDIC issued a formal safety \u0026amp; soundness enforcement action to address Enloe’s weaknesses.\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/CalculatedRisk/~4/1dEib0WaPqo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/CalculatedRisk/~3/1dEib0WaPqo/may-2019-unofficial-problem-bank-list.html","published":"2019-06-02T14:31:00.001Z","guid":"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10004977.post-5915060301629083736"}]},{"url":"https://andrewchen.co/feed/","items":[]},{"url":"https://feeds.feedburner.com/StrategyBusiness-AllUpdates?format=xml","items":[]},{"url":"https://fortune.com/feed/","items":[{"title":"On the ‘New Silk Road,’ a Father-Son Road Trip Goes 8,000 Miles to China and Back","content":"\u003cp\u003eAs far as road trips with your dad go, this one was unusual, even for Siebe Alblas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, there was the distance: more than 4,000 miles one way, from Rotterdam in the Netherlands to western China, via Berlin, Moscow and much of Kazakhstan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, there was the pace: more than 80 hours of driving--nearly as long as it would take to drive from New York to Los Angeles and back--over less than six days, with father and son switching off when the other was tired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd finally, there was the return journey.

It\u0026#8217;s also aimed at changing its own narrative; that China is not just about exporting inexpensive goods; it has the technology and the backing to build sophisticated infrastructure. The initiative has also included the rapid development of the traditionally remote western regions of China--a push that has come \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/08/world/asia/china-uighur-muslim-detention-camp.html\"\u003ealongside oppression\u003c/a\u003e of the Uighur Muslim population in Xinjiang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat said, putting down physical roots has never been easy in Central Asia, a region sandwiched uneasily between China, Russia, and the Middle East.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;It\u0026#8217;s a big assumption that [China] is going to be able to build massive amounts of infrastructure in these regions,\u0026#8221; says Brown. \u0026#8220;Without a huge amount of knowledge, it\u0026#8217;s doing ambitious things.

Installed in the 1970s, what started as a standard salad bar turned into one offering customers an endless amount of toppings to dress their sandwiches. At the time, the idea that customers could personalize food by choosing their own amount of endless pickles, onions, and other toppings was innovative.

The late actor and singer, looking to become involved in restaurants, licensed his name to the Marriott Corp. in 1968, as one of Marriott's board members had a connection to the star's agent.

It was very quiet during the month as there were no changes to the list this month.   At the end of May, the Unofficial Problem Bank stood at 73 institutions with assets of $52.1 billion, down from 92 intuitions but up in assets of $18.0 billion from a year ago.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eHowever, two interesting events occurred during the month related to the list.  First, on May 29th, the FDIC released industry results for the first quarter of 2019.  Within that release, the FDIC said the Official Problem Bank List held 59 institutions with assets of $46.7 billion.  Second, the Enloe State Bank, Cooper, Texas ($36.7 million) failed on Friday, May 31st.  This is the first failure since January 2018, stretch of 15 months.  Notable about this failure is that the Enloe State Bank, founded in June 1928 and supervised by the FDIC, is that it does not appear that FDIC issued a formal safety \u0026amp; soundness enforcement action to address Enloe’s weaknesses.\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/CalculatedRisk/~4/1dEib0WaPqo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"

In 1938, when the Civil War was just barely close enough to touch, President Franklin D.

Invoking Abraham Lincoln, he spoke before veterans of the North and the South about how he was “thankful that they stand together under one flag now.” At the time, FDR knew that Civil War veterans would not live much longer, Dalessandro told me, adding, “In my heart, I know this is the last time we’re going to get D-Day veterans to this ceremony.” (This year, he said, about 35 D-Day veterans will attend.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eI had taken a strange, solitary pilgrimage here to begin to comprehend what had happened on these beaches in June 1944 after General Dwight D.

Before the invasion, the Allies organized a \u003ca href=\"https://www.history.com/news/d-day-normandy-wwii-facts\"\u003emisinformation campaign\u003c/a\u003e—phantom field armies were planted; a group in Dover, England, tried to trick the Germans into thinking the invasion would be in Pas de Calais, not Normandy; an actor was hired to impersonate British General Bernard Law Montgomery to throw the enemy off course; planes dropped metal strips to scramble German radar and leaflets telling the Germans their army was in retreat when it wasn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eMartha Gellhorn, the indefatigable reporter, managed to make the English Channel crossing to Normandy on a hospital vessel.

Her family is from the area, and her grandfather donated some of the land for the cemetery. Sixty percent of the D-Day casualties are buried back home, in the U.S., and the remainder lie here. There is no order to the graves, not even alphabetical. Each name is carved into a kind of Italian marble known for its purity.

She walked swiftly, purposefully, through the rows of graves. A silence hung in the air, punctuated by birdsong and the sound of our feet on the pathways. She showed me a photograph of \u003ca href=\"https://www.theadvocate.com/new_orleans/news/article_bf17fa76-cedd-11e6-b812-4bfcf69a4ffc.html\"\u003eHarold Baumgarten\u003c/a\u003e visiting a comrade’s grave in 2004.

They went home and moved on. “These people gave us a chance. They bought time for us so we can do better,” Eisenhower\u003ca href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/video/eisenhower-recalls-sacrifices-of-d-day-20-years-later/\"\u003e told Walter Cronkite in 1964\u003c/a\u003e. It was Reagan’s speech on the D-Day anniversary in 1984 that began to focus renewed attention on the war. Between Omaha Beach and Utah Beach is Pointe du Hoc, a steep, narrow cliff that juts into the channel. A unit of 225 Army rangers scaled this cliff in bad weather under enemy assault, and Reagan memorialized their efforts in his \u003ca href=\"http://www.historyplace.com/speeches/reagan-d-day.htm\"\u003espeech\u003c/a\u003e. Written by Peggy Noonan, it is a model of the form—stirring, poetic, and only 13 minutes long.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e“We stand on a lonely, windswept point on the northern shore of France. The air is soft, but 40 years ago at this moment, the air was dense with smoke and the cries of men, and the air was filled with the crack of rifle fire and the roar of cannon,” Reagan began. He spoke of how the rangers had scaled the cliff, and also of “a profound, moral difference between the use of force for liberation and the use of force for conquest.” That line reads differently today, after the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, where liberation has proven more vexing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eReagan also spoke out against isolationism. “We in America have learned bitter lessons from two world wars: It is better to be here, ready to protect the peace, than to take blind shelter across the sea, rushing to respond only after freedom is lost. We've learned that isolationism never was and never will be an acceptable response to tyrannical governments with an expansionist intent.” Here, too, it’s hard to read these lines in 2019, as a president seems intent on taking American foreign policy down a different path.\u003c/p\u003e\u003caside class=\"callout-placeholder\" data-source=\"curated\"\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eReagan delivered his remarks one year after his “evil empire” speech and three years before he implored Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev to “tear down this wall.” His Pointe du Hoc speech became a rallying cry against communism. He mentioned Warsaw, Prague, East Berlin. “Soviet troops that came to the center of this continent did not leave when peace came,” he said. “They’re still there, uninvited, unwanted, unyielding, almost 40 years after the war. Because of this, Allied forces still stand on this continent. Today, as 40 years ago, our armies are here for only one purpose—to protect and defend democracy.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIn 1994, President Bill Clinton also spoke at Pointe du Hoc, and marked a new generation. “We are the sons and daughters you saved from tyranny’s reach,”\u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1994/06/07/clinton-honors-d-day-sacrifice/de2aa6cf-0016-4487-b730-fd54203ac05e/?utm_term=.fb7580dbaf64\"\u003e he told the veterans in attendance\u003c/a\u003e. In 2004, a year after the invasion of Iraq, President George W.

The question may sound absurd, but you’d be surprised: A great many lawyers, politicians, judges, and policy experts think the U.S. Constitution builds from exactly that starting point. Their argument relies on the first sentence of Article II, which gives the president “the executive power.” That phrase, they claim, was originally understood as a generic reference to monarchical authority. This means, they say, that the American president must have been given all the prerogatives of a British king, except where the Constitution specifies otherwise. The foreign-relations scholar Philip Trimble states their conclusion plainly: “Unless the [Article II] Vesting Clause is meaningless, it incorporates the unallocated parts of Royal Prerogative.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe repercussions of this claim ripple across the face of constitutional law. During Senate hearings on legislating an end to the Iraq War, Brad Berenson, who had served as one of President George W. Bush’s top lawyers, told the Senate that the executive-power clause conveys “a vast reserve of implied authority to do whatever may be necessary in executing the laws and governing the nation.” When the Bush administration wanted to defy statutory restrictions on dragnet surveillance, the Justice Department relied on the clause in advising that Congress “cannot restrict the President’s ability to engage in warrantless searches that protect the national security.” And Justice Clarence Thomas put the clause front and center in concluding that “those who ratified the Constitution understood the ‘executive Power’ vested by Article II to include those foreign affairs powers not otherwise allocated in the Constitution.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese aren’t selective examples. Pick a random recent controversy about presidential power, and you’re almost certain to find the president-as-king claim woven into the debates. During the George W. Bush administration, the argument was used to defend the torture of prisoners, the evasion of habeas corpus, and the claim of authority to invade Afghanistan and Iraq without congressional authorization. During the Obama administration, the argument surfaced in debates about the administration’s defiance of a statute recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and about the use of force against Libya. And supporters of the Trump administration have supercharged the claim, advocating a breathtaking theory of indefeasible imperial prerogative in areas ranging from the Russia investigation and workaday congressional oversight to immigration law and the bombing of Syria.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter years of research into an enormous array of colonial, revolutionary, and founding-era sources, I’m here to tell you that—as a historical matter—this president-as-king claim is utterly and totally wrong. I’ve reviewed more than a thousand publications from the 17th and 18th centuries for each instance of the word root \u003cem\u003eexec-\u003c/em\u003e, and have read most of those texts from cover to cover with the topic of presidential power squarely in mind. I’ve read every discussion of executive power and presidential authority that appears in the gigantic compilation of archival materials known as the \u003cem\u003eDocumentary History of the Ratification of the United States Constitution\u003c/em\u003e. And with the help of a team of research assistants, I’m most of the way through flyspecking the full records of the Continental Congress—including committee reports, floor debates, and delegate correspondence—with the same question in mind.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll this work has left me with both the confidence to share this conclusion and the sense of obligation to do so as bluntly as possible. It’s just not a close call: The historical record categorically refutes the idea that the American revolutionaries gave their new president an unspecified array of royal prerogatives. To the contrary, the presidency that leaps off the pages of the Founders’ debates, diaries, speeches, letters, poems, and essays was an \u003cem\u003einstrument\u003c/em\u003e of the law of the land, \u003cem\u003esubject\u003c/em\u003e to the law of the land, and both morally and legally obliged to \u003cem\u003eobey\u003c/em\u003e the law of the land.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you had the same third-grade history class I did, you might think this all goes without saying. But in the realm of constitutional law, these findings represent a tectonic shift.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor more than two centuries, jurists and statesmen have intoned that “ours is a government of limited powers.” That proposition is the foundational principle of federal power. The Constitution did not grant Congress open-ended authority to regulate in the public interest. Instead, the Founders wrote a laundry list of highly specific legislative authorities. This enumeration strategy, the Supreme Court has explained, is why courts must carefully consider the national government’s legislative limits: “If no enumerated power authorizes Congress to pass a certain law, that law may not be enacted.” From this starting point comes the endless constitutional sparring over the scope of the powers to regulate commerce, to tax, to spend, and to enter treaties—just to name a few. Almost everyone agrees that unless legislators can point to an affirmative grant of constitutional authority, Congress simply can’t act.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA funny thing happens, though, when it comes to the presidency. Suddenly you see hand waving that would be laughed out of the room just about anywhere else. Here’s Justice Robert Jackson on executive power, in 1952:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eA judge, like an executive adviser, may be surprised at the poverty of really useful and unambiguous authority applicable to concrete problems of executive power as they actually present themselves. Just what our forefathers did envision must be divined from materials almost as enigmatic as the dreams Joseph was called upon to interpret for Pharaoh.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is one of the most celebrated opinions in constitutional history. Is Jackson seriously advising us to approach problems of presidential power by meditating on curtsying wheat and overweight cows?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe answer is obviously no. But such sorcerous gesticulations are motivated by an inconvenient fact: The constitutional text doesn’t actually authorize the president to do very much. It enumerates the veto, appointments, and pardon powers. It grants the president “the executive power” and the office of commander in chief. It authorizes the president to receive foreign ambassadors, demand reports from his subordinates, and deliver a State of the Union address. But aside from a few miscellaneous process authorities, that’s just about it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe way president-as-king theorists see it, this fact is more than just inconvenient; it’s downright dangerous. Can we imagine a country, they ask, whose president doesn’t have the authority to conduct diplomacy, recognize foreign governments, terminate treaties, acquire territory, fire officers and employees, or announce national policy? Is it conceivable, they wonder, that our national charter would fail to include an escape hatch—“In case of emergency, break this law”—for any legal requirement that interferes with our national security? For president-as-king theorists, to ask these questions is to answer them. And so they claim that the first three words of Article II—“the executive power”—vest all the authorities I’ve just described and more.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs a historical matter, my research shows that this claim is dead wrong. “The executive power” granted at the American founding was conceptually, legally, and semantically incapable of conveying a reservoir of royal authority. The real meaning of executive power was something almost embarrassingly simple: the power to execute the law. \u003ca href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3328945\"\u003eOverwhelming evidence\u003c/a\u003e for this point pervades both the Founders’ debates and the \u003ca href=\"https://reason.com/2019/03/04/article-ii-vests-the-executive-power-not/\"\u003elegal and political theory\u003c/a\u003e on which their discussions drew.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eListen to how Gouverneur Morris framed the problem for his fellow delegates in Philadelphia. The central challenge of constitutional governance, he said, was to safely distribute each of “the three powers” that everyone knew so well: “one … the power of making[,] another of executing, and a third of judging, the laws.” Under this tripartite system, the function of executive power was both straightforward and indispensable—to implement instructions issued by a valid exercise of legislative power. In a famous 1774 Election Day sermon, Gad Hitchcock stated the consequence plainly: “The executive power is strictly no other than the legislative carried forward, and of course, controllable by it.” These weren’t idiosyncratic views. The catechistic statement of three interlocking powers served as a universal grammar for debating constitutional governance. As one exasperated British reviewer said of the relentless trinitarianism in John Adams’s 1787 constitutional treatise, “Upon this point, like Lord Chesterfield with the Graces, Dr. Adams dwells for ever.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd so the historical Constitution just wasn’t that complicated. It defined the president’s fundamental role as the servant of legislative will. It gave the president a conditional veto to check Congress’s exercise of that will in any particular case. And it vested a smattering of other authorities where Article II specifically said so. But that was it. The very “doctrine of prerogative” and such “other peculiar properties of the royal character,” one Virginia newspaper explained, were conceptually “incompatible with the view of these states when they are settling the form of a republican government.” The defining fact of the Constitution’s separation of powers was the structural minimalism of its presidency: Because the president’s powers were “so clearly defined,” a South Carolina Federalist concluded, they “never can be dangerous.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDid this leave gaps in the constitutional system as ratified in 1789? Of course it did! But the Founders weren’t idiots. They knew that no legal text can anticipate every possible eventuality, so they made specific provision \u003cem\u003efor\u003c/em\u003e \u003cem\u003eCongress\u003c/em\u003e to decide how to fill any gaps in the system. The constitutional text on this point could scarcely be more explicit: The national legislature is expressly authorized to make “all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution” any of the “Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States.” The first Congress took up that invitation and ran with it, just like its successors have ever since—conveying those powers to the executive branch \u003cem\u003eby statute\u003c/em\u003e that the constantly evolving democratic process deems necessary for the president to have.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s not like this vision of the presidency leads to weakness or irresolution. Under the modern administrative state, a vast statutory framework authorizes a spectacular range of presidential authorities. But as a matter of the original constitutional understanding, all such powers are subject to legislative revision. And that’s what the Founders expected. You can advocate originalism in constitutional interpretation. You can support the imperial presidency. But you can’t do both at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/4LIdtSOxqKY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/4LIdtSOxqKY/","published":"2019-06-02T10:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-590461"},{"title":"Democrats and Republicans Have Two Different Constitutions","content":"\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" height=\"713\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/05/2ConstitutionsRedo2/4e68cb2a6.jpg\" width=\"672\"\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"caption\"\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eDemocratic and Republican politicians agree on one thing when it comes to President Donald Trump’s tax returns: The Constitution determines who can see them.

Yet in political debates such as the Trump tax tussle, it sometimes feels as if we have two legal charters, one for Republicans and another for Democrats. The suspicion arises that the Constitution may no longer be serving as a symbol of “\u003ca href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=eEoyK7ZCXjsC\u0026amp;pg=PA31\u0026amp;lpg=PA31\u0026amp;dq=%22+the+symbol+of+nationhood,+of+continuity,+of+unity++and+common+purpose%22\u0026amp;source=bl\u0026amp;ots=MS4Sotvy8a\u0026amp;sig=ACfU3U0rvRqU67TDmQV70mAeMcUCUbmokg\u0026amp;hl=en\u0026amp;sa=X\u0026amp;ved=2ahUKEwilyP2iyYniAhWSVN8KHYtEB4oQ6AEwAXoECAQQAQ#v=onepage\u0026amp;q=%22%20the%20symbol%20of%20nationhood%2C%20of%20continuity%2C%20of%20unity%20%20and%20common%20purpose%22\u0026amp;f=false\"\u003eunity and common purpose\u003c/a\u003e,” and might instead be enabling or even exacerbating partisan strife.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat suspicion, it turns out, is well grounded. My colleagues Eric Talley, Julian Nyarko, and I \u003ca href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3351339\"\u003erecently examined\u003c/a\u003e the evolution of constitutional rhetoric on the floor of Congress from 1873 to 2016. We first identified all remarks that referred to the Constitution. We then trained a machine-learning algorithm to predict whether Republicans or Democrats were speaking, \u003cem\u003ebased solely on the content of the remarks\u003c/em\u003e. If the algorithm finds this hard to do, it suggests that the parties tend to talk in similar or overlapping ways. If the algorithm performs this task with a high degree of accuracy, it suggests that the parties are largely talking past each other.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe results are sobering. Since about 1980, it has become increasingly easy for an algorithm to predict whether any given constitutional remark was made by a Republican or a Democrat. It has likewise become increasingly easy to predict whether the speaker was a conservative or a liberal. By the time Trump took office, the machine was guessing right roughly 80 percent of the time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis result holds up across multiple algorithms, multiple measures of algorithmic accuracy, and multiple criteria for what counts as a constitutional remark. Additional tests of the “disjointness” between the parties’ rhetoric point to the same conclusion: To an unprecedented extent, Republican and Democratic members of Congress no longer speak the same constitutional language.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnderlying this polarization of constitutional discourse, we \u003ca href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3351339\"\u003efurther found\u003c/a\u003e, are competing constitutional vocabularies. In particular, whereas terms from or about the original Constitution of 1789–91 have become associated with the Republican Party, terms from or about the \u003ca href=\"https://constitutioncenter.org/learn/educational-resources/historical-documents/the-reconstruction-amendments\"\u003eReconstruction Amendments\u003c/a\u003e of 1865–70 have become associated with the Democratic Party. Republicans are more likely to discuss the Founding Fathers and textual provisions such as the First, Second, and Tenth Amendments—emphasizing themes of individual liberty and state autonomy. Democrats are more likely to discuss civil rights and voting rights—emphasizing themes of equality and federal authority. The perennial tension in constitutional law “\u003ca href=\"https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1439\u0026amp;context=faculty_scholarship\"\u003ebetween the values of the Founding and the values of Reconstruction\u003c/a\u003e” is today a highly partisan struggle.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe ongoing debate over \u003ca href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1\"\u003eH.R. 1\u003c/a\u003e shows how this struggle plays out. After House Democrats introduced H.R. 1 in January, Republicans took to the floor to argue that the electoral-reform bill would “limit Americans’ First Amendment right to political speech” (Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky), encroach on “the liberties and powers of the Constitution reserved for the States and the people” (Representative Jeff Duncan of South Carolina), and undermine “the original intent of the Founders” (Representative Barry Loudermilk of Georgia). Democrats countered that the bill would provide crucial protections for the “constitutional right to vote” (Representative Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas) and help redeem “a Constitution that was flawed” at its inception “by not recognizing the full equality of every American” (Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs these remarks reflect, members of each party follow a certain constitutional script. The details change, depending on the issue. The broad interpretative themes, and ideological fault lines, stay the same.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat’s more, constitutional discourse has polarized at least as rapidly as nonconstitutional discourse since 1980—on most measures, even more so. Any number of legal thinkers have imagined the Constitution as supplying a kind of cultural glue that disciplines disagreement and tempers partisan passions. At least in recent decades, our findings suggest something closer to the opposite. Arguments pitched in a constitutional key do not generally transcend preexisting political divides so much as mirror or magnify them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese arguments, however, are imbalanced in a key respect. During the 1960s and early 1970s, Democratic legislators invoked their preferred constitutional clauses and tropes far more often than Republican legislators invoked theirs. By the turn of the millennium, the situation had flipped. Of the 50 constitutional terms that were most strongly “owned” by one party under President Barack Obama, for instance, approximately three-quarters belonged to Republicans. Democrats may have dominated constitutional discourse in the Capitol at the height of the civil-rights movement, but Republicans have caught up, and then some.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis puts Democrats to a choice. One option is to accept this asymmetry and continue to emphasize nonconstitutional narratives. Yet insofar as the Constitution really is America’s \u003ca href=\"https://princeton.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.23943/princeton/9780691152400.001.0001/upso-9780691152400-chapter-002\"\u003ecivil religion\u003c/a\u003e, future Democrats who wish to enact transformative legislative programs—from the Green New Deal to Medicare for All to a tax code overhaul—may need to develop a more robust “higher law” language with which to make their case.

The actor Randall Park and the comedian Ali Wong had a script in need of a director—and Khan had been their first choice all along. “When [the Lionsgate film] went away, they went, ‘\u003cem\u003eHeeeeey\u003c/em\u003e! What about \u003cem\u003eoooour movie\u003c/em\u003e?’” Khan said in a singsongy voice to mimic her leads, who were out of earshot, in another room.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e“As soon as she was available, we were like, ‘Start the engines,’” Park had told me earlier.

Both have been on a hot streak in Hollywood—Park delivered memorable turns in blockbusters (\u003cem\u003eAquaman\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eAnt-Man and the Wasp\u003c/em\u003e) and TV comedies (\u003cem\u003eVeep\u003c/em\u003e), while Wong broke out with a one-two punch of Netflix stand-up specials (\u003cem\u003eBaby Cobra\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eHard Knock Wife\u003c/em\u003e) and a supporting role on ABC’s \u003cem\u003eAmerican Housewife\u003c/em\u003e. For their first film together, which they’d co-written and produced with the screenwriter Michael Golamco, they needed someone behind the camera who understood their goals.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThough the film tells a classic tale of boy remeets girl—it follows a pair of childhood sweethearts, Marcus (Park) and Sasha (Wong), who reunite as adults after leading very different lives—Wong and Park didn’t just want to tell a love story; they wanted to tell a distinctly Asian American love story. They drew from their own upbringings, from their real-life friendship, and from two rom-com touchstones for inspiration: 1989’s \u003cem\u003eWhen Harry Met Sally\u003c/em\u003e, which broke the genre’s format by delving into its leads’ contrasting lives, and 1992’s \u003cem\u003eBoomerang\u003c/em\u003e, which depicted a predominantly black cast navigating love.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" height=\"448\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/05/Always_Be_My_Maybe_Unit_07723/72498cedd.jpg\" width=\"672\"\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"caption\"\u003eAli Wong and Randall Park’s classic tale of boy remeets girl (Ed Araquel / Netflix)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eKhan proved the perfect match for the material.

With \u003cem\u003eAlways Be My Maybe\u003c/em\u003e, she achieves a celluloid sleight of hand: The film is a portrait of contemporary middle-class Asian America wrapped in a conventional, mainstream rom-com. Young Sasha makes herself some Spam musubi for dinner and watches \u003cem\u003eClarissa Explains It All\u003c/em\u003e while her parents work late at their convenience store. Marcus fronts a comedic rap group, just as Park once did. Adult Sasha and Marcus have significant others—a tracksuit-wearing playboy (Daniel Dae Kim) for her, a hippie with dreadlocks (Vivian Bang) for him—who aren’t defined by being Asian. “It’s such a cool, confident thing when you don’t explain the premise, you just have the premise,” Wong said. “It’s our reality, and we’re not going to take\u003cem\u003e time\u003c/em\u003e to explain it.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eKhan grasped that reality. The Iranian American writer-director cut her teeth on TV comedies—she created \u003cem\u003eDon’t Trust the B---- in Apartment 23\u003c/em\u003e before launching \u003cem\u003eFresh Off the Boat\u003c/em\u003e—and paid careful attention to world building. For a scene set at a birthday party, Khan was determined to open the sequence on two little girls running into the house and taking off their shoes—a small but significant cultural flourish. “I spent more time on that shot than I think a director would have if that wasn’t an important detail,” she admitted to me. “We had to get that timing right. You could get into [that scene] in any number of ways, but I liked showing that … It’s a part of this world.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eEven the film’s biggest set piece is a sly celebration of Asian American identity. Keanu Reeves swans into the film for a scene-stealing sequence in which he plays a heightened version of himself who competes with Marcus for Sasha’s affections and delivers nonsensical one-liners. (“The only stars that matter are the ones you see when you dream,” he purrs to Sasha.) But Reeves wasn’t chosen just because he’s an A-lister with a \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/05/john-wick-chapter-3-parabellum-review/589459/?utm_source=feed\"\u003epopular franchise in the zeitgeist\u003c/a\u003e. “We thought, \u003cem\u003eWho would be Marcus’s worst nightmare?\u003c/em\u003e It should be an Asian American \u003cem\u003eicon\u003c/em\u003e who’s a great actor and who’s funny but also willing to make fun of himself,” Wong said. “[Keanu] was flattered that we remembered he was Asian American.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWhile the gag had always been in the script, Khan enhanced its absurdity. “In our heads, it was, \u003cem\u003eKeanu’s going to walk in, and that’s gonna be magical\u003c/em\u003e,” Park said, “but she took that and really made it dreamlike and surreal.” In Khan’s hands, time almost stops as Reeves enters (in a moment that’s already been \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/keanu_muse/status/1134355416144474112\"\u003eGIFed\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/meshellv/status/1134487728001867776\"\u003eto\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/Melissa_Leo7/status/1134446843008495616\"\u003eoblivion\u003c/a\u003e) and Marcus’s face falls in slow motion.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" height=\"448\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/05/ABMM_Unit_10989A/ad8d60656.jpg\" width=\"672\"\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"caption\"\u003eKeanu Reeves steals his scene as a romantic rival.

She’d used it on \u003cem\u003eDon’t Trust the B---- in Apartment 23\u003c/em\u003e with James Van Der Beek to hilarious effect: The joke played with the actor’s \u003cem\u003eDawson’s Creek\u003c/em\u003e legacy to comment astutely \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=verGQV5YQVU\"\u003eon celebrity\u003c/a\u003e. With Reeves, Khan does the same—and she didn’t stop there when it came to bringing her stamp to \u003cem\u003eAlways Be My Maybe\u003c/em\u003e. On set, she liked to cross-shoot, pointing cameras at both leads at the same time so they’d capture on-the-fly jokes as they came rather than resetting and re-creating them to complete the shot. And every night, Khan would mark up the next day’s shooting pages with alternative jokes and leave room for her stars to improv—a strategy she’d used while writing and directing TV episodes. “It frees you up as a writer to not have to craft the one perfect joke, and then you also have the improv capability,” she said. “Like, you \u003cem\u003ehave\u003c/em\u003e Ali and Randall. You have two racehorses. You’ve got to let them run!”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTogether, they’ve created a film that challenges rom-com norms not by reinventing the genre wholesale, but by complementing its most timeless elements with the minute details of a world rarely seen on-screen. To Wong, \u003cem\u003eAlways Be My Maybe\u003c/em\u003e works not only because she, Park, and Khan know that world intimately, but also because they understand one another’s sensibilities. “With comedy, it’s so much about trust and communication,” Wong told me. “You don’t want to be on a comedy movie set and get into a screaming match with somebody because you don’t trust that what they’re suggesting is a good idea … [Randall and I] both have a huge amount of respect [for Nahnatchka], but also, we’re friends with her. Sometimes I panic when I think about, like, if I don’t have a project with her coming up.” Wong will just have to snatch her up for whatever comes next.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/Sjw0NF4v0q0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/Sjw0NF4v0q0/","published":"2019-06-02T12:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-590818"},{"title":"The Surprising Complexity of Animal Memories","content":"\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eChrysippus, a Greek philosopher from the third century \u003cspan class=\"smallcaps\"\u003eB.C.\u003c/span\u003e, is said to have recounted how a hunting dog arrived at a spot where three roads met.

I find this fascinating, because in this thought experiment, we postulate that humans would need a sense of self to take the same decision, which we then take as evidence for a sense of self in another organism. This extrapolation is generally satisfying, but not risk-free, because it hinges on the assumption that there is only one way to solve a problem.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eChrysippus’s dog is a great example of apparent inferential reasoning. Fortunately, we now have tests of inferential reasoning.

This experimenter then left the room, and Sarah was given a chance to inspect the boxes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eShe faced an interesting dilemma, since she had not seen how the experimenter had obtained his fruit. Invariably, however, she would go to the box with the fruit that the experimenter had not eaten. She must have concluded that the experimenter had taken his fruit from the corresponding box and that the second box would still contain its original fruit. Most animals don’t make any such assumptions, the Premacks note; they just see an experimenter consume fruit. Chimpanzees, by contrast, always try to figure out the order of events, looking for logic, filling in the blanks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/03/what-the-crow-knows/580726/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: A journey into the animal mind\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIn \u003ca href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15250810\"\u003eanother test\u003c/a\u003e, apes were presented with two covered cups after they had learned that only one would be baited with grapes.

But then the experimenter shook just the empty cup, which obviously made no sound. The apes picked the other cup.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eI once watched another such causal inference unfold at the Burgers Zoo when the chimpanzees in the indoor colony watched us carry a crate full of grapefruits, which they find delicious, through a door that went outside onto their island.

As soon as they saw that the fruit was gone, 25 apes burst out hooting and hollering in a most festive mood.\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr class=\"c-section-divider\"\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eAnimal consciousness is hard to investigate, but we are getting close by exploring examples of reasoning, such as those given above, that we humans cannot perform unconsciously. We cannot plan a party without consciously thinking about all the things we need; the same must apply when animals plan for the future. The latest neuroscience suggests that consciousness is an adaptive capacity that allows us both to imagine the future and to connect the dots between past events. We are \u003ca href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027700001232\"\u003esaid to have\u003c/a\u003e a “workspace” in the brain where we consciously store one event until another one comes along.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eTake for example taste aversion in rats. It is \u003ca href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/122/3160/157\"\u003ewell known\u003c/a\u003e that rats avoid certain toxic foods even if they don’t become nauseous until hours later. Simple association fails to explain this. Could it be that rats consciously go over the recent past in their minds, thinking back to every food encounter to determine which one was most likely to have made them sick? We certainly do so ourselves after food poisoning and gag at the mere thought of the particular food or restaurant that we believe caused a shock to our digestive system.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe possibility that rats have a mental workspace where they review their own memories is not so far-fetched given the \u003ca href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29754898\"\u003egrowing evidence\u003c/a\u003e that they can “replay” memories of past events in their brain. This kind of memory, known as episodic memory, is different from associative learning, as when a dog learns that by responding to the command “sit,” he will be rewarded with a cookie. To create the association, the trainer has to give the dog the reward right away—an interval of even just a few minutes is not going to be helpful. In contrast to this kind of learning, episodic memory is the capacity to think back to a specific event, sometimes long ago, the way we do when we think of, say, our wedding day. We remember our clothes, the weather, the tears, who danced with whom, and which uncle ended up under the table.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/05/how-animals-think/476364/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: How animals think\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eEpisodic memory must be at work for the wild chimpanzees that forage among the fruit-bearing trees of Taï National Park, in Ivory Coast.

Despite their deep-seated fear, the apes would set out on a long trek to a specific fig tree where they had recently eaten. Their goal was to beat the early fig rush by other animals, from squirrels to hornbills. Remarkably, the chimps would get up earlier for trees far from their nests than for those nearby, arriving at about the same time at both. This suggests calculation of travel time based on distance. All this makes Janmaat believe that Taï chimpanzees actively recall previous experiences in order to plan for a plentiful breakfast.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIn a classical experiment, Nicky Clayton at Cambridge University \u003ca href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9751053\"\u003estudied western scrub jays\u003c/a\u003e (a corvid) to see what they remembered about foods they’d cached.

I know what I know. These kinds of experiments have been conducted with animals ( including monkeys, apes, birds, dolphins, and rats), showing that they too have different levels of confidence about what they know. They perform some tasks without hesitation, but at other times they can’t make up their mind, exhibiting doubt.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIn one early study, a dolphin named Natua was \u003ca href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8530911\"\u003easked to discriminate\u003c/a\u003e between a high tone and a low tone. His level of confidence was quite manifest. He swam at different speeds toward the response depending on how easy or hard it was to tell the tones apart. When they were quite distinct, Natua swam at full speed with a bow wave that threatened to soak the electronic apparatus. The scientists had to cover it with plastic sheets. If the tones were similar, though, Natua slowed down, waggled his head, and wavered. Instead of touching one of the paddles to make his choice, he selected the opt-out paddle (asking for a new trial), which meant he knew that he’d probably flunk the task.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eEven if this and other studies fail to directly tell us how aware animals are of their own memories, it is hard to deny the possibility that animals consciously travel along the time dimension and rack their brains for knowledge and experiences. We now have the beginnings of an idea of what consciousness is good for and why it evolved. I suspect that animals capable of consciously probing their experiences and memories also have the capacity to explicitly recognize the bodily upheavals that we call emotions. If they’re going to make decisions based on memories of the past, it probably helps to realize how those experiences made them feel.\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003csmall\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis post is adapted from De Waal’s new book, \u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780393635065\"\u003eMama’s Last Hug: Animal Emotions and What They Tell Us about Ourselves\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/small\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/gMzHVfIGq78\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/gMzHVfIGq78/","published":"2019-06-02T12:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-589420"},{"title":"How the ‘Central Park Five’ Changed the History of American Law","content":"\u003cp\u003eCoverage of violent crime is a staple of American news, yet only a handful of stories capture the attention of the nation.

So, too, were Raymond Santana, Kevin Richardson, Korey Wise, Yusef Salaam, and Antron McCray—the kids, ages 14, 15, and 16, who were wrongfully convicted of her attack.

McCray (played by Caleel Harris), a rising Little League star, discussed the Yankees with his father (Michael K. Williams). Richardson (Asante Blackk), a trumpet player, anticipated being named first chair as he walked home from school with his older sister. Meanwhile, Santana (Marquis Rodriguez) and Wise (Jharrel Jerome) seemed primarily occupied with impressing girls, as Salaam (Ethan Herisse) avoided a bully. By nighttime, the boys had entered Central Park together, along with 25 to 35 others—some of whom began throwing rocks at cars, harassing passersby, and beating up homeless people. When the police arrived, the crowd scattered. The officers managed to catch five boys during the chase, including Richardson and Santana, who were taken to the Central Park station for questioning.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInitially, the police prepared to charge the kids with unlawful assembly and refer them to the children’s court system. But New York District Attorney Linda Fairstein (Felicity Huffman) and investigators quickly concluded that the boys instead were Meili’s attackers and built a case around them, rather than conducting a full investigation. “Every young black male who was in the park last night is a suspect in the rape of that woman who is fighting for her life,” Huffman’s Fairstein says to NYPD officers. She called for the deployment of an “army of blue up on Harlem” and encouraged police to “stop every little thug you see.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe police, investigators, and the press dubbed the boys’ actions in the park that night “wilding.” Two days after the remaining three suspects had been arrested, the \u003cem\u003eNew York Post \u003c/em\u003eportrayed “wilding” as “packs of bloodthirsty teens from the tenements, bursting with boredom and rage, roam[ing] the streets getting kicks from an evening of ultra-violence.” Soon the term became part of the national discourse, with the newscaster Tom Brokaw describing “wilding” as “rampaging in wolf packs and attacking people just for the fun of it” on \u003cem\u003eNBC Nightly News\u003c/em\u003e. Peter Jennings of ABC named it “terror,” plain and simple.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe concept of “wilding” and the racist assumptions behind it made it seem plausible to law-enforcement authorities and the public that black and brown boys’ mischief could easily turn into violent rape. In \u003cem\u003eWhen They See Us\u003c/em\u003e, viewers hear excerpts from the \u003cem\u003eNew York Post \u003c/em\u003ecolumnist Pete Hamill’s April 23 account. “They were coming downtown from a world of crack, welfare, guns, knives, indifference, and ignorance,” Hamill wrote, “and driven by a collective fury, brimming with the rippling energies of youth … they had only one goal: to smash, hurt, rob, stomp, rape.” For Hamill, “wilding” was an expression of class and racial hatred. “The enemies were rich. The enemies were white.” The implication was that “wilding” would destroy affluent, white New York if young black and brown boys and men were not severely punished. DuVernay reminds her audience that Donald Trump purchased $85,000 ads in New York City newspapers that screamed “BRING BACK THE DEATH PENALTY.

In his definitive 1995 \u003cem\u003eWeekly Standard \u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.weeklystandard.com/john-j-dilulio-jr/the-coming-of-the-super-predators\"\u003eessay\u003c/a\u003e, “The Coming of the Super-Predators,” John DiLulio Jr.—then a politics and public-policy professor at Princeton—predicted that immediate demographic shifts would “unleash an army of young male predatory street criminals.” These chiefly black and brown youths were, \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/14/opinion/echoes-of-the-superpredator.html\"\u003eaccording to DiLulio\u003c/a\u003e, “so impulsive, so remorseless, that [they] can kill, rape, maim, without giving it a second thought.” Politicians and the media seized on the “super-predator” idea, just as they had done with “wilding.” Three months after the release of DiLulio’s article, then–first lady Hillary Clinton famously \u003ca href=\"https://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/crime/298693-hillary-clintons-superpredators-still-the-most-damaging-insult-by\"\u003ecalled for\u003c/a\u003e authorities to bring “the kinds of kids who are called ‘super-predators,’ no conscience, no empathy … to heel.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAmid the “super-predator” frenzy, nearly every state passed laws that made it easier to punish children as young as 13 as adults and, in some cases, \u003ca href=\"https://daily.jstor.org/u-s-sentence-children-life-prison/\"\u003esentence\u003c/a\u003e them to life without the possibility of parole. In 1998 alone, roughly 200,000 youths were put through the adult court system, and the majority of them were black. Sixteen-year-old Korey Wise was the only Central Park Five defendant to be \u003ca href=\"https://www.innocenceproject.org/cases/korey-wise/\"\u003etried as an adult\u003c/a\u003e, and the fourth episode of \u003cem\u003eWhen They See Us \u003c/em\u003eis mainly told from his perspective. With an exceptional performance by Jharrel Jerome—who plays Wise both as a boy and as an adult, and imbues the role with empathy—the episode exposes the horrors children experience when they are locked up with adults. In one scene, for instance, a Rikers Island guard helps two prisoners orchestrate a violent attack against Wise. The teen then chooses to enter solitary confinement for his own protection.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese practices went even further in the mid-1990s. Though Trump’s 1989 call for the execution of the Central Park Five went unfulfilled, between the release of “The Coming of the Super-Predators” in 1995 and the Supreme Court’s \u003cem\u003eRoper v. Simmons \u003c/em\u003edecision, which outlawed the death penalty for juveniles in 2005, 62 percent of the children placed on death row across the U.S. were black or Latino.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut by the late 1990s, it became clear that DiLulio’s “super-predators” were not, in fact, coming for blood. Youth violence had \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/07/us/politics/killing-on-bus-recalls-superpredator-threat-of-90s.html\"\u003edeclined\u003c/a\u003e—not drastically increased—and a number of prominent criminologists discredited DiLulio’s data. He \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2001/02/09/us/as-ex-theorist-on-young-superpredators-bush-aide-has-regrets.html\"\u003eapologized\u003c/a\u003e in 2001 for “any unintended consequences.” A year later, after DNA evidence linked a serial rapist and murderer named Matias Reyes to Meili’s attack, the New York Supreme Court vacated the Central Park Five’s convictions. And in 2014, the court settled a civil case with the five men for $41 million. Nonetheless, the “super-predator” myth irrevocably altered the lives of McCray, Richardson, Salaam, Santana, Wise, and tens of thousands of youths and their families, with the proliferation of misguided state and federal policies.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eSuper-predator\u003c/em\u003e may now be seen as a dirty word (and indeed came to haunt Clinton during her 2016 presidential-election bid), but the “wilding” concept that emerged during the Central Park Jogger case is alive and well. The most recent usage came almost 30 years to the day of Meili’s rape, on April 17, 2019, after a reported 500 black youths in Chicago descended on Millennium Park, allegedly stealing from and harassing tourists. \u003ca href=\"https://www.fox32chicago.com/news/401889895-video\"\u003eThe local news\u003c/a\u003e described their actions as “wilding.” An official blamed “soft on crime” policies, warning of more “wilding” to come. As DuVernay’s strongest work to date, \u003cem\u003eWhen They See Us\u003c/em\u003e should inspire even more people to recognize that crime-control policies and the racist ideas behind them must change.

It also retaliated against the U.S. blacklisting of Huawei by announcing Friday that it will establish its own list of \u0026#8220;unreliable entities\u0026#8221; consisting of foreign businesses, corporations and individuals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWang Shouwen, China\u0026#8217;s vice commerce minister and deputy international trade representative, said that China would issue more detailed information on the unreliable entities list soon, but that it was aimed at enterprises that \u0026#8220;violated market principles\u0026#8221; and cut supplies of components to Chinese businesses for non-commercial reasons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChina\u0026#8217;s statement that it intends to publish such a list follows additional measures last week that deepened the bite of U.S. sanctions imposed on Huawei in mid-May.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral leading U.S.-based global technology standards-setting groups announced restrictions on Huawei\u0026#8217;s participation in their activities under U.S. Commerce Department rules that bar the sale and transfer of U.S. technology to Huawei without government approval.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWang also repeated suggestions that China could restrict the export of exotic minerals known as rare earths that are widely used in electric cars and cellphones. Foremost among them is lithium, the main component in modern batteries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe threat to use China\u0026#8217;s rich supply of rare earths as leverage in the conflict has contributed to sharp losses in U.S. stocks and sliding long-term bond yields.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;If some countries use China\u0026#8217;s rare earth metals to produce products to contain China\u0026#8217;s development, this is unacceptable by standards of both minds and hearts,\u0026#8221; Wang said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSunday\u0026#8217;s report lays out China\u0026#8217;s argument for blaming Washington for the frictions as well as the costs to both sides, and said China has room for fiscal policy changes to maintain the health of its economy amid the dispute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWang said China had been forced to \u0026#8220;take forceful measures in response\u0026#8221; to U.S. actions and denied China had backtracked on its earlier commitments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said the U.S. had made unacceptable demands, including on tariffs and compulsory requirements that infringed on Chinese sovereignty. \u0026#8220;You give them an inch, they take a yard,\u0026#8221; he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePresident Donald Trump has touted the tariff increases as a way of reducing China\u0026#8217;s trade surplus with the U.S., which hit a staggering $379 billion last year. However, Wang questioned how much China was actually benefiting from its surplus, saying a joint Chinese-U.S. study showed the U.S. figure could be inflated by as much as 20%.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe also said many of those exports were produced by foreign companies operating in China and that Chinese firms often pocketed only a relatively meager fee for assembling. Subtracting the U.S. surplus in the services trade with China, the actual surplus came to just $152.6 billion last year, Wang said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe U.S. deficit with China has actually been worsening since tariffs were first imposed, Wang said, pointing to a 50% decline in soy bean exports to China and a drop-off in U.S. auto sales in the country. The average U.S. family, meanwhile, will pay an additional $831 for consumer items over the year due to the higher tariffs, he said, while the dispute\u0026#8217;s impact on businesses could end up costing 2.23 million U.S. jobs overall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;That shows that the deepening trade restrictions hurt U.S. workers,\u0026#8221; Wang said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/time/topstories/~4/rh4VD5oqmjY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/rh4VD5oqmjY/","published":"2019-06-02T15:43:14Z","guid":"http://time.com/?p=5599538"},{"title":"President Trump Says U.K. Should Be Ready for a No Deal Brexit","content":"\u003caside class=\"right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad\" id=\"right-rail__ad-5599530\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module video-2\" data-src=\"http://time.com/5599530/trump-uk-no-deal-brexit/\" data-widget-id=\"SB_4\" data-ob-template=\"timemag\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLONDON \u0026mdash; President Donald Trump has waded into the most contentious issue in British politics by urging the U.K. government to leave the European Union without a deal if it can\u0026#8217;t get better terms from EU leaders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrump told the Sunday Times in an interview that Britain should \u0026#8220;walk away\u0026#8221; from talks and refuse to pay a 39-billion pound ($49 billion) divorce bill if it doesn\u0026#8217;t get better terms from the EU.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe president also says Brexit party leader Nigel Farage, an outspoken advocate of leaving the EU without a deal, should be given a role in the negotiations.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe told the newspaper that Farage \u0026#8220;is a very smart person.

/\u003e\u003cp\u003eHumans are living longer around the world. While there have been obvious ups and downs, life expectancy at birth overall has been \u003ca href=\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/296/5570/1029\"\u003esteadily increasing\u003c/a\u003e for many years. It has more than doubled in the last two centuries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis increase was previously driven by \u003ca href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2690264/\"\u003ereductions in infant mortality\u003c/a\u003e. But since around the 1950s, the main driver has been reductions in mortality at older ages. In Sweden, for example, where national population data have been collected since the mid-16th century and are of a very high quality, the maximum lifespan has been \u003ca href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/289/5488/2366\"\u003eincreasing for almost 150 years\u003c/a\u003e. Increasing lifespans have been observed in many other countries, including in Western Europe, North America, and Japan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis has contributed to a rapid increase in the number of very old people—those living up to 100, 110, or even more. The first verified supercentenarian (aged 110 and above) was Geert Adrians-Boomgaard, who died in 1899 aged 110 years and four months. His record has been broken by others since. The first verified female supercentenarian, Margaret Ann Neve, died in 1903 aged 110 years and ten months, and held the record for almost 23 years. Delina Filkins passed away in 1928 aged 113 years and seven months. She kept the record for just over 52 years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe current record holder is the French woman Jeanne Calment, who died on August 4, 1997, aged 122 years and five months. Despite the near \u003ca href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0212345\"\u003eexponential increase\u003c/a\u003e in the number of supercentenarians since the early 1970s, her record holds firm—but she’s \u003ca href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0212345\"\u003eunlikely\u003c/a\u003e to hold it for much longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eSurviving past 100\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough these upward lifespan trends are widespread, they are not a given. Recent improvements in Danish mortality after a period of stagnation has led to the suspicion that centenarian lifespans could be increasing there. This is rather different from what has been recently observed in Sweden, where there has been some slow down at the \u003ca href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28470872\"\u003ehighest ages\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe studied \u003ca href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s13524-018-0755-7\"\u003e16,931 centenarians\u003c/a\u003e (10,955 Swedes and 5,976 Danes) born between 1870 and 1904 in Denmark and Sweden, neighboring countries with close cultural and historical ties, to see if our suspicions may be correct. Although Sweden generally has lower mortality rates than Denmark at most ages, \u003ca href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28470872\"\u003eno evidence\u003c/a\u003e of an increase in Sweden was found in recent years. In Denmark, however, the very oldest were observed to die at higher and higher ages, and the age at which only 6% of centenarians survive rose consistently over the period.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDenmark and Sweden are similar in many ways, yet these lifespan trends are very different. The disparity could be due to several causes, which are not easy to fully disentangle. But we have a few ideas. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eHealth systems\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, there are different levels of health among the two elderly populations. \u003ca href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28595320\"\u003eRecent studies\u003c/a\u003e have shown improvements in health as measured by Activities of Daily Living (ADL)—the basic tasks necessary for leading an independent life, such as bathing or getting dressed—in cohorts of female centenarians in Denmark. In Sweden, by contrast, such trends for the elderly have been less optimistic. One study found that there was no improvement in ADL, with deterioration in mobility, cognition, and performance tests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe difference in the two healthcare systems, especially in recent times, could therefore also go some way towards explaining the difference. Spending on public services was reduced in Sweden in the early 1990s, due to a series of economic crises. Healthcare for the elderly was affected. For instance, with inpatient elder care, there was a shift away from hospitals to nursing homes and a reduction in the number of nursing home beds. The cost cuts left some older people at risk, particularly those in the lowest socioeconomic groups. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition, the two countries have since followed slightly different paths to elderly care: Sweden tends to target the frailest whereas Denmark takes a slightly broader approach. \u003ca href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5547399/\"\u003eSome studies suggest\u003c/a\u003e that Sweden’s approach has resulted in some who require care not receiving it, with the least well-off segments of the elderly population relying more heavily on family care, which can be of lower quality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople who reach advanced ages are a select group and are obviously very durable. Perhaps because of their inherent resilience and particular physiology, they are best able to benefit from the improvements in living conditions and technology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur comparative study suggests some interesting things for other nations, particularly where there are developing and emerging economies. These findings demonstrate that it may be possible to lengthen lifespans further if improvements in health at the highest ages can be realized and if high quality elderly care is widely available.  Indeed, if this is so, then the human longevity revolution is set to continue for some time still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis article is republished from \u003ca href=\"http://theconversation.com\"\u003eThe Conversation\u003c/a\u003e under a Creative Commons license.

An Icelander hearing the unusually poetic word tolva for “computer\u0026#8221; also hears the faint ring of its ancient root words: tala for “number” and volva for “a female seer.” The Icelandic term for “midwife” (ljósmóður) combines “mother” and “light,” literally “mother of light.” While nearly every Icelander probably understands the same words in English, the foreign words offer no such colorful undertones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKnowing the geology of a word also allows its speakers to better understand the ideology that shaped it. The ancient word for \u0026#8220;homosexual\u0026#8221; in Icelandic, for example, once described a person who had lost their sex, or was drifting away from it—literally disoriented. To add further insult, one of the words in the compound, villingur, also implied someone who is ill-behaved. Having identified that history in the word, Icelanders have stopped using it altogether, in favor of samkynhneigð or samkynhneigður.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"attachment_1633009\" style=\"width: 705px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"\u003e\u003cimg aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1633009\" class=\"size-hero-l wp-image-1633009\" src=\"https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/towingsign.png?w=695\" alt=\"\" width=\"695\" height=\"717\" srcset=\"https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/towingsign.png 695w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/towingsign.png?resize=50,52 50w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/towingsign.png?resize=160,165 160w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/towingsign.png?resize=320,330 320w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/towingsign.png?resize=640,660 640w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/towingsign.png?resize=32,32 32w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 695px) 100vw, 695px\" /\u003e\u003cp id=\"caption-attachment-1633009\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"\u003e\u003c!-- caption placeholder --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside the department, Icelanders have used the same compound method to make their own translations of global vernacular. Hrutskyring, the Icelandic word for \u0026#8220;mansplaining,\u0026#8221; substitutes the Icelandic word for “ram” where the English is “man.”  (Icelanders rarely miss an opportunity to insert a sheep pun.) The DIY compound neologism mammviskubit (mother guilt), refers to the guilt that modern mothers might feel when distracted from parenting by their phones or work. There is no equivalent term for fathers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Department is there to help Icelanders of all stripes invent any word they want. “I’ve just got this new gadget to sell.

Later, another Icelandic researcher personally championed Icelandic as a language to be included in Google\u0026#8217;s speech recognition software: Trausti Kristjanssen, whose father, a biomedical engineer, created Iceland’s first computer dictionary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It goes back to the Viking culture—being a good poet was as important as being a good warrior,” says Trausti, of his own deep interest in the language. “I think this is why the early Icelanders wrote the sagas.

It was slow going, due to the enormous cost and effort required at the time to make a computer understand human speech. \u0026#8220;We had people working for 15 years on the peculiarities of French—pronunciation, grammar, syntax rules,\u0026#8221; Trausti recalls. \u0026#8220;I said we should do Icelandic, and everyone laughed.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow Trausti can laugh (hlátur). Google did eventually create voice search in Icelandic, as well as SMS dictation, thanks to a realization that could save languages across the world: Instead of devoting costly human resources to transmitting all of the knowledge and rules that constitute a language to a computer, Google would let the machines learn on their own—much like human children do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrausti’s team, led by data scientist Pedro Moreno, realized that machine learning could make the process fast enough to add all kinds of languages, with far less effort or investment than originally thought. \u0026#8220;All we needed was a huge amount of data and not experts,\u0026#8221; says Trausti. As a pilot, Google recruited some researchers from the University of Iceland to help collect the data with open-source tools. In 2009, they sent cell phones to various workplaces in Iceland, and asked those organizations to collect phrases from all the workers, for a total of about 250,000 unique utterances. Icelandic voice search came out the next year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"attachment_1633011\" style=\"width: 950px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"\u003e\u003cimg aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1633011\" class=\"size-hero-l wp-image-1633011\" src=\"https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/schooldesk.png?w=940\" alt=\"\" width=\"940\" height=\"622\" srcset=\"https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/schooldesk.png 1343w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/schooldesk.png?resize=768,508 768w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/schooldesk.png?resize=50,33 50w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/schooldesk.png?resize=160,106 160w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/schooldesk.png?resize=320,212 320w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/schooldesk.png?resize=640,424 640w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/schooldesk.png?resize=940,622 940w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" /\u003e\u003cp id=\"caption-attachment-1633011\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"\u003e\u003c!-- caption placeholder --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrausti, now a research manager in speech recognition and audio processing at Amazon, continues to work with the University of Reykjavik on language technology for Iceland.

Keenly aware of the technological promise, Iceland plans to make its language databases available to foreign tech companies, free of charge. The hope is that making the data free will incentivize more companies to teach their AI Icelandic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it’s not clear that even free data will ultimately offer enough of an incentive for Big Tech to develop products and services for a language with comparatively few speakers. Seven years after the team’s breakthrough with voice search, Google’s voice translation service Interpreter does not speak Icelandic. Nor is Icelandic available for the voice-operated Google Assistant.

All the people that have ever lived in Iceland are part of one language community and we understand all Icelanders that have gone before us. So that should be important.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost young people I met pooh-poohed the idea that their language could disappear, and one or two gently mocked the Language Planning Department’s attempts to centralize word-creation. However, the very youngest Icelander I met, a 12-year-old teenager riding his bike along a desolate patch of rural Icelandic coastline, did confess that he did sometimes forget basic Icelandic words—including the word “lunch”—to the consternation of his mom. He had learned his English from Grand Theft Auto and Friends, he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven if the all the world’s tech companies agreed to offer Icelandic options, there is a human problem: Young Icelanders have to want to speak Icelandic, and they have to have reason to speak it in their own country.

This fear is often without much reason, as few US beachgoers were likely to encounter one of these predators.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat is changing, however. Last month, researchers thought they spotted a great white shark off of Long Island Sound in \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/21/nyregion/shark-long-island-sound.html\"\u003eNew York\u003c/a\u003e (paywall). In Florida, scientists recently \u003ca href=\"https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Two-great-white-sharks-spotted-in-the-Gulf-near-13901494.php\"\u003espotted two great whites\u003c/a\u003e in the waters of the Gulf of Mexico. The return of great white sharks, due in large part to conservation efforts, is prompting scientists to focus on ways humans and sharks can better live—if not swim—side by side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs \u003ca href=\"https://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/2019/05/14/cape-cod-sharks/\"\u003eBoston Magazine\u003c/a\u003e reported on May 14, these predators are on the rebound near Cape Cod, Massachusetts, and beach towns are struggling to contend with the problem. Last September, a surfer—Arthur Medici, a 26-year-old from Brazil—was fatally attacked by a great white. His death came just a few weeks after 61-year-old swimmer William Lytton was bitten by a shark in the same waters. Lytton was in a coma for two days but lived to tell the tale of his great white encounter. In 2017, a great white in the same area bit a paddleboarder but the boarder wasn\u0026#8217;t hurt, while in 2014, a great white chomped on two kayaks, leaving the kayakers traumatized but uninjured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe region seems to be teeming with sharks. And indeed, the Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries (DMF) has spotted hundreds of these predators swimming nearer than ever to local beaches in recent years. This is both bad news and good news, says Thomas Grothues of the department of marine and coastal sciences at Rutgers University in New Jersey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=\"pull-quote\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"quote-line\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe return of great white sharks can be attributed to human efforts to conserve sea life that we nearly wiped out.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"quote-line\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003eFirst, the good news. The region was historically a natural habitat for great white sharks and they are being drawn back to the growing number of gray seals in the region, now on the rebound after years of being hunted down in bounty programs. Their return can be attributed to human efforts to conserve sea life that we nearly wiped out, a positive sign that conservation is undoing the damage people did before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the west coast of the US, sea lion populations are also on the uptick, which is attracting more predators close to beaches there, Grothues says. Sharks were also aggressively targeted by humans in the past. But now that there are protections in place for all these marine creatures, their populations are growing and becoming more visible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, the bad news. More marine life can also mean an increase in risk for people. As sharks increasingly swim closer to shore in waters that humans enjoy, the danger to beachgoers is growing. Still, Grothues says, \u0026#8220;It\u0026#8217;s important to keep this in perspective. Sharks are not very often going to be successful at getting a meal out of a human.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=\"pull-quote\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"quote-line\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“It’s important to keep this in perspective. Sharks are not very often going to be successful at getting a meal out of a human.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"quote-line\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003eGrothues explains that most young sharks don\u0026#8217;t want to eat people. Even if they did, they wouldn\u0026#8217;t be able to, as their teeth are better suited to holding fish. As great whites get older and develop those terrifying saw-like teeth that can chomp through us like so much meat, they are more of a threat to humans, but we are still not their ideal meal. People are not as fatty or as nourishing as seals or sea lions. To the extent that humans get bitten by great whites, it\u0026#8217;s not because they nutritious or delicious. It\u0026#8217;s more likely because a person was in the wrong place at the wrong time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarine biologists are increasingly finding that sea creatures each have distinct personalities as well, Grothues notes. It\u0026#8217;s possible then, he contends, that the shark that attacked and killed Medici last year was a bad apple, as it were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrothues doesn\u0026#8217;t dismiss the dangers to humans of sharks. But he argues that the more we know about their behaviors and patterns, the safer it will be for people to keep enjoying beaches. Tagging and counting creatures won\u0026#8217;t save human lives, but knowing where and how great whites move, and when they feed, does show us what we truly have to fear and how to avoid deadly encounters. Studying sharks is a good start in helping humans to devise better systems to stay safe while protecting sharks at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur growing awareness of their presence through scientific efforts also means we\u0026#8217;re more attuned to the fact that they are nearby, he says, but \u0026#8220;we can concentrate resources more effectively when we understand the sharks\u0026#8217; behavior better,\u0026#8221; Grothues argues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Cape Cod, for example, municipalities are \u003ca href=\"https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/05/shark-attack-repellent-safety-cape-cod.html\"\u003ethis summer\u003c/a\u003e funding the addition of phones on beaches in places where cell phone receptivity is limited to make it easier to report sightings and warn beachgoers in the region if a predator is seen swimming close by. Beaches are also being supplied with more sophisticated first aid kits to immediately treat potential shark bites.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=\"pull-quote\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"quote-line\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u0026#8220;Where there is risk to humans, we need to address that graciously.

Arguably, programs could be set up for the public to help track and report great whites and other dangerous predators using drones. Like adding phones to beaches, this would make it easier to report sightings and warn beachgoers. Grothues notes too that in Brazil and Australia researchers have experimented with creating barriers in the ocean that keep dangerous predators from approaching beaches. These can be somewhat effective, but also endanger sea turtles and other creatures who can get caught up in nets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne thing is certain: Going back to the days when people shot at sharks from boats, as they did in the early to mid-20th century, is not the solution—although one Cape Cod politician briefly \u003ca href=\"https://www.bostonherald.com/2017/08/23/latest-shark-incident-prompts-cape-cod-politician-to-push-deadly-plan/\"\u003esuggested as much.\u003c/a\u003e Grothues has heard tales from older marine scientists about the bounty hunting that depleted animal populations and forced the need for conservation, and they are gruesome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;It\u0026#8217;s not just an emotional response,\u0026#8221; Grothues explains, saying that he doesn\u0026#8217;t feel personally attached to sharks necessarily. He does, however, appreciate what they do, and warns that we need these creatures even if they do rightly terrify us. \u0026#8220;They are \u003ca href=\"https://qz.com/1300150/world-oceans-day-2018-sharks-dont-deserve-their-dangerous-reputation/\"\u003ean important part of the ecosystem.\u003c/a\u003e Where there is risk to humans, we need to address that graciously.

Applicants will also have to supply five years of email addresses and phone numbers. These requirements, which previously only applied to applicants flagged for additional vetting, are expected to affect approximately \u003ca href=\"https://www.apnews.com/c96a215355b242e58107c2125c18fc4a\"\u003e15 million\u003c/a\u003e visa applicants annually.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyone who has applied for a US visa will already know how stringent the requirements are for applicants. This can include details about family members, travel and work history, proof of financial security, years of addresses, and more. Some applicants are fortunate to get a 10-year visa. Unlucky ones can prepare to do the process again if they need to travel to the country within a few months or years. (To be fair, the US isn\u0026#8217;t alone in putting visitors and immigrants through onerous requirements like these, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/09/countries-difficult-visas-travel/403267/\"\u003eother countries\u003c/a\u003e make it even harder.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe process requires applicants to provide reams of evidence that they are not a security risk, and apply an almost obsessive attention to detail to make sure their application isn\u0026#8217;t held up by typos or any material that could be subject to misinterpretation. Adding social media vetting to this process is only going to amp up that anxiety, and for good reason.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they were first proposed last year, the new requirements were contested by the American Civil Liberties Union as \u0026#8220;ineffective and deeply problematic.\u0026#8221; The nonprofit said it was concerned that they risked self-censorship and unfair profiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;People will now have to wonder if what they say online will be misconstrued or misunderstood by a government official,\u0026#8221; Hina Shamsi, director of the organization\u0026#8217;s National Security Project, said \u003ca href=\"https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-comment-state-department-notices-requiring-social-media-information-visa\"\u003ein a statement\u003c/a\u003e. \u0026#8220;There is also no evidence that such social media monitoring is effective or fair, especially in the absence of criteria to guide the use of social media information in the visa adjudication process.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;Social media can be a major forum for terrorist sentiment and activity,\u0026#8221; a State Department official \u003ca href=\"https://thehill.com/hilltv/rising/446336-trump-admin-to-ask-most-us-visa-applicants-for-social-media-information?rnd=1559316643\"\u003etold The Hill\u003c/a\u003e. \u0026#8220;This will be a vital tool to screen out terrorists, public safety threats, and other dangerous individuals from gaining immigration benefits and setting foot on US soil.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has long used social media to screen immigrants and Americans, but began to expand its use of social media surveillance in \u003ca href=\"https://www.oig.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/assets/2017/OIG-17-40-Feb17.pdf\"\u003epilot programs\u003c/a\u003e (pdf) in 2015.

If you\u0026#8217;re lucky, you never have to think about it because your breath comes naturally, unimpeded, without any effort at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, learning how to breathe thoughtfully is important. Our breath and our health are inextricably linked and you can change your mental and physical state by understanding the ins and outs of your inhales and exhales, according to Ashley Neese, a breath specialist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeese teaches people how to breathe. She works with groups and individuals on cultivating awareness of their life force so they can use it mindfully to relax, feel happier, and even overcome lifelong traumas. Her new book, \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/598412/how-to-breathe-by-ashley-neese/9780399582714/\"\u003eHow to Breathe,\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/em\u003ereleased in April, tells a brief history of the breath as part of ancient spiritual and heath practices like meditation and yoga, and looks at the current science of breathing. It also provides 25 simple exercises that you can do at home to get in touch with the wind that blows through your body and gives you vitality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;We are learning today through neuroscience research that a number of nerve cells in the brain stem connect breathing to different states of mind,\u0026#8221; Neese writes. \u0026#8220;This research is significant because it confirms what thinkers, healers, and mystics have known for ages; we have the power to shift our thinking by changing the way we breathe. And since it\u0026#8217;s already common knowledge that our thoughts affect our overall health, energy, and well-being, it\u0026#8217;s safe to conclude that changing our breathing can have a global effect on our entire body.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeese points out that adults typically breathe 12 to 20 breaths per minute, taking in oxygen and releasing carbon dioxide. About a quarter of the oxygen we inhale is used by the brain. Our breath is the \u0026#8220;natural detoxifier\u0026#8221; that keeps our minds and bodies clean and clear. You can use your inhalations and exhalations, then, to send a message to your nervous system, slow down your heart rate, and decrease stress whenever necessary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first exercise Neese offers is intended to have the opposite effect, however. \u0026#8220;Just for fun,\u0026#8221; she suggests, try holding your breath \u0026#8220;while feeling joyful.\u0026#8221; You will notice that it\u0026#8217;s impossible. You can\u0026#8217;t relax, and when you\u0026#8217;re straining to breathe it becomes more difficult to think at all, much less appreciate the moment. Many of us go through life holding our breath unconsciously, and that\u0026#8217;s what Neese is trying to correct with this exercise by making us more mindful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rest of the book targets particular feelings with specific movements and breaths. Here are a few to get you started on a practice of smart breathing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThe joy breath\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you do want to feel joyful, Neese has developed a three-minute pick-me-up intended to improve moods. She suggests you stand up tall with you feet hip-distance apart, bend your knees slightly, and let your arms rest at your side as you formulate the intention to feel joy. Then, take a few breaths, inhaling and exhaling through your nose only. Next, reach your arms upward as you inhale. Hold your breath for a couple of seconds, release your arms to your sides, and laugh out loud. Repeat this 10 times, being sure to breathe and laugh as deeply as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou might feel funny forcing laughs at first, and Neese admits it can be awkward. But, she writes, \u0026#8220;The joy breath is an invitation to switch your brain and body chemistry, thus changing the way you feel from the inside out.\u0026#8221; She contends that joy is contagious and that if you practice this exercise, alone or with others, you\u0026#8217;ll find this great feeling can be cultivated \u0026#8220;with intention and willingness.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eShifting negative thinking\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026#8217;re stuck in a mental loop and keep ruminating over the same old thoughts, fear not. Neese has another quick fix for what she calls \u0026#8220;your self-care tool kit,\u0026#8221; which shifts your perceptions so that you can see more clearly and feel better immediately. She notes that it\u0026#8217;s natural for the brain to focus on negativity, the things that go wrong, as this trait has helped humans survive for so long. But she argues that our \u0026#8220;hardware is in need of an upgrade and that the breath can help us get there.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor this exercise, stand up and set your intention to clear negative thoughts. Take three small consecutive breaths through your nose and then exhale through your mouth three times. Repeat these inhalations and exhalations for two full minutes and then rest for a minute, observing any changes in your mental state. \u0026#8220;Breathing through the mouth in this practice helps to clear energy more quickly than an exhale through the nose,\u0026#8221; Neese writes. \u0026#8220;This can be a faster way to change our state, and in the case of a negative thought loop, can be very supportive for making that change happen quickly.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eCultivating resilience\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ability to bounce back from disappointments is critical to our mental and physical health. Increasingly, psychologists argue that more than any other skill, \u003ca href=\"https://qz.com/1289236/resilience-is-the-new-happiness/\"\u003ecultivating resilience ensures a high quality of life\u003c/a\u003e because the resilient individual is self-reliant and internally driven, able to deal with any circumstances and the many inevitable setbacks life presents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeese contends that we can use our breath to develop this skill. She says that her resilience breath-work, more than any of the other exercises she offers, \u0026#8220;anchors you in the present [and] helps you feel alive.\u0026#8221; Practicing this five-minute hack regularly will leave you feeling more flexible generally and with a deeper sense of self-worth, she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo get started, stand up tall with your feet hip-distance apart. Bend your knees. Let your arms rest at your sides as you set the intention to develop resilience. Breathe in out through your nose for a few cycles, then inhale deeply through your nose as you reach your arms out by your sides palms facing upward. Then slowly raise your arms above your head until your palms are facing each other in a prayer position. As you exhale, draw your palms down your midline, pausing briefly at your heart, and release your hands to your side. Repeat this cycle for three minutes, then relax with your arms at your side for a minute and reflect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeese recommends doing this exercise every morning before breakfast for a week. She believes that is all the time it will take for you to notice you can \u0026#8220;uplift yourself, cultivate a stronger life force presence, and remind yourself that you\u0026#8217;ve got this.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt sounds too good to be true, perhaps, yet Neese swears by these free and easy exercises. Certainly, they seem worth trying.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://qz.com/1633226/do-you-even-know-how-to-breathe-this-article-will-teach-you/","published":"2019-06-02T16:41:47Z","guid":"https://qz.com/1633226//"},{"title":"The key to a perfect summer is making absolutely zero plans","content":"\u003cimg width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/crowds.jpeg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;w=1024\" class=\"attachment-medium_10 size-medium_10 wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/crowds.jpeg 3282w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/crowds.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/crowds.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/crowds.jpeg?resize=160,90 160w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/crowds.jpeg?resize=320,180 320w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/crowds.jpeg?resize=640,360 640w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/crowds.jpeg?resize=940,529 940w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/crowds.jpeg?resize=1600,900 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn our \u003ca href=\"https://qz.com/work/1458073/reddit-co-founder-alexis-ohanian-is-taking-a-stand-against-hustle-porn/\"\u003ehustle culture\u003c/a\u003e the richest among us are those who control their calendars. Yet despite feeling too busy, complaining of burnout and stress, and wanting to do little more than gaze numbly at Netflix, we pack our days with plans and fill the hours, weeks, and months in advance for fear of being bored.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis summer, go for the opposite approach. Make no plans. Scrap the calendar.

Reserve no Airbnb. Instead, delight in not knowing where you will be going or what you will do and \u003ca href=\"https://qz.com/quartzy/1342058/the-most-relaxing-vacation-you-can-take-is-going-nowhere-at-all/\"\u003elet time unfold\u003c/a\u003e. The more you\u0026#8217;re afraid of being bored, the more likely it is that this is precisely the kind of break that will liberate you and lead you to new heights of creativity and relaxation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeing bored is good for your health. One reason many of us feel especially stressed now is because technology keeps us constantly entertained. Our brains are accustomed to consuming lots of content and we rarely turn the external stimuli off. As a result, we feel as if we are always doing something, but much of this consumption isn\u0026#8217;t actually enriching us. It is merely filling time, that thing which we claim is so precious but that we give away so liberally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeing bored is good for your mind, imagination, and productivity, argues Sandi Mann, author of \u003cem\u003eThe Upside of Downtime\u003c/em\u003e and a senior psychology lecturer at the UK\u0026#8217;s University of Central Lancashire. Boredom is \u0026#8220;a search for neural stimulation that isn\u0026#8217;t satisfied,\u0026#8221; she \u003ca href=\"http://time.com/5480002/benefits-of-boredom/\"\u003etold Time magazine\u003c/a\u003e. \u0026#8220;If we can’t find it, our mind will create it.\u0026#8221; Her research, and that of other social scientists, has shown that giving the mind space to wander and daydream leads to inspiration and innovation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile some may protest that they can\u0026#8217;t abandon plans because they have kids to keep busy and precious few vacation days they must take advantage of, that\u0026#8217;s not actually a valid response. For one thing, psychologists recommend that children be bored during their summer vacations, \u003ca href=\"https://qz.com/704723/to-be-more-self-reliant-children-need-boring-summers/\"\u003eas Olivia Goldhill has noted in Quartz\u003c/a\u003e. It teaches them resourcefulness, time management, and creativity, and inspires them to find entertainments born of their own imaginations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor another thing, cramming a busy vacation into an already harried life undermines the whole point of time off, which is to create a brief sense of spaciousness in our otherwise packed days. If we spend the days we are free hurrying up to get a bunch of supposedly fun stuff done, we never discover our own depths, don\u0026#8217;t tap our inner resourcefulness, and come back from a break more exhausted than when we left. It means we don\u0026#8217;t relax and end up feeling perpetually stressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo though it may be totally anathema to you, clear your calendar this summer. Think of time as money and be really stingy with yours, avoiding obligations and entertainments that don\u0026#8217;t arise spontaneously. It may be the best season you\u0026#8217;ve had in years, especially if you\u0026#8217;re bored to tears and discover that\u0026#8217;s nothing to fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://qz.com/quartzy/1633181/the-key-to-a-perfect-summer-is-making-absolutely-zero-plans/","published":"2019-06-02T15:05:19Z","guid":"https://qz.com/1633181//"},{"title":"A book on focus, designed for the distracted, promises to spark your creativity","content":"\u003cimg width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/spark.creativity.jpeg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;w=1024\" class=\"attachment-medium_10 size-medium_10 wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/spark.creativity.jpeg 6720w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/spark.creativity.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/spark.creativity.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/spark.creativity.jpeg?resize=160,90 160w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/spark.creativity.jpeg?resize=320,180 320w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/spark.creativity.jpeg?resize=640,360 640w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/spark.creativity.jpeg?resize=940,529 940w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/spark.creativity.jpeg?resize=1600,900 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026#8217;re like pretty much everyone living in today\u0026#8217;s tech culture, you\u0026#8217;ve probably lost the ability to focus on anything for very long. Brian Solis, a digital anthropologist, understands this distractedness and he has solutions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSolis, who is the author of seven books about business and disruptive technologies, has felt himself disrupted by the new tools as well.

He was struggling to focus and wasn\u0026#8217;t having fun working or thinking. He couldn\u0026#8217;t concentrate on books or live conversations, and his imagination seemed dulled. He couldn\u0026#8217;t spend more than six minutes on a single activity before checking his devices, and he recognized a problem in himself that he was seeing in others, too. \u0026#8220;I was almost always online or on my phone,\u0026#8221; Solis writes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNew tech is \u003ca href=\"https://qz.com/1398398/the-internet-is-a-manifestation-of-our-psyches-neither-better-nor-worse/\"\u003edesigned to hook us\u003c/a\u003e. In \u003ca href=\"http://www.jaronlanier.com/tenarguments.html\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eTen Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, technologist Jared Lanier, who was early to the web and quick to advocate for more \u003ca href=\"https://qz.com/1427738/acronym-sums-up-problem-with-twitter-facebook-other-platforms/\"\u003econscious use of platforms\u003c/a\u003e, argues that engaging on the internet makes us feel bad because systems are designed to manipulate us by measuring our interests, anticipating our desires, modifying our behavior, and creating opportunities for advertisers. Like Solis, Lanier says we have to control how we use those tools or we will lose ourselves to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSolis started doing just that. He began paying close attention to how he spent his time, studying the science of consciousness, and devising exercises to rekindle the spark of creativity he felt was lost. He began \u0026#8220;attention hacking.\u0026#8221; Instead of trying to dive deep into activities that were now difficult for him, Solis tweaked his habits incrementally, using quick fixes to cultivate the strength for serious change. And when it worked, he realized that the book he had to write wasn\u0026#8217;t about how technology will change business. It was about how people can change their relationship to new tools.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fixes Solis came up with sound super simple. For example, he used to start the day by checking email and news, but decided to start writing instead, a switch inspired by a Montreal Neurological Institute analysis of 10,000 brain scans, which found that the brain literally shrinks throughout the course of the day. The researchers likened the mind to a sponge that is full of fluid in the morning and gets increasingly squeezed dry. Solis shifted his priorities, saving administrative matters for later in the day instead of wasting his best energy on less creative activities. He found he was becoming more productive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimilarly, Solis stopped multitasking. He became religious about doing only one thing at a time, instead of trying to get a bunch of things done all at once. By forcing himself to focus—even if only for short periods at first—the futurist noticed he was regaining the ability to concentrate for ever longer periods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce he started seeing that these changes were transforming his work and emotional state, Solis dug in deeper. He analyzed what he truly values, tried to get in touch with what it means to be happy, and gave himself time and mental space to play with the understanding that it would help him get more done ultimately. Solis started imposing breaks on himself to replenish his energy instead of wasting time endlessly scrolling through content online. He practiced silence, to try to quiet his constant mental chatter. The writer even picked up the guitar again, an instrument which had been shoved in his closet for years. And eventually, after three years between books, he finished his latest creative project.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eLife Scale\u003c/em\u003e is the result of Solis\u0026#8217; personal anguish and transformation, so it is designed for the distracted. Like so many new \u003ca href=\"https://qz.com/quartzy/1530348/instagram-is-changing-the-way-we-write-and-design-books/\"\u003ebooks in the Instagram era\u003c/a\u003e, this text is for people who now have some difficulty reading for extended periods of time, and are used to consuming content online. It\u0026#8217;s replete with images and important bits are highlighted. There are short stories, bits of guidance, exercises, and scientific findings. Though the book can be read straight-through, you can also flip it open to any spot and find a useful morsel of advice or an illuminating note, all meant to help you become more focused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, reading \u003cem\u003eLife Scale\u003c/em\u003e won\u0026#8217;t change your life unless you do the hard part of following the advice Solis provides.

Sony for instance is boosting rookie pay by up to 20% for new recruits in fields like artificial intelligence, \u003ca href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Companies/Sony-boosts-rookie-pay-to-reward-tech-talent\"\u003ereports the Nikkei Asian Review\u003c/a\u003e (paywall).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike most Japanese companies, Sony has traditionally emphasized seniority over individual abilities when it comes to salaries. But this year\u0026#8217;s class of new graduates joining the company can expect to make more money than their colleagues if they show exceptional abilities. Sony expects that about 5% of its 400 new hires will see their pay quickly rise above average salaries in 2019.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe baseline annual salary for an incoming employee joining Sony\u0026#8217;s technology divisions after graduate school is about 6 million yen, or $55,000, with a standard raise to 6.3 million in year two. Under the company\u0026#8217;s new pay structure, exceptional employees will earn 7.3 million yen, or about $67,000 within the first year. The Nikkei Asian Review predicts that Sony\u0026#8217;s announcement will influence other employers, saying, \u0026#8220;The change is likely to make waves in Japan\u0026#8217;s labor market.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the starting salaries Sony is promising may still seem paltry compared to the pay at US competitors, the Japanese company is getting much closer to offering similar compensation with these changes. According to Glassdoor, where users anonymously disclose pay and employment information online, the base pay for a software engineer at Google in the US ranges from $70,000 to more than $130,000. Similarly, the data from engineers at Apple shows a starting range from $70,000 to $140,000, with an average base pay of about $100,000.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSony is also making sure foreign hires feel comfortable working in Japan. According to \u003ca href=\"https://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/Careers/jphq/faq/index.html\"\u003eits website\u003c/a\u003e, workers from abroad can interview and work for the company entirely in English, rather than Japanese. The company has been recruiting engineers internationally, focusing on \u003ca href=\"https://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/Careers/jphq/recruitment/index.html\"\u003eIndia in particular since 2009\u003c/a\u003e. With its new pay structure and openness to non-Japanese-speaking workers, Sony may indeed find it easier than ever to compete with American tech giants in attracting the best and brightest workers.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://qz.com/1633348/google-and-apple-are-upending-japans-salary-traditions/","published":"2019-06-02T19:32:34Z","guid":"https://qz.com/1633348//"}]},{"url":"https://www.vice.com/en_us/rss","items":[]},{"url":"https://feeds.gothamistllc.com/gothamist05","items":[{"title":"Photos,

In the history of our country, no president has been attacked as he has. I believe the only hope for him, and this nation, is God.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe National Day of Prayer is a longstanding \u0026#8212; and somewhat controversial \u0026#8212; official event that goes back decades and has involved Congress and proclamations from presidents of both parties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe idea is to have people pray for the good of the country in a non-denominational and innocuous, even anodyne, way. Conservative evangelical Christians always participate, but they occupy the space alongside many other religions and do not dictate the message. Some groups have used the day to push their own agendas, but for Graham to declare a second special day of prayer specifically for the president is unique.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;By calling his own Day of Prayer, Graham gets to control the message,\u0026#8221; said Dr. Emily Johnson, assistant professor of history at Ball State University. Johnson could not think of a precedent in modern U.S. history, but she did note that the Puritans regularly called National Days of Prayer or Thanksgiving or Repentance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe people Graham says are supporters of the idea make up a Who’s Who list of the Religious Right. Former Gov. Mike Huckabee (R-AR), former Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-MN), James Dobson, Jack Graham, Paula White, Jerry Falwell Jr., and Robert Jeffress are all listed as supporting Graham\u0026#8217;s call for prayer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRev. Marie Alford-Harkey, president of the Religious Institute and a pastor with Metropolitan Community Churches, was struck by the difference in tone and messaging of Sunday\u0026#8217;s planned event.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;In most faith communities around the country, we pray for our leaders all the time. This is just a very different orientation,\u0026#8221; she told ThinkProgress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;This is very different from the way in which we pray for leaders which is that they serve the common good in the interest of peace. We believe it\u0026#8217;s important to lift up the leaders of the world because they have the power to to do good and pursue peace and justice. It\u0026#8217;s hard for me to pray for people who are in a position of power because they are in a position of power. I think for those of us in more progressive or mainline traditions that this will not change anything about the way we pray.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraham, son of the late televangelist Rev. Billy Graham, has not shied away from partisan politics. In 2016, he spent months traveling the country on a \u0026#8220;Decision America\u0026#8221; tour, urging people to vote on \u0026#8220;biblical principles.\u0026#8221; What that meant in a race between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton was simple, according to an \u003ca href=\"https://www.christianpost.com/news/franklin-graham-decision-america-tour-8200-unite-prayer-virginia-capitol.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003einterview\u003c/a\u003e he gave to the Christian Post.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;First of all, when it comes to the presidential election, it\u0026#8217;s not about emails that are lost, it\u0026#8217;s not about crude and vulgar language,\u0026#8221; he said. \u0026#8220;That\u0026#8217;s not what this vote is about. It\u0026#8217;s about the Supreme Court.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Johnson, Graham was likely motivated by fights over women\u0026#8217;s health. \u0026#8220;The timing of the event is most obviously about the recent controversy over restrictive abortion laws being passed in various states,\u0026#8221; she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;We\u0026#8217;ve seen renewed anti-Trump activism from the left, and especially from the women\u0026#8217;s movement. But Trump\u0026#8217;s promises to appoint pro-life judges and justices were a key reason that evangelicals supported Trump in 2016. I think Graham\u0026#8217;s Day of Prayer works in part to counter the negative reaction to these laws and to remind Trump that his supporters are still with him.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe relationship Trump has with white conservative evangelical voters is a strong one.

Though some of the more extreme and less-qualified candidates failed to get a formal nomination or confirmation, there are many who espouse radical views who have been appointed to lifetime positions on the bench.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;The Trump administration has delivered on its promise made during the election to give them the judges they want,\u0026#8221; said Nan Aron, founder and president of Alliance for Justice. \u0026#8220;Nearly every nominee to the bench has displayed hostility on LGBT rights, abortion rights, etc.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAron said the Religious Right has been trying to transform the judiciary for decades. The exchange is political support for conservative judges. \u0026#8220;They form a very potent constituency within the Republican party,\u0026#8221; she said. \u0026#8220;Does Donald Trump know much about federal judges and what they do? Probably not. But he was told by his advisers that it was the best way to get their support.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;They\u0026#8217;ve already received the gifts they\u0026#8217;ve asked for \u0026#8212; two Supreme Court seats and scores of lower court judges that hold their views.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;The most effective way to nurture the Religious Right and right-wing base in this country is to remind constituents that Trump is acting on his promises to them.

This is especially problematic because for many years, transgender people served in the military but not openly. The Obama administration reversed course in 2016 to allow transgender people to serve openly, and thousands of people made themselves known in active and reserve duty as transgender. The Trump administration reversal meant that those servicemembers could no longer serve. This year, the administration began discharging transgender servicemembers, and as of April 12, no transgender person will be allowed to enlist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eAllowing discrimination against transgender people in health care\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast week, the Trump administration targeted “Section 1557” in the Affordable Care Act, which bans discrimination on the basis of “sex.” The Obama administration had interpreted this to mean gender identity, but the Trump Department of Health and Human Services argued that not only should gender identity not be protected, but sex stereotyping of any kind should not be protected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEarlier this month, the administration also finalized the “conscience rule” which allows health care workers to refuse to treat people due to religious or moral objections. This threatens the lives of LGBTQ people who need medical care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eRescinding workplace and school protections for transgender people\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2017, the Trump Justice Department announced it would stop arguing that workplace protections on the basis of sex included protections for transgender people. This was after the department issued guidance that schools no longer had to protect transgender students.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWaging war against the Johnson amendment\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrump has \u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/05/09/president-trumps-shifting-claim-that-we-got-rid-johnson-amendment/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eoften claimed\u003c/a\u003e that he has gotten rid of the Johnson amendment, an item in the tax code that prohibits churches and other nonprofits from endorsing or opposing candidates for office. He issued an executive order in May 2017 that claimed at the time did away with the amendment, although his own Justice Department said in court that it did not. It remains a top priority of the Religious Right to repeal the Johnson Amendment, though Trump has claimed victory on the matter and seemingly moved on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eBirth control rule\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe administration finalized a rule last year that permits employers to use religion as their justification for refusing access to birth control coverage.\t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"promo amp-wp-article-promo\"\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"post__figure post__figure--format-full\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"post__thumbnail\"\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003ca href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/membership/?c=cr042018-7-00-wp\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cimg width=\"2917\" height=\"2038\" src=\"https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/membership-graphic_2.03-1.png?w=2917\u0026amp;h=2038\u0026amp;crop=1\" class=\"attachment-full size-full\" alt=\"\" data-attachment-id=\"1142474\" data-permalink=\"https://thinkprogress.org/membership-graphic_2-03-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/membership-graphic_2.03-1.png?w=2917\u0026amp;h=2038\u0026amp;crop=1\" data-orig-size=\"2917,2038\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{\u0026quot;aperture\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;credit\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;camera\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;created_timestamp\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;copyright\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;focal_length\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;iso\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;shutter_speed\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;title\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;orientation\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;}\" data-image-title=\"membership graphic_2.03\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/membership-graphic_2.03-1.png?w=2917\u0026amp;h=2038\u0026amp;crop=1\" data-large-file=\"https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/membership-graphic_2.03-1.png?w=2917\u0026amp;h=2038\u0026amp;crop=1\" draggable=\"false\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1920px) 1920px,(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1920px) 1920px,(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1024px) 1024px,(min-width: 512px) and (max-width: 1024px) 1024px,(min-width: 512px) and (max-width: 768px) 768px,(max-width: 512px) 512px,(max-width: 768px) 768px,2917px\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/membership-graphic_2.03-1.png?w=1920\u0026#038;crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C1341px\u0026#038;ssl=1 1920w,https://i1.wp.com/thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/membership-graphic_2.03-1.png?w=1024\u0026#038;crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C715px\u0026#038;ssl=1 1024w,https://i1.wp.com/thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/membership-graphic_2.03-1.png?w=768\u0026#038;crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C537px\u0026#038;ssl=1 768w,https://i1.wp.com/thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/membership-graphic_2.03-1.png?w=512\u0026#038;crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C358px\u0026#038;ssl=1 512w,https://i1.wp.com/thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/membership-graphic_2.03-1.png?w=2917\u0026#038;crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C2038px\u0026#038;ssl=1 2917w\" /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/a\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n","url":"https://thinkprogress.org/religious-right-pray-trump-enemies-away-6ddf38adcfa7/","published":"2019-06-02T13:43:54Z","guid":"https://thinkprogress.org/?p=1142632"},{"title":"The Trump administration escalates its war on reality","content":"\u003cp\u003eThe Trump administration is intensifying its effort to discredit climate science by recruiting a select group to try to cast doubt on the facts it doesn\u0026#8217;t like \u0026#8212; all under the guise of an official review.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePresident Donald Trump, who dismissed climate change as a \u0026#8220;hoax\u0026#8221; on the campaign trail, has filled his administration with people who would go to great lengths to stifle, obscure, and mock any evidence to the contrary.

He took those comments even further in a recent podcast interview, during which he said he likely killed hundreds of civilians and admitted that he doesn\u0026#8217;t care if a Navy SEAL committed a war crime by murdering an ISIS prisoner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter spoke to the podcast \u003cem\u003eZero Blog Thirty\u003c/em\u003e in \u003ca href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/zbt-170-interview-w-rep-duncan-hunter-on-eddie-gallaghers/id1151856991?i=1000439952113\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003ean episode\u003c/a\u003e that originally came out Tuesday and garnered widespread attention over the weekend. The hosts asked Hunter specifically about the case against Eddie Gallagher, who faces charges of numerous war crimes, but most notably stabbing a wounded teenage ISIS fighter in the neck and sharing photos of himself with the dead boy\u0026#8217;s head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter has publicly advocated for President Donald Trump to pardon Gallagher, which the president is reportedly mulling. As Hunter explained on the podcast, his own rationale is that he doesn\u0026#8217;t actually care if a war crime was committed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter insisted he doesn\u0026#8217;t believe the case against Gallagher, but that it doesn\u0026#8217;t matter to him if it\u0026#8217;s true. \u0026#8220;I frankly don\u0026#8217;t care if he was killed,\u0026#8221; Gallagher said of the ISIS fighter. \u0026#8220;I just don\u0026#8217;t care.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the end, even if everything that the prosecutors said about the one ISIS fighter that escaped the bombing of this building — and that the Iraqis then shot, and then interrogated, then turned him over to the SEALS — I frankly don\u0026#8217;t care if he was killed. I just don\u0026#8217;t care, and that\u0026#8217;s my personal point of view, and as a Congressman that\u0026#8217;s my prerogative to help a guy out like that. Even if everything that the prosecutors say is true in this case, then Eddie Gallagher should still be given a break I think.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen host Kate Mannion noted that the stabbing might even violate the Geneva Convention, Hunter insisted, \u0026#8220;Yeah, but ISIS is not part of — and I think this guy was going to die anyway, because I\u0026#8217;ve seen the video.\u0026#8221; When pressed on whether he still wouldn\u0026#8217;t care if Gallagher\u0026#8217;s actions constituted a war crime, Hunter said, \u0026#8220;I would still support him, yeah.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the conversation continued, Hunter took a defensive position, suggesting that he was likely responsible for killing many civilian women and children too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen how do you judge me? So I was an artillery officer and we fired hundreds of rounds into Fallujah, killed probably hundreds of civilians — if not scores of hundreds of civilians — probably killed women and children if there were any left in the city when we invaded. So do I get judged too?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMannion tried to note that there\u0026#8217;s a difference between the collateral damage of artillery fire and killing a specific prisoner who\u0026#8217;s already wounded — not to mention desecrating the corpse by posing for pictures with it. \u0026#8220;I just feel like we\u0026#8217;re above that, that\u0026#8217;s all,\u0026#8221; she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;Okay,\u0026#8221; Hunter replied, ending the discussion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe interview suggests Hunter wishes to offer wide latitude to soldiers to act in immoral ways. Before the discussion about Gallagher, the congressman also suggested that there should be a one-month grace period for soldiers returning from combat zones \u0026#8220;where you get some time to not get in trouble, especially if you get a DUI or something like that.\u0026#8221; (Hunter is currently facing charges of embezzling $250,000 from his campaign over a period of seven years, undermining his moral credibility to defend others.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe comments Hunter made on this podcast also cannot be separated from his history of extremely Islamophobic rhetoric. In last year\u0026#8217;s election, he attacked his opponent Ammar Campa-Najjar (D) as a “security risk” and a “radical Muslim,” even complaining at one campaign rally that kids in California schools were learning how to be respectful of their Muslim classmates. \u0026#8220;It’s not just a religion.

Apple introduced the concept at last year's WWDC, but we expect the big rollout to happen in some form or another this year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1513395#p3\"\u003eRead 2 remaining paragraphs\u003c/a\u003e | \u003ca href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1513395\u0026comments=1\"\u003eComments\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"feedflare\"\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=8M_ijwzgAd0:rg6FV8QEyV8:V_sGLiPBpWU\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=8M_ijwzgAd0:rg6FV8QEyV8:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=8M_ijwzgAd0:rg6FV8QEyV8:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=8M_ijwzgAd0:rg6FV8QEyV8:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=8M_ijwzgAd0:rg6FV8QEyV8:qj6IDK7rITs\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=8M_ijwzgAd0:rg6FV8QEyV8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","url":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1513395","published":"2019-06-02T12:30:46Z","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1513395"},{"title":"“WHAT HAPPENED????” How a remote tech writing gig proved to be an old-school scam","content":"\u003cdiv id=\"rss-wrap\"\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"intro-image intro-left\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/robot-operators-800x531.jpg\" alt='Maybe this is the \"Mark Taylor\" I seek...'\u003e\u003cp class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/robot-operators.jpg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"1175\" data-width=\"1769\"\u003eEnlarge\u003c/a\u003e \u003cspan class=\"sep\"\u003e/\u003c/span\u003e Maybe this is the \"Mark Taylor\" I seek...

These high-tech predators use a new twist on an old scam to \"hire\" the victim in order to gain access to their bank account. The scheme was cleverly engineered, but a couple of small irregularities tipped me off to my would-be assailants' plans before they could steal anything more than two days' worth of my time. Once alerted, I was even able to use some of their own tactics to inflict a bit of pain on the folks who sought to scam me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmbarrassing as it might be, I'm sharing my experiences in the hope that they might help you avoid falling victim to these cyber-vultures and perhaps even turn the tables on them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThe setup\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike most successful cons, this one involved gaining the willing consent of its victim through some combination of greed, fear, or desperation.

But as they venture out beyond Dinétah, they’re forced to work together on overcoming their own issues to try and save their home. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"gWxJan\"\u003eIn this instance, we learn that the White Locust wants to destroy Dinétah in a plot to both placate his ego and sense of revenge for his childhood trauma. Kai, with his abilities, is instrumental to the White Locust’s plan. Both parts of this story fit perfectly together: Maggie works to heal some of the trauma that she’s endured over the years and help her new friends, while their adversary is caught in his own self-destructive mindset. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"V4W87T\"\u003eAlong the way, we’re treated to some fantastic and horrifying scenery that shows off what’s happened with the world. Society has collapsed, and we see armed gangs running around the countryside in their own territory, and the chaos allows for charismatic figures like the White Locust to swoop in and gather up followers to enact some really horrible plans. Where the action was largely limited to Dinétah in the prior book, seeing the characters navigate the destruction is useful, showing a more complete picture for the larger world that Roanhorse has created. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"t7SoZY\"\u003eRoanhorse wraps the novel up nicely, but it’s clear from the ending that there’s more in store for Maggie and her allies.

But some of its major partners are staying quiet — most notably Microsoft, which still hasn’t put out an official statement on the ban. Microsoft did quietly pull Huawei laptops from its site, suggesting some kind of withdrawal of services, but we’re still in the dark about the company’s broader plans for dealing with the ban.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"1C3R4Y\"\u003eMicrosoft is one of Huawei’s biggest software partners, licensing and maintaining Windows on a number of Huawei laptops that have to be directly licensed and updated by the company. It’s most likely that Microsoft is simply staying quiet because of the sensitivity of the issue, but the silence raises an interesting question: if Microsoft (or any other company) defies the Commerce order and keeps doing business with Huawei, what kind of penalties would it face?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"QR2DyM\"\u003eThe assumption from nearly everyone in the industry is that Microsoft will take the same tack as Google and the others, for the simple reason that they can’t afford not to. There’s a raft of penalties for companies that defy export bans, ranging from civil fines to denial orders that would place explicit limits on what the violating company can export, all administered by \u003ca href=\"https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/enforcement\"\u003ededicated Export Enforcement investigators\u003c/a\u003e. If the violations are flagrant enough, there can even be criminal penalties, like a case in May that saw a New Jersey man convicted on conspiracy charges for \u003ca href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-nj/pr/middlesex-county-man-admits-participation-conspiracy-illegally-export-firearms-and-other\"\u003eexporting weapons to Ukraine\u003c/a\u003e. But given how much Microsoft relies on government and international contracts for its business, there would be plenty for the company to lose before the threat of jail time was even raised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"g01w0Z\"\u003eIt’s not just US companies that need to be careful of this kind of penalty. As law firms are rushing to clarify, anyone who licenses technology from the US has to abide the same restrictions, which effectively means cutting off partnership with Huawei. “For example,” \u003ca href=\"https://www.akingump.com/en/news-insights/reminder-commerce-department-prohibitions-pertaining-to-huawei.html\"\u003eone firm explains\u003c/a\u003e, “nonpublic U.S.-origin technology necessary to produce a toothbrush may not be provided to Huawei by a company outside the United States without a BIS license,” even if the toothbrush itself is made outside the US. That risk goes a long way to explain why companies like ARM, which is based outside the US and provides chip architectures rather than manufacturing itself, are still steering clear of the ban.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"9CDite\"\u003eWhat’s more likely is that Microsoft is simply playing for time. Trump himself has hinted that the restrictions could be removed as part of a trade deal, which would likely be struck before the new tariffs go into effect on June 25th. If that deal actually happens, staying quiet and riding out the storm might seem smart in retrospect — but given Trump’s track record as a federal deal-maker, it seems like a risky bet.\u003c/p\u003e","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/2/18647156/huawei-ban-consequences-microsoft-commerce-trump","published":"2019-06-02T16:00:00Z","guid":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/2/18647156/huawei-ban-consequences-microsoft-commerce-trump"},{"title":"Amazon will reportedly fall under antitrust oversight from the FTC","content":"\u003cimg alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oE1i1knu4b_jKJxiUhTI8eD7pXc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/63935789/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0007.0.jpg\" /\u003e\n\n\n\n  \u003cp id=\"aW4KpW\"\u003eAmazon will reportedly fall under the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission following an agreement between the FTC and the Department of Justice, \u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/06/02/amazon-could-face-heightened-antitrust-scrutiny-under-new-agreement-between-us-regulators/?utm_term=.a90ec1b11836\"\u003ereports \u003cem\u003eThe Washington Post\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.

It felt simple. I just placed a finger on it, waited a moment, and after my phone vibrated the tiniest amount to confirm everything’s okay, I was let into my device. Now, though, after spending a week with the side-mounted fingerprint sensor on the \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/21/18633027/honor-20-pro-series-release-date-news-feature-specs-camera-battery-life\"\u003eHonor 20 Pro\u003c/a\u003e, I’m not so sure it’s the simplest or most convenient place for a fingerprint sensor after all. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"tzP2qI\"\u003eBack in the bulky bezel days, there was one obvious place for manufacturers to put their shiny new fingerprint sensors. Apple, Samsung, and pretty much everyone else plonked a big home button on the bezel at the bottom of their displays, and we got used to holding our phones so that either thumb was positioned to quickly get scanned. But as bezels got smaller, and home buttons started to disappear, everyone started to get more creative with their biometric security. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"bZMKcv\"\u003eMany, including Samsung, Google, and LG, initially went for rear-mounted fingerprint sensors, and until now I’ve been firmly in favor of this decision. I like their simplicity, I like the fact that you only have to register one finger on each hand to use them, and I like that I can feel where they are without having to look at my phone, unlike Apple’s Face ID or in-display scanners that only cover a small portion of the screen. This sounds like a minor thing, but one of my main uses for Google Pay is tapping my way through the London Underground’s ticket barriers to pay my fare, and in a crowded ticket hall I want to be able to keep my eyes on where I’m going rather than making eye-contact with my phone’s face-scanning biometric security, or looking for the specific part of the screen that’s able to scan my thumbprint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Opc2TM\"\u003eFor the most part, Honor has been happy to follow this trend, but with the Honor 20 Pro it took a slightly different approach and mounted its sensor on the side. It’s not the only one, Samsung recently used a side-mounted sensor on the \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/13/18262252/samsung-galaxy-s10e-android-phone-review-specs-features\"\u003eGalaxy S10E\u003c/a\u003e (and the \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/19/18498904/samsung-galaxy-fold-review-screen-broken-issue-durability-foldable-phone-video-performance-price\"\u003eill-fated Galaxy Fold\u003c/a\u003e), and Sony has been using them for years on a range of its devices. But the \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/21/18633027/honor-20-pro-series-release-date-news-feature-specs-camera-battery-life\"\u003eHonor 20 Pro\u003c/a\u003e is the first of these phones that I’ve had the chance to use extensively, and it completely changed my attitude.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sAMrj5htnFekPi87Y52_jF7lffw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16288368/jporter_190517_3431_9184.jpg\"\u003e\n      \u003ccite\u003ePhoto by Jon Porter / The Verge\u003c/cite\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"0uaYPp\"\u003eInitially, it took me a little while to warm to the sensor placement on the Honor 20 Pro. With a rear-mounted sensor you only really need to scan your two index fingers to cover every eventuality, but with a side-mounted sensor there are so many more possibilities. To start with, I set up both the index finger and middle finger on my left hand and the thumb on my right hand, but eventually I’d added both thumbs, middle fingers, and index fingers when I realized you might use any of these fingers when unlocking a phone that laid flat on a desk. That’s six fingerprints you have to register in total, and at the time it felt like a hassle. But unless you’re changing your phone super regularly, I can’t see this being a problem you’ll have more than once a year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"7tUbCD\"\u003eOnce it’s set up, combining the fingerprint sensor and power buttons makes so much sense. Unless you’re picking up your phone to specifically check your notifications, it’s likely that you’re going to want to unlock it, so there’s little sense in wasting space having two buttons when one will suffice. Yes, this means that you’ll hardly ever see your lock screen any more, but if you really need to look at it then you can nudge the power button with an unregistered part of your thumb to wake the phone without unlocking it. Alternatively, the Samsung Galaxy S10E also has a neat feature where you can double tap the screen to wake up the phone without unlocking it, although this feature isn’t available on Honor’s device. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"891hL7\"\u003eIt’s also great when you have a phone on the desk in front of you. Rather than committing to picking up a handset, like I have to do whenever I want to unlock my Pixel 3, I can just give the Honor 20 Pro a little squeeze to have a quick scroll through Twitter or check my emails. It’s another little thing, but it’s something I found myself doing a lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"A4LnSK\"\u003eIt’s not just me that’s discovered a soft spot for the side-mounted fingerprint sensor. When my colleague Natt reviewed the budget member of the Samsung Galaxy S10 lineup, the \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/13/18262252/samsung-galaxy-s10e-android-phone-review-specs-features\"\u003eS10E\u003c/a\u003e, she also loved its placement. She said she found it sat naturally underneath her thumb while she was using the device, and was easy to instinctively feel out without having to look at the phone. Compared to previous Samsung Galaxy devices, it also had the added benefit of being nowhere near the phone’s rear camera, unlike the S8 and S9 which placed them so close together on the rear of the phone that it became easy to confuse them when feeling with your finger. \u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rO1QrPgRng7oHakcnqgZXXCFcxo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/15957300/akrales_190311_3263_0045.jpg\"\u003e\n      \u003ccite\u003ePhoto by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\u003c/cite\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Xtr5tb\"\u003eSide-mounted sensors aren’t without their drawbacks. They’re not symmetrical for one thing, meaning that they don’t cater equally to right-handed and left-handed people. That might not be a problem for some, but if you’ve got smaller hands and you’re using a larger device, reaching your fingers around the back of the device to a sensor on its side could be difficult. Side-mounted sensors are also under more space constraints than those on the backs of devices, so you have to be more specific about how you place your thumb or finger on it if you want it to scan correctly first time. Spending more time setting up your fingerprints correctly can help with this, but it’s more effort than you’d have to put into setting up a rear-mounted sensor. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"36k9Ka\"\u003ePerhaps understandably, as the technology improves, the industry at large now seems to be shifting inexorably toward under-display fingerprint sensors. In just a few short years, they’ve gone from being a \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/6/11/17448214/vivo-x21-ud-in-display-fingerprint-sensor-review\"\u003eniche feature on Chinese handsets\u003c/a\u003e to featuring heavily in two of the biggest flagships of the year, the Samsung Galaxy S10 and the OnePlus 7 Pro. Now, \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/1/17/18187776/xiaomi-bigger-in-display-fingerprint-sensor\"\u003eearly prototypes from the likes of Xiaomi\u003c/a\u003e suggest that the next step will be to turn most or even all of the screen into one large sensor. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"FpLTz5\"\u003eWhat I like most about the side-mounted fingerprint sensor is the way it blurs the line between functionality and security. You don’t really think about scanning your finger on the Honor 20 Pro’s sensor, it just happens automatically when you go to wake your device. I hope this is the future we eventually reach with in-display fingerprint sensors, where your device is seamlessly checking your fingerprints as you use your phone. When security becomes invisible, the inconvenience of using it almost completely disappears, people are willing to put up with more of it, and everyone becomes safer as a result. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"C6qWuM\"\u003eWe’re not there yet. In-display fingerprint sensors still cover just a small part of the screen, and you still have to think just that little bit about using them in order to get them to work. But while we’re still waiting for them to cover the entirety of a screen, a side-mounted fingerprint sensor feels like the perfect solution, and I hope more manufacturers follow Honor and Samsung’s leads and start using them.\u003c/p\u003e","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/2/18645783/fingerprint-sensors-side-mounted-samsung-galaxy-s10e-honor-20-pro-sony","published":"2019-06-02T15:00:00Z","guid":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/2/18645783/fingerprint-sensors-side-mounted-samsung-galaxy-s10e-honor-20-pro-sony"},{"title":"Marvel is adapting a number of its iconic comic books into audiobooks","content":"\u003cimg alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JI05Hk6IEd8_pZeWteyi-ntVuB8=/0x0:1796x1197/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/63935578/marvel.0.1430832763.0.jpg\" /\u003e\n\n\n\n  \u003cp id=\"5qg04B\"\u003eMarvel Entertainment has partnered with audiobook and digital content producer Dreamscape Media to adapt a number of Marvel’s comic stories as “read-to-me style audiobooks,” \u003ca href=\"https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/marvel-dreamscape-audio-books-1203228671/\"\u003ereports \u003cem\u003eVariety\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.

Unlike last year’s podcast \u003cem\u003eInside Jaws\u003c/em\u003e from Mark Ramsey and Wondery, this isn’t so much a making-of story as it is about the three men themselves, and how each had their own influence on changing movies forever. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"GojUHW\"\u003eYou can listen to \u003cem\u003eBlockbuster\u003c/em\u003e on \u003ca href=\"https://www.getblockbuster.com/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eBlockbuster\u003c/em\u003e’s website\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/blockbuster/id1451112935\"\u003eApple Podcasts\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/6nhQUF8rDmBaRjbZp9zgzv\"\u003eSpotify\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/score-the-podcast/blockbuster\"\u003eStitcher\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E_Vt2N-3lAG1pSse-2f0Pwp1Yzg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16309981/BLOCKBUSTER_artwork_clean_blue_sky_copy_itunes_thick.jpg\"\u003e\n      \u003ccite\u003eImage: Epicleff Media\u003c/cite\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"9nLm5A\"\u003eSchrader told \u003cem\u003eThe Verge\u003c/em\u003e that while his background is in investigative journalism, they opted to take a more dramatic approach: “the thing that was really interesting is the storyline between Steven, and George, and John Williams. That is something that hasn’t been written about before, at least not as a story arc narrative, and that’s something we wanted to bring to life.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"VTgLUU\"\u003e“With a documentary, you can construct an interesting, informative piece, but you’re not able to capture the moment of actually being there.” Schrader noted. “You’re always removed from what happened a little bit. In this case, we turned all of the research that goes into a journalistically-drive, true-crime [style] podcast, and merge that with the film production approach on the backend.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"BOqJaW\"\u003eSchrader put his experience as an investigative journalist to work, going through interviews to ground their series in a factual manner. “We were actually able to include the phrase ‘this is a true story’ in our story,” he says. The series went through a legal review and fact check to verify everything they could. That effort sets the series apart from another podcast series that took a similar approach, Wondery’s \u003cem\u003eInside Jaws. Inside Jaws \u003c/em\u003eis a fun and engaging listen, but it’s more like the films that are heavily inspired by, but which is free to take a bit more dramatic license. The distinction is probably best viewed through a cinematic lens — \u003cem\u003eSaving Private Ryan\u003c/em\u003e is a historically-inspired film about real events, whereas HBO’s \u003cem\u003eBand of Brothers\u003c/em\u003e is a dramatic recreation of history and characters. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"knC8f6\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eBlockbuster\u003c/em\u003e distinguishes itself in other ways as well — it’s not a “making of” in the same way as Mark Ramsey’s \u003ca href=\"https://wondery.com/shows/inside-psycho/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eInside Psycho\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://wondery.com/shows/inside-the-exorcist/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eInside The Exorcist\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://wondery.com/shows/inside-jaws/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eInside Jaws\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e — and most recently, \u003ca href=\"https://wondery.com/shows/inside-star-wars/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eInside Star Wars\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e. \u003c/em\u003eRather, Schrader describes it as a story of the friendship of Lucas and Spielberg, and how together, the two of them upended the entire movie industry. “It’s because they relied on each other and they had this mutual respect and support for each another in this pivotal time in the 1970s.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-float-right\"\u003e\u003caside id=\"xcOtds\"\u003e\u003cq\u003eit’s also an appreciation for another common link between them: John Williams\u003c/q\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"vSA2xf\"\u003eWhile the series is framed as the story behind the rise of the blockbuster film through \u003cem\u003eJaws\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eStar Wars\u003c/em\u003e, it’s also an appreciation for another common link between them: Williams’ music. The series introduces the composer through Spielberg, and goes through the beats for the creation of the iconic music for \u003cem\u003eJaws\u003c/em\u003e, the time Spielberg introduced Williams to Lucas, and the impact that his music had on conveying the grand scale of the \u003cem\u003eStar Wars\u003c/em\u003e universe to the film’s producers and audience. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"2Piyam\"\u003eSchrader explained that the composer’s biography was the most difficult to get right. “There’s not that much about him, and his story is virtually unknown.” They had to go to original sources, like letters and files that they were able to track down, and were able to piece together the events of his life for the series. The appreciation for Williams appears in other places as well — Schrader and his team put together an original, John Williams-style score by Ryan Taubert and Benjamin Botkin for the podcast, which accompanies the action and enhances the story as it plays out.

Grim also weighs in on the large 2020 Democratic candidate field and talks about his new book, “We’ve Got People: From Jesse Jackson to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the End of Big Money and the Rise of a Movement.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eJeremy Scahill: \u003c/b\u003eThis is Intercepted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[Music interlude.]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eJS: \u003c/b\u003eI’m Jeremy Scahill, coming to you from the offices of The Intercept in New York City. And this is a special bonus episode of Intercepted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eJS: \u003c/b\u003eThere is a very mild, collegial debate brewing among Democrats in Congress: to impeach or not. Calls are mounting for the opening of an impeachment inquiry and the effort now has the support of at least one Republican congressman, Justin Amash, the libertarian politician from Michigan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eJustin Amash: \u003c/b\u003eNonetheless we have a job to do and I think we owe it to the American people to represent them, to ensure that the people we have in office are doing the right thing, are of good character, aren’t violating the public trust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eJS: \u003c/b\u003eNancy Pelosi, the House speaker, has not shown any sign that she will back such a move imminently and she appears to be opting for a tactic of trying to drive Trump insane. She said this to reporters last week:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eNancy Pelosi: \u003c/b\u003eWe do believe that it’s important to follow the facts. We believe that no one is above the law, including the President of the United States, and we believe that the President of the United States is engaged in a cover-up, in a cover-up. And that was the nature of the meeting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eJS: \u003c/b\u003eTrump then staged his massive tantrum and put on a performance of calling off a meeting with congressional Democrats about infrastructure and marching out to the Rose Garden to denounce the Mueller investigation and Nancy Pelosi, in general.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eDJT: \u003c/b\u003eI just saw that Nancy Pelosi just before our meeting made a statement that we believe that the President of the United States is engaged in a cover-up. Well, it turns out, I’m the most — and I think most of you would agree to this — I’m the most transparent president probably in the history of this country.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eJS: \u003c/b\u003eTrump seems to be going nuts from the Democrats’ continuing probe into his possible obstruction of justice, corruption, abuse of power. And regarding Pelosi, the right-wing and Trump backers hit back. A doctored video featuring a slowed-down Nancy Pelosi went viral on social media. Rudy Giuliani and Trump himself shared that altered video. Trump also called Pelosi, “a mess” and Pelosi tweeted back, “When the ‘extremely stable genius’ starts acting more presidential, I’ll be happy to work with him on infrastructure, trade and other issues.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNancy Pelosi is, of course, the top Democrat in Congress. She is the House Speaker, third in line to the presidency. Despite Trump controlling the White House and the GOP with a firm grip on the Senate, Nancy Pelosi is incredibly powerful, and it’s important to understand who she is, how she rose to power, and what her endgame strategy with Trump might look like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo discuss this, and the current state of the Democratic Party, I’m joined by my colleague Ryan Grim, The Intercept’s DC bureau chief.

For people that don\u0026#8217;t know much about Nancy Pelosi — and you cover this in the book as you kind of trace the modern history of the Democratic party — what is the Nancy Pelosi story?

And so, she herself has a fascinating background. She was raised by a kind of mob-connected Congressman/Mayor of Baltimore. So, she learned, actual brass knuckles politics from a very early age then moved out west. And so, she has this like fighting, like actual fighting liberal sensibility that\u0026#8217;s quite rare. She turned out to have an extraordinary ability to raise money. And so while she was raising five children, she was also acting as a fundraiser for the party and kind of, working her way up through the party ranks in the 1970s and 1980s and she —\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eJS: \u003c/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003eShe wasn\u0026#8217;t in an elected position at that point?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eRG: \u003c/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003eRight, she actually ran for DNC chair at one point and barely lost to the guy who replaced Ted Kennedy in the Senate in a weird coincidence. But no she had not run for any elected office. She was a very much behind the scenes fundraiser/operative and she became very close with a guy named Phil Burton who was also known as a fighting liberal.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003eHe was a guy who, he died early. He died in 1983 but if he had lived, he would\u0026#8217;ve kind of changed the course of Democratic history. He was the kind of guy who was not only progressive but wanted to punch you in the face and also, was all about raising a ton of money and screwing Republicans. He basically invented gerrymandering in California and screwed Republicans out of a ton of districts there. Essentially, Pelosi is Burton\u0026#8217;s Lieutenant, kind of, an enforcer and a fundraiser back home. He dies in 1983. His wife takes over for him and serves four years. She then dies. On her deathbed, she endorses Nancy Pelosi to take her seat. So, now there\u0026#8217;s a special election in 1987. Her top opponent is the vice chair of the DSA, Democratic Socialists of America.

And so it\u0026#8217;s a real establishment versus insurgent race. Nancy Pelosi likes to say that she\u0026#8217;s from the Bay Area and so she understands the left. That\u0026#8217;s true in the sense that she beat the left to win her seat. It\u0026#8217;s not that she organized support among the left, but she barely won. If they were using the current top two system, I think she would have lost her first seat and there would be no Nancy Pelosi.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003eBut she wins in 1987. She joins Steny Hoyer who\u0026#8217;d been there for a while already and a class of Democrats who came in in the late 70s and 80s, just as the party was ending. And in 1980, not only did you have Ronald Reagan elected and have him re-elected in 1984, but in \u0026#8217;80, a whole slew of liberal lions who\u0026#8217;d been running for president just four years earlier, who\u0026#8217;d been serving five, six terms, famous people at the time like Birch Bayh, Frank Church all upset by these upstart, insurgent Republicans.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003eAnd so, you\u0026#8217;ve got this rise of the new right. Newt Gingrich elected in \u0026#8217;78 and then Reagan in \u0026#8217;80 and it teaches people like Pelosi that liberalism is going to cost them elections, that if they let the country know how progressive they are, then there\u0026#8217;s going to be a backlash. And they learned that lesson over and over throughout the \u0026#8217;80s as Reagan kept pounding them.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003eThey still controlled the House of Representatives, even though they lost the Senate and the White House. And so, what they did is say, \u0026#8220;We\u0026#8217;ve got the House, let\u0026#8217;s go to the banks. Let\u0026#8217;s go to corporate America and say look, we\u0026#8217;re not necessarily doing a lot for you, but we control the House. So, you\u0026#8217;ll pay up.\u0026#8221; And that was the way that they figured that they were going to be able to match Republicans.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eJS: \u003c/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003eWhen you say pay up, are you talking about campaign contributions?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eRG: \u003c/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003eRight, because prior to 1980, big money was not as much of a thing in politics, they had labor support. They had some corporate money and some wealthy donor money, but it wasn\u0026#8217;t anywhere near the scale that we have today. And so, they pivoted after 1980 to say — they diagnosed their 1980 problem as Republicans outspent us and outmaneuvered us. So, we need to match them dollar-for-dollar and to do that, we need to use our position in the House of Representatives and extract money from industry. That leads in an obvious direction. It reshaped the party and it ended up with the party of Bill Clinton and the party that we have today.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003eBut as you watch Nancy Pelosi trying to navigate Trump, all she\u0026#8217;s thinking about is the Reagan era. If she says that she\u0026#8217;s for impeachment, if she says she\u0026#8217;s for Medicare for all, if she says she\u0026#8217;s for a Green New Deal, that the country is going to recoil at their progressivism and they\u0026#8217;re going to be thrown out.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eJS: \u003c/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003eIs it entirely that or is it that Pelosi believes in the policies that she\u0026#8217;s worked for her entire career? That she isn\u0026#8217;t as progressive as somebody who says \u0026#8220;Oh, I\u0026#8217;m from San Francisco. I understand the left.\u0026#8221;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eRG: \u003c/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003eRight, I mean there is that because she was the right wing candidate in that primary so there absolutely is that. But at the same time, once you\u0026#8217;ve been acting out a certain way for 30 or 40 years, the question of what you actually believe becomes impossible to disentangle. It almost doesn\u0026#8217;t matter. She\u0026#8217;s been doing this since then and whether, what exists in the recesses of her heart, is immaterial really.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eJS: \u003c/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003eSo Pelosi gets elected in this special election that you\u0026#8217;re describing where her opponent was a Democratic Socialist of America and she barely wins that race. How does she then ascend within the party to any kind of a leadership position?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eRG: \u003c/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003eWell, she had the same abilities that her predecessor Phil Burton had, an incredible vote counter and a tremendous fundraiser. And so, because there was so much emphasis by \u0026#8217;87 on fundraising, she just raised an extraordinary amount of money and would distribute it to colleagues. And because she was also tactically proficient within the caucus, she was able to carve out a place for herself. By 2001, Dick Gephardt is washing out of his career finally and she ends up replacing him around that time to become minority leader. And so, she\u0026#8217;s minority leader in 2002, 2004. When they finally take over in 2006, she\u0026#8217;s well positioned and nobody can challenge her by then.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eJS: \u003c/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003eAnd she becomes the first elected speaker of the House that was a woman.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eRG: \u003c/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003eRight.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eJS: \u003c/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003eSo, as Pelosi and other Democrats are shifting the party in some ways toward big money, toward Wall Street and then Pelosi ends up in this position where she\u0026#8217;s minority leader and then ultimately becomes speaker of the House. When you talk about her ability to count votes — for the lay people among us, myself included — explain exactly what that means. Because you hear it now every day on cable that oh, Pelosi is this expert, she\u0026#8217;s great with the whip. She\u0026#8217;s good with the vote count. What does that mean just to ordinary folks?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eRG:\u003c/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003e And like I said her mentor had it too. And presumably her father, as well. But it means understanding exactly what the other person needs and is also afraid of. And so, it also means having a tactile feel for the district that somebody represents and understanding that a swing district in Iowa is not a swing district in Southern California, or it\u0026#8217;s not one in Central Pennsylvania. And just having that knowledge and that ability to listen to that other person and be transactional in what you can offer them, stick by those promises, deliver on them, and if somebody screws you to remember it.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003ePeople will tell stories like there\u0026#8217;ll be 40 freshmen in a meeting and she\u0026#8217;ll go around the room and will point to each one of them and say, \u0026#8220;You screwed me on that motion to recommit last Tuesday. I don\u0026#8217;t ever want to see it happen again. You hit me on April 3rd with this in committee.\u0026#8221; She knows if you voted the wrong way in a committee hearing.

You kind of saw that like inside Pelosi coming out with the cameras on her. But that\u0026#8217;s basically what it means — a willingness to destroy somebody and an ability to reward somebody and knowing what the reward is that that person wants and kind of an amorality about the whole thing, not getting hung up on whether what you\u0026#8217;re doing is right or wrong. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eJS:\u003c/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003e Talk about Pelosi during the Bush/Cheney era because Pelosi was the subject of a lot of protest and anger from the left for a number of reasons.

So, instead, they went with the electable Michael Dukakis. That then opens the way for these new Democrats, Bill Clinton. And Bill Clinton\u0026#8217;s famous Sister Souljah moment which this is summer of 1992 where he basically dredges up an obscure rapper. She hadn\u0026#8217;t ever been above I think 82 on Billboard. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eJS:\u003c/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003e She follows me on Twitter, Ryan, and has praised my Blackwater book. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eRG:\u003c/b\u003e [Laughs.]\u003cb\u003e \u003c/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003eShe\u0026#8217;s great now and she\u0026#8217;s an author and an interesting person.

And what\u0026#8217;s important is where he did it. This was at the Rainbow Coalition Conference with Jesse Jackson right there on stage. And so, I think that part has also been missed too that it was not just a signal to Reagan Democrats that he\u0026#8217;s like willing to take on these black people who were dominating the Democratic party. It was also a signal to Jesse Jackson and to the kind of, left in the Democratic party. \u0026#8220;This is my party now. I\u0026#8217;m doing this at your conference.\u0026#8221; Jackson demanded an apology from him and he never got it. And that was his way of saying \u0026#8220;This is my party now.\u0026#8221; People also forget Clinton won with 43 percent of the vote because Ross Perot was in as a third party candidate. So, it\u0026#8217;s not like this new Democratic centrism was some resounding success.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003eAnd that more than anything else has become a rallying cry for today\u0026#8217;s left, that says \u0026#8220;Look, if you actually won with this pragmatism, what you call pragmatism, then OK. Then we can have a conversation. If this centrism, if this compromising approach was actually keeping the fascists out of the gates, keeping the barbarians from raping and pillaging the village, then OK, that\u0026#8217;s a plausible argument to make but it\u0026#8217;s not. You got 43 percent with Bill Clinton. You lost to Bush. The one time you took a chance and nominated the unelectable person, Barack Obama, he wins twice. He then pivots to center and loses a thousand seats and we end up with Trump. So the pragmatism isn\u0026#8217;t very pragmatic. And so, the new generation which did not experience the trauma of losing to Newt Gingrich and Ronald Reagan doesn\u0026#8217;t have the fear of the Republican party that the Pelosi\u0026#8217;s of the world have.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eJS:\u003c/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003e Right, Clinton wins in the \u0026#8217;92 election and then as you indicate in the midterms then there\u0026#8217;s this sweeping so-called Republican revolution that brings Newt Gingrich to the position of being speaker of the House and at the same time you had Bill Clinton and the Democrats adopting very right-wing policies on drugs, on crime you can, I think, argue on race, on all of these things and very hawkish militaristic policies. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003eBut I want to zero in on the Crime Bill and the so-called war on drugs under Bill Clinton because it comes up quite often now because of Joe Biden being a sponsor of the Crime Bill. And then Kamala Harris, really bringing this up a lot and trying to reform her own image because people will say \u0026#8220;Oh, Kamala Harris is a cop.\u0026#8221; She\u0026#8217;s now trying to attack Biden from the left on the Crime Bill while pushing aside the concerns about her own role in the criminal justice system in this country. But for people that don\u0026#8217;t have a living memory of it or weren\u0026#8217;t around then, explain Clinton\u0026#8217;s Crime Bill, race policies, war on drugs.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eRG:\u003c/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003e Right, crime was an actual problem. It was a problem all across the country and partly or significantly because of the hollowing out of the manufacturing industry and the middle class and working classes that Reagan and the deregulating Democrats brought about in the \u0026#8217;80s. So, you do have a bottoming out and you do have a surge in crime and so a response to that, also a response to the Civil Rights Movement, is just getting tougher and tougher and tougher. And there was no political lever to push in the other direction and so, in both primaries, Democratic and Republican, the candidate who could say that they were tougher on crime was the one who was going to win and so it just keeps getting ratcheted up and up and up. Bill Clinton famously calls for a hundred thousand new cops on the street and gets a standing ovation for that.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003eAnd that\u0026#8217;s a cornerstone of the \u0026#8217;94 Crime Bill. The idea is to just jack up sentences, mandatory minimums, three strikes and you\u0026#8217;re out. Lumping together a bunch of different things so, if you sell weed but you also own a gun, then that becomes a violent crime. The sentence is exponentially greater. So, you wind up then throughout the \u0026#8217;90s with crime rates falling yet the prison population soaring. So, you\u0026#8217;re like wait a minute, how are there fewer crimes being committed but yet more and more and more people are in prison? And one of the answers that people are in prison for these extremely long sentences. And so, starting in the early 1980s, you just have practically a straight diagonal line up and you go from fewer than half a million prisoners to well over two million.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eJS: \u003c/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003eAnd then, on the issue of welfare reform, I mean, I\u0026#8217;m originally from Wisconsin, at the time the Crime Bill was implemented, I was a student in Wisconsin and I remember Tommy Thompson was the governor at the time, a Republican and he had implemented sweeping so-called welfare reform that was essentially, when you boil it down to it, it was forcing people to choose between having a job where they can\u0026#8217;t make enough money to live or accepting state aid and then having to live your life essentially in a police state that is constantly monitoring every expense that you make. This whole notion that in order to get welfare, you have to work was a Tommy Thompson idea that then Bill Clinton more or less nationalized with his omnibus welfare reform package. That was, I mean, it was largely written by Republicans, but it was Bill Clinton who was championing it, shepherding it.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eRG: \u003c/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003eYeah. And welfare got racialized. Reagan helped very much help do that. When people talk about Democrats going to the center, that\u0026#8217;s a euphemism for them distancing themselves from black people and from the Civil Rights era. That\u0026#8217;s essentially what they\u0026#8217;re talking about. And this was a huge part of that. This was Clinton\u0026#8217;s way of saying \u0026#8220;Look, that promise that I made on the Rainbow Coalition stage when I called out Sister Souljah, I\u0026#8217;m delivering on that right now. I told you I would stick it to them.\u0026#8221; He was running for re-election and his advisors told him, you sign welfare reform and you\u0026#8217;re basically guaranteed to get re-election. Wendell Primus who was a top HHS official at the time resigned in protest over it. He\u0026#8217;s now one of Pelosi\u0026#8217;s top aides. And you had a couple others in the White House who resigned, who said this is going to increase poverty and increase child poverty. More or less, it has.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003eAnd it has an illogic that says if you\u0026#8217;ve received benefits for five years, that\u0026#8217;s it regardless of need. And like you said it puts all these draconian work requirements on it. Now welfare itself did need to be reformed because it had a gross kind of, police surveillance aspect to it to where you\u0026#8217;d have government agents like raiding your house to try to find out if there was a man living in the house who might be benefiting from this $500 a month that you\u0026#8217;re getting.

Obama launched his campaign and I think, he wanted to give the impression that he was the anti-war candidate, but in reality the speech that he gave in Chicago in October of 2002, which really launched his national political aspirations and campaign was a very carefully crafted speech with lots of ifs and thens in terms of the position. He famously said I\u0026#8217;m not against all wars, I\u0026#8217;m against dumb wars, stupid wars and essentially making a tactical argument against the Iraq War.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003eAnd I often think of that as kind of a metaphor for how Obama governed. He would telegraph one thing and sort of, there would be this perception people would place onto the canvas of Obama, what they wanted to think he was but in reality, he always if you really took his words at their value, was saying I\u0026#8217;m not a leftist and I actually am, would be a sort of, moderate Republican of the 90s. That was more or less how Obama, he wasn\u0026#8217;t lying or being disingenuous. He was telegraphing exactly who he was. The sense I had was that people wanted to place onto him an identity that Obama himself never even claimed but he did craft his identity — I mean political identity — in such a way that a lot of things were open to interpretation. It was like the sophisticated smart version of Trump saying we\u0026#8217;ll see what happens. Obama would allow people to think he was this thing but in reality, he was a pretty right-wing Democrat.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eRG: \u003c/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003eRight.

He must be. He\u0026#8217;s a great writer. He went to Harvard. He was a community organizer. I think that was a huge selling point to a lot of people. He must be a lefty.

And so, then you wind up with this massive, inspired grassroots army of millions of people ready to transform politics. And he could have brought that army with him into Washington with the sky falling, Wall Street completely collapsing, the economy on the brink. People were talking about the end of the Republican party like what\u0026#8217;s going to be the new party that takes its place? It was that low of a moment for them and they signaled right away before he was even sworn in that they were going to oppose him on everything across the board and that was going to be their play.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003eAnd still, he shut down the grassroots army, basically folded up what was called OFA, Organizing for America, put it onto the DNC and mothballed the thing. And ordered all the outside groups under threat of them getting their donors called by Rahm Emanuel or Jim Messina to also stop pressuring Republicans and stop pressuring Blue Dogs because he\u0026#8217;s got this. He and Rahm are going to like work it out. They\u0026#8217;re gonna sit down with Susan Collins. They\u0026#8217;re going to figure this thing out. And if you push, it\u0026#8217;s only going to cause problems for the Blue Dogs in the midterms. So, just let us handle this.

All of the women in the Senate except for Warren signed a letter saying \u0026#8220;Run, Hillary, run and don\u0026#8217;t anybody else run against her.\u0026#8221; And Sanders didn\u0026#8217;t want to run like he was trying to get Warren to run. He was hoping somebody else would run just so that there could be some competing ideas put out in the primary. So, when nobody would and he eventually was like \u0026#8220;Ok, fine I\u0026#8217;ll do this. Somebody\u0026#8217;s got to make the argument.\u0026#8221; But he was very clear from the beginning, he was not trying to win out of the gate. That was sort of an accident, that Clinton was so unpopular, and his ideas were so popular that he almost got to her. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003eProbably the most damaging thing that came out of there were the Goldman Sachs speeches, speech transcripts. And I didn\u0026#8217;t think it would seriously work but I had reached out to the campaign at some point in 2015, I think it was Karen Finney. I said, look, these speeches are going to come out at some point, leak them to me. I\u0026#8217;ll do the story right now and I\u0026#8217;ll light you guys up because I\u0026#8217;m sure it\u0026#8217;s ridiculous whatever she said to Goldman Sachs. It\u0026#8217;s gonna come out like get it out, get it out now and give it to me.

Now it\u0026#8217;s close to the election and you have the fact of the private speeches married with the years-long effort to keep them private which just imbues them with suspicion which is warranted. And then she comes out and says, I think in a debate, \u0026#8220;Look, you say some things privately and you say different things publicly. That\u0026#8217;s how this works.\u0026#8221; Like oh, I can\u0026#8217;t believe you just said that. Well yeah, we were aware that that\u0026#8217;s how you operate.

There was already the impression that she was too close to Wall Street and to wealthy interests. And then that just underlined it for everybody. It was something that you could just understand in one sentence. $700,000, speaking to Goldman Sachs.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eJS:\u003c/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003e Coming out of the 2016 election — I mean, this may be an oversimplification. You can put whatever nuance you want in this but it does seem like there is a very clear split in the Democratic Party right now where on the one hand, you have the Hillary Clinton wing of the Democratic Party and then on the other hand, you have I mean, you could say the Bernie Sanders wing but really it\u0026#8217;s more of a left front that is, sort of, arguing against the Pelosi/Clinton/Obama worldview and trying to do things differently. You have what is it now? Twenty-four people running for the Democratic nomination? Give a kind of overview in the context of the 2020 election of where the Democratic party is today and what are the dynamics within it?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eRG:\u003c/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003e Right, it\u0026#8217;s sort of the wing that was represented by Jesse Jackson and then was vanquished throughout much of the 90s and it kind of rises again sort of accidentally through Howard Dean. Howard Dean was not that progressive of a candidate but again, he kind of appeared like it next to everybody else. He was the only candidate who was running on opposition to the Iraq War and because he was from Vermont, people felt like \u0026#8220;Oh well, he must be pretty liberal.\u0026#8221; And he\u0026#8217;s a doctor who talked about universal health care. So, it was check, check, check for a lot of progressives. And so, the blogosphere was just getting going then. Move On was just getting the ability to raise big amounts of money online. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003eAnd so, all of a sudden he has a well-funded and organized campaign which falls apart at the very end. Everybody talks about his scream. But actually, if you remember this the thing that undid him was he said something like he didn\u0026#8217;t want Saddam Hussein executed. I think there was some comment around Saddam Hussein and the entire Democratic primary electorate was like oh, he\u0026#8217;s going to get beat by Bush. Bush is too tough. We\u0026#8217;re gonna be too weak and they went into their shells and they\u0026#8217;re like \u0026#8220;Let\u0026#8217;s do John Kerry.\u0026#8221; They can\u0026#8217;t question his military credentials. But all of the learning and organizing that had gone on around the Dean campaign then fueled other campaigns in 2006 and then also the Obama campaign and it flows into Occupy. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eJS:\u003c/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003e Just one note before you go on with that, one just bookend on Howard Dean. He then goes on to be head of the Democratic National Committee and has just steadily moved himself even further and further and further to the right. He\u0026#8217;s taken money from the MEK group that\u0026#8217;s agitating for regime change in Iran and had been for many years an officially designated terror organization by the State Department. And Howard Dean helped lobby against that and he\u0026#8217;s now just basically a right-wing Democrat attack dog going after anyone on the left of the Democratic party. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eRG: \u003c/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003eHe\u0026#8217;s a gun for hire. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eJS: \u003c/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003eYeah, he\u0026#8217;s a gun for hire.

I mean, I remember covering him in New Hampshire and elsewhere and it was the same thing you saw with Obama that people were projecting onto Howard Dean everything that they want in a candidate and it\u0026#8217;s like the evidence isn\u0026#8217;t really there. I mean Howard Dean had promoted the idea that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. When I asked him about that at an event in New Hampshire, he said well I said that because somebody in the Clinton team had told me that. Oh well, that really gives you confidence that this is a guy who\u0026#8217;s gonna be sifting and winnowing through the intelligence. But in any case, so then we get to 2016. Trump wins the Electoral College defeating Hillary Clinton and you were about to talk more about the big picture of the Democratic Party as it exists today. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eRG:\u003c/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003e Yeah, and what Dean and then to a degree Obama and then Bernie Sanders did is that they created an alternative kind of funding structure. Obama did both. He had a huge small dollar operation and also tons of money from Wall Street and other places. But Obama showed that you could raise an extraordinary amount of money online for a presidential campaign, which was the kind of the promise of the Dean campaign back in \u0026#8217;03. And then Bernie Sanders kind of actualized that and then you see what\u0026#8217;s happened in 2020 with the DNC even leaning into it saying everybody needs to have 65,000 small donors to get on the stage.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003eWhen we were kids, every quarter, the candidates would brag about how much money they had raised, who their bundlers were, the names of the lobbyists that were bundling money for them and that was a mark of seriousness.

But like the idea that that 35 percent, most of whom are barely paying attention to the election, were going to change their mind within a week of him officially announcing, of that 35 percent, what percent do you think even know that he transitioned from saying he was thinking about running to actually running?

Well no, that wasn\u0026#8217;t, that shouldn\u0026#8217;t be the expectation to begin with. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003eThe thing that she\u0026#8217;s also lacking is kind of a why. Like why is she running for president? What\u0026#8217;s her vision for the country? Because she doesn\u0026#8217;t have the obvious — and this is racist also — she doesn\u0026#8217;t have the \u0026#8220;I\u0026#8217;m electable and I can beat Trump.\u0026#8221; Because in this country electable and I can beat Trump means I\u0026#8217;m a white guy. So, she doesn\u0026#8217;t have that. And she also doesn\u0026#8217;t have a Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders style, this is my vision for how the country should be governed and transformed. So, you\u0026#8217;re left with a well, what? What what\u0026#8217;s going on here? \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003eAnd so, when you\u0026#8217;re talked about as a top tier candidate but you continue to hover under 10 percent that chips away at your sheen of kind of, inevitability or electability. She certainly, she gets talked about all the time as vice president for if it\u0026#8217;s Joe Biden or something like that. And she has, I\u0026#8217;m sure, a big career ahead of her. But what exactly the path is, remains unclear. You\u0026#8217;d have to have Biden collapse and her to kind of take over the Biden lane for the Hillary Clinton type aides.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eJS:\u003c/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003e I mean, all politics is performance at some level but I do think that both Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris are remarkably good lawmakers when it comes to interrogating hostile witnesses. And obviously, Kamala Harris spent a lot of time in law enforcement and as a prosecutor and I personally think it would be utterly fascinating to watch Kamala Harris debate Donald Trump and to see how she would meticulously prepare for that. It\u0026#8217;s like in many movies, the prosecutors are the good guys —\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eRG: \u003c/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003eIt would be interesting if she would say, \u0026#8220;there are a lot of people out there that need to be prosecuted. And I have the skills to prosecute those people. We have been letting elites get away with criminal behavior for far too long\u0026#8221; and try to use it that way. But she does the same thing with Biden where she says she was a progressive prosecutor which isn\u0026#8217;t true. She ran against progressive prosecutors. She was stridently a tough on crime prosecutor. And so rather than kind of owning up to that and saying I was wrong. Times have changed because I don\u0026#8217;t believe she does believe she\u0026#8217;s wrong which is, that\u0026#8217;s totally her right.

And as a result of that he discarded the tactics that he had used in his Senate campaign, discarded the actual Bernie people who had organized his Texas Senate campaign and replaced them with Obama people. The very ones who had actively shut down OFA like the officials who were overseeing that project of shutting down his grassroots army. They shut down Beto\u0026#8217;s grassroots army believing that Biden wasn\u0026#8217;t really serious and that the kind of Obama world of establishment figures would wind up getting behind Beto and he\u0026#8217;d be lifted to victory because nobody else was a kind of, they could conceivably see as winning the nomination. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003eAnd so he stopped fighting for it. And like you said, he drifted away from Medicare for all. He abandoned his kind of organizing approach that he\u0026#8217;d been taking. And it turned out that he was not in the position that he thought he was in.

And our colleague Glenn Greenwald recently did a long sit down interview with her where he brought up some of these critiques but the way that she is handled when she goes on major TV networks primarily on CNN, it\u0026#8217;s extremely hostile and the way that she\u0026#8217;s interviewed seems intent on defending the good name of imperial America. And that\u0026#8217;s how it\u0026#8217;s presented. But what\u0026#8217;s going on with that campaign?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eRG:\u003c/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003e She\u0026#8217;s badly undermined by Sanders\u0026#8217; presence in the campaign. She rose to national prominence at the end of the campaign by quitting the DNC and endorsing Bernie which, might not be proper to point out, happened long after the campaign was over. If you date the kind of, end of the Sanders campaign in April or May or so, it\u0026#8217;s nice that Tulsi went public with her dissatisfaction with how the DNC handled that and endorsed Bernie, but it didn\u0026#8217;t do him any good at that point. It did her an enormous amount of good and all of the Sanders goodwill kind of drifted over to her. If he hadn\u0026#8217;t run, she\u0026#8217;d have a core of supporters that would be out organizing for her. But her reason to be in is less clear with him in because they agree on — I mean, she certainly makes a bigger deal out of anti-imperialism than he does but they agree on that issue. So, at that point like well, what are you bringing to the campaign that Sanders isn\u0026#8217;t since Sanders is kind of the one that brought you to the campaign in the first place?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eJS: \u003c/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003eWell, I mean she would probably say that she was a combat veteran, that she\u0026#8217;s a woman, that she represents a much younger generation in politics.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eRG:\u003c/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003e She has far more right to run — well, everyone has a right to run — she has just far more reason to run than at least a dozen of these dudes for the reasons that you mentioned but her lane was always going to be on the progressive side and with Bernie and Warren taking it all up, it\u0026#8217;s just really hard to see.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eJS:\u003c/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003e What about what\u0026#8217;s going on now with the Bernie Sanders campaign? It\u0026#8217;s not a case at this point certainly, that he\u0026#8217;s just running away with it and that there is any inevitability to it in part because of Biden being in the race. But I see it more as you have Sanders and Warren and then a handful of other people that are sort of to the left of the Pelosi Democratic Party and then, you have the massive Clinton/Pelosi machine that will produce somebody and that they believe that that person is going to have the nomination and we don\u0026#8217;t know who that is at this point. It looks like Biden is the anointed one but who knows what happens but what\u0026#8217;s going on with Bernie Sanders given that there\u0026#8217;s a field of 24 people? There is Elizabeth Warren. There is Tulsi Gabbard. Is it operating the way it did in 2016? Is he running a successful fundraising operation? Is he going up in the polls?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eRG:\u003c/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003e I think he\u0026#8217;s running a much better campaign in 2020 just functionally, operationally than he was in 2016. It\u0026#8217;s a much more professional campaign and it\u0026#8217;s much more bottom-up, organizer-driven whereas in 2016, for all of its revolutionary talk, it was fairly traditional in the sense that they were raising money — now, not the traditional way — but they were raising money to fund a field program and go up on TV in early states. Like that was, now, their message was different but the strategy was the same. Right now, they\u0026#8217;re running a very distributed campaign where they\u0026#8217;re trying to empower their organizers all over the country to organize in places where they don\u0026#8217;t have paid field staff. They\u0026#8217;re raising money at an even faster clip than they did in 2016. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003eHe is ticking up in the polls but the psyche of the Democratic primary voter plays into this in a disturbing way in the sense that they just can\u0026#8217;t, a lot of voters can\u0026#8217;t convince themselves that a Democratic socialist is \u0026#8220;electable.\u0026#8221; And so, his 40 plus percent that he got in 2016 relied on some protest vote against Clinton. He was the alternative. O\u0026#8217;Malley was just not doing it as the alternative. And some protests against the system and some who were voting for him because they thought he could win and would be president. But by no means was that 100 percent of his base and so the ones that weren\u0026#8217;t in that base are now out shopping around for other candidates. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003eIf he can pull off a win in Iowa — that\u0026#8217;s the thing about being unelectable. If you show yourself to be electable, it changes everything. Barack Obama\u0026#8217;s numbers among black voters before Iowa were in the single digits because they quite reasonably said this country\u0026#8217;s not going to elect Barack Obama so I\u0026#8217;m not going to waste my vote on somebody that they\u0026#8217;re not going to elect. When Obama won Iowa, overnight in the black community, his numbers went from single digits to well into the majority and within weeks, he\u0026#8217;d sewed up the black vote. When it became clear actually, these corn-fed kids out in Iowa voted for this guy, he could actually win. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003eSo, if Sanders can win in Iowa and then can win in New Hampshire, the aura of winning can create the impression of electability and the aura of losing — let\u0026#8217;s say Biden loses those — it damages the impression of his own electability and so, that really is the only way that I see something like that turning around. Maybe you have a Warren and Ocasio-Cortez getting in behind him at a key moment around that time and creating kind of, a new sense of inevitability around a Sanders presidency. But it\u0026#8217;s really threading a needle but he would have to do something about that impression that he can\u0026#8217;t win.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eJS: \u003c/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003eBut the open hostility toward Bernie Sanders that continues or even is increasing in some quarters of the Democratic party is real.

And so, whatever Nicole Wallace wants to do, she can do. But the question of can Bernie win those three key states is what decides whether or not he can beat Trump. And if you talk to Republicans, interestingly, Republicans who know those states well, they believe that Bernie is a major threat in a state like, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin because not only does he galvanize the Democratic base support, but he does appeal to the kind of angry independents who just want to cast a screw you vote. They can just as happily cast it for Bernie Sanders as they can for Trump.

Tem ideias velhas, trabalha pouco e viaja muito.

Na primeira viagem, o ex-juiz aproveitou o tempo para protagonizar um bate-boca via imprensa com José Sócrates, ex- primeiro-ministro português. Moro usou a palestra para se meter na vida política lusitana. Afirmou ter identificado uma \u0026#8220;dificuldade institucional\u0026#8221; no país em fazer avançar o processo contra Sócrates, \u003ca href=\"https://brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2017/10/11/internacional/1507717284_121102.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003edenunciado pelo MP de Portugal\u003c/a\u003e por corrupção, lavagem de dinheiro, falsificação de documentos e fraude fiscal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEm nota, Sócrates, que é um político de esquerda, chamou Moro de \u0026#8220;ativista político atua disfarçado de juiz\u0026#8221;. Moro respondeu que não debateria com um \u0026#8220;criminoso\u0026#8221;. Ou seja, um representante do governo brasileiro acusou sem provas, em solo português, um ex-primeiro-ministro que ainda não foi nem julgado. É uma agressão à presunção de inocência tipo exportação. Do que mais o nosso Torquemada é capaz? Alguma dúvida de que Moro estaria bajulando Sócrates se ele fosse de extrema-direita? Aqui no Brasil ele jamais se constrangeu ao passar panos para caixa 2, laranjas e milícias do seu grupo político.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eO que a ida a Portugal trouxe de concreto para o Brasil? Absolutamente nada. Serviu para o ministro incrementar seu currículo de palestrante, vender sua imagem de herói e ignorar a presunção de inocência de um político de esquerda. Esse vergonhoso arranca-rabo com o ex-primeiro-ministro português mostra que Moro não cumpriu um papel institucional nessa viagem, mas um papel político do mais baixo nível.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuais foram as ações práticas de relevância do ministro até agora?

Como se vê, transparência não é o forte do nosso herói.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA gestão de Moro se resume ao projeto anticrime, à autorização do uso da Força Nacional para atuar em protestos e à compra de mais armas.

Não faz o menor sentido. O órgão é obrigado a reportar todas as movimentações financeiras suspeitas às autoridades competentes, como a Polícia Federal, que está sob a guarda do ministério da Justiça. A não ser que Moro queira ficar monitorando as transações financeiras dos cidadãos em tempo real, não há motivo para querer ter o Coaf no seu ministério.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTodos os sinais indicam que o ex-juiz está usando o cargo como trampolim para novos voos políticos.

Quando aceitou o ministério da Justiça, disse que estava assumindo \u0026#8220;um cargo técnico, não político\u0026#8221;. Assim, Moro encarnou a estratégia de maior sucesso eleitoral dos nossos tempos: o político que não faz política.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAté no Twitter ele entrou agora para fazer o marketing da sua gestão. Não que seja um problema, mas o tom adotado nas redes sociais é muito mais político do que técnico e institucional, o que não combina com o perfil técnico que ele sempre vendeu. Combina mais com um político que quer ser presidente da República.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMuitos cogitaram que Sergio Moro seria um freio democrático para os impulsos autoritários de Bolsonaro. Parecia que o ex-juiz corajoso e honesto estava fazendo um favor ao Bolsonaro ao participar do seu governo. Até hoje, parte da grande imprensa crítica ao bolsonarismo ainda o coloca num pedestal, como se fosse um quadro técnico de respeito, um iluminado perdido entre tantas Damares e Weintraubs. Mas não.

The sound. It reminded me of what it was like. And I guess I had never thought about it since I came home. I made it my business not to think about it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander was arrested in 1994 for his role as a lookout in an armed robbery that killed a store owner in Memphis, Tennessee. He pleaded guilty and was released from prison after 10 years, becoming an advocate for kids living in the kinds of traumatic circumstances in which he’d grown up. In Nashville, where he lives now, Alexander mentored students in city schools, then became a program developer for the YMCA, organizing wilderness retreats in the summer. Today he’s a legislative advocate for the Washington, D.C.-based \u003ca href=\"https://www.fairsentencingofyouth.org/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCampaign for the Fair Sentencing of Youth\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was through the campaign that Alexander found himself at Angola on the morning of April 11. The massive complex recalled the Tennessee penitentiary where he was once incarcerated. At that time, he said, “everyone knew full well if you were black and young, you were going to serve your time in West Tennessee, whereas if you were white and young, you would be sent to a prison in East Tennessee, where there were services around computer literacy and other things.” As at Angola, a former slave plantation named after the homeland of those once forced to work there, men at the prison harvested crops on the grounds. “The only reason I escaped fieldwork was because I became a licensed barber,” Alexander said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had not been back inside a prison since his release. And while he was unnerved by his own visceral reaction to Angola, he was glad to be there. It was an important day: 72-year-old Henry Montgomery was up for parole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMontgomery was the same age as Alexander had been, 17, when he was arrested for shooting a white police officer in East Baton Rouge. Montgomery’s crime took place decades before, however, in 1963 — and he was sentenced to life without parole. But more than 50 years later, Montgomery would open a path for freedom to thousands of people like himself, doomed to die in prison for crimes they committed as kids. In 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court decided a landmark case, \u003ca href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/10-9646g2i8.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMiller v. Alabama\u003c/a\u003e, which declared that such sentences, when imposed mandatorily, were unconstitutional for juvenile defendants. The ruling was based on research showing that children’s brains are not as fully developed as those of adults, making them less culpable for their actions and more capable of change. As states responded to Miller, Louisiana fought back against applying the decision retroactively.

Louisiana, more than 500 people have been freed from prison who were once serving life without parole for crimes they committed as juveniles. Many more have been re-sentenced, among them Montgomery, who was given a parole-eligible life sentence in 2017. Of the more than 50 people released from Louisiana, several were at Angola for the hearing that day. “Some of them were gray-haired and leaning on canes,” recalled Jody Kent Lavy, executive director of the Campaign for the Fair Sentencing of Youth, who attended the hearing with Alexander. “Some of them were younger. But everybody knew Mr. Montgomery.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMontgomery had gone before the parole board once before, in February 2018. He was \u003ca href=\"https://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/courts/article_acca953e-1579-11e8-aa66-1b036f45b902.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003erejected\u003c/a\u003e by a vote of 2-1. The rationale was that he had not participated in enough programs over his five decades in prison. Though Montgomery was supposed to wait two years for another chance, his lawyer successfully sought a rehearing, much to the dismay of his victim’s relatives, who had testified against him and were prepared to do so again. Nonetheless, Alexander felt optimistic. “I was excited for Mr. Montgomery. I was thinking, How could they not grant him parole after the U.S. Supreme Court had passed a mandate in his name? … But it turned out to be the total opposite.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class='stylized pull-right'data-shortcode-type='pullquote' data-pull='right'\u003e“I was excited for Mr. Montgomery. I was thinking, How could they not grant him parole after the U.S. Supreme Court had passed a mandate in his name?”\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnlike Alexander’s final parole hearing years ago, Montgomery went before the parole board remotely, via a TV monitor linked to its Baton Rouge office. Looking back at him on the screen was the presiding member, Brennan Kelsey, joined by two others. Kelsey, a physical therapist from Amite, Louisiana, had no background in criminal justice when he was appointed to the parole board. But he was a longtime friend of Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards, who hailed from the same town. The first-term Democrat won a surprise victory in the fall of 2015. “It’s hard to pin it, but there was something more about John that he had that you knew he was kind of destined for something really big,” Kelsey \u003ca href=\"https://www.fox8live.com/story/30940275/citing-his-integrity-family-and-friends-say-edwards-will-be-good-for-la/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003etold\u003c/a\u003e a local Fox station in January 2016. Less than two weeks later, Edwards appointed Kelsey to the parole board.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mr. Montgomery, you said you’ve been incarcerated for how long?” Kelsey asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFifty-five years, Montgomery said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fifty-five years,” Kelsey repeated. “Your last write-ups were in 2013 and 2014, is that correct?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, Montgomery answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, Montgomery had collected only 23 write-ups total during his time at Angola — a remarkable record for a near-lifetime spent behind bars. But Kelsey didn’t acknowledge this. “Tell me about the write-ups in 2013 and 2014,” he pressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMontgomery struggled to reply. As his lawyers showed at trial, he has quite a low IQ and a hard time expressing himself. At his 2018 hearing, his lawyer had been forced to help him along — “he’s very, very nervous this morning,” Baton Rouge attorney Keith Nordyke had explained — but there was an additional problem: Montgomery couldn’t hear. “It looks like I’ll need you to translate, Mr. Nordyke, because Mr. Montgomery is more hard of hearing than I am,” one of Kelsey’s colleagues joked. Prison staff adjusted the volume of Montgomery’s hearing aid — a box hanging from his neck that resembled a “repurposed cassette-tape player,” as one reporter \u003ca href=\"https://jjie.org/2019/04/13/inmate-from-supreme-court-case-rejected-for-parole-a-second-time/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003edescribed\u003c/a\u003e it. Nevertheless, Nordyke had to loudly repeat most of the questions for his client.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMontgomery spoke haltingly, often mumbling and trailing off. But he clearly named the first write-up from 2013: “smoking in an unauthorized area.” A deputy warden offered the second — “clothes left on his locker box,” he said. But he made clear that Montgomery was no troublemaker. “He’s not a problem to us at all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome 20 minutes into the hearing, Andrew Hundley stood to speak. In his 30s, Hundley was the first “juvenile lifer” freed under Miller and Montgomery, released in June 2016. Now he’s the executive director of the New Orleans-based \u003ca href=\"https://www.paroleproject.org/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLouisiana Parole Project\u003c/a\u003e, which has helped all the state’s returning juvenile lifers find housing, employment, and support. Hundley hoped to do the same for Montgomery, reiterating what the board was told in 2018: Montgomery had a bed waiting for him at The Refinery, a faith-based mission in Opelousas, Louisiana, whose director was watching in Baton Rouge that day. “I hope this board gives Henry the same opportunity that multiple individuals have been able to take advantage of and be successful since the U.S. Supreme Court decision that bears his name.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree people came to oppose Montgomery’s release that day. Two were relatives of Charles Hurt, the deputy officer shot by Montgomery. By all accounts, Hurt was well-loved in the community; on the day he died, he was on patrol looking for truants and encountered Montgomery skipping school. Hurt’s daughter, Linda, was angry to be returning to testify so soon after she last spoke before the board. “You have no idea how this affects me,” she said. “How it has affected me since I was 6 years old.” Although she said she had forgiven Montgomery, she did not think he should be released.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class='stylized pull-left'data-shortcode-type='pullquote' data-pull='left'\u003eThe audio from the parole hearing stops immediately after Kelsey makes his announcement.

But the decision had to be unanimous. “Unfortunately, Mr. Montgomery, I’m gonna have to vote to deny you parole,” Kelsey said. He repeated what the previous parole members had said in 2018: Montgomery had not participated in enough programs. “I think that’s a lack of maturity,” he said. “It’s your responsibility to continue to work hard on the inside. … Take as many programs as you can. Continue to work hard. But that’s my vote for today.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe audio from the parole hearing stops immediately after Kelsey makes his announcement. It does not capture Montgomery’s confusion; his inability to hear exactly what Kelsey had said. “It obviously didn’t register with him what had happened,” Lavy said. “His lawyer turned to him and said, ‘Henry, you’ve been denied.’ And he just looked stunned. As we all did. Much of the room was in tears.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander had still not fully processed the hearing when we met in Nashville last month. It was not only the cruelty of telling an elderly man with cognitive challenges that he just needed to work harder to ever leave prison that left Alexander struggling for words. “I saw a lot of myself in him,” Alexander said. He was struck by Montgomery’s difficulty expressing himself, which reminded him of his own early inability to articulate the childhood trauma that had contributed to his crime. For years Alexander had craved the kind of outpouring of love and support shown to Montgomery that day. He wanted him to “finally get to see people around him hug him and cheer for him. I long for that for him because that’s something that I longed for myself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-bleed large-bleed width-auto' style='width: auto;'\u003e\n\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-252088\" src=\"https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/05/GettyImages-894670616-angola-louisiana-state-penitentiary-1559080204.jpg\" alt=\"ANGOLA PRISON, LOUISIANA - OCTOBER 14, 2013:   The entrance of Angola Prison, Louisiana.

No one has argued he poses a threat to society. Nor is there is any tangible benefit to keeping him behind bars, beyond a lingering need for retribution. Meanwhile the costs of keeping him incarcerated are clear. Montgomery is one of scores of elderly men at Angola, where the vast majority will die on the grounds. The Angolite, a prisoner-run magazine, prints regular death notices, a hospice provides end-of-life care, and multiple cemeteries provide an ever-expanding burial ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShould Montgomery live to see his next parole date, it is hard to imagine he will have a better shot at release. After the hearing ended, Nordyke asked the warden what other programs Montgomery might take. “The warden said, ‘Oh, there may be some substance abuse class he hasn’t taken,’” Lavy said. “He doesn’t have a substance abuse problem.” To Lavy, the truth of the matter comes down to a story that is as old as the U.S. criminal justice system. “It’s a white police officer. He is a black teenager. It’s 1963, just months before the ‘I Have a Dream’ speech.” In fact, as she points out, Montgomery was originally sentenced to die, but the sentence was overturned after the Louisiana Supreme Court found that a racist atmosphere — and the presence of the Ku Klux Klan — had infected the trial. “That’s the context in which the crime took place. There is no discussion of that. But in thinking about this outcome, you can’t ignore that history. You can’t ignore the power dynamics at play.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class='stylized pull-right'data-shortcode-type='pullquote' data-pull='right'\u003eThe racist myth of the “teenage superpredator” convinced U.S. lawmakers and courts that kids should serve “adult time for adult crimes.”\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIndeed, Montgomery’s case is not only inextricable from Louisiana’s racist past, it is emblematic of how so many other U.S. children came to be sentenced to die in prison in the years that followed. Newspapers seized on Montgomery’s nickname, “Wolf Man” (originally a reference to his oversized incisors), while the district attorney dismissed his developmental limitations. “He may have the mind of a 3-year-old, but he has the cunning of a wolf,” he said. Decades later, the racist myth of the “teenage superpredator” convinced U.S. lawmakers and courts that kids should serve “adult time for adult crimes,” fueling a wave of reforms to toughen juvenile sentencing. Among the vocal proponents of such policies were Democratic politicians like Joe Biden, who in a 1993 \u003ca href=\"https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2019/03/05/joe-biden-tough-on-crime-speech.cnn\" target=\"_blank\"\u003espeech\u003c/a\u003e issued dire warnings about the menacing “cadre of young people, tens of thousands of them, born out of wedlock, without parents, without supervision, without any structure, without any conscience.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was amid this dehumanizing rhetoric that the Clinton administration passed its now infamous 1994 crime bill. Among its major impacts was banning Pell Grants that once allowed for college education in prisons — a devastating assault on the rehabilitative goals incarcerated people were expected to pursue. “Prison guards came around and confiscated everything,” Alexander recalled. “They would actually say things like, ‘Oh, you think you’re better than everybody else,’ and throw my papers in the garbage. Sometimes throw them in the toilet.” At the time, Alexander says, “it made me doubt whether or not I would be able to transition back into society, because in my mind education was the only way that I could take away the stain of incarceration.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday there is some political support for \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/02/18/pell-grants-for-prisoners-education-behind-bars/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003erestoring\u003c/a\u003e Pell Grants to people in prison — and the crime bill has become a perennial subject of critique.

It pointed out that on the same day Montgomery was denied parole at Angola, the board voted to free a juvenile lifer “who had served a similar amount of time, had a less stellar prison record, and was convicted of killing a black woman.” While Lavy supported that vote, she wrote, “it’s hard to shake the idea that the differing outcomes in these cases is a reflection of the value we as a society place on white versus black lives.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelsey, the board member who denied Montgomery parole, did not respond to phone calls asking him to discuss his vote.

He urged the board to consider the context in which Montgomery spent his first decades at Angola. These were years when it was notorious as “the bloodiest prison in America,” he explained. The men inside were not focused on what little programs the prison had to offer. “They were concerned about basic survival.” Besides, it was simply not true that Montgomery had been lax in his efforts to get involved in activities at the prison. In the 1970s, a time when lifers were not even eligible for educational programming, Montgomery founded the Angola Amateur Boxing Association, which still \u003ca href=\"https://prisonphotography.org/2011/08/10/exclusive-photos-of-the-angola-amateur-boxing-association-louisiana-state-penitentiary/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eexists\u003c/a\u003e today. “We all learned the discipline, not only for self-protection, but to deal with the environment,” Henderson said.

Matthew’s catastrophic flooding, which displaced an estimated 1,500 residents, was the result of a gap in the city’s levee system. A pathway for the Lumber River’s floodwaters remained wide open where the CSX railroad passes under Interstate 95. State officials recommended the construction of a floodgate after Matthew, otherwise hundreds of homes and businesses could flood again.

He’d learned his lesson. “At least in my world, most people give up and do it themselves, or they leave.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany have left.

If someone can’t work for a couple weeks, that can mean their lights go out and they don’t have grocery money for their kids.

Lumberton, North Carolina is the seat of one of the poorest counties in the nation. In 2016, it was catastrophically flooded due to Hurricane Matthew creating a first crop of people who fled their homes permanently, and left hundreds who were hanging on by a thread financially and physically as they prayed for FEMA aid and other donations to help them rebuild and suffered from systemic neglect. Just as the community finally began to recover, hurricane Florence hit, causing flooding in many of the exact same places and beyond. Now in the areas hardest hit by the flooding families are struggling to recover and grappling with the new reality of the rising waters and what it means for their home.

The city and the owner of the railroad at the time negotiated an agreement that would allow public officials to block the gap should flooding appear imminent, so long as they gave the railroad owner a 12-hour notice.

The “overriding factor that caused the majority of the devastation was the failure to have a proper closure” at the underpass, according to a report commissioned by the North Carolina Division of Emergency Management.

A CSX spokesperson suggested that the company had to keep the railroad open so that hazardous materials could be removed and emergency materials could be hauled in ahead of the storm. “Our network is critical to ensure storm supplies are strategically located in areas prior to a storm’s arrival,” the spokesperson wrote in an email to The Intercept. “We work as safely and as quickly as possible to ensure railcars and hazardous materials are out of the storm’s path for the safety of neighboring communities and our employees.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"shortcode\" data-shortcode=\"newsletter\" data-campaign=\"\" data-cta=\"\" data-headline=\"\" data-layout=\"\" data-subhead=\"\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, on Friday, September 14, with Florence already unleashing rain and high winds on Lumberton, Cooper issued an emergency order that the berm be constructed against the will of CSX.

In its motion to dismiss the class-action suit, CSX implied that the sandbagging wasn’t effective in the end. But although the damage to West Lumberton was significant, it was not as bad as during Matthew, Love, the deputy city manager, told The Intercept. He’s certain it’s because of the sandbagging. “No doubt in my mind,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What would have been truly effective is if they built that floodgate,” Foreman added. “That’s what gets me — it’s that they knew.

Residents of New Orleans filed a complaint against CSX in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. There, too, CSX infrastructure represented a breach in the levee system. In fact, the very first breach of New Orleans levees occurred where CSX property crossed the Industrial Canal. The floodgates had been damaged by a train derailment the year before, and sandbags were used to seal the levee walls instead. The waters broke through before the storm even made landfall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCommunity members blamed the city-owned railroad for failing to repair the floodgate but also argued that CSX had contributed to the breach by using porous, lightweight sand and gravel in structures that connected to the city’s flood protection system. A New Orleans judge sided with CSX, finding that protecting the community from floods was not the company’s responsibility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Lumberton, the process of building a floodgate over the CSX railroad is finally in motion, but city officials have estimated that it could take three to five years to complete. An extensive hydrologic study will have to be completed in advance of construction. As hurricane season begins, the levee gap remains open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the edge of Lumberton, where the ground slopes to one of its lowest points, fewer and fewer houses appeared to be occupied. James Cummings, a veteran and a runner who has lived in the neighborhood for years, joked that he enjoyed the privacy after the post-storm exodus. He wasn’t planning to leave. “It’s more than a box you live in; it’s a home,” he said. “You see that little brown house and that’s where you belong.” But if another major storm hits, he’ll still be in the floodwaters’ path.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-bleed large-bleed width-auto' style='width: auto;'\u003e\n\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-252417\" src=\"https://prod01-cdn06.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/05/055_FV2A0710-1559254592.jpg\" alt=\"October 23, 2018.

Army conducts “breach training” at a range near Camp Trzebień in Poland","content":"\u003cp\u003eThe U.S. Army has announced that Combat Engineers with 1st Engineer Battalion, 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team, 1st Infantry Division successfully deployed an M60 Armored Vehicle Launched Bridge system and crossed an 85-class bridge as part of a day of breach training they conducted at a range near Camp Trzebień, Poland.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bridge system was used to cross a tank ditch, which would be too wide and deep to cross without the bridge system deployed. For the combat engineers, this is referred to as a trench breach. Practice deploying and crossing this type of bridge is an essential part of the readiness mission of the 1st Engineer Battalion. The 1st Engineers were joined by units with the 3rd Battalion, 66th Armored Regiment for the day’s training.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e“Today\u0026#8217;s training was to allow other elements to see how an actual tank ditch breach with an AVLB is done,” said Spc. Wess Frentz, a combat engineer and team leader with Bravo Company, 1st Eng. Bat. “It allows the Soldiers to get some training time actually crossing over the bridge and learning how to do it efficiently and safely.”\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the first time that this particular bridge system, designed to allow large tracked vehicles such as the M1 Abrams Tank and the Bradley Fight Vehicle to cross trenches safely, had been deployed by this unit. Frentz was positioned on the bridge to guide the tracked vehicles across.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e“The bridge is a brigade level asset and because of how unpredictable it can be, most haven\u0026#8217;t seen it deployed or crossed over it,” said Pfc. Dogacan Williams, a combat engineer with Bravo Company, 1st Eng. Bat. “Doing training like this, even if it\u0026#8217;s not a real combat zone, helps the Soldiers get that mindset and have that knowledge for future operations.” Williams operated the AVLB and deployed the bridge.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs an operator, Williams explained that he operated five different hydraulic valves located in front of the driver’s seat of the AVLB to lay out different portions of the bridge simultaneously in a fluid motion. Williams stated that being able to successfully deploy the bridge and pick it up again was a big achievement for the 1st Eng.

serious situation,\u0026#8221; said Nahles\u0026#8217; deputy Malu Dreyer, the governor of the state of Rhineland-Palatinate. \u0026#8220;If we don\u0026#8217;t manage to stick together and find a way out of it then things will look really bleak.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDreyer told reporters in Berlin that senior party officials would meet Monday to discuss the next steps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFormer party leader Sigmar Gabriel told the daily Hannoversche Allgemeine Zeitung that the Social Democrats needed a \u0026#8220;detox\u0026#8221; to prevent internal power struggles from further harming the party.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Social Democrats had planned to hold a midterm review of the coalition with Merkel\u0026#8217;s bloc later this year, raising the prospect of an early end to the coalition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA recent opinion poll indicated that the Social Democrats may not have hit rock bottom yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe survey conducted last week for broadcaster RTL by the Forsa research institute found the Greens at 27%, ahead of Merkel\u0026#8217;s Union bloc with 26% and the Social Democrats at 12%.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe poll had a margin of error of 2.5 percentage points.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMerkel, who handed the leadership of her Christian Democratic Union party to Kramp-Karrenbauer in December, has said she wants to stay on as chancellor until her fourth term ends when Germany holds its next national election in late 2021.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Christian Democrats were meeting late Sunday to review their own election result, but that is likely to be overshadowed by discussions about the future of the governing coalition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/time/world/~4/p2n5MKxkVDI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"

Arabia Nervous amid Fast-Paced Developments’","content":"\u003cp\u003eThe Saudis, who seem a little anxious amid the recent fast-moving developments, hosted three regional meetings last Thursday and Friday: The Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), the [Persian] Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and the Arab League. But that anxiety has been coupled with some questions, including \u0026#8220;Why has there been so much haste and back-to-back meetings?\u0026#8221; and, \u0026#8220;Were those meetings successful, after all?\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCoincidence of Meetings with Developments\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe holding of the meetings in Mecca none of which produced full consensus comes as developments are unfolding at a fast pace in the region.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the key ongoing developments is the political tension between Iran and the United States, which has worried most of the regional countries as well. These countries fear that the US may be pushed by some rich regional sheikhs into a war with Iran whose dimensions and consequences are not predictable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe meetings were held on the threshold of International Quds Day. Some experts believe they were aimed at overshadowing the millions-strong worldwide rallies on that day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, the meetings are not completely unrelated to the so-called \u0026#8220;Deal of the Century\u0026#8221; initiative proposed by US President Donald Trump to destroy Palestine completely. The plan initiated by Trump\u0026#8217;s son-in-law Jared Kushner in cooperation with Zionists takes on board regional Arab states, especially Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn keeping with the Deal of the Century, these meetings are associated with an upcoming meeting in Bahrain which is going to discuss the financial dimensions of the Deal of the Century and which has already been boycotted by Palestinian groups and some other countries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutcome of Meetings\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Arab League meeting was one of three held in Mecca last Thursday amid profound differences which they tried to keep under wraps. The Iraqi delegation led by President Barham Salih expressed strong opposition to the final statement of the meeting, something that Saudi authorities might have never imagined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStatements released by the GCC, OIC, and Arab League sparked reaction from many parties, authorities and prominent political groups in the region from West Asia all the way to the African Middle East. Secretary General of the Lebanese Resistance Movement Seyyed Hassan Nasrallah were among those who said Saudi Arabia needs the West, the US and their intelligence services for survival. He also said some Arab regimes have been plotting against the Islamic Republic of Iran since the victory of the 1979 Islamic Revolution in the country.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMohamed Abdel Salam, the head of the Yemeni delegation and spokesperson for Ansarullah, also weighed in on the meetings held in Mecca. He said the participants swayed by Saudi Arabia issued a unilateral statement which made no mention of Palestine, the most pressing issue of the Muslim world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe meetings and the statements released in them did not receive a positive feedback in the occupied Palestinian territories which hosted mass anti-Israeli rallies on International Quds Day last Friday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA pivotal issue associated with the meetings was the differences among participants, especially with Riyadh. One of the videos which went viral on social media shows the Qatari prime minister snubbing the Saudi King. Unlike other participants, Sheikh Abdullah bin Nasser bin Khalifa al-Thani did not go to King Salman to shake hands with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKuwaiti Emir Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani refused to take part in the meetings and, instead, sent Prime Minister Abdullah bin Nasser bin Khalifa Al Thani. Riyadh-Doha relations have been strained since June 5, 2017 following the blockade of Qatar by the Saudis and other GCC members. Maghreb\u0026#8217;s king, who has not been in good terms with Riyadh since the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, did not attend the meetings, either, and sent over the country\u0026#8217;s prime minister instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Saudis also tried to tried to draw the attention of participants to Iran by taking a swipe and Tehran and bringing up issues such as the suspicious attacks at oil tankers in the UAE.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNaturally, the centrepiece of the talks was the Zionist regime of Israel which is slowly advancing its anti-Islamic objectives amid the recent fuss that the Americans have kicked up in the region against Iran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, the Al Mayadeen news network criticized Saudi Arabia for holding the three meetings in Mecca. It said Riyadh aimed to garner support by holding the meetings, but to no avail as the deep divisions between the Saudis and their closest allies show the Saudi rule is facing a brick wall. According to the network, Riyadh also accused Iran of working hand in hand with the Yemeni army to target Mecca. They displayed parts of drones that they claimed belonged to Iran and called for all resources to be mobilized against Iran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Al Mayadeen, Riyadh\u0026#8217;s attempts to get other Arab countries on board with Saudi Arabia in order to counter Iran failed. Only Sudan\u0026#8217;s military ruler General Abdel Fattah Al-Burhan announced he would welcome all actions taken by Persian Gulf countries to ensure their security. However, other Arab, Persian Gulf and Islamic states did not support the option of war against Iran and echoed the Kuwai Emir\u0026#8217;s call for talks in order to defuse the war propaganda.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt can be said that the three meetings in Mecca show Saudi Arabia only has the UAE, Sudan\u0026#8217;s Military Council, Israel and US hawks by its side. Saudi Arabia\u0026#8217;s isolation will become more evident only when US President Donald Trump, fearing the repercussions of a destructive war, retreats from his attempts to fuel tensions with Iran and begins to call on France, Saudi Arabia and the UAE to end the war on Yemen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e* Article by Mohammad-Ali Heidar-Haee \u0026#8211; IRNA\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe post \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ifpnews.com/exclusive/saudi-arabia-nervous-amid-fast-paced-developments/\"\u003e‘Saudi Arabia Nervous amid Fast-Paced Developments’\u003c/a\u003e appeared first on \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ifpnews.com\"\u003eIFP News - Iran Front Page\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://ifpnews.com/exclusive/saudi-arabia-nervous-amid-fast-paced-developments/","published":"2019-06-02T08:05:52Z","guid":"https://ifpnews.com/?p=142185"},{"title":"Iran Exporting Nano Towels to Iraq, Azerbaijan, Georgia","content":"\u003cp\u003eIn 2018, the anti-bacterial towels of the knowledge-based company have been exported to Georgia, Iraq, and Azerbaijan, while Russia and Turkmenistan are the company\u0026#8217;s next export destinations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Fars News Agency, since 2016, the company has begun exporting its nano-based products and is currently focusing on Commonwealth of Independent States.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe CIS is a union of some independent republics of the former Soviet Union, such as Russia, Belarus, Azerbaijan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, which is a very good market place for anti-bacterial towels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2019, the company expanded its activities and entered into negotiations with countries such as Russia and Turkmenistan to export its products to these countries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurkey is also very powerful in the textile industry and is a rival for those active in textile industry, not only in the Middle East but also around the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNevertheless, last year, the Iranian company\u0026#8217;s anti-bacterial towels were used in several hotels in Turkey. Although the value of exports was $30,000, it was a big step because the company could export nano towels to the largest textile manufacturer and exporter in the region.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe price of these towels is 20 to 35 percent more than ordinary towels, but their durability is higher and requires less washing. Therefore, it is more cost-effective to use them in the long run. In addition, nano-antibacterial towels do not smell bad and are environment-friendly because of the need for less detergents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, in general, the use of these towels is good for hotels and hospitals.

‘Art of the Deal’ Not to Work on Iran: Zarif","content":"\u003cp\u003eIn an exclusive interview with ABC News, Zarif also told \u0026#8220;This Week\u0026#8221; Co-Anchor Martha Raddatz that \u0026#8220;there will be consequences\u0026#8221; if the United States keeps up its economic pressure campaign against Iran’s people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZarif labelled the new US sanctions as \u0026#8220;economic terrorism\u0026#8221; that \u0026#8220;targets ordinary Iranian people\u0026#8221; because even though food and medicine are exempted from the sanctions, the financial transactions associated with them are not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;If the objective of President Trump is to impose pressure on normal Iranians, on ordinary Iranians, he is certainly achieving that,\u0026#8221; Zarif said. \u0026#8220;But he will not achieve his policy objectives through pressure on the Iranians.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZarif, however, said the prospects of potential talks are \u0026#8220;not very likely, because talking is the continuation of the process of pressure.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe foreign minister also noted that Trump’s business experience in real estate \u0026#8212; as described in his 1987 book, \u0026#8220;Trump: The Art of the Deal\u0026#8221; \u0026#8212; will not work with Iran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;This may work in a real estate market. It does not work in dealing with Iran,\u0026#8221; he said. \u0026#8220;It may work even with in dealing with other countries, for a brief period, not for long term, but it doesn\u0026#8217;t work with Iran for a brief period, or in medium or long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;The only thing that works with Iran is respect,\u0026#8221; he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsked what message he would give directly to the US president, Zarif advised against threatening the country.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;I\u0026#8217;ve said it before, threats against Iran never work,\u0026#8221; he said during the interview. \u0026#8220;Never threaten an Iranian. Try respect, that may work.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZarif dismissed the US claims that there was a new Iranian threat to the region and countered that it was the US Navy’s presence that was destabilizing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;We call this place the Persian Gulf for a reason,\u0026#8221; said Zarif. \u0026#8220;It\u0026#8217;s next to us. We have a right to defend ourselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;Just imagine if Iran were to come to California coast [or the] Florida coast,\u0026#8221; he added. \u0026#8220;How do you feel? How would you treat that? The United States is sending nuclear ships to our waters, to our vicinity.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for how Iran could respond in the future to what it considers further escalations, the foreign minister told Raddatz his country will take a page from the Trump administration’s playbook.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;I like to keep President Trump guessing because he likes everybody in the world to keep on guessing about what is happening in the United States,\u0026#8221; said Zarif.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Zarif warned that \u0026#8220;there will be consequences\u0026#8221; if the US continues adding more economic sanctions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;If the United States decide to cause so much pain on the Iranian people by imposing economic warfare, by engaging in economic terrorism against Iran, then there will be consequences,\u0026#8221; he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;We don\u0026#8217;t differentiate between economic war and military war,\u0026#8221; he cautioned. \u0026#8220;The US is engaged in war against us, and a war is painful to our participants. We have a very clear notion that in a war, nobody wins. In a war, everybody loses the loss of some will be greater than the loss of others.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsked by Raddatz if the consequences he was referring to was the equivalent of the phrase used by American officials that \u0026#8220;all options are on the table,\u0026#8221; Zarif explained that he was referring to self-defence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;All options are on the table belongs to the time when the use of force was legal, and that is about 100 years ago,\u0026#8221; said Zarif.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;What we say is that we exercise our self-defence. Self-defence is allowed.
