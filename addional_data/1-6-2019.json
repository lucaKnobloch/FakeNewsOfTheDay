Some of the going-ons and drama at the French Renaissance ch?teau-style building on Central Park South involve real-life characters like Harry Black, a womanizer who attempted to drown himself in his bathtub at the hotel after the 1929 Wall Street crash; hotelier Conrad Hilton; and Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal. Then, of course, there\u0026#8217;s Donald Trump, seemingly inescapable from any story these days--although his association with the Plaza used to be one of his most famous assets. The now President bought the hotel for a record price at the peak of the 1980s, putting first wife Ivana in charge, only to bankrupt the hotel two years later. Most recently, a disgraced Indian tycoon, who never slept at the hotel, bought the Plaza--only to run it on a shoestring budget from his prison cell in Delhi. Facing foreclosure, he sold it in June 2018 to the Gulf state of Qatar.

Launched in 2005 and now a fully fledged digital media hub for all things food, domestic, or travel-inspired, Serious Eats is a major outlet in the culinary world--all started by founder Ed Levine. The James Beard Award winner recounts what inspired him to start the site, much of which sounds almost laughably simple then or now, like wanting to eat the world\u0026#8217;s best bagel or sample everything on In-N-Out\u0026#8217;s secret menu, and then write about it. The ideas seem quaint now because everyone has tried to copy the approach since, and it was quaint then because no one had done it yet. Perhaps Levine\u0026#8217;s work and influence on food writing was something we didn\u0026#8217;t know we needed--but we\u0026#8217;re surely thankful for his contributions and influence now.

Now imagine a road trip taken by Henry Ford[f500link] and Thomas Edison. No, really. As illuminated by bestselling author Jeff Guinn, the two icons of American enterprise, along with tire tycoon Harvey Firestone, dubbed themselves \"The Vagabonds\" and joined one another for annual summer trips around the country between 1914 and 1925. Outfitted in a caravan of [f500link]Ford automobiles with an entourage of chefs, butlers, and other handlers, the Vagabonds were followed by a gaggle of journalists--perhaps the early 20th-century version of the paparazzi--at landmarks, campgrounds, motels, diners, and even gas stations. But their trips had a side effect: They were essentially advertising not only Ford cars but also a new national lifestyle involving summer vacations and life on the road.

And yet many critics point to this as the beginning of the drug-fueled downward spiral to his 1977 death.

Doing so while helping another highly successful local business reduce its waste in an effort to meet eco-friendly goals is a task so arduous, some might consider it insane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat supposed insanity has paid off for Noah Bernamoff and Travis Kauffman, founders of \u003ca href=\"https://www.blackseedbagels.com/\"\u003eBlack Seed Bagels\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://www.folksbier.com/\"\u003eFolksbier Brauerei\u003c/a\u003e respectively. The two Brooklyn-based businesses have recently partnered to create \u003ca href=\"https://untappd.com/b/folksbier-black-seed-glow-up/3200181\"\u003eBlack Seed Glow Up,\u003c/a\u003e a limited-release beer brewed by Folksbier using Black Seed\u0026#8217;s leftover bagels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We were thinking about our food waste and how we have leftover bagels at the end of the day, no matter how hard we try to nail the [right] number [to make each day],\" says Bernamoff. \"We started to think about how we could manipulate the leftovers into a very different form, and we came across this idea of making beer. I turned to one of the best brewers and breweries that I know and, thankfully, [they] said yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpon receiving the uneaten bagels (nothing with onions or garlic, which would distort the flavor of the ale), the Folksbier team breaks them up by hand and uses them as replacements for a little under 25% of the grains necessary in the brewing process. \"We have to be cautious because, at some point, there's going to be too many bagels and not enough grains to ferment properly because the types of sugars that come out of the bagels are different from what we get out of the grains,\" explains Kauffman. \"We're not trying to make bagel-flavored beer. We're trying to make beer out of bagels.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eResembling the brewery's other offerings both in flavor and production, Black Seed Glow Up is made in the same style as the Berliner Weisse, a sour beer from Northern Germany that Folksbier makes with Hudson Valley fruits. Instead of said fruits, the bagel beer boasts some of the honey that Black Seed utilizes in-store. (The bagels are boiled in honey and water before baking in a wood-fired oven.) The result is a slightly hazier brew, due to the gluten and proteins in the bread, which tastes \"tart, pleasantly acidic\" and boasts fleeting notes of breadiness. (\"Although it could also just be in people's heads,\" Kauffman says.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe entire project came together pretty quickly. A mere five months have passed since Bernamoff first reached out to Kauffman and, during that time, the brewing process was put into place and the first batch of the stuff was released to the public. Drinkers can find the product ($14 for a 750-milliliter bottle, $42 for a 1.5-liter magnum) at Folksbier (which also served it on tap until recently) as well as a handful of other locations throughout New York City, including Grand Army in Boerum Hill, Celestine in Dumbo, Old Rose in the West Village, and The Smile in NoHo. These are also all venues in which Bernamoff himself or Black Seed Bagels cofounder Matt Kliegman have stakes. Although supplies of the beer are running out, the team is working on preparing a second, hopefully larger, batch of the product.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"inline-image-default-width aligncenter\"  \u003e\u003ca href=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/folksbier-tasting-room-exterior.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg data-attachment-id=\"2639146\" data-permalink=\"http://fortune.com/2019/06/01/bagel-beer-brooklyn-food-waste/folksbier-tasting-room-exterior/\" data-orig-file=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/folksbier-tasting-room-exterior.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"5184,3456\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{\u0026quot;aperture\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;7.1\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;credit\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;camera\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;Canon EOS Kiss X7\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;created_timestamp\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;1556105400\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;copyright\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;focal_length\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;22\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;iso\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;1600\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;shutter_speed\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0.0003125\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;title\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;orientation\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;1\u0026quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Folksbier tasting room exterior\" data-image-description=\"\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Folksbier\u0026#8217;s tasting room in Brooklyn, N.Y.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/folksbier-tasting-room-exterior.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/folksbier-tasting-room-exterior.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"wp-image-2639146 size-large\" src=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/folksbier-tasting-room-exterior.jpg?w=1024\u0026#038;h=683\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/folksbier-tasting-room-exterior.jpg?w=1024\u0026amp;h=683 1024w, https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/folksbier-tasting-room-exterior.jpg?w=2048\u0026amp;h=1366 2048w, https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/folksbier-tasting-room-exterior.jpg?w=150\u0026amp;h=100 150w, https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/folksbier-tasting-room-exterior.jpg?w=300\u0026amp;h=200 300w, https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/folksbier-tasting-room-exterior.jpg?w=768\u0026amp;h=512 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"image-caption\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"caption\"\u003eFolksbier\u0026#8217;s tasting room in Brooklyn, N.Y.\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"credit\"\u003eAlex Ostrof\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis isn't either company's first foray into environmentally conscious production.

A research fellow in A.I. at \u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/ibm/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eIBM\u003c/a\u003e, Mojsilovic holds 16 patents in machine learning, and helped develop algorithms that can check other algorithms for unintended bias. An essential part of using A.I. to encourage diversity, she notes, is making sure the teams that build what goes into the black box are themselves a diverse group, with a variety of backgrounds and points of view.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;Any A.I. tool can only be as good--and as impartial--as the data we put in,\u0026#8221; Mojsilovic says. \u0026#8220;It\u0026#8217;s not about replacing human intelligence, but rather about complementing it.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA.I. has helped companies find and attract new hires of all sexes, ages, and ethnicities. Here are four main ways it\u0026#8217;s helped them to do that:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eA.I. knows how to speak to your best candidates\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words in job postings matter, not least because they often unwittingly discourage some potential hires from applying. \u0026#8220;We as humans take our best guess at what will resonate with job seekers, but we\u0026#8217;re often wrong,\u0026#8221; notes Kieran Snyder, cofounder and CEO of the A.I. firm Textio.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing a dataset of about 500 million actual job ads, and A.I. that analyzes the real-life responses they got, Textio advises companies on which words to use--and avoid. At client \u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/ebay/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eeBay\u003c/a\u003e, for instance, the phrase \u0026#8220;prior experience\u0026#8221; drew a 50% increase in male applicants. \u0026#8220;But the phrase \u0026#8216;demonstrated ability\u0026#8217;--even though it means essentially the same thing--attracted 40% more women,\u0026#8221; Snyder says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLanguage that is neutral across sexes, races, and ethnicities \u0026#8220;changes rapidly. There is no \u0026#8216;use-these-10-words\u0026#8217; list,\u0026#8221; she adds. \u0026#8220;But the right word at the right moment does attract the most diverse possible group of applicants.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA.I. widens the pool of eligible workers\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA.I. also has the power to cast a wider net across unmanageable geographies. Take, for example, campus recruiting. Employers can send only so many humans to a limited number of campuses--but what if the perfect hire skipped the job fair, or goes to a different school entirely?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;A student at an obscure college where you\u0026#8217;d never send a recruiter could be every bit as good as, or better than, graduates of the \u0026#8216;right\u0026#8217; schools,\u0026#8221; observes Loren Larsen, chief technology officer at A.I. firm HireVue, which lists \u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/intel/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eIntel\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/oracle/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eOracle\u003c/a\u003e, Dow Jones, Dunkin\u0026#8217; Brands, and many others among its clients.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the old days, says Larsen, this student wouldn\u0026#8217;t have gotten a second sniff, let alone a first. But by sourcing the leads with A.I., and using modern tools like video chatting, you can reach them with ease. \u0026#8220;This way, a lot more people are let into the system on their merits, so you get to \u0026#8216;meet\u0026#8217; and assess a much more diverse group of candidates,\u0026#8221; adds Larsen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA.I. has an eye for talent--and skill sets\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eResumes are nice, but \u0026#8220;if you focus on what it says on someone\u0026#8217;s resume, you risk overlooking huge numbers of people,\u0026#8221; says Irinia Novoselsky, CEO of CareerBuilder, whose top leadership is now 70% women and minorities--up from 40% when Novoselsky joined in 2017.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe site uses A.I. to help employers and job hunters find the best match, with a database that includes more than 2.3 million job postings, 10 million job titles, and 1.3 billion skills. The algorithms zero in on exactly what skills a job requires, and find promising candidates who have them--but who may, based on their background, be applying for a different job altogether.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;Someone\u0026#8217;s resume headline or most recent role may not necessarily translate into what else they can do,\u0026#8221; says Novoselsky. Customer service reps need, for instance, patience and problem-solving ability, and \u0026#8220;we\u0026#8217;ve found that home health care workers share those skills. Without A.I., making those matches would have been impossible.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA strict focus on skills \u0026#8220;naturally leads to more diversity, because the hiring criteria are exactly the same for each and every candidate, regardless of sex, race, ethnicity, age, or anything else. A.I. strips out all that extraneous stuff,\u0026#8221; says Loren Larsen at HireVue. Reams of research confirm that so-called structured interviews, where interviewers ask precisely the same questions of each candidate and look for precisely the same checklist of answers, work best at eliminating unconscious biases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe catch is, human interviewers rarely do them. \u0026#8220;We get bored, or we\u0026#8217;re distracted, or we have a toothache,\u0026#8221; Larsen notes. \u0026#8220;A.I. never does.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA.I. can correct its own biases\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople can\u0026#8217;t help bringing their own experiences, assumptions, and preferences with them to work in the morning, and some of those quirks--especially when they lurk in the subconscious--are notoriously slow to change. By contrast, even the smartest machines (at least so far) can learn and apply only what programmers install in them. That can include an emphasis on welcoming the best-qualified candidates of all ages, sexes, and colors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;Humans often can\u0026#8217;t fully explain their decisions, because they\u0026#8217;re going partly on \u0026#8216;gut feel,'\u0026#8221; says Larsen. \u0026#8220;But with algorithms, we can pinpoint exactly where an unintentional bias has sneaked in.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt one client company, HireVue\u0026#8217;s team tried out an algorithm that turned out to be biased toward job applicants with deep voices so that, in preliminary testing, it kept selecting men over women who were just as qualified. Meanwhile, other, earlier A.I. systems have drawn fire for favoring light skin tones over darker ones in video interviews.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLarsen says programmers have learned to spot--and fix--that sort of thing, adding that \u0026#8220;data-driven technology gives us the chance to keep getting more fair in ways that weren\u0026#8217;t possible before.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026#8217;s not to say that A.I. can ever push human resource professionals and hiring managers to the sidelines. The tasks of managing company policy on inclusion, building great relationships with promising candidates, and making sure that A.I. is doing its job can only be done by people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Aleksandra Mojsilovic at IBM puts it, \u0026#8220;All the research shows that \u003ca href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/shyam_sankar_the_rise_of_human_computer_cooperation/transcript?language=en\"\u003ehumans and A.I.\u003c/a\u003e, working together, are far more effective than either alone.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"http://fortune.com/2019/06/01/ai-artificial-intelligence-diversity-hiring/","published":"2019-06-01T11:00:44Z","guid":"http://fortune.com/?p=2640801"},{"title":"The Long Winter: Bracing for a Protracted US-China Cold War","content":"\u003cp\u003eGreetings from Hong Kong.

While there isn't any definitive data that measures how much of an economic impact the American craft sake industry would have on the state, data from similar industries strongly suggests that an investment in craft sake breweries would have a positive impact on local communities.

The first sake brewery in the U.S. was established in Berkeley in 1901, he notes, while others came and went, mostly in Hawaii and California.

Seasoned sake drinkers know there are other ways to experience the complexities of this drink. \"It really took a trip to Japan and a firsthand experience with fresh, local, and affordable sake to seed the idea of creating Brooklyn Kura,\" says Brian Polen, who opened New York State's first sake brewery in 2018.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"inline-image-default-width aligncenter\"  \u003e\u003ca href=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/brooklyn-kura-sake-new-york-brewery.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg data-attachment-id=\"2641389\" data-permalink=\"http://fortune.com/2019/06/01/craft-sake-arkansas/brooklyn-kura-sake-new-york-brewery/\" data-orig-file=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/brooklyn-kura-sake-new-york-brewery.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"2880,1921\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{\u0026quot;aperture\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;credit\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;camera\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;created_timestamp\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;copyright\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;(C) GoDaddy Brand Creative\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;focal_length\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;iso\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;shutter_speed\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;title\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;orientation\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Brooklyn Kura-Sake-New York Brewery\" data-image-description=\"\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Head brewer Brandon Doughan samples Sake inside the brewery in Brooklyn, New York.

So I have not had really great sake before this day. I poured out glasses to all in attendance and we said \u003cem\u003eKanpai\u003c/em\u003e and my life was changed forever,\" Johnson recalled about the bottle of Yatsushika Junmai Daiginjo he received as a parting gift.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePart of what makes sake so unique, and the idea of a trail so appealing, is that the range of flavors between different types of sakes varies. \"Brewers have a lot of leverage in the sake-making process, and as a result, sake can be savory, sweet, floral, or acidic, and combinations thereof,\" Polen says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough often (mistakenly) referred to as a rice wine, sake is actually the result of fermentation created by combining five ingredients: rice, water, a mold known as \u003cem\u003ekoji\u003c/em\u003e, yeast, and lactic acid. Sake styles vary depending on the amount of distilled alcohol added to sake as well as the type of rice milled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile there's no definitive U.S. style given the industry's infancy, there's a lot to like about the prospect of American sake eventually joining the ranks of the world's finest. \"Does American sake have a style like our big Cali wines and hoppy craft beers?

Hard on its heels, the prefecture of Yamagata became recognized as a \"geographical indication\" on labels for particular sakes the following year.

Do they?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt one time, the answer would be a clear yes, for reasons of both nature and nurture. \"The water source associated with a region can create a natural differentiation,\" says Tim Sullivan, founder of Urbansake.com and brand ambassador for Hakkaisan. \"The snowmelt water in Niigata would be one example.\" Melted snow is a very soft water that lends itself to brewing a dry, pure style of sake called \u003cem\u003etanrei karakuchi.\u003c/em\u003e Certain rice varieties also grow better in certain regions: \u003cem\u003eGohyakumangoku\u003c/em\u003e in Niigata, \u003cem\u003eYamada Nishiki\u003c/em\u003e in Hyogo, and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the cultural side, just as in Europe, where local wines pair with local foods, so sake tended to match with local cuisine, creating immense variety in a country where even ramen comes in sundry regional manifestations. \"Akita is a northerly, rural region of Japan, and many villages up there, historically, would have relied heavily on fermented and preserved foods to survive the winters,\" Sullivan says. \"This was believed to have led to the development of more full-bodied styles of sake to match with these more salted, fermented, and pickled foods with more impactful flavors.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"inline-image-default-width aligncenter\"  \u003e\u003ca href=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/hakkaisan-brewery-02.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg data-attachment-id=\"2642339\" data-permalink=\"http://fortune.com/longform/sake-japan/hakkaisan-brewery-02/\" data-orig-file=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/hakkaisan-brewery-02.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"2880,1920\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{\u0026quot;aperture\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;credit\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;camera\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;created_timestamp\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;copyright\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;focal_length\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;iso\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;shutter_speed\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;title\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;orientation\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Hakkaisan-Brewery-02\" data-image-description=\"\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Without Koji, there is no Sake.

There are vestigial remnants of those guilds today, but it's not the force it used to be.\" Nor, as Sullivan points out, are villages blocked off from the rest of the world each winter anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNatural factors, too, have been fading for some time. Rice, yeast, and \u003cem\u003ekoji\u003c/em\u003e--a mold that converts rice's starch into fermentable sugars--are three of sake's main ingredients; all three are easily transportable, so brewers today aren't confined to whatever grows locally. Modern technology also allows brewers to easily filter or adjust the fourth ingredient--water--to match the style a brewer wants to make.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eSake's Terroir\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSake's classification system, instituted in 1992, centers on how milled or polished the rice grains are, rather than the source of the raw materials. More milling typically produces more fruity and floral aromas; to make a \u003cem\u003edaiginjo\u003c/em\u003e sake, the brewer polishes the rice grains to 50% or less their original size, but 60% or less for a \u003cem\u003eginjo\u003c/em\u003e. While these terms are standard on premium sake labels, the prefecture of origin isn't even required.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCertain brewing recipes have become standardized across regions, lessening local character even further over the past few decades. \"Many sake brewers were using the same yeast strains, the same polishing ratio,\" says Toshio Ueno, vice president at the Sake School of America. One recipe, for example, is nicknamed YK35. \"'Y' was for \u003cem\u003eYamada Nishiki\u003c/em\u003e rice, 'K' for \u003cem\u003eKumamoto\u003c/em\u003e yeast, and 35% was the polishing ratio.

They're trying to have more regional character.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUeno's use of the word \"terroir,\" the wine world's term for how a wine represents the place where it was grown and made, is not accidental. \"Japan is very romanced by the world of wine,\" says Monica Samuels, director of sake and spirits for Vine Connections, which imports both wine and sake. \"So you'll see a lot of terms like \u003cem\u003edomaine\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003ecuv?e\u003c/em\u003e being used and applied to sake labels.\" Meanwhile, accepted Japanese terms are disappearing. \"A lot of brewers nowadays don't put anything like \u003cem\u003eginjo\u003c/em\u003e or \u003cem\u003edaiginjo\u003c/em\u003e on the labels. They want people to pay attention to something else about the sake, whether it's the region or even the growing site of the rice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as in wine, where even small vineyards sometimes lay claim to an individual character and quality, some sake brewers are taking a micro-regional approach. Vine Connections imports Ama No To, a brewery that started out as rice growers and began making its own sake. \"Their trademark is that all their rice fields are visible from the front door of the brewery,\" Samuels says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn a broader scale, the only way Yamagata could be certified as a geographical indicator with the WTO is if sakes claiming the designation are made exclusively with local water and rice. Similarly to Ama No To, Takahiro Nagayama, brewmaster at Taka Brewery, came back from Burgundy and stopped filtering his water so the sake would more reflect the local environment. Other brewers have even begun treating each harvest differently, responding to growing conditions to make different types of sakes each year just as wines vary by vintage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"inline-image-medium-width aligncenter\" style=\"max-width:650px;\" \u003e\u003ca href=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/hakkaisan-brewery-05.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg data-attachment-id=\"2642346\" data-permalink=\"http://fortune.com/longform/sake-japan/hakkaisan-brewery-05/\" data-orig-file=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/hakkaisan-brewery-05.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1000,1250\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{\u0026quot;aperture\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;credit\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;camera\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;created_timestamp\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;copyright\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;focal_length\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;iso\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;shutter_speed\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;title\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;orientation\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Hakkaisan-Brewery-05\" data-image-description=\"\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;A bottle of Tokubetsu Junmai sits ready for drinking.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/hakkaisan-brewery-05.jpg?w=240\" data-large-file=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/hakkaisan-brewery-05.jpg?w=819\" class=\"wp-image-2642346\" src=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/hakkaisan-brewery-05.jpg?w=650\u0026#038;h=813\" alt=\"Hakkaisan-Brewery-05\" width=\"650\" height=\"813\" srcset=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/hakkaisan-brewery-05.jpg?w=650\u0026amp;h=813 650w, https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/hakkaisan-brewery-05.jpg?w=120\u0026amp;h=150 120w, https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/hakkaisan-brewery-05.jpg?w=240\u0026amp;h=300 240w, https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/hakkaisan-brewery-05.jpg?w=768\u0026amp;h=960 768w, https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/hakkaisan-brewery-05.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"image-caption\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"caption\"\u003eA bottle of Tokubetsu Junmai sits ready to drink.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"credit\"\u003eCourtesy of Timothy Sullivan\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the novice sake consumer, the idea of getting to know sake styles region-by-region might be a little premature, but there are some generalizations one can follow. \"At a very high level,\" Sullivan says, \"the further north you go, the more dependent brewers would be on snowmelt as their water source; further south you're going to get more well water, which would generally create richer, more full-bodied sakes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis shows in data from the Japanese National Tax Agency.

Sake faces a shrinking market at home thanks to population decline; as brewers court export markets, regionality may help a larger number of them distinguish themselves and survive.

The code behind EternalBlue leaked online at the hands of a mysterious, still-unknown entity called the ShadowBrokers in 2017, and nation state actors have used the weapon to launch destructive cyberattacks--including \u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/2017/12/18/wannacry-cyber-attack-north-korea/\"\u003eNorth Korea\u0026#8217;s WannaCry\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/2018/02/16/russia-notpetya-cyberattack-damage/\"\u003eRussia\u0026#8217;s NotPetya\u003c/a\u003e--costing billions of dollars in damages for businesses and governments around the globe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause NSA lost control of this hacking tool, an alleged \u0026#8220;key component\u0026#8221; of the latest ransomware, according to the \u003cem\u003eTimes\u003c/em\u003e, the paper lays blame at the spy agency\u0026#8217;s feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe backlash on that point has been fierce. Some information security professionals have argued that the malware in question did not need EternalBlue to wreak its havoc. Dave Aitel, a former NSA hacker and present chief security officer of Cyxtera, a data center company, \u003ca href=\"https://cybersecpolitics.blogspot.com/2019/05/baltimore-is-not-eternalblue.html\"\u003ewrote on his personal blog\u003c/a\u003e that \u0026#8220;that particular exploit being used to do lateral movement for this ransomware is neither supported by any public facts, nor my own sources on the issue.\u0026#8221; Alternative means of propagation were far likelier, he said. Rob Graham, CEO of Errata Security, a cybersecurity shop, agreed that even if the ransomware incorporated EternalBlue code, it probably didn\u0026#8217;t rely on the tool to spread. \u0026#8220;Yes, ransomware increasingly includes Eternalblue as part of their arsenal of attacks, but this doesn\u0026#8217;t mean Eternalblue is responsible for ransomware,\u0026#8221; he \u003ca href=\"https://blog.erratasec.com/2019/05/a-lesson-in-journalism-vs-cybersecurity.html#.XPJl19NKjOQ\"\u003ewrote on his own blog\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnsurprisingly, the NSA is disclaiming responsibility for the fallout. C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger, a Maryland congressperson, said that senior NSA leaders told him \u0026#8220;there is no evidence at this time that EternalBlue played a role in the ransomware attack affecting Baltimore City,\u0026#8221; as the \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/31/us/nsa-baltimore-ransomware.html\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eTimes\u003c/em\u003e reported in a follow-up story\u003c/a\u003e on Friday. Rob Joyce, a top NSA bigwig offered his own form of disavowal: \"The characterization that there is an indefensible nation-state tool propagating ransomware is simply untrue,\" he said in remarks \u003ca href=\"https://www.cyberscoop.com/eternal-blue-baltimore-ransomware-rob-joyce-new-york-times/\"\u003ereported by \u003cem\u003eCyberScoop\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, a cybersecurity news outlet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe NSA has a point. If EternalBlue truly was key to the Baltimore attack, as the \u003cem\u003eTimes\u003c/em\u003e initially reported, then it would appear that Baltimore had for years failed to update its computer systems to defend against a known, critical vulnerability. Microsoft released a patch in 2017; the exploit works on machines running Windows software that\u0026#8217;s two years out of date. The harsh truth: Baltimore should have been better prepared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeeping IT systems up to date and secured is easier said than done, of course. Government offices are perennially resource-strapped and impoverished of tech expertise, struggling to get by on dated equipment. (I used to work in local government--trust me.) And another point to consider: Even if the NSA is not to blame for Baltimore\u0026#8217;s debacle, that still does not absolve the agency of its prior negligence. It\u0026#8217;s unclear how the spooks lost control of their bag of cyber tricks, including EternalBlue, a couple years ago, let alone the identities of the thieves that call themselves the ShadowBrokers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs we ponder these questions and wait for Baltimore to release more details about its thwomping, a recommendation: For the love of all that\u0026#8217;s holy, please patch \u003ca href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/microsoft-bluekeep-patched-too-slow/\"\u003ethis \u003cem\u003eother\u003c/em\u003e critical, wormable Windows security hole\u003c/a\u003e. Microsoft released a patch for the bug, dubbed BlueKeep, on May 14th, but as of two weeks later 900,000 computers still appear to remain vulnerable, \u003ca href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/microsoft-bluekeep-patched-too-slow/\"\u003eby \u003cem\u003eWired\u0026#8217;s\u003c/em\u003e count\u003c/a\u003e.

He called the treatment of his country \"unfair\" and that it \"makes no economic sense to anyone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn Saturday, AMLO said at the Mexican port city of Veracruz that Mexico shouldn't be used as a pawn in U.S. political fights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJesus Seade, Mexico's undersecretary of foreign relations for North America, said Thursday he had no idea that the tariff threat was coming, and that his government hadn't been warned by the U.S. Embassy before Trump's tweet announcing his decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrump is determined to impose the 5% tariff set to kick in on June 10, people familiar with the matter said. He sees it as a way to help pay for construction of the a wall on the border that he promised during his 2016 campaign, and to claim that Mexico paid for it, according to the people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Trump has repeatedly argued that the countries he penalizes bear the cost of tariffs, it's U.S. importers that pay the duties and some of that gets passed to consumers in the form of higher prices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe administration's know-it-when-you-see-it definition of action by the Mexican government has left outsiders grasping to interpret the president's intentions--and sincerity.

Lighthizer's office said in a statement he supported the president's move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrump made the decision to publicly threaten the tariffs on a day that he was traveling to Colorado with only a small cadre of lower-level aides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllies on Capitol Hill and in the business community have expressed concern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA diverse group of Republican senators, including Arizona's Martha McSally, Ohio's Rob Portman, Iowa's Joni Ernst, and Pennsylvania's Pat Toomey issued statements criticizing the proposal.

That could mean retaliatory steps that would amplify the effect of the levies on U.S. citizens, who are already likely to bear the brunt of the costs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe big question now is how long Mexico can continue with a policy of no confrontation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsked about the tariffs, Seade said: \"I'm not saying we'll sit on our hands and do nothing until June 10 to see if it's real or not, but I trust that it's not something that will be put into action because it would be very serious.

If you disagree with what we\u0026#8217;ve chosen, let\u0026#8217;s try to use the comments of these articles to have conversations about what game is your game of the week and \u003cstrong\u003ewhy\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout further ado…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 style=\"font-size: larger; border-bottom: 1px solid #BBB; font-weight: bold;\"\u003eDeath Hall\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI already knew I was interested in Tom Janson\u0026#8217;s new game \u003cem\u003eDeath Hall\u003c/em\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://toucharcade.com/link/http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1308999352?mt=8\"\u003e(\u0026#36;2.99)\u003c/a\u003e when he formally announced it earlier this year. I mean this is the guy who made the completely crazy \u003cem\u003eWave Wave\u003c/em\u003e about a half a decade ago, so yeah of course I\u0026#8217;m anxious to see what else would be coming from a brain that was capable of producing THAT. But this is one of those instances where even though I figured I\u0026#8217;d enjoy the game based on what I\u0026#8217;d seen pre-release, I wasn\u0026#8217;t prepared for how hard \u003cem\u003eDeath Hall\u003c/em\u003e sucked me in. It\u0026#8217;s a game that\u0026#8217;s apparently been in the works for three years, and the level of polish in every nook and cranny backs that up. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"clear:both;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"video-responsive\"\u003e\n\t\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2jE5M1bU-a4\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eDeath Hall\u003c/em\u003e is a platformer played in portrait orientation, with a virtual button setup very similar to \u003cem\u003eDownwell\u003c/em\u003e. Just left and right arrows for movement and a jump button. The goal is to get to the end of each level without getting killed by the many, many, MANY types of hazards that are out to impale you. Spikes of all shapes and sizes, both moving and stationary, as well as a cast of ghoulish enemies are all trying to hurt you real good. Luckily you have four hearts that allow you to take four hits of damage, and those hearts can be refilled by doing the classic \u0026#8220;bounce on an enemy\u0026#8217;s head\" routine. Levels are randomly generated so the layout is always different, and that makes going after an enemy to try and refill a heart a risky endeavor, but one that\u0026#8217;s often necessary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026#8217;s another risk factor at play, too. That\u0026#8217;s the Monster. He\u0026#8217;s a giant red sphere with razor-sharp spikes for teeth, and he is NOT stoked that you\u0026#8217;re trying to escape his hall. His DEATH HALL, if you will. You\u0026#8217;ll pass a certain point in a level where Ol\u0026#8217; Red will burst from the wall and begin chasing you, adding a little extra… let\u0026#8217;s just call it \u003cem\u003emotivation\u003c/em\u003e to get to the level exit. Of course getting through these hazard-filled levels is tough enough even when you can take your time and be careful, but with that thing chasing you it becomes a frantic dash of desperation. And it\u0026#8217;s a total blast. It\u0026#8217;s also super difficult, so don\u0026#8217;t go thinking you\u0026#8217;re going to breeze through all the levels here in one sitting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"clear:both;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"video-responsive\"\u003e\n\t\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/97UvlapTYqE\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything about \u003cem\u003eDeath Hall\u003c/em\u003e just FEELS right. The physics and weight of your jump, your movement speed, the level layouts and hazards. Like I said, this feels like a game where the concept was decided on day one and the next 2 years and 364 days were spent making sure every single detail was \u003cem\u003ejust right\u003c/em\u003e. There also seems to be plenty of secrets hiding in the shadows of \u003cem\u003eDeath Hall\u003c/em\u003e, and with a very clever scoring system and Game Center leaderboards there\u0026#8217;s also a competitive side to the game. As long as you can get on with the portrait orientation of the game, \u003cem\u003eDeath Hall\u003c/em\u003e is one of the most entertaining platformers I\u0026#8217;ve played in a long time and is well worth checking out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://toucharcade.com/2019/05/31/toucharcade-game-of-the-week-death-hall/","published":"2019-06-01T01:11:46Z","guid":"https://toucharcade.com/?p=253596"}]},{"url":"https://www.nintendolife.com/feeds/latest","items":[{"title":"New Trailer And Release Date For Gunvolt Chronicles: Luminous Avenger iX","content":"","url":"https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/06/new_trailer_and_release_date_for_gunvolt_chronicles_luminous_avenger_ix","published":"2019-06-01T03:50:00Z","guid":"https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/06/new_trailer_and_release_date_for_gunvolt_chronicles_luminous_avenger_ix"},{"title":"Shovel Knight Update Coming To Musical Bullet-Hell Game Just Shapes \u0026 Beats","content":"","url":"https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/06/shovel_knight_update_coming_to_musical_bullet-hell_game_just_shapes_and_beats","published":"2019-06-01T03:00:00Z","guid":"https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/06/shovel_knight_update_coming_to_musical_bullet-hell_game_just_shapes_and_beats"},{"title":"Mario Kart 8 Is Now Five Years Old","content":"","url":"https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/06/mario_kart_8_is_now_five_years_old","published":"2019-06-01T04:30:00Z","guid":"https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/06/mario_kart_8_is_now_five_years_old"},{"title":"Square Enix Has Just Filed A Trademark For Collection Of Mana In Europe","content":"","url":"https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/06/square_enix_has_just_filed_a_trademark_for_collection_of_mana_in_europe","published":"2019-06-01T05:05:00Z","guid":"https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/06/square_enix_has_just_filed_a_trademark_for_collection_of_mana_in_europe"},{"title":"Video: See How The Digimon Games Have Evolved In This Developer Diary","content":"","url":"https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/06/video_see_how_the_digimon_games_have_evolved_in_this_developer_diary","published":"2019-06-01T06:00:00Z","guid":"https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/06/video_see_how_the_digimon_games_have_evolved_in_this_developer_diary"},{"title":"Mortal Kombat 11 Shows Off Shang Tsung And Confirms Additional DLC Fighters","content":"","url":"https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/06/mortal_kombat_11_shows_off_shang_tsung_and_confirms_additional_dlc_fighters","published":"2019-06-01T08:00:00Z","guid":"https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/06/mortal_kombat_11_shows_off_shang_tsung_and_confirms_additional_dlc_fighters"},{"title":"Video: See How The Digimon Games Have Evolved Over The Past 20 Years In This Developer Diary","content":"","url":"https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/06/video_see_how_the_digimon_games_have_evolved_over_the_past_20_years_in_this_developer_diary","published":"2019-06-01T06:00:00Z","guid":"https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/06/video_see_how_the_digimon_games_have_evolved_over_the_past_20_years_in_this_developer_diary"},{"title":"Talking Point: What Are You Playing This Weekend?

Robert Mueller was a formally appointed special counsel in the Russia matter; Jim Comey assumed the functional equivalent of the role in investigating and make a prosecutorial judgment in the case of Hillary Clinton’s email. Both came to their tasks highly celebrated for their independence and professional integrity. They were each believed to be especially well equipped by background and temperament to manage and resolve the most politically sensitive of assignments. By the time they had concluded their work, both came in for heavy criticism. Enchantment gave way to disillusionment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd yet, while the results in each case left a bitter taste, Comey and Mueller went about their job in strikingly and fundamentally different ways.

Despite trying multiple models, we have not gotten it quite right, dooming us to disappointment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eConsider first the differences between the Mueller and Comey cases.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMueller was admired for being the consummate law-enforcement professional who played it by the book. Comey subscribed to a very personal moral code that required him to bend the rules, or disregard them, when required to do the right thing. In an open, swashbuckling manner alien to Mueller, Comey directly, unabashedly bypassed officials higher in the reporting chain in order do what he thought necessary to protect public confidence in the Department of Justice. Comey also chose to made specific commitments to Congress to testify about his conclusions and to keep it apprised of case developments if any occurred. Mueller made it clear that he would prefer not to testify at all about his Russia report. If he did, he stated quite clearly, he would not depart from the text of the written, publicly released version.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/05/robert-mueller-sticking-facts/590494/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eKen White: Robert Mueller wishes you’d read his report\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf course, Mueller was operating within specific rules for the conduct of special counsel investigations.

His choice to give the attorney general only short notice, without details, of his plan to make a public announcement of his conclusions  in July of 2016 did not comport with his responsibilities as director of the FBI to observe the Department of Justice’s chain of command. The department’s inspector general later found that Comey’s action was “extraordinary and insubordinate.” Comey sees his actions differently: In his book, \u003cem\u003eHonest Loyalty\u003c/em\u003e, he defends his “crazy idea of personally offering the American people unusual transparency, and doing it without the leadership of the Department of Justice.” The contrast with Mueller could not be starker: Mueller does not do “crazy ideas.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNor, in his role as \u003cem\u003ede facto\u003c/em\u003e prosecutor, did Comey’s comments about Clinton’s carelessness managing email systems security satisfy ethical or department policy prohibitions on commenting on the conduct of a subject or target who is not charged with a crime. The IG dismissed Comey’s justification as neither “reasonable” nor “persuasive,” but instead found that he had violated “long-standing Department and protocol.” The decision to notify Congress of the additional emails found on the Anthony Weiner laptop days before the election—a decision taken in the face of the express objections of the attorney general—presented the same issues of a prosecutor marching to the beat of his own internal moral drummer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eComey has written an entire book to justify his adherence to a higher moral calling. He explained that because he did not “trust that the system would work,” he would have to bear special, personal, ethical responsibility to do what was right. No one would expect that sort of claim from Mueller, who has long been seen to represent what was best about the “system.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMueller, for his part, has been criticized for the passages in his final report declining to “exonerate” the president, which his critics have seen as little different from Comey’s commentary about Clinton’s conduct. But there is a clear difference in the two cases. His comments on the limits of his charge arose from a \u003cem\u003elegal \u003c/em\u003esource that introduced, as far he was concerned, serious complications into his \u003cem\u003elegal\u003c/em\u003e assessment of the president’s conduct.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/05/james-comey-candor-cnn-town-hall-trump-barr/589189/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: James Comey’s “duty of candor” was his undoing\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMueller read Office of Legal Counsel opinions on presidential immunities to disallow a prosecutorial judgment as well as a prosecution, and after laying out the evidence of Trump’s obstructive actions, he decided to stress that nothing in his failure to reach a conclusion constituted an exoneration. It may have been an awkward move, but it remained within the realm of legal presentation— a fair distance from any Comey-like statement such as: “While I cannot find that the president committed a crime, his actions were reckless, inconsistent with the norms governing the relationship between his office and the Department of Justice and reflected poorly on his judgment.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMueller was averse to leaks, or to any public comment whatsoever, and when he did speak publicly about his report, it was largely with the aim of emphasizing that he would speak no more. Mueller seems likely to remain silent. Comey has gone on speaking tours, tweeted his views about the administration, and written a book and periodic opinion pieces for editorial pages. (And, of course, he had more to discuss by the time he left office: His conflict with President Donald Trump. Even there, Comey chose to take matters into his own hands and, once gone from the administration, he leaked memos he prepared as FBI director to induce the appointment of a special counsel.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut despite these very different approaches, by the time Comey wrapped up the Clinton investigation and Mueller signed off after his report on Russian electoral interference and presidential obstruction, they ended up at much the same place: targets of immense frustration. Comey was maligned by Democrats for inflicting political injury on Clinton, then by Republicans for what they saw was his pursuit of a lawless, underhanded vendetta against Trump; and in both cases, the critique was largely that, for reasons of misguided ethical zeal or unbounded vanity, he had ignored legal limits and crashed through norms.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMueller’s sin was often described in very much the opposite way: as the pulling of his punches, reflected in the confusing, half-in and half-out analysis of possible obstruction of justice. The \u003cem\u003eNew York Times\u003c/em\u003e editors who had praised him when appointed as “one of the few people with the experience, stature and reputation to see the job through” suggested this week that “ as the foremost expert on the president’s questionable doings, with expertise earned on the taxpayer’s dime,” he had proven too fearful that he would “endanger [his] own image by expressing a forthright view of those doings, even if the future of the Republic might be at stake.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/05/mueller/590467/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eDavid Frum: What the Mueller report actually said\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNeither the moral crusader nor the straight arrow have fared well, then, in the most recent tests of our processes for investigating high-level executive branch wrongdoing. Of course, much of the criticism of process and performance follows closely, if it does conform exactly, to the critics’ preferred outcomes. We see this now in Democrats’ attempt to read into Mueller’s public statement a “code” for what he meant to convey to the public (Trump committed crimes) and to Congress (initiate impeachment proceedings). Republicans reject decoding and go with a crude misrepresentation of the written report: “no obstruction.” The Democrats who cheered Comey’s “crazy idea” in July 2016 thought that in October of that year he went simply crazy, and by this no compliment was intended. Republicans embraced him on reading his first letter to Congress in October of 2016, and returned to reviling him, only days later, on reading his second.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo, what is to be made of our unhappy experience with these kinds of investigations?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSince Watergate, \u003cem\u003ethree\u003c/em\u003e modes of independent or special inquiry into presidential or senior executive misconduct have produced frustration: an  independent counsel like Ken Starr who operates in part outside the regular system, answering in key respects to the judiciary and not to the attorney general; a senior official, like Comey, who takes on a heroic responsibility for the failings of a flawed system; and a special counsel, like Mueller, who works within regulations that restrict his independence of action, bind him to departmental policies and rules, and make no provision for direct communications with the public or Congress.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt is time to turn again to the question of how to structure this role to improve the prospects that it can be successfully discharged.

Advocates for the clause’s removal say it’s simply not necessary anymore, and that its inclusion in the founding document is insulting to African Americans in Vermont. The current raft of proposed amendments—the slavery provision, an expansive equal-protection measure, a constitutional guarantee for abortion rights, and a guarantee of privacy—could hit the ballot as soon as the 2022 midterm elections.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWhile the abortion-related measures are high profile, the slavery and equal-protection measures go to the core of the state’s identity. Vermont, which was 95 percent white at the time of the last census, has been known for its racial liberalism since becoming the first place in the Western Hemisphere, in 1777, to outlaw slavery. But the state remains monochromatic and, sometimes, racially fraught. “Vermont has long been accused, especially in other parts of the country, of being tolerant without a lot of diversity … to bump up against that tolerance,” says Kesha Ram, a former state representative and former candidate for lieutenant governor who is one of only a few people of color ever elected to the state’s legislature.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/02/what-kids-are-really-learning-about-slavery/552098/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: What kids are really learning about slavery\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eAs for the slavery passage, “we want it out completely,” says Tabitha Pohl-Moore, the acting director of the NAACP’s Vermont branch and the president of the Rutland-area chapter, arguing that opponents of removal are propagating the belief that “white folks think that they know better what we need than we do.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe racial-equity measures function as a signal to Vermonters, advocates say, that bigotry is anathema to the state’s values. Cementing equal protection in the state constitution in particular gained a renewed urgency among lawmakers this past summer, when Kiah Morris, a two-term state representative from Bennington and the only black woman in the legislature,\u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/26/us/politics/kiah-morris-vermont.html\"\u003e resigned\u003c/a\u003e following a torrent of racist harassment and threats from white supremacists,\u003ca href=\"https://www.sevendaysvt.com/OffMessage/archives/2019/02/07/max-misch-pleads-not-guilty-to-possessing-high-capacity-magazines\"\u003e most notably\u003c/a\u003e another Bennington resident.

Yet the issue is the most historically and ideologically fraught of all the amendments working their way toward the ballot. The amendment’s backers see Vermont as a place on the cutting edge of social equity, where the constitution changes with the times and yesterday’s radicalism is today’s foregone conclusion. The other faction sees the work of the past—the state’s abolition movement and groundbreaking legal codes that allowed men who did not hold property to vote—as the essential building block of today’s Green Mountain State. Vermonters in this camp believe that the abolition language needs to stay in the constitution—that when the history of Vermont’s radical past is not visible in the state’s law, something of its spirit may be lost.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWhen the earliest version of the state’s constitution was written, in July 1777, Vermont was an independent republic tenuously allied with the year-old United States. In the document, Vermont’s founders were attempting to portray themselves as learned, reasonable, and radical, says Gary Shattuck, a former assistant U.S. attorney and a historian who studies the state’s formation. Part of that radicalism was an action against slavery: Since the beginning of the transatlantic slave trade,\u003ca href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-slavery/chronology-who-banned-slavery-when-idUSL1561464920070322\"\u003e no country had banned the practice\u003c/a\u003e—and Vermont became the first to do so.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eBut the reality of abolition was murkier. In early Vermont, the ban—along with most of the new constitution—\u003ca href=\"https://www.uvm.edu/uvmnews/news/patchwork-freedom\"\u003ewas unevenly enforced\u003c/a\u003e. And the language is ambiguous: Designed to allow apprenticeships and indentured servitude, both relatively common 18th-century practices, the document explicitly banned only slavery for adults. The pertinent section in \u003ca href=\"https://legislature.vermont.gov/statutes/constitution-of-the-state-of-vermont/\"\u003ethe current document\u003c/a\u003e—essentially identical in\u003ca href=\"http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/vt01.asp\"\u003e the 1777 version\u003c/a\u003e—reads:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\r\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThat all persons are born equally free and independent, and have certain natural, inherent, and unalienable rights, amongst which are the enjoying and defending life and liberty, acquiring, possessing and protecting property, and pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety; therefore no person born in this country, or brought from over sea, ought to be holden by law, to serve any person as a servant, slave or apprentice, after arriving to the age of twenty-one years, unless bound by the person's own consent, after arriving to such age, or bound by law for the payment of debts, damages, fines, costs, or the like.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eUnder the amendment as first proposed, which was co-sponsored by 25 state senators, that entire passage would be cut. The current language “allow[s] slavery under certain conditions, and that’s quite simply wrong,” says Democratic Senator Debbie Ingram, who proposed the measure. “I think we, as white people who are privileged, we ought to go the extra mile and understand what it would be like to have this provision as the very first sentence in our constitution. It’s degrading and it’s exclusionary. And we need to make sure that this is righted.” Getting rid of the entire passage is the only option, Pohl-Moore says.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eBut the idea that slavery is countenanced in any way by the current language is disputed by some scholars. The proposed amendment, says the Vermont Law School professor Peter Teachout, is the product of a misreading of 18th-century language. “It’s absolutely clear, and the Vermont Supreme Court at that time made clear, that the Vermont Constitution banned slavery,” he says. “It didn’t matter if it was adult slavery or child slavery.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eState pride is also on the line. Vermont’s early abolition of slavery is much-vaunted within the state. “It’s something of which all Vermonters are proud, given our leadership on racial equality back when other places didn’t recognize that,” says Jim Douglas, the Republican former governor who left office in 2011. The constitution of 1777 was an aspirational and visionary document when first adopted, according to Rob Williams, a lecturer at the University of Vermont and the publisher of the secessionist site Vermont Independent. Removing the slavery section, he says, would redact one of the state’s proudest achievements.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eBut there’s a simple reason to cut the existing language, according to Tim Ashe, the state Senate’s president pro tempore and a leading co-sponsor of three of the four proposed amendments. Doing so would underscore to people of color that they are equal and valued within the state’s society—a message “that should triumph over preserving the legacy of state leaders from a couple of hundred years ago,” Ashe says.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eStill, both Ashe and Joe Benning, the Senate minority leader, believe in the possibility of a compromise solution in which the ambiguous language is removed while the prohibition of slavery is maintained—new language that would likely emerge as the measure is debated in the legislature. Indeed, Teachout and his allies were able to persuade the state Senate to move forward with an amendment \u003cem\u003eto\u003c/em\u003e the amendment that removes wording that could have allowed indentured servitude or unpaid apprenticeships. \u003ca href=\"https://legislature.vermont.gov/Documents/2020/Docs/BILLS/PR0002/PR0002%20As%20passed%20by%20the%20Senate%20Official.pdf\"\u003eThat version\u003c/a\u003e has advanced to the legislature’s lower house.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/01/will-congress-ever-ratify-equal-rights-amendment/580849/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: The equal-rights amendment strikes again\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eBut any solution that leaves a part of the clause intact is unacceptable, Pohl-Moore says. “If it’s about historical preservation, then put the original constitution in a museum somewhere and go look at it.

The document, at 8,295 words, is the shortest in the nation (\u003ca href=\"https://law.justia.com/constitution/alabama/\"\u003eAlabama’s\u003c/a\u003e, the longest, is about 42 times lengthier). It’s one of the oldest, materially unchanged longer than any other. And it’s “the most difficult state constitution in the country to amend,” says Eric Davis, a political-science professor emeritus at Middlebury College. That’s due in part to a law that stipulates that amendments may only be introduced at four-year intervals and requires a two-year cooling-off period between votes on the amendments in each chamber of the legislature. Only after that process is complete do voters get to weigh in. The new amendments are at various stages of their life span, though most are expected to be approved by lawmakers. The equal-protection measure has already passed both legislative chambers, meaning it will appear before voters in 2022.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003ePerhaps because of this onerous process, Vermont’s constitution is svelte. Amendments are judged by voters and legislators alike on whether they fulfill basic needs and structural concerns, rather than whether they legislate any specific issue, says Richard Cassidy, an attorney who studies the state’s constitution. That has meant the document is much more generalized than many of its peers, some of which have hundreds of amendments and concern themselves with such relative banalities as the government of specific municipalities. Teachout likened the document to Dan \u0026amp; Whits, a general store in Norwich, a town of 3,000 on the Connecticut River. The store’s motto: “If we don’t have it, you don’t need it!”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe most recent amendments to Vermont’s constitution have not been sweeping, dealing with items such as judicial retirement and the setting of bail. But this cycle is different. If any one of the new measures is approved by the state’s electorate, it would be the first major socially progressive amendment to pass since voters approved suffrage for women in 1924, a symbolic measure after the federal Constitution took the same step in 1920.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eFor the state senators I spoke with, the quadrennial chance to amend the state’s highest document is a moment of gravity—and a chance to cement what they believe are the state’s true values. “The desire in this day and age was to take a harder look and to make that very clear that all segments of society are protected, not just one segment of society,” says Benning, the Senate minority leader. Senator Lyons voiced a similar sentiment: “This is the time to reconsider who we are—constitutionally.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/9t5KQwDTpEE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/9t5KQwDTpEE/","published":"2019-06-01T10:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-588853"},{"title":"The Ugly Logic Behind Trump's Flattery of Kim Jong Un","content":"\u003cp\u003eThe grisly news that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un allegedly executed his envoy for nuclear talks with the United States didn't come as a total surprise.

She dug into the testimonies of “wayward” young women who had been sent to mental hospitals and reformatories, and into the press coverage of lesser-known entertainers in Harlem. Through deep archival work, Hartman managed to recover the powerful subjectivity of her characters, often by giving voice to their thoughts and desires—and to the music and art they made.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLike Hartman, the Morans are devoted to elevating voices that have not often been heard, and to articulating connections between the highest levels of black society and the lowest. “Two Wings,” which spans nearly three hours, featured performances from some of the leading voices in gospel, jazz, folk, and Western classical music; for the Morans, it was an opportunity to put a version of the black American musical canon into venues that, even today, seldom make space for its full breadth. The Morans’ guest performers throughout the evening included the gospel-piano virtuoso Joseph Joubert; the Imani Winds quintet; the vocalist, pianist, and pastor Smokie Norful; and Wilkerson, who read passages from \u003cem\u003eOther Suns\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs the Morans assembled the “Two Wings” program over a two-year period, they let the Wilkerson book’s stories echo alongside their own family lore. Hall Johnson’s history, for instance, resonated with the narratives from \u003cem\u003eOther Suns\u003c/em\u003e, like the one of a doctor who moved his family to L.A. only to find a palm tree burning on his lawn the night he arrived. “It was not unlike the crosses that burned in the South,” Wilkerson writes, “except this was California.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHartman’s book, meanwhile, traces a quiet social realignment taking place during this era—what the author calls “the revolution before Gatsby.” Before the flappers caused a stir in the 1920s; before it became socially acceptable for, say, \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnPmg0R1M04\"\u003ewhite women to smoke cigarettes in public;\u003c/a\u003e and before women had even gained the right to vote, the young women she writes about were stubbornly demanding new forms of personal liberation, simply by living their lives as they pleased. More often gainfully employed than their male counterparts, black women in the early-20th century might have been breadwinners, proud single parents, unapologetic libertines, same-sex spouses, or community leaders. They were engaged in what Hartman describes as “a \u003cem\u003ebeautiful experiment\u003c/em\u003e in how-to-live”—a process not just of assimilating into the city, but also of rewriting American social norms in their image.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn doing this research, relying mostly on sources that sought to either condemn or corral the women she was writing about, Hartman found herself grappling “with the power and authority of the archive and the limits it sets on what can be known.” Her practice, in this sense, has much in common with the Morans’. Jazz and classical musicians are lovers of archives, and they’re able to unlock powerful emotional and intellectual work from within old material. But the most nuanced practitioners are also troubled by its limitations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Two Wings,” in this way, works as historical corrective, guided by a commitment to scrambling, reordering, and recontextualizing the history of bodies “in motion.” (The very act of bringing this cast of musicians into Carnegie Hall had an element of transgression. As Moran wrote in the concert’s program notes, “We’re ready to etch our mark in the walls.”) “Two Wings” includes Harlem Renaissance–era jazz tunes, gospel hymns, the Morans’ own compositions, and a piece by the oft-overlooked classical composer George Walker. The Morans hired Norful to deliver a sermon and sing “\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnWbYqSJ3_w\"\u003eDear God\u003c/a\u003e” (declaring melismatically, “Thank you for my life”), and they put him immediately after Lawrence Brownlee, a primo operatic tenor. Program order can connote seniority, Hall Moran noted in an interview, so putting Norful after an opera singer, in a setting where he normally might not be heard at all, felt significant.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNot that Brownlee was an easy act to follow. He sang “There’s a Man Going ’Round Taking Names,” a traditional piece best known for the version by the blues legend Leadbelly, with simple, repetitious lyrics that refer to a slaver, or an officer of the law, or perhaps the grim reaper. Brownlee’s voice stretched like leather toward his highest notes; as the song ended, he held a single word (“Death!”), and Moran pounded the keys with both hands. Spare, dissonant harmonies rang at either end of the keyboard—Moran was doing an Ellington thing, a Monk thing, something rebellious and foreboding.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Two Wings” was conceived as part of Carnegie Hall’s \u003ca href=\"https://www.carnegiehall.org/Events/Season-Highlights/Migrations\"\u003eMigrations festival\u003c/a\u003e, which was meant to highlight the importance of mass movements in shaping American history, and perhaps to tacitly rebuke the ethno-nationalism of President Donald Trump’s immigration policies. Moran told me that when Carnegie Hall first invited him to produce a concert for the festival, he made it clear that he wouldn’t perform without Hall Moran. “What you think I am is because of her,” he remembered telling the organizers. Besides, migration has long been a central theme of Hall Moran’s work, snaking through original songs such as “Open Door,” “Deep River,” and “Oklahoma Girl.” Her debut album’s title, \u003ca href=\"https://aliciahallmoran.bandcamp.com/album/here-today\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eHere Today\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, itself suggests constant transience.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut even songs of fugitivity and displacement can become a kind of home. Referring to three early-jazz pieces played in succession during “Two Wings,” each by a different soloist, Moran wrote in the program notes: “Each of these pieces reflects a place. They give us a sense of the hood and the air, the cause and the effect, effectively the call and the response.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Morans talked about the importance of place when I caught up with them last month at their home in Harlem. Over the past two decades, they have seen the faces in their building on Riverside Drive change as gentrification has forced many residents out. “None of the other black families are still here. Most of the Dominican families are not here,” Hall Moran told me. “It’s a white building now.” As Hartman outlines in her book, the couple’s famous neighborhood became primarily black only after white violence chased black people out of Lower Manhattan and Midtown in the early-20th century. By defining Harlem as a refuge not from the American South but from the white mob waiting just a few dozen blocks below, Hartman shows that black bodies have never been allowed to rest: Even in the earliest years of the migration, the idea that freedom might be found in the North was proving to be a fallacy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMoran has found something similar happening in Chicago, where “Two Wings”\u003cem\u003e \u003c/em\u003erecently landed. Over the past 20 years, \u003ca href=\"https://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/chicagos-black-exodus/Content?oid=66920657\"\u003ehundreds of thousands\u003c/a\u003e of black Chicagoans have left the city, many moving to Atlanta and Birmingham and other points south, escaping inadequate public housing and schools, and high rates of crime. In 2014, when Moran and the artist Theaster Gates were \u003ca href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/howard-reich/ct-ent-jazz-kenwood-recording-0307-story.html\"\u003eworking\u003c/a\u003e with high-school musicians in the Kenwood Academy Jazz Band, a young member of the ensemble was shot and killed\u003ca href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/howard-reich/ct-jazz-kenwood-ent-0222-20170221-column.html\"\u003e just two weeks before their concert premiere\u003c/a\u003e.

The initial big drop in circulation/reshelf numbers was almost entirely due to periodicals going online. This led librarians to a flawed assumption that soon all reading would be digital, and led to a fad for preferentially buying ebooks. Yes, ebooks are easy to access online but, as the author himself points out, they are inferior for deep reading. If more new library books are ebooks, print books on the shelves will become more and more out of date; this will create a feedback loop that further depresses print circulation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eFinally, the idea that “no library can be completely universal” is perfectly true, but trying to be universal is part of the problem. Nearly all academic libraries outsource book selection to “approval plans,” so that every library buys essentially the same scholarly books regardless of faculty research specialties, curricula, or geographic location. Academic libraries are doing students a huge disservice when they simply reduce book collections without developing any plan to boost print circulation or to reconnect with a culture of literacy and reading. Instead of spending millions on generic collections, academic librarians ought to treat the college community more like a real community with specific issues and interests reflected in a curated collection of books. Libraries have emotional power specifically because the books a person has read become a reflection of their deep self. I will be surprised if the group work, data processing, or “new forms of digital scholarship” replacing the books ever turn out to have as much impact on the formation of identity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAmy Brunvand\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eSalt Lake City, Utah\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eDan Cohen replies:\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eI am all in favor of finding ways to engage students with books and other printed materials, and appreciate Rebecca L.

As appealing as these activities in the library might be, I am pessimistic, however, that they can stem the long decline in the use of college book collections that I identify in the piece, which has many factors beyond just positive encounters with the written word, as compelling as that often is.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eAs a fellow Victorianist, I am very familiar with the elements that can make individual copies of books unique, such as marginalia from bygone students and faculty in some of the books held by the University of Virginia library, which one can see in the digitized copies of those books on Andrew Stauffer’s \u003ca data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.booktraces.org\u0026amp;source=gmail\u0026amp;ust=1559425053035000\u0026amp;usg=AFQjCNHHUxzMhqOJx6QSbquuU_N2iXJTUg\" href=\"http://www.booktraces.org/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBook Traces website\u003c/a\u003e (as well as in Google Books, HathiTrust, and other places). However, while such volumes are a delight to find, and can in some cases produce new scholarship about the circulation of knowledge, a comprehensive analysis of the total modern library collection, especially at universities that are not as old as UVA or that do not have such extensive collections of older works, would find that significantly altered volumes are relatively rare.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe bigger issue is that privileging even small variations in each book over the larger concerns of the library—to maintain a useful and used collection of books, tailored to community needs and to all disciplines in an institution (not just book historians)—can too easily lead to paralysis and a maximalist take on the retention of all books centrally. As a historian of science and a general nerd, I love to leaf through old computer-programming books, but I also understand that they might have to go off-site to make room for newer, more relevant books in computer science on limited shelf space. I can retrieve them quickly if needed from nearby high-capacity storage.

I\u0026rsquo;ve decided to kick off Pride Month by writing a letter to one of my senators to explain how strongly I feel that the Equality Act should be passed. I urge you to write to your senators too. I\u0026rsquo;ll be looking for your letters by searching the hashtag #lettertomysenator. While there\u0026rsquo;s no information yet as to when the Equality Act will go before the Senate for a vote, we do know this: Politicians need votes to stay in office. Votes come from the people. Pressure from massive amounts of people is a major way to push politicians towards positive change. That\u0026rsquo;s why I\u0026rsquo;ve created a petition at change.org to urge the Senate to support the Equality Act.  Our country\u0026rsquo;s lack of protection for its own citizens ensures that LGBTQ people must live in fear that their lives could be turned upside down by an employer or landlord who is homophobic or transphobic. The fact that, legally, some people are completely at the mercy of the hatred and bigotry of others is disgusting and unacceptable. Let\u0026rsquo;s show our pride by demanding that, on a national level, our laws truly treat all of our citizens equally. \u0026#127752;\u0026#127752;\u0026#127752;\u0026#127752;\u0026#127752;\u0026#127752;\u0026#127752;\u0026#127752;\u0026#127752;\u0026#127752;\u0026#127752;\u0026#127752;\u0026#127752; Click the link in my bio to sign the petition for Senate support of the Equality Act.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\"\u003eA post shared by \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/taylorswift/\"  style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e Taylor Swift\u003c/a\u003e (@taylorswift) on \u003ctime style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2019-06-01T04:05:04+00:00\"\u003eMay 31, 2019 at 9:05pm PDT\u003c/time\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cscript async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/time/topstories/~4/g73MwOYhoK4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/g73MwOYhoK4/","published":"2019-06-01T20:09:54Z","guid":"http://time.com/?p=5599462"}]},{"url":"https://rss.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml","items":[{"title":"11 Killed in Shooting at Virginia Beach Municipal Center, Officials Say","content":"","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/31/us/virginia-beach-shooting.html?emc=rss\u0026partner=rss","published":"2019-06-01T00:10:39Z","guid":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/31/us/virginia-beach-shooting.html"},{"title":"Trump’s Tariff Threat Sends Mexico, Lawmakers and Businesses Scrambling","content":"","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/31/business/mexico-tariffs-donald-trump.html?emc=rss\u0026partner=rss","published":"2019-06-01T00:50:18Z","guid":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/31/business/mexico-tariffs-donald-trump.html"},{"title":"A New Threat From Trump and Old Questions About Its Effectiveness","content":"","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/31/us/politics/trump-border-threats.html?emc=rss\u0026partner=rss","published":"2019-06-01T00:06:48Z","guid":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/31/us/politics/trump-border-threats.html"},{"title":"‘Become My Mom Again’: What It’s Like to Grow Up Amid the Opioid Crisis","content":"","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/31/us/opioid-children-addiction.html?emc=rss\u0026partner=rss","published":"2019-06-01T00:40:51Z","guid":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/31/us/opioid-children-addiction.html"},{"title":"Louisiana School Scandal: The Truth Behind Students’ Viral Videos","content":"","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/31/the-weekly/tm-landry-school-scandal-louisiana.html?emc=rss\u0026partner=rss","published":"2019-06-01T00:40:50Z","guid":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/31/the-weekly/tm-landry-school-scandal-louisiana.html"},{"title":"There Are 472,000 Words in the Dictionary.

As a US marshal, he’s a representative of “the law,” but this far out on the frontier, the law has less meaning than it normally does. The scene embodies the central tension of \u003cem\u003eDeadwood\u003c/em\u003e in microcosm: How do we build a civilization out of nothing? Under whose authority?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"xCRxVs\"\u003eThe first four episodes of the series — which climax in Hickok’s death — are the most classically Western. But after Hickok dies, his murderer isn’t immediately killed by the residents of the camp. Instead, they hold a trial and attempt to convict him in a more lawful fashion. Therein lies the optimism of \u003cem\u003eDeadwood\u003c/em\u003e: Individuals may be driven by rage, but pull enough of them together and they might build a better world by balancing each other’s furies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"CwLrNg\"\u003eThat sense of balance is why Bullock and Al Swearengen (\u003ca href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0574534/?ref_=nv_sr_1?ref_=nv_sr_1\"\u003eIan McShane\u003c/a\u003e) are the series’ two central characters. Bullock is a man who’s channeled his rage toward the more useful purpose of helping keep the peace, while Swearengen inverts that type — he’s hidden his fundamental sweetness in the name of being a cutthroat bastard. Over the course of the original seasons, they learn better how to balance their true selves and the men they have to be to fulfill the role society requires of them. The joy of \u003cem\u003eDeadwood: The Movie\u003c/em\u003e is in how Milch finds ways to continue these essential evolutions after another 10 years have passed in the two men’s lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Svel9N\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eDeadwood\u003c/em\u003e was never just about that rage and sudden explosions of violence. Those elements were always part of its mix, but the series was always driven by mercy and kindness, by the small ways that people care for each other in times of need. And in the movie, there are moments when both Bullock and Swearengen find themselves in positions where they don’t \u003cem\u003eneed\u003c/em\u003e to extend mercy, but they do it anyway, reaching out and taking someone else’s hand, just for a moment, rather than spreading their anger further up and out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"qyo2K4\"\u003eThis is how civilization is built, in \u003cem\u003eDeadwood\u003c/em\u003e’s estimation: by way of a million tiny moments in which someone chooses \u003cem\u003enot\u003c/em\u003e to do further harm when they could, but to find a way to treat others with kindness and charity. \u003cem\u003eDeadwood\u003c/em\u003e often suggests — via lengthy shots that don’t cut away but instead track from character to character, drawing them together into a web — that people are connected in ways that remain mysteries to them. The movie suggests not that future generations better understand the mystery, but that as they solve old ones, new ones are born. That’s a natural part of progress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"jIY9Qc\"\u003eIt’s 10 years later in Deadwood, and it’s 13 years later for \u003cem\u003eDeadwood\u003c/em\u003e. The place looks much the same as before, but it also looks a little smaller. The people are older, but they’re still themselves. The viewers, too — we’re all in different places than we were when the show first ran. (Heck, it was just 10 years ago that I \u003ca href=\"https://www.avclub.com/c/tv-review/deadwood\"\u003ebegan reviewing every episode of the series at the A.V. Club\u003c/a\u003e, a few years after the show had been canceled.) And even if there are the rudiments of a plot, what is most miraculous about \u003cem\u003eDeadwood: The Movie\u003c/em\u003e is that all these people are still here.

He says Mueller “could’ve reached a decision” on whether Trump committed crimes. He says he disagrees with Mueller’s application of obstruction statutes to certain of Trump’s acts.

Specifically, he examined whether Trump’s actions in each case met three elements common to obstruction statutes: 1) whether they were obstructive acts, 2) whether they had a nexus to an official proceeding, and 3) whether there was corrupt intent. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"rxgQ2x\"\u003eOften, Mueller’s analysis seemed quite damning. For some of the episodes, he \u003ca href=\"https://www.lawfareblog.com/obstruction-justice-mueller-report-heat-map\"\u003esaid there\u003c/a\u003e was “substantial” evidence that all three of those elements applied; for others, his assessment was more mixed. But he never took the final step of clearly saying Trump broke the law or committed a crime in any instance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"AxOXde\"\u003eYet in one last twist, Mueller also said that if he had “confidence” that Trump “clearly did not commit obstruction of justice,” he would say so — and that he is “unable to reach that judgment.” So he implied that, at the very least, Trump’s conduct wasn’t obviously innocent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"V3tATy\"\u003eWhat Barr did\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Qr7ovc\"\u003eAs Mueller was wrapping up his work in March, he informed the Justice Department and its new attorney general, Barr, that he wouldn’t reach a judgment on whether Trump obstructed justice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"qzW9sh\"\u003eBarr has \u003ca href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2019-05-01/attorney-general-william-barr-surprised-robert-mueller-didnt-decide-on-obstruction\"\u003etestified\u003c/a\u003e that he was “frankly surprised” to hear this, and he \u003ca href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/william-barr-interview-full-transcript-cbs-this-morning-jan-crawford-exclusive-2019-05-31/\"\u003etold CBS this week \u003c/a\u003ethat he didn’t agree with that call. “He could’ve reached a conclusion.

(He made a similar argument last year \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/12/20/18150165/mueller-barr-memo-rosenstein-obstruction-trump\"\u003ein a memo \u003c/a\u003ebefore he got the attorney general job.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"5AbMwW\"\u003eSecond, though, he says, he didn’t just “rely on” his team’s alternate interpretation of how the obstruction statutes should be applied — he also examined whether, under Mueller’s interpretation of the obstruction laws, Trump’s actions in any instance satisfied all three elements of the statute (that they were obstructive acts, that they had a nexus to an official proceeding, and that they were done with corrupt intent).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ZQYdON\"\u003eFor every single one, Barr said, “we thought long and hard about it, we looked at the facts and we didn’t feel the government could establish obstruction.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ayjmx6\"\u003eIt’s certainly a convenient conclusion for Trump. And it’s curious that we actually haven’t seen any of Barr’s analysis on these topics, beyond his \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/3/24/18279926/mueller-report-letter-full-text-plain-barr-trump-congress\"\u003ebrief letter to Congress\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"5hn56G\"\u003eWhat are Barr’s responses to the seemingly damning analysis Mueller gave about certain episodes? Did he in fact think “long and hard” about it and seriously study Mueller’s evidence and arguments? Or was it more of a hasty “nothing to see here” whitewash? \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"zpofn2\"\u003eHow can a president be held accountable for lawbreaking?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"RfsLzn\"\u003eLooming over all this are the tremendously important issues of what is to be done when the president of the United States may have committed criminal wrongdoing — and whether the president is in fact above the law.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"JudnqJ\"\u003eCurrently, there’s no easy answer to this within the US government. The Justice Department, which is charged with investigating and enforcing federal law, is to at least some extent subordinate to the president and run by his appointees. And DOJ has taken the position that it cannot indict a sitting president.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"VD0a9Y\"\u003eCongress, meanwhile, has the constitutional authority to impeach and remove a president. But it doesn’t really have the ability or expertise to conduct a serious criminal investigation. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"5UkUVy\"\u003eNow, Mueller’s role as a Justice Department special counsel required him to submit “a confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions reached” to the attorney general (not to Congress).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"sp16nN\"\u003eStill, some \u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/2019/05/30/robert-mueller-statement-impeachment-referral/\"\u003ehave speculated\u003c/a\u003e that Mueller may have truly intended his report for Congress to act on. Under this interpretation, Mueller gathered facts and did the analysis, but one reason for his refusal to take the final step and say that Trump’s conduct was criminal was because he believed that was Congress’s job. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"telvyl\"\u003eMueller has never outright said he intended any such thing. But in \u003ca href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/special-counsel-robert-s-mueller-iii-makes-statement-investigation-russian-interference\"\u003ehis remarks Wednesday\u003c/a\u003e, the special counsel did mention how “the Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting President of wrongdoing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"xQ1tcK\"\u003eBarr, however, recoiled at this very concept “The Department of Justice doesn’t use our powers of investigating crimes as an adjunct to Congress,” he \u003ca href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/william-barr-interview-full-transcript-cbs-this-morning-jan-crawford-exclusive-2019-05-31/\"\u003etold CBS\u003c/a\u003e. “Congress is a separate branch of government and they can, you know, they have processes, we have our processes. Ours are related to the criminal justice process. We are not an extension of Congress’s investigative powers.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"piHQqv\"\u003eAnd these arguments aren’t baseless. Mueller had no actual obligation or authority under the law to give his final report to Congress, and certainly not to make an impeachment referral. Barr’s critique is that Mueller was a Justice Department special counsel investigating violations of federal criminal law. And the impeachment process \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/1/3/18166821/impeachment-trump-democrats-house-congress-mueller\"\u003ehas nothing to do\u003c/a\u003e with federal criminal law. So why should the special counsel be involved in it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"wleXb2\"\u003eIn any case, Barr did choose to release the report anyway, and Congress now has the ability to decide how it wants to proceed. But the question remains: What should the Justice Department do when it thinks the president may have violated federal criminal law?

As one of the most diverse states in the US, California’s likely voters are 59 percent white, 21 percent Latino, 11 percent Asian American and 6 percent African American.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"5gBjWJ\"\u003eCalifornia’s voting is still expected to follow the trend lines established by NH and Iowa — despite its early voting twist\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"74JTz4\"\u003eAlthough the California primary was moved up to give the state a larger say in the final outcome of the Democratic nomination, it’s likely its voters will still take strong cues from the outcomes of the early four primaries and caucuses in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"olGiLZ\"\u003e“There is a ripple effect from the early primaries, typically — those who do not do well early may fall by the wayside by Super Tuesday,” says Kondik. “Even Harris, the home state candidate, probably would have a hard time in California if she hasn’t done well earlier in the calendar.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"IvX442\"\u003eThis dynamic means that candidates will have to perform strongly and place in the “top two or three” in at least two of the early states in order to establish themselves, says UC Berkeley political science professor Eric Schickler. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"bSU8mV\"\u003e“Past experience suggests that a candidate needs to do well in at least some of the early states to have the visibility necessary to do well in a state like California, even this early in the process,” he says. “Otherwise, the risk is you are not seen as relevant.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"kaSxII\"\u003eAnd while California’s early voting set-up, which begins right around the Iowa caucus, could mean that some candidates pick up votes before the results even come in from the first four races, that backing isn’t expected to be enough to give any person who otherwise flounders enough support to get a solid win. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ELt72S\"\u003e“A January polling leader who stumbles in February may have ended up banking some votes in California,” says Kondik, calling the state’s early voting arrangement a “strange dynamic.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"5nOOiB\"\u003eMost of California’s early voters, however, will still be voting after the very first states have done so, says Schickler. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"FZIn6D\"\u003eCalifornia’s results could ultimately show just how fractured the field is\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"qgucoc\"\u003eEarly voting isn’t the only quirk of the California primary. Another interesting twist in the way the state doles out votes could mean that no single candidate walks away with the lion’s share of the delegates. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"oMbaHk\"\u003eMuch like many other Democratic primary states, California is not a “winner-take-all” system, so several candidates could theoretically each get a fraction of the 495 delegates. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"KSeIaq\"\u003eIn order to be eligible for getting any delegates, however, a candidate needs to obtain at least 15 percent of the vote in a district. In such a wide field, it’s plausible that multiple candidates hit that threshold while many do not. In one particularly extreme scenario, for example, 10 candidates could each get five percent of the vote and not qualify for any delegates. In another, multiple candidates could each receive more than 15 percent of the vote without hitting a majority, meaning that they could split the delegates. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Es1rDz\"\u003e“The impact on whether [the California primary] helps settle the race early is unpredictable,” says Schickler. “Since delegates are allocated relatively proportionally, it is possible that the winner will not receive all that many delegates — if, for example, there are still four or five serious candidates in the race.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"1uJhBO\"\u003eIf the California vote does wind up splitting in a way where there’s no clear winner, it could be a portent for a much longer, drawn-out race depending on the results in other Super Tuesday states like Texas, North Carolina, and Virginia. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"EuiZ6T\"\u003e“If California is an isolated multi-way split, then the impact is likely minimal. However, if that multi-way split is replicated across the map on Super Tuesday, then it could signal a protracted race,” says Josh Putnam, a political science professor at the University of North Carolina-Wilmington. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"rCGL9E\"\u003eThere is, however, the possibility that a clear leader emerges, especially if one person is able to rake in a majority of the votes. If a candidate was already performing strongly and did well in California, that could give their campaign a key advantage. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"mOU1bC\"\u003e“While we aren’t a winner-take-all state, we are in a winner-take-most and I would expect whoever does best in California is going to come away with a huge and decisive haul of delegates,” says Mitchell. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"tT6SfA\"\u003eHistoric trends suggest that California is more likely to help solidify various candidates’ frontrunner statuses than fuel a drawn out primary fight, though there are, of course, no guarantees. By “front-loading” the overall calendar, California is making it so a larger proportion of the delegates are available sooner in the race. That’s helped cull the field more quickly in the past, says Putnam. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"H6DIsi\"\u003e“Typically, the most front-loaded calendars — 2000 and 2008, for example — winnowed the field down pretty quickly,” he said. “In no cycle has a very front-loaded calendar led to a multi-way split that persisted for very long. That is different than saying it cannot happen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"dKABI6\"\u003eIn addition to the impact it could have on the primary outcome, the change in the California schedule could have a significant effect on the issues that candidates choose to prioritize, and the way they frame their messaging. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"DUnG1H\"\u003e“If candidates want a strong showing in [Texas and California] they need to have a strong plan for outreach to Latinos, blacks, and Asian Americans,” says Matt Barreto, a co-founder of polling and research firm Latino Decisions. “A majority of the Democratic voters [in these states] are non-white, and so candidates need to be investing in outreach, engagement and policy solutions that speak to communities of color specifically. A generic rising tide lifts all boats is not going to cut it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"WhqqQf\"\u003eCompared to several other early primary states, California is both more progressive and more diverse, forcing candidates to address an electorate that differs significantly from the predominately white voter bases of New Hampshire and Iowa. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"JXQQfe\"\u003eCandidate visits this weekend, which are set to feature several campaign fundraisers, an appearance at a forum hosted by progressive activist group MoveOn, and speeches at the Democratic Convention, could offer a glimpse of just how heated the fight for the Golden State is going to get. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"8iRqaX\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Bhg7Qf\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","url":"https://www.vox.com/2019/6/1/18645639/california-primary-2020-kamala-harris-joe-biden-bernie-sanders","published":"2019-06-01T12:10:00Z","guid":"https://www.vox.com/2019/6/1/18645639/california-primary-2020-kamala-harris-joe-biden-bernie-sanders"},{"title":"Rep.

But [for example,] antitrust. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"1aUNMA\"\u003eThere was this older view of the antitrust that ... if there’s one big firm in a sector, that’s probably a monopoly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"JrOVNd\"\u003eBut a law and economics angle would say, “Well, no. You can’t infer just because there’s one large firm that there’s market power. That firm might be really worried about the threat of potential entrants!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ubhJXq\"\u003eAnd so that means you can’t say that just because there’s one firm in a sector, there’s necessarily the exercise of monopoly power, because it could be that that monopolist is being disciplined by the threat of entry. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"g3kDxm\"\u003eAnd so the idea is that previous cases that argued that big firms were obviously monopolies were misguided because they didn’t account for the threat of potential entry. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"vffe2L\"\u003eDylan Matthews\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"uO1OiK\"\u003eYou had some really eye-popping examples in the paper about pollution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"LoVtln\"\u003eSuresh Naidu\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"BKkrP5\"\u003eYeah, and it kind of reveals ... sometimes when you take economics too literally, it leads you into kind of very sociopathic ways of thinking about things. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"1MdGEk\"\u003eWe have quotes from Armen Alchian, who said, “Give me a capsule that will magically clean all the air in Los Angeles. ... Beg me to crush it. ... I won’t crush the capsule. Because if I do, poor blacks will have to pay $20 a month more for land rental. ... The black in Watts, already used to living with bad air, loses his discount for doing that.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"EanP8h\"\u003eAnd that’s just this idea that if you clean up the pollution, more people will want to live there and that will drive up the housing prices, making the people that are already used to pollution worse off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"P1lwEV\"\u003eI think that’s the kind of reasoning you’ll find in a lot of what the Manne teachers were teaching, as well as, “Here’s why a lot of regulation by the EPA [Environmental Protection Agency] might not be the most efficient way of reducing environmental damages … and maybe people don’t value environmental damage that much anyway.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"ekCTmq\"\u003eDylan Matthews\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"VrtyqR\"\u003eThere’s a section in the paper where you talk about how [Goetz] had an argument that it can be rational to punish black defendants more than white defendants for the same crime. Where does that come from?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"g9NEeH\"\u003eSuresh Naidu\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"X6PClm\"\u003eAlongside the ideas about antitrust and regulation, there also comes this idea of thinking about crime as something that can be a rational decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"P6Ky6r\"\u003eFor a while, people thought that criminals were like social deviants or psychologically disturbed, and what economics brings to that is, “Nope, criminals are rational like everybody else, and they’re making decisions based on considering costs and benefits.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"6UXI2g\"\u003eWhat that means is that part of the object of sentencing and punishment should be altering the calculus of crime. And one of the values of being harsh in sentencing, for example, is that you deter future criminals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"LcEHiS\"\u003eDefinitely the skew of the instruction runs toward the conservative side of the economics profession at the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"2l2Kng\"\u003eOut of, say, two weeks of lectures, there’s one lecture by [liberal economist Paul] Samuelson but there’s, like, five by Alchian and five by Goetz, and then there’s one lecture by [liberal] Ashenfelter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"nA6qeu\"\u003eAnd when you read the testimonials of some participants, it was often the case that Paul Samuelson would dispense stock trading advice and Orly Ashenfelter would talk about wine, but the real meat of the program was broadly coming from like the more conservative faculty on the program. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"bB5SUA\"\u003eDylan Matthews\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"B6FmZq\"\u003eDo you have a sense of why people like Samuelson or Ashenfelter participated in it, then?

And that’s part of why it’s successful. And you can imagine from the point of view of economics as a profession, we just love the idea that our tools can get applied in ever-increasing contexts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"Na1pZk\"\u003eDylan Matthews\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"wOLpgk\"\u003eWas it just Republican appointees and people inclined to these ideas anyway who were going to these?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"oKH4LN\"\u003eSuresh Naidu\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"kJhEwy\"\u003eIt’s certainly not the case that it’s only Republican appointees that are going. In fact, some of the biggest praise of the program comes from Democratic appointees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"TreKfE\"\u003eThe beloved Ruth Bader Ginsburg is in fact a big fan of this program, and talks about it quite favorably afterward. About the intensity of the instruction being as hot the Florida sun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"OabhBP\"\u003eSome of our results find that the effects of this program are larger for the Democratic appointees than the Republican ones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"gnnDU3\"\u003eDylan Matthews\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"uyFWop\"\u003eLet’s go to the results section of your paper.

That’s the first time ever that kind of an economics diagram gets used in a court opinion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"wPH6b8\"\u003eBut then, in terms of actual outcomes, what we see is that they also start voting more conservatively on economic cases. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"9fiuMR\"\u003eWhat we look at is whether or not you find against the EPA or NLRB [National Labor Relations Board, the federal union regulator] in a case where one of those is the plaintiff. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"vddjVh\"\u003eAnd we find that you’re less likely to find in favor of the federal regulatory agency after you attend the Manne program.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"yDNv2Y\"\u003eDylan Matthews\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"uIUBGO\"\u003eAnd you also found some results for criminal cases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"vygwEm\"\u003eSuresh Naidu\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"pA6r9Z\"\u003eWe went to look more at the district courts, because the district courts are where sentencing for criminal cases happens. We looked at the effects of attending Manne seminars on the average length of sentence given. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"CKA0AT\"\u003eAnd what’s important about all of this is that we’re really taking advantage of the fact that the judicial docket is randomized, so that nothing about the kind of case you’re getting as a judge is associated with whether or not you went to the Manne program.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"IXcEUy\"\u003eSo that means by just looking at the effect of going to Manne on the average sentence length of the case, we kind of know that that’s not due to some weird characteristics about those cases that those judges are facing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"n57qDU\"\u003eAnd we find that after you go to the Manne program, you give longer criminal sentences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"y5y45D\"\u003eDylan Matthews\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"gE3sYq\"\u003eYou also estimate what having Milton Friedman as a teacher does to these judges.

conclusion of \u003ca href=\"https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/sola/advpub/0/advpub_15A-002/_pdf/-char/ja\"\u003ea report released last week\u003c/a\u003e, as the country battles yet another record-breaking heatwave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe July 2018 heatwave, which killed 1,032 people, saw temperatures reach 41.1C (106F), the highest temperature ever recorded in the country. Torrential rains also triggered landslides and the worst flooding in decades.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePenned by the Meteorological Society of Japan, the study is the first to establish that some aspects of the international heatwave could not have occurred in the absence of global warming. Scientists reached this conclusion by employing a technique known as event attribution (EA).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe relatively new method, lead author Yukkiko Imada told Climate Home News, sought to pin down the causality of climate change in the heatwave by simulating 18 climate scenarios with and without the current 1C global warming above pre-industrial levels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey found a one in five chance of the heatwave occurring in the current climate, but almost no chance of in a climate unchanged by human activity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImada described the findings as “really surprising.” “For more than 5 years, we have been studying several extreme events… using the EA strategy,” Imada said. “But in most cases, we could express the results like ‘the likelihood of the event increased by X times due to the human-induced climate change.’ That is, the probability rarely becomes ‘zero’ even under the non-warming climate [scenario].”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe study shows it was “essentially impossible” for a heatwave that devastating to happen under natural conditions, Nicholas Leach, a researcher in climate attribution at Oxford University, told CHN.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Climate change is happening and it’s happening more and more quickly, at least in the past decade,” he said. “You would expect that from the fact that it is still warming to start seeing more of these papers.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBorn in the early 2000s, the field of \u003ca href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/mapped-how-climate-change-affects-extreme-weather-around-the-world\"\u003e“extreme weather attribution,”\u003c/a\u003e of which the study is part, has grown in the past years, with 230 peer-reviewed studies on record in March.  It tracks the human fingerprint of climate change on extreme weather events such as droughts, heatwaves, floods, and storms. Though the field will usually conclude that the likelihood of an event has been multiplied by climate change, papers categorically linking an event to the climate crisis are not unheard of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack in December 2018, \u003ca href=\"http://www.ametsoc.net/eee/2017a/ch20_EEEof2017_Perkins.pdf\"\u003ea study of the 2017/18 heatwave\u003c/a\u003e in the Tasman Sea concluded the “overall intensity of the 2017/18 Tasman [heatwave] was virtually impossible without anthropogenic forcing”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn Sunday, temperatures hit a new record of 39.5C on the \u003ca href=\"https://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/record-heat-turns-deadly-in-japan-on-sunday-relief-to-arrive-on-tuesday/70008369\"\u003eisland of Hokkaido\u003c/a\u003e, according to the Meteorological Society of Japan.

Rockefeller—launched an ambitious program to help cities around the world adapt to the physical, social, and economic challenges of the 21st century. Known as \u003ca href=\"http://100resilientcities.org/\"\u003e100 Resilient Cities\u003c/a\u003e, the initiative was designed largely to address challenges of urban population growth and the increasing threat posed by climate change. More than 80 “Chief Resilience Officers” were hired and trained to work within city governments, and more than $160 million was spent to kickstart projects of all shapes and sizes. Planners designed schoolyards that remain \u003ca href=\"https://www.100resilientcities.org/projects/paris-oasis-schoolyards/\"\u003ecool during heat waves\u003c/a\u003e in Paris, \u003ca href=\"https://www.100resilientcities.org/projects/proctor-creek-greenway/\"\u003erestored urban wetlands\u003c/a\u003e in Atlanta, and harnessed the power of the Yaque, the Dominican Republic’s longest river, to \u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/urban-resilience-prospectus-latin-america-and-the/santiago-de-los-caballeros-dominican-republic-r%2525C3%2525ADo-yaque-1ffb0ad2d160\"\u003emitigate flooding\u003c/a\u003e in Santiago De Los Caballeros, among other projects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cities that received funds from the Rockefeller Foundation initiative represented \u003ca href=\"https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/our-work/initiatives/100-resilient-cities/\"\u003emore than 20 percent of the world’s urban population\u003c/a\u003e. So it came as a shock when the foundation announced last month that 100 Resilient Cities would be closing up shop by the end of 2019. The foundation gave little warning or explanation, leaving planners, policymakers, and community organizers to question its rationale. And for people like me, who have worked in both the research and practice of resilient city planning, it raised serious questions about the wisdom of relying on charitable organizations to fund resilience work—particularly those that were chiefly responsible for the problems to begin with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor groups that—like the Rockefeller Foundation—owe their wealth to the production and sale of fossil fuels, climate change initiatives can walk a fine line between charity and public relations. When ExxonMobil recently donated \u003ca href=\"https://www.africanews.com/2019/04/02/mozambique-malawi-zimbabwe-braced-for-cyclone-idai/\"\u003ean eyebrow-raising $300,000\u003c/a\u003e to aid Mozambique’s recovery from Cyclone Idai, Kenyan writer Shailja Patel aptly pointed out that the sum represented \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/shailjapatel/status/1108786133654298625\"\u003eless than seven minutes of the company’s 2018 profits.\u003c/a\u003e It’s difficult to congratulate a corporation for a contribution of that size following \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/19/world/africa/cyclone-idai-mozambique.html\"\u003ewhat’s being called\u003c/a\u003e one of the worst disasters to strike the Southern Hemisphere—a disaster that was compounded when Mozambique was hit by an even stronger storm, Cyclone Kenneth, just one month later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then there’s the question of who gets help. In many ways, the work of building resilient cities is less about protecting the environment than it is a recognition of the fact that we have made the environment increasingly dangerous for ourselves—exponentially so for the most marginalized members of our society. Can we count on private organizations to treat those marginalized communities with the same level of importance as they do the rich?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRecent history suggests the answer is no. Take, for example, \u003ca href=\"http://www.rebuildbydesign.org/our-work/all-proposals/winning-projects/big-u\"\u003ethe Big U\u003c/a\u003e, a plan to protect New York’s Lower Manhattan from floodwaters and storms that won $335 million of initial funding in a Rockefeller Foundation-supported design competition. The project’s developers tout its potential to protect 95,000 low-income, elderly, and disabled residents—including those who live in public housing near the waterfront on the Lower East Side. But the fact that this plan is part of a larger proposal that encompasses the city\u0026#8217;s $500 billion business sector was surely a factor in the choice to protect it over other flood-prone areas populated by poorer, marginalized communities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother drawback of relying on charitable giving to combat climate change is that, as we saw with 100 Resilient Cities, there’s nothing to stop an organization from abandoning its resilience efforts whenever its incentives or financial picture changes. They don’t have to explain themselves, and they are rarely held accountable to the communities they serve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m not sure that we can jettison the charitable model entirely, but we can improve it. This will require a cultural and perspective shift. For starters, we must stop patting companies on the back for giving pennies when, at the same time, they make massive profits from activities that contribute to the problem. Environmental and climate justice activists \u003ca href=\"https://www.democracynow.org/2018/2/26/six_months_after_harvey_environmental_justice\"\u003ehave criticized\u003c/a\u003e the City of Houston for appointing former Shell Oil president \u003ca href=\"https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/2018/11/28/313365/houstons-harvey-recovery-czar-steps-down/\"\u003eMarvin Odum\u003c/a\u003e to his position directing recovery efforts after Hurricane Harvey. Activists opted to question the petroleum giant’s role in the disaster, rather than allow it to take credit for the recovery by way of a largely symbolic leadership role. Odum \u003ca href=\"https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Houston-s-Harvey-recovery-czar-stepping-down-13427858.php\"\u003estepped down\u003c/a\u003e from his role after 15 months.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCitizens should also feel entitled to demand real contributions to climate change adaptation from fossil fuel companies and the political leaders who take money from them. That means attending planning meetings, budget hearings, public forums, and town halls to remind leaders that they shouldn’t overlook the needs of communities of marginalized people—many of them people of color—in the “sunken places” of low-lying, flood-prone areas across the globe. It means following and improving upon \u003ca href=\"https://coastalresiliencecenter.unc.edu/2017/02/coastal-resilience-center-hmdrri/\"\u003emodels set by places like North Carolina\u003c/a\u003e, where the state dedicated money and resources to help small and low-capacity towns think through issues of resilient planning in the wake of hurricane disaster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for city, state, and federal leaders, they’ll have to put their money where their mouths are and dedicate sustained budgets toward mitigating the impacts of climate change, particularly for people of color and the poor. That may mean rethinking how fossil fuel companies are taxed—from the federal to the municipal level—and strengthening the requirements that companies must meet to do business in these communities. In other words, the good faith gestures of private companies should be codified into formal, long-term budgetary commitments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the shuttering of 100 Resilient Cities teaches us anything, it’s that the stakes of climate change are too high for us to rely on the generosity of large oil family foundations guided by vague missions of improving society. Granted, the Rockefeller Foundation hasn’t wholly abandoned the work of building more resilient cities: The foundation will channel some of the funding from 100 Resilient Cities to other offices within and outside the Foundation, including to a new, smaller Resilience Office and to The Atlantic Council, an international affairs think tank. Nonetheless, communities in 100 cities across the globe are facing the prospect of serious setbacks because a single organization chose to close up shop. We have the ability, the right, and the responsibility to demand more from the companies who helped create this climate crisis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis article was originally published on \u003ca href=\"https://undark.org\"\u003eUndark\u003c/a\u003e.

In the words of a protagonist in \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/wVDtmouV9kM\"\u003ethe trailer for the 2019 movie\u003c/a\u003e, “Our world is changing.

But like all living organisms, the earth has unleashed a fever to fight this infection”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere lies an important trait of Godzilla’s. As the scientist Dr Serizawa says in the 2014 Hollywood movie simply titled \u003ca href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0831387/?ref_=nv_sr_1?ref_=nv_sr_1\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eGodzilla\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e: “we may not have created this monster.

It threatens humanity, although it sometimes incidentally helps humanity avert a larger threat (such as the Smog Monster) or Godzilla’s archenemy, Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster. But even when Godzilla and humanity share a common goal, it is not that Godzilla takes our side or that we make Godzilla “our pet,” as it is put in the 2019 trailer. Instead, \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/KDnKuFtdc7A?t=82\"\u003eDr Serizawa\u003c/a\u003e observes, “we would be his.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWherever Godzilla appears, the triviality of humanity’s accomplishments and defences are made plain.

In this way, Godzilla echoes Bateson and Bateson’s Eco: it “is of no avail to tell [Eco] that the offense was only a small one, that you are sorry and that you won’t do it again.” Every one of our misdeeds against the world irrevocably rebounds against us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn reality, the impacts of our vandalism or thoughtlessness can remain in out-of-sight lands or \u003ca href=\"https://theconversation.com/theres-no-garbage-patch-in-the-southern-indian-ocean-so-where-does-all-the-rubbish-go-114439\"\u003eimmense garbage patches in our oceans\u003c/a\u003e, or be \u003ca href=\"https://theconversation.com/society-actually-does-want-policies-that-benefit-future-generations-69481\"\u003eborne in the future\u003c/a\u003e.

In 2016, it outpaced California as the home for feature film productions.

In this case, the divide is not even centered on the morality of the abortion bill (though that tension must exist too), but instead on how best to respond to it. Employees fighting the same cause must grapple with an old question: Is disengagement the right answer?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eA nascent movement\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNearly 40% of American workers could be called “employee activists,” according to \u003ca href=\"https://www.webershandwick.com/news/employee-activism-age-of-purpose/\"\u003ea new report by the communications firm Weber Shandwick, \u003c/a\u003ewhich defined the term as \u0026#8220;people who have spoken up to support and/or criticize their employer’s actions over a controversial societal issue.\u0026#8221; The survey found widespread support, across generations, for the right to voice dissent at work, but noted that nearly half of millennial employees fit the employee activist label themselves, compared to a third of Gen-Xers and only 27% of baby boomers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMillennials were also most likely to say they believe “employees can make a greater impact on the world than business leaders can,” suggesting that, yes, employee activism is on the rise for demographic reasons alone. But employees are not naive, either: 79% said they feel advocating for an employer to change a policy can put their jobs at risk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClearly, employee activism is far more complicated than consumer boycotts or other forms of collective action. Even once a person accepts the personal risk of joining a collective action at work, they may still risk offending colleagues who don\u0026#8217;t share in their outrage, or worse, putting someone else’s security and income on the line, when that someone may sit down the hall or come face-to-face with them at the next all-hands staff meeting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver decades, community organizers have developed processes for building consensus and rallying the troops, making sure all voices feel heard. Employee activism, however, isn’t there yet, and what\u0026#8217;s unfolding in Georgia suggests it\u0026#8217;s still a wild west; we can likely expect a few minefields in future. \u0026#8220;It seems that there will need to be more art and science to how and when you respond [to employee protests], and part of that will be based on data and what do our employees think and feel,\u0026#8221; says Samuelson.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;This is going to get more complicated,\u0026#8221; she adds, \u0026#8220;not less so.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://qz.com/work/1632657/georgia-abortion-bill-disneys-boycott-threat-and-the-problem-with-employee-activism/","published":"2019-06-01T11:45:16Z","guid":"https://qz.com/1632657//"},{"title":"May was a great month for haven assets—and bitcoin","content":"\u003cimg width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/RTX67L8R-1-e1559395120631.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;w=1024\" class=\"attachment-medium_10 size-medium_10 wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" /\u003e\u003cp\u003eFinancial traders had plenty to fret about in May.

In excellent recent news, the House has passed the Equality Act, which would protect LGBTQ people from discrimination in their places of work, homes, schools, and other public accommodations. The next step is that the bill will go before the Senate. I\u0026rsquo;ve decided to kick off Pride Month by writing a letter to one of my senators to explain how strongly I feel that the Equality Act should be passed. I urge you to write to your senators too. I\u0026rsquo;ll be looking for your letters by searching the hashtag #lettertomysenator. While there\u0026rsquo;s no information yet as to when the Equality Act will go before the Senate for a vote, we do know this: Politicians need votes to stay in office. Votes come from the people. Pressure from massive amounts of people is a major way to push politicians towards positive change. That\u0026rsquo;s why I\u0026rsquo;ve created a petition at change.org to urge the Senate to support the Equality Act.  Our country\u0026rsquo;s lack of protection for its own citizens ensures that LGBTQ people must live in fear that their lives could be turned upside down by an employer or landlord who is homophobic or transphobic. The fact that, legally, some people are completely at the mercy of the hatred and bigotry of others is disgusting and unacceptable.

and investors are unhappy with the Securities and Exchange Commission’s uncertain approach to the sector, saying the agency is killing innovation and driving companies from the US. Now the Canadian social media company Kik—backed by prominent voices in the crypto world—is stepping up its effort to use the courts to force the SEC’s hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn Tuesday, Kik announced a \u003ca href=\"https://www.defendcrypto.org/\"\u003ecrowdfunding effort\u003c/a\u003e to help it fight the SEC over the company’s 2017 initial coin offering, in which it sold nearly $100 million worth of a token it called kin. The company says it sold a currency that could be used across a network of apps, whether to get paid for taking surveys or to buy new stickers and themes. The SEC disagrees, arguing in a \u003ca href=\"https://www.kin.org/wells_response.pdf\"\u003eproposed action\u003c/a\u003e last November that kin are securities—investments subject to strict rules about how they can be sold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKik’s fight has drawn interest from major investors and cryptocurrency exchanges such as Circle, that are hoping for changes in how tokens are regulated. By drawing the SEC into a legal battle, Kik and its backers are hoping the courts will devise rules that would impact a wide array of crypto companies. The catch?

Why? They take a human captured on a standard 2D camera and turn that into a moving 3D skeleton that can be augmented in a digital world. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn a few minutes after you upload a video of yourself, or someone you captured dancing, up to RADiCAL\u0026#8217;s servers, you get back a 3D model.

We get that we couldn\u0026#8217;t even keep our jobs if we didn\u0026#8217;t wear glasses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThese corrective lenses in the form of glasses turn the world from blurry to sharp. From unreadable to readable. From headache inducing to beautiful. Yes, those of us who wear glasses would rather not wear them either, if that was an option, but it isn’t. Without them life would simply suck and, yes, we’ve looked at all alternatives, from surgery to contacts. Glasses are simply better for many of us who have eyes that need optical correction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePeople who wear glasses are already augmenting their world around them. Without them we can’t see the words on the screen in front of us as we type. Everytime we put on our glasses, the real world gets noticeably better. We can’t imagine living life without our glasses. Soon we won’t be able to imagine living life without devices that not just correct our vision but add new virtual and augmented reality capabilities to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThey won’t stop at augmenting our eyes, either, Bose already has wearable devices (they look like glasses, but don’t really do much for your eyes, it’s rather your ears they focused on) that augment our hearing and there are tons of haptic devices being developed that augment our ability to feel, touch and other things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn labs we’ve been visiting we’ve seen Spatial Computing glasses that are coming that will augment the world around even more. We call them fourth paradigm devices because they are the fourth paradigm that the personal computing era has brought us. More on the four paradigms in a bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe have already seen some devices like Google Glass that gave us a taste of how they would improve the world, even while introducing new problems, deepest amongst them was that they didn’t provide enough benefit to offset the real social costs of wearing a computing device and the weight that a computer put on our face. The small monitor that Google Glass showed us is tiny and not impressive at all when compared to devices that are coming on the market in 2020.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe fact that we can now state you will be fired for not wearing these new devices introduces yet even more social problems: there will be those who resist and resent those who wear these new devices. New cultural divides will appear. New privacy challenges, amongst others. That said, those who resist wearing will be putting themselves at a huge disadvantage to those who do wear the glasses. Given enough time we can see pretty much everyone will jump on board here, but the Amish prove that some people will resist new technologies. That said, most of you will probably not choose to live life like the Amish do, driving horse and buggy and resisting most smartphones and all the benefits computing brings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are new optics coming. The ones we are seeing in labs can literally remove light from the air before those photons arrive at your eyes. Will be useful in turning the sky dark, for instance, or replacing objects or people in front of you with virtual replacements and avatars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThese new optics and wearable screens, coming by 2022, along with the smaller computers that will drive them, will bring us all into a 3D world that few can imagine today. This shift in technology and how we view the world will be the biggest shift in technology in human history and will change literally everything we know about the way the real world works and the industries humans run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe know we won’t be able to get jobs without them. Just like an Uber or Lyft driver would be unable to get jobs if she refused to carry a modern smartphone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf we didn’t wear our corrective lenses/glasses there is no way we could write a book, drive a car, see notes up on screens, or even throw ball with our kids. It is why we answer that if you don’t wear the Spatial Computing glasses of the future you will lose your job and your ability to participate in modern society. Those who wear glasses will simply be able to out perform those who refuse to wear glasses and the difference in performance will be so huge that it will be like if we don’t wear the optical correction lenses we currently wear. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eYes, we hear those who say “but the real world is awesome enough, after all how can you make something like Yosemite even more beautiful?” Along with the cruder rejection of glasses “I hate glasses and will never wear them.” Those who wear glasses already know both statements are ridiculous, because we are already seeing a much more beautiful world with our old glasses and we already are forced to wear them. Even in beautiful places like Yosemite National Park.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe agree that the real world is pretty beautiful and humans have evolved over millions of years to sense the real world and the analog wave of photons that reflect off of surfaces around us. Our eyes are remarkable sensors that haven’t yet been matched by even the most expensive cameras, although cameras are also about to get much better and smaller (LG’s team that builds the cameras in your iPhones or built into a Tesla told us that in a few years they will be). Our human eyes can see in low light, in high contrast situations, in rapidly changing conditions, and in the glare of sunlight on white snow, all without seemingly much challenge where cameras in smartphones still can’t match the light collecting abilities of our eyes and retinas that turn that light into signals our brains can interpret. We are jealous of those who have eyes that can see this world perfectly but our wearing glasses is soon to turn the tables: those of you who have perfect eyes for seeing the real world will have to start wearing glasses and many will resist. This resistance will give those of us who already wear glasses a major advantage: we are ready for the move to 3D computing, er, Spatial Computing, already.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe difference between the real world, which we sense by collecting analog waves of photons and sound, and the digital world, is quickly shrinking and this is significant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo understand this gap, let’s go back to rock star Neil Young’s studio. Listening to his music recorded in analog format is the most enjoyable. Why? It’s a smooth wave that he and his audio engineer captured on tape. You know this to be true if you have ever listened to music on a vinyl record. That’s analog. A small needle rides in a groove in the vinyl as it spins around, moving the needle back and forth as smoothly as the singer or musician sang or played. When you compare to what you hear on your phone, which arrives as streams of numbers, there is a slight difference. The vinyl is more enjoyable. You can hear more detail in the highs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo why didn’t we stick with vinyl if it’s so much better to listen to? Well, some do, but most of us use Spotify, Apple Music, or Youtube, to listen to music now. Why? Well, digital is a lot more convenient. Plus, vinyl can’t work while commuting to work in a subway or a car or in a plane while traveling the world. For the music industry distributing music on vinyl is much more difficult. On Spotify and other services there are millions of songs to search and instantly play. To do that on vinyl would require a huge library of albums, something that even radio stations can’t afford to do anymore, and then you’d have to either be a skilled librarian or pay someone to organize all those albums. Plus, on some of the digital services these songs come with lyrics, and on others they come with music videos that are impossible to encode using analog techniques.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eDigital wins, except in the rarest of cases. It is too inconvenient, too expensive, to distribute or listen to, analog. Even Young admits this and brought to the market a device, the Pono, to let us listen to much higher quality digital music. We were in his studio to understand that the gap between digital and analog was shrinking because of that and become computers and wireless networks were getting so fast that we could listen to much higher resolution digital music that got close to the original analog master.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eA similar win will happen as we move to an augmented world that Spatial Computing brings. Oh, and this augmented world will arrive with several different approaches, the first, virtual reality (AKA “VR”), shows you a completely digital, er, virtual, world that you can move around in. If you haven’t experienced VR yet you should make a commitment to getting into a VR headset for a few hours. Those who haven’t experienced VR for a few hours will have a tough time understanding why we are so adamant that the world is about to deeply change. Already there is a spectrum of devices that let you see everything from a completely virtual world (VR) to virtual items put on top of, or replacing, the real world (AR, Augmented Reality). Some devices you wear will be more focused on letting you see some of the real world. Others will be more focused on higher resolution and wrap-around screens for enjoying a mostly virtual one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis is why, instead of calling these things VR or AR glasses, we just lump them all into Spatial Computing, which is computing that you, a robot, or a virtual being can move around in. Spatial Computing includes all the devices that do VR and AR, along with other things like autonomous cars (they move around the real world and use very similar computer technology to see, process, and navigate around the real world as our VR or AR devices do) and cameras that help computers “see” the real world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSpatial Computing devices were developed for military purposes for decades (the F35 pilots are forced to wear them simply to fly that plane), brings a dramatically different kind of user experience to bear than, say, Microsoft Windows, designed to be used on flat screens on a desk or a laptop, or even from smartphones that run Android or iOS, which also are designed for flat screens that you can touch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn Spatial Computing you can move around a virtual world and with controllers you can touch, manipulate, shoot, and otherwise use your hands in a way that is closer to the real world than other computing types. It also lets you look around a 3D world that completely surrounds you. Some people denigrated early efforts, like the VR headsets that HTC and Oculus produced, as a fad, comparing it to the Segway or earlier 3DTV attempts. These denigrations show they really didn’t understand how deeply VR technology changes how we interact with computers. We saw that in our houses as kids came over, found our VR headset and controllers, and without instruction were able to start up experiences like Job Simulator, and do things like move files that looked like real-world files from file cabinet to cabinet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eDoing similar things on our Apple II’s back in the late 1970s took hours of learning commands to type into the computer. In VR a four-year-old did it within seconds without any instructions. These observations, both anecdotally, and in research labs shows why Spatial Computing will eventually bring computing to billions of new people who have never considered owning a smartphone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you visit Jeremy Bailenson’s VR lab at Stanford University, like Mark Zuckerberg did before acquiring Oculus, which was an early consumer VR producer, you’ll learn a lot of the magic that VR brings to bear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHis lab is a simple looking room with some VR headsets hanging on the wall. Yeah, he has an expensive audio system built into the floor, and he does use that to great effect in some of his research. On the day we visited he asked us to walk across a virtual plank while wearing one of those headsets. We had been expecting this since we had seen the same demo on YouTube and watched as people freaked out, unable to walk across the plank. Their minds had fooled them into thinking they were on a plank above a big abyss. Their eyes had fooled them into thinking they might fall to their deaths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe were going to be braver and smarter than that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo, when he started us out on the plank we thought we would just remember we were walking on a conference room floor and that there was nothing to be afraid of. What we hadn’t expected is that the floor would shake due to that big audio system under the floor. Our minds freaked out. Certain death seemed imminent even though our rational brain remembered it just was a regular floor we were walking on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis, and other demos, where he embodied us into both children and homeless people, show us that VR is doing something to our brains that other mediums like TV, radio, or flat video screens couldn’t even touch. He then explained how this embodiment worked to fool our brains. When you are wearing a VR headset you are “immersed” into what the software developer built for you to experience in your headset. Your brain buys into this immersion and thinks it’s the real world. This immersive effect is so powerful that you instantly start flying like a bird if you look down and see your arms have become wings. This ability to embody other people, or animals is powerful. We saw dozens of people fly like birds while experiencing one of Chris Milk’s creations at the Sundance Film Festival in 2017. They all started flapping their arms and flying within half a second of being put into a bird’s form.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn VR you will experience vertigo, or the fear of heights that you probably have, the same way where it’s uncomfortable to look down off of a cliff’s edge in Yosemite. Your brain interprets the virtual and the analog the same: as a threat to your safety. We have seen people throw off VR headsets because what they are viewing is so uncomfortable. We tell you this not to scare you off of trying VR but to explain its power to so completely fool your brain into thinking what it is seeing is real. Even if it’s not real at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor the past few years Bailenson and his students have been doing research around this embodiment effect, studying whether this can lead to greater empathy for other people’s experiences and even the environment itself. His team found that it does, indeed, have a strong empathy-forming effect. People who were taken on a virtual scuba dive to see how carbon emissions are affecting the oceans came away with changed opinions on that and, in other research, where people were put into the view of a black child, changed their understanding of racism.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBailenson also told us about some of the other magic of Spatial Computing. For one, it can so completely fool the brain that it can take away pain even amongst those who suffer from horrible burns on their skin. He told us about research into pain that VR pioneer Tom Furness, and his teams at the University of Washington, had done. Furness stumbled onto this discovery after dentists started buying early Spatial Computing headsets after they discovered that patients didn’t feel as much pain when they were wearing these headsets. He, and his students, did more research into this and found that Spatial Computing, in particular, VR, by distracting your brain away from pain, is better than morphine at taking away the pain burn victims feel. They do this by playing a snowball throwing game on a snowfield and their research is on the Web at \u003ca href=\"http://vrpain.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://vrpain.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe 3D thinking that Spatial Computing brings to us lets us see our world and ourselves quite differently and its ability to change our brains will be built upon by the fourth paradigm glasses of the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo, how will you get fired if you refuse to put the glasses on? Well, we can imagine one morning your boss brings in a set and has bought a data visualization tool to help your team walk around factory floors in a new way. For instance, BadVR’s Suzanne Borders builds such tools that we discussed in the first chapter. Won’t you look ridiculous if everyone else puts the glasses on and is walking around the factory floor with them and you are standing there telling everyone else on your team “I refuse to wear those glasses.” Yeah, and if you soon don’t join in you will be at a significant disadvantage to everyone else on the team.

I also wondered what they brought to the table beyond their cash. But before we get there, let me explain a little more about what Overtime does.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFounded in late 2016 by \u003ca href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/person/dan-porter\"\u003eDan Porter\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/person/zachary-weiner-2\"\u003eWeiner\u003c/a\u003e, the Brooklyn company has raised \u003ca href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organizations/funding_total/overtime\"\u003ea total of $35.3 million\u003c/a\u003e. The pair founded the company after observing “how larger, legacy media companies, such as ESPN, were struggling” with \u003ca href=\"https://adage.com/article/media/nba-millennials-commissioner-adam-silver/316858\"\u003eattracting the younger viewer\u003c/a\u003e who was tuning into the TV less and less “and consuming sports in a fundamentally different way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo they created Overtime, which features about 25 to 30 sports-related shows across several platforms (which include YouTube, Snapchat, Instagram, \u003ca class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"facebook\"\u003eFacebook, \u003cspan class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e TikTok, Twitter and Twitch) aimed at millennials and the Gen Z generation. Weiner estimates the company’s programs get more than 600 million video views every month.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn terms of attracting NBA investors, Weiner told me each situation was a little different, but with one common theme: “All of them were fans of Overtime before we even met them…They saw what we were doing as the new wave of sports media and wanted to get involved. We didn’t have to have 10 meetings for them to understand what we were doing. This is the world they live and breathe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo how is having NBA players as investors helping the company grow? Well, for one, they can open a lot of doors, noted Weiner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“NBA players are very powerful people and investors,” he said. “They’ve helped us make connections in music, fashion and all things tangential to sports. Some have created content with us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition, their social clout has helped with exposure. Their posting or commenting on Instagram gives the company credibility, Weiner said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Also just, in general, getting their perspectives and opinions,” he added. “A lot of our content is based on working with athletes, so they understand what athletes want and are interested in being a part of.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s not just sports-related startups that are attracting the interest of NBA players. I also talked with \u003ca href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/person/hussein-fazal\"\u003eHussein Fazal\u003c/a\u003e, the CEO of \u003ca href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/snaptravel#section-events\"\u003eSnapTravel\u003c/a\u003e, which recently closed a $21.2 million \u003ca href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/snaptravel-series-a--edb938b8\"\u003eSeries A\u003c/a\u003e that included participation from \u003ca href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/telstra-ventures\"\u003eTelstra Ventures\u003c/a\u003e and Golden State Warriors point guard \u003ca href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/person/stephen-curry\"\u003eStephen Curry\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFounded in 2016, Toronto-based \u003ca class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/snaptravel\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"snaptravel\"\u003eSnapTravel \u003cspan class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e offers online hotel booking services over SMS, Facebook \u003ca class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/messenger\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"messenger\"\u003eMessenger, \u003cspan class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e Alexa, Google Home and Slack. It’s driven more than $100 million in sales, according to Fazal, and is seeing its revenue grow about 35% quarter over quarter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike Weiner, Fazal told me that Curry’s being active on social media about SnapTravel helped draw positive attention and “add a lot of legitimacy” to his company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you’re an end-consumer about to spend $1,000 on a hotel booking, you might be a little hesitant about trusting a newer brand like ours,” he said. “But if they go to our home page and see our investors, that holds some weight in the eyes of the public, and helps show we’re not a fly-by-night company.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother way Curry’s involvement has helped SnapTravel is in terms of the recruitment and retainment of employees. Curry once spent hours at the office, meeting with employees and doing a Q\u0026amp;A.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was really cool,” Fazal said. “And it helps us stand out from other startups when hiring.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegardless of who wins the series, it’s clear that startups with NBA investors on their team have a competitive advantage.

The company is today pushing that reputation up into a higher price, quality, and resolution bracket with the announcement of $4,000 \u003ca href=\"https://na.panasonic.com/us/news/panasonic-lumix-develops-new-lumix-s1h\"\u003ethe Lumix S1H\u003c/a\u003e, a full-frame shooter capable of recording 6K video at 24fps. It’s a fresh iteration of the Lumix S1, which made its \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/29/17916606/panasonic-lumix-s1r-hands-on-photos-photokina-2018\"\u003edebut at Photokina last year\u003c/a\u003e and which I’ve recently tried and been delighted by.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"A1ruZB\"\u003eThe upcoming Lumix S1H, scheduled to launch in the fall, comes with the claim of being the world’s first full-frame camera to do 6K/24p at a 3:2 aspect ratio or 5.9K/30p at 16:9. Aside from being cool in its own right, this bump in resolution capability should be a big help for people shooting 4K too, as it will allow them to crop in or apply video stabilization without losing image quality as they otherwise would. Downsampling to 4K will also be an option, which sounds preposterous to even think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"W8joWP\"\u003ePanasonic touts a wide dynamic range of 14+ stops in the Lumix S1H, which should help it capture detail even in extremely dark or bright sections of a scene. The company hasn’t specified if the S1H will have in-body image stabilization like the S1 and the high-resolution S1R, but that can probably be considered a likely inclusion for a camera designed specifically for video capture. Also important for video shooters: the S1H has no recording time limits, so you’ll be constrained only by your memory card’s capacity and the camera’s battery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"OVOs01\"\u003eThough the $4,000 price makes the Panasonic Lumix S1H strictly professional equipment, it’s still a positive surprise for many who might have expected a camera of this kind to be closer to $6,000 (which would have been a neat match for the 6K resolution). My experience with the Lumix S1, which I used to photograph \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/3/18292853/beats-powerbeats-pro-true-wireless-earbuds-announced-airpods\"\u003ethe Powerbeats Pro\u003c/a\u003e, has been exceedingly good, with fast performance, luscious bokeh, and incredible ease of use for such a bulky and otherwise intimidating thing. If the Lumix S1H keeps that going and extends it into the video realm, Panasonic will have another winner on its hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"Yg3iNk\"\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.2493%;\"\u003e\u003ciframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gT2B_DUEbiw?rel=0\" style=\"border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/31/18648057/panasonic-lumix-s1h-price-release-date-specs","published":"2019-06-01T01:28:57Z","guid":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/31/18648057/panasonic-lumix-s1h-price-release-date-specs"},{"title":"DJI’s most advanced drone yet comes with its own van and film crew","content":"\u003cimg alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CD6LEasrk0arx8MXm_vohZw3QHY=/74x0:1690x1077/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/63931399/dji_storm_studio_screenshot.0.jpg\" /\u003e\n\n\n\n  \u003cp id=\"uJMuTQ\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/1/23/16923472/dji-mavic-air-specs-product-line-4k\"\u003eDJI is the leading name in drones\u003c/a\u003e, and we’ve liked their prosumer \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/26/18519255/dji-deny-discontinue-drone-phantom-4-5-mavic-2-pro\"\u003ePhantom\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/6/17826384/dji-mavic-2-pro-zoom-drone-review-specs-price\"\u003eMavic lines\u003c/a\u003e quite a bit — but it looks like the company has also quietly built a professional cinematography drone that’s so high-end, it’s not even for sale.

For years, Trump has slammed companies across a number of industries for outsourcing manufacturing jobs to other countries, like when he famously shamed heating, ventilating and air conditioning manufacturer Carrier for trying to move production to \u003ca href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/carrier-manufacturing-factory-morale-low-trump-jobs-c539ce84bc0c/\"\u003eMexico during the 2016 presidential campaign\u003c/a\u003e.

GM, for instance, is a popular target for him. The automaker announced in late 2014 that it planned to invest $5 billion in Mexico over the next six years, even though it already had \u003ca href=\"https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/2015/08/12/trump-autos/31589899/\"\u003efour complexes with 14 manufacturing facilities\u003c/a\u003e in the country.

Trump fumed, and has spent the intervening months sparring publicly and privately with GM CEO Mary Barra about the closures. In May, Trump touted the “GREAT NEWS” that GM was in talks to sell one of the plants, but it turned out the potential buyer is a startup that is \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/8/18537225/gm-factory-workhorse-ev-electric-vehicle-startup-sale-trump-tweet\"\u003ein serious financial distress\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-float-left c-float-hang\"\u003e\u003caside id=\"PwACPh\"\u003e\u003cq\u003eTrump has fought with automakers about where they build cars since before the election\u003c/q\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"dNdTwI\"\u003eGM is not Trump’s only target. In April 2016, Ford announced plans to spend $1.6 billion to build a factory in Mexico where it would make small cars like the Fiesta and the Focus. It had also previously announced a separate plan to invest $2.5 billion in new engine and transmission manufacturing facilities in the country. Trump’s reaction in June 2016 was to threaten Ford with \u003ca href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-gm-idUSKCN0YT2V4\"\u003ea 35 percent tax on its Mexican exports\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"VrH3iY\"\u003eTrump continued to criticize Ford’s Mexico plan even after he became president.

The average selling price of cars in the US is near all-time highs, thanks largely to the increased popularity of SUVs and trucks, which tend to cost more.

It quickly picked up speed, however, when the team started realizing how important FaceTime was to a generation of kids, developer Daniel Greenberg tells \u003cem\u003eThe Verge\u003c/em\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"eHQ2eK\"\u003e“Millennials are all about texting,” Greenberg says of the now-aging generation being supplanted by current teenagers. “Everyone my age and younger is always FaceTiming.

(Comparatively, I am 27 years old, and taught my mother to text so I could avoid any kind of vocal communication.) \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"02gsQH\"\u003eThe popularity of video calls is representative of a generational divide, but it’s also heavily influenced by how Gen Z musicians, influencers, and celebrities treat apps like Instagram and Snapchat. Artists like Post Malone or the late Lil Peep would often start a random Instagram live stream multiple times a week to have conversations with fans, instead of publishing a carefully curated post or photo caption. The former is more raw and real, the latter more superficial and traditional. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"NlZNad\"\u003eTeenagers have become used to talking with their friends face-to-face (via a rectangular phone), and now experiencing their favorite influencers the same way. FlexTime leans into that desire by allowing people to create the illusion for friends and strangers that they’re a part of this world and engaging with their favorite artists and celebrities similarly. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"B0RkCC\"\u003eIt’s a two-way street, according to Greenberg. People who download the app want to be able to trick their friends or create funny videos, but influencers are also seeing the benefit. Five Instagram and YouTube influencers — \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/kushpapi_/?hl=en\"\u003eKushPapi,\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjALGqcF7JQMlXRpI3T5ntw\"\u003eMilan Mirabella\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/minijakepaul/?hl=en\"\u003eTydus Talbott\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI7IxRdZIn9G0cOUwiozhjw\"\u003eBryce Hall\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/joeybirlem/?hl=en\"\u003eJoey Birlem\u003c/a\u003e — are working with FlexTime to create individual landing pages where fans can use exclusive simulated FaceTime conversations. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"qROl3C\"\u003eAll five influencers have more than 10 million followers and subscribers combined across various platforms. Their careers are \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/19/18629183/tati-westbrook-james-charles-youtube-fans-drama\"\u003edependent on an active and engaged fan base\u003c/a\u003e, and this is one way to \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/17/17832948/youtube-youtubers-influencer-creator-fans-subscribers-friends-celebrities\"\u003emaintain an active parasocial relationship, in which fans feel a non-reciprocated level of intimacy with a creator or celebrity\u003c/a\u003e.

Greenberg said the team thought about how the tool could be used by bad actors during the year-long development cycle. He told \u003cem\u003eThe Verge \u003c/em\u003ethat their team “scouted the audio carefully” to make sure that it couldn’t harm a celebrity or influencer’s reputation if, say, someone wanted to maliciously edit together a misleading quote using real-life audio. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"9ncBmo\"\u003e“Let’s say that we had a video of a celebrity not saying anything, but just nodding their head in agreement,” Greenberg said. “In that case, someone could make a video saying something incredibly racist and having the celebrity nod to imply they agree. We thought of that, and made sure none of the videos fell into that category. We’ve thought of every way this could go wrong and acted against it.” It’s likely, however, that if the app gains popularity, some users will indeed find ways to abuse the system; FlexTime’s development team can’t have foreseen \u003cem\u003eeverything\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"oJpsUM\"\u003eFlexTime is available now. A \u003ca href=\"https://flextime.co/?ref=producthunt\"\u003ebrowser version exists\u003c/a\u003e for anyone to use, but people can’t directly share their recordings. A mobile version also exists via a third-party app called Monkey. It allows people to share their recordings directly to Instagram or Twitter. There are about 25 celebrities to choose from in the browser version, and close to 40 in the mobile app. Greenberg is hopeful more celebrities and influencers will be added soon.

For eight years, the secret program was run by this man, Lue Elizondo.” The camera then pans to a visual of the former military intelligence case officer in a darkened house peering out warily through half-drawn window shades.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s an odd scene. Is Elizondo on the lookout for aliens or a bad guy from his old spook life? Either way, the History Channel show, which premiered on Friday and is being promoted as “groundbreaking nonfiction,” goes on to follow Elizondo as he re-investigates strange UFO incidents he says he learned of when he was at the Pentagon running the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, known as AATIP. It’s as if Agent Mulder had handed off his X-Files to another paranoid government agent, this one with a pug face and billy-goat beard. In the screener I saw for “Unidentified,” the narrator says that Elizondo quit the Pentagon because he was “frustrated by what he says was a cover-up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhatever the truth about otherworldly UFOs (cue a collective eye-roll from scientists), there is one crucial detail missing from “Unidentified,” as well as from all the many stories that have quoted Elizondo since he outed himself nearly two years ago to a wide-eyed news media: There is no discernible evidence that he ever worked for a government UFO program, much less led one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, AATIP existed, and it “did pursue research and investigation into unidentified aerial phenomena,” Pentagon spokesperson Christopher Sherwood told me. However, he added: “Mr. Elizondo had no responsibilities with regard to the AATIP program while he worked in OUSDI [the Office of Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence], up until the time he resigned effective 10/4/2017.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat directly contradicts an email sent by a spokesperson for To The Stars Academy of Arts \u0026amp; Science, a UFO research and entertainment company that Elizondo joined after he left the Defense Department.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class='stylized pull-left'data-shortcode-type='pullquote' data-pull='left'\u003eThere is no discernible evidence that Luis Elizondo ever worked for a government UFO program, much less led one.\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003ca href=\"https://www.theblackvault.com/documentarchive/navigating-the-twisted-maze-of-the-aatip-timeline/\"\u003eemail\u003c/a\u003e was sent over a year ago by Kari DeLonge, a public relations representative for To the Stars, to John Greenewald, a UFO researcher who runs an online archive of Freedom of Information Act-obtained government documents on a website called the Black Vault. At the time, Greenewald had become frustrated at the lack of tangible information about AATIP and Elizondo’s role; additionally, Elizondo had spurned Greenewald’s interview requests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreenewald told me that he had asked DeLonge specifically where Elizondo worked within the Department of Defense when he ran AATIP.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hi John \u0026#8211; Thanks for reaching out,” DeLonge wrote. “The program was initially run out of [the Defense Intelligence Agency] but when Lue took it over in 2010 as Director, he ran it out of the Office for the Secretary of Defense (OSD) under the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence (USDI). Hope that clarifies.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried contacting Elizondo multiple times via email and his cellphone. He has not responded. It’s not as if he is on retreat somewhere; I noticed that in the run-up to his star turn on the new History Channel show, he has been speaking to everyone from \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/26/us/politics/ufo-sightings-navy-pilots.html\"\u003ethe New York Times\u003c/a\u003e to \u003ca href=\"https://www.coasttocoastam.com/show/2019/05/26\"\u003eUFO media personalities\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://www.wearethemighty.com/entertainment/interview-with-agent-luis-elizondo\"\u003emilitary bloggers\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIndeed, judging by all the UFO stories lighting up the internet this week, the self-described “\u003ca href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/2018/09/28/do-aliens-exist-blink-182-co-founder-ex-pentagon-official-prove-we-are-not-1129299.html\"\u003ecareer spy\u003c/a\u003e” is having another big moment in the media spotlight.

Since the company’s inception, certain members of its “elite team,” including Elizondo, have appeared frequently in the news media.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis week is a prime example.

And what is the technology behind these devices that we are observing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMellon, like Elizondo, works for To the Stars (his title, according to the company’s website, is national security affairs adviser). \u0026#8220;Fox \u0026amp; Friends\u0026#8221; neglected to mention this connection, along with the fact that the History Channel show was made by the company Elizondo and Mellon work for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m not surprised.

Elizondo confirmed to me earlier this year that he is, in fact, working as a government contractor, “but it’s not what you think it is,” he said.

They don’t have a way to go on a show like this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s worth noting that, several years before DeLonge took on this momentous communications assignment, he created a website called Strange Times that was essentially a clearinghouse for UFO news and conspiracies. “Think of it as a \u003ca href=\"https://dyingscene.com/news/tom-delonge-debuts-strange-times-website-to-monitor-ufoconspiracy-theory-activity/\"\u003eHuffington Post for the tin-foil-helmet wearing crowd\u003c/a\u003e,” wrote one music blogger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomehow, we are to believe that this is the mindset with which staid former members of the military and intelligence community sought to join forces. But perhaps there’s a more innocent answer.

When you dis-establish an organization, there’s a paper trail. You won’t find one for this program.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome dubious, unofficial documents \u003ca href=\"https://www.lasvegasnow.com/news/exclusive-i-team-obtains-some-key-documents-related-to-pentagon-ufo-study/1324250087\"\u003eleaked out\u003c/a\u003e to George Knapp, a Las Vegas TV journalist who, for decades, has been a fixture in the UFO media orbit. Knapp has been a vocal defender of Elizondo and DeLonge for the past two years, pushing back on critics who have raised thorny questions about To the Stars. Knapp also purchased stock in the company, something he has not always revealed to readers and viewers in his reporting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn an email to The Intercept, Knapp acknowledged buying 400 shares of the academy\u0026#8217;s stock in 2018, “not as an investment, but as a way to support their fledgling company and their work.” He wrote that he had “made that information public” and “informed” his employer” at KLAS-TV in Las Vegas. Knapp also said that he put the shares in a trust that “would be donated to a charity.” He believes that transaction has been completed and that he now owns “zero stock” in the company, he wrote.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs it happens, Knapp also appeared in the first episode of “Unidentified,” lauding DeLonge for his “unprecedented” efforts in advancing the UFO issue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother fixture in the UFO orbit is John Greenewald, the FOIA researcher and a sort of antithesis to Knapp. Initially enthusiastic about To the Stars, Greenewald became increasingly skeptical when he was unable to verify many of Elizondo’s claims about the government’s UFO program through FOIA requests and conversations with Pentagon representatives. So last year, Greenewald reached out to To the Stars spokesperson Kari DeLonge (Tom’s sister) for more information about Elizondo’s involvement in AATIP.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"shortcode\" data-shortcode=\"newsletter\" data-campaign=\"\" data-cta=\"\" data-headline=\"\" data-layout=\"\" data-subhead=\"\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI mentioned Kari DeLonge’s response — about Elizondo having taken over AATIP and run it “out of the Office for the Secretary of Defense (OSD) under the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence (USDI)” — to Sherwood, the Pentagon spokesperson who had told me unequivocally that Elizondo \u0026#8220;had no responsibilities with regard to the AATIP program while he worked in OUSDI.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI then asked Sherwood how he knew that Elizondo hadn’t worked for AATIP during his time with the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, where he was based from 2008 until his retirement in 2017. Sherwood said he’d spoken with OUSDI leadership, including individuals who are “still there” from the time when Elizondo started working in the office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe Elizondo was running AATIP under the purview of another office or agency within the Department of Defense? Sherwood acknowledged that Elizondo “worked for other organizations in DoD.” But that, too, would have contradicted Kari DeLonge’s statement to Greenewald.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKari DeLonge did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt bears noting that, although Elizondo has made a point of providing various documents to reporters (including me) to establish his bona fides, he does not appear to have supplied any materials that validate his connection to the government UFO program he insists he led. No memorandums, no emails discussing deliverables or findings, and no paperwork addressed to or from him that connects him to AATIP.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe documents he has provided include recent annual Defense Department performance evaluations and his October 4, 2017 resignation letter to then-Defense Secretary James Mattis, which bears the apparent seal of the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense. In the letter, Elizondo alludes to internal opposition at the Pentagon to investigate UFOs that he wrote had menaced Navy Pilots and posed an “existential threat to our national security.” He was leaving, he strongly implied in his letter, because the Pentagon wasn’t taking that threat seriously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe letter does not mention AATIP or Elizondo’s role as its director.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cu\u003eIn “Unidentified,” Politico’s\u003c/u\u003e Bender describes Elizondo as “in many ways, an enigma. Here is a guy who spent decades in the intelligence community.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat much appears to be true. Elizondo retired as an official at the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence. A public records search also reveals a series of home addresses for Elizondo over the last two decades that are close to intelligence facilities in Toa Baja, Puerto Rico (the site of an unacknowledged government surveillance program called \u0026#8220;Echelon\u0026#8221;) and in Grovetown, Georgia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Being from Georgia, I can assure you, there is no reason anyone in their right mind would live in Grovetown unless they were working at Fort Gordon, home of the Army’s principle signals intelligence units and school,” \u003ca href=\"https://www.lttimmcmillan.com/\"\u003eTim McMillan\u003c/a\u003e, who, like Greenewald, has a longtime interest in UFOs but has  come to doubt Elizondo’s involvement with any government UFO program.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2017, when Elizondo outed himself to the Times, he was portrayed as a reluctant whistleblower and \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/18/insider/secret-pentagon-ufo-program.html\"\u003ea little paranoid\u003c/a\u003e. The three reporters who shared bylines on the story, including freelancer Leslie Kean (who wrote in 2016 that she was “\u003ca href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/is-there-a-ufo-coverup-a_b_9865184\"\u003eprivileged to welcome\u003c/a\u003e” Chris Mellon into the UFO organization to which she belonged) met Elizondo in a “nondescript Washington hotel where he sat with his back to the wall, keeping an eye on the door.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the Times’s podcast, “\u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/18/podcasts/the-daily/ufo-pentagon-program.html\"\u003eThe Daily\u003c/a\u003e,” Helene Cooper, the newspaper’s Pentagon correspondent, described Elizondo as a “spooky, secretive guy” but added that he was “completely credible.” He showed her documents, pictures, and military videos of potential UFOs, which appeared fantastic to her, but also persuasive. “I did believe him,” Cooper said on the podcast. “It seemed completely credible to me in the moment.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater on, after she left the hotel room, Cooper acknowledged that doubts crept in.

The measure also required the Texas comptroller’s office to compile a blacklist of companies supporting the boycott of Israel. In April, Texas divested $72 million of stock from DNB ASA, a financial services group that put a handful of Israeli companies on a list of companies it wouldn’t invest in because of involvement in human rights violations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn March of this year, the office added vacation rental website Airbnb to the blacklist after the company decided to remove listings from illegal Israeli settlers, who were profiting from land taken from Palestinians.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe decision to blacklist Airbnb had immediate impact. The University of Texas said no employee could use state funds to rent on Airbnb. Abbott similarly ordered that no public worker use Airbnb. Then, in April, Airbnb reversed the decision to remove its listings in Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, and in May was taken off the Texas comptroller’s list.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The decision to stand up for human rights should have been applauded by state lawmakers,” said Meera Shah, a senior staff attorney at Palestine Legal, a group that defends the speech rights of Palestinian rights advocates. “Instead, they elected to punish the company and force its hand and force it to walk back that decision.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe American Civil Liberties Union and the Council on American-Islamic Relations filed a lawsuit challenging the law in 2018. Their plaintiffs included Obi Dennar, a former University of Texas at Austin student who was asked to sign a no-boycott pledge as part of his work moderating high school debates; George Hale, the host of the popular crime podcast “Buried,” who was forced to sign the clause or forgo working on the show; and \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/12/17/israel-texas-anti-bds-law/\"\u003eBahia Amawi\u003c/a\u003e, a Palestinian American children’s speech pathologist who was forced to end nine years of work in public schools when she refused to sign the pledge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I had to choose between continuing to express my support for Palestinian rights and the commitments I had made to sources as a journalist,” said Hale, who ended up signing the contract but made a clear note of his disagreement in the margins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"shortcode\" data-shortcode=\"newsletter\" data-campaign=\"\" data-cta=\"\" data-headline=\"\" data-layout=\"\" data-subhead=\"\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn April 2019, a federal judge sided with the plaintiffs, \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/04/26/in-case-brought-by-school-speech-pathologist-texas-federal-court-becomes-the-third-to-strike-down-pro-israel-oath-as-unconstitutional/\"\u003eblocking the anti-BDS law\u003c/a\u003e and issuing a scathing decision that blasted Texas lawmakers for passing a law “intended not to combat discrimination on the basis of national origin, but to silence speech with which Texas disagrees.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut instead of backing down, Texas is continuing to crack down on boycott advocates. Two weeks after the judge’s decision, Abbott signed House Bill 793, a law amending the original bill to exclude individual contractors and narrow the law’s focus to companies with state contracts over $100,000.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCivil liberties experts say this law remains unconstitutional, though it may pave the way for Texas to get the current ACLU and CAIR lawsuit against the original bill dismissed because the amended law no longer applies to the plaintiffs.

And so my struggle, which I am sure is also regularly your struggle, began. In almost every developed nation in the world, 12 people being killed in a mass shooting would make that incident the deadliest in years. In some nations it would be the deadliest ever. But in the United States, they happen so often, with such ferocity and carnage, that when we learn about the next one, we hardly skip a beat. Indeed, 2018 \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/12/10/18134232/gun-violence-schools-mass-shootings\"\u003ewas by far the most violent year ever measured for school shootings\u003c/a\u003e in the United States and 2017 \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/18/us/gun-deaths.html\"\u003ewas the deadliest year in at least a half-century for gun deaths altogether\u003c/a\u003e in this country – with an astounding 40,000 people killed by guns. That’s 110 people per day. We couldn’t keep up if tried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter seeing the news of his latest mass shooting, I wanted to somehow relay the fact that 12 people were just murdered to my wife without actually saying the specific words in front of our kids. “Oh no. 12 people,” I said to her – not speaking in a complete sentence. “Virginia Beach,” I continued. I know my kids are aware of gun violence and mass shootings, but it just seemed like too much in that moment to say in front of them something like, “12 people were just shot to death.” Between the seriousness of my tone and the six words that I assembled for her about the shooting, she knew exactly what I was trying to relay to her without the kids quite catching on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were happy. And we were pulling up to a fun restaurant in Brooklyn. And so I used the strange skill that none of us should have, but all of us use almost every day. Somewhere deep in my mind I tucked the thought of that horrific shooting in Virginia Beach away. I compartmentalized it \u0026#8212; boxed it up and closed the door to the memory so that I could be emotionally present during dinner, so that I could listen to the kid’s stories about their day at school, and excitedly order from the menu with the family. And I did it. I moved on in that moment so that I could enjoy the taste of Vietnamese food. And while I ate dinner, as I reflect back on it, I don’t think I once thought again of the victims in Virginia Beach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s the game we play. To get through dinner, to get through a movie or a game, to get through quality time with our loved ones, we must temporarily suspend our knowledge that people are being slaughtered all around us. We speak of the Wild Wild West as some nostalgic era of the past, but we’re living it. The United States is the only nation in the world that has more guns than people. And it shows. Americans are shooting and killing themselves and killing others with guns at a pace that should be treated as a dire National Emergency. If we just enacted a fraction of the basic standards and norms held by the rest of the world, our nation would be so much safer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn New Zealand, after 51 men, women, and children were shot to death earlier this year while gathered for prayers in their local mosques, the nation, in a matter of just a few days, made radical shifts in their gun laws – banning assault rifles and so much more. And that urgency is just what the United States needs, but I am afraid we’ve crossed some invisible threshold, given up after burying so many thoughts of so many shootings and so much violence \u0026#8212; so that we can just have dinner in peace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe post \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/06/01/mass-shootings-dinner-and-the-cognitive-dissonance-of-just-living-in-america/\"\u003eMass shootings, dinner, and the cognitive dissonance of just living in America\u003c/a\u003e appeared first on \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com\"\u003eThe Intercept\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://theintercept.com/2019/06/01/mass-shootings-dinner-and-the-cognitive-dissonance-of-just-living-in-america/","published":"2019-06-01T13:58:33Z","guid":"https://theintercept.com/?p=252670"},{"title":"O extremismo é um projeto global","content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eEste texto foi publicado originalmente na newsletter do Intercept Brasil.

Se liguem no que rolou na Itália.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePano de fundo: Matteo Salvini, ministro do Interior (espécie de Casa Civil do país), é o premier de fato. Ele faz parte da Lega Nord, um partido que faz populismo com racismo e xenofobia, demonizando “comunistas” e minorias em geral. Seu principal projeto: uma lei chamada \u0026#8220;Decreto Sicurezza\u0026#8221;, espécie de \u0026#8220;lei anti-crime\u0026#8221; do Moro.

Soa familiar? Salvini, depois, voltou atrás, e disse que a punição era “exagero”. Sim, soa familiar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuem mais vem perseguindo professores e alunos, chegando ao ponto de expelir uma universidade para fora do país? Viktor Orbán, o Bolsonaro da Hungria.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSalvini, Bolsonaro e Orbán são políticos da nova onda de populismo de extrema direita. Não é coincidência que seus inimigos sejam os mesmos: professores (e jornalistas, \u0026#8220;o comunismo\u0026#8221;, George Soros etc). Todos estão seguindo um manual extremamente previsível de anti-iluminismo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eO projeto é criar novas oligarquias, destruir as instituições públicas e privadas e substituí-las por suas próprias instituições e amigos.

been more tormented by him than the United Kingdom, to which he will make a state visit next week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver the past two and a half years, the president has interfered in the U.K.’s domestic politics. He has repeatedly undermined its national security with his comments and actions after terrorist attacks in Britain. He has bullied and humiliated the prime minister, Theresa May. He has accused British intelligence agencies of spying on him, even after he promised not to do so. Trump has taken a predatory approach in trade talks, seeking to squeeze controversial concessions out of London at a moment of weakness, even at the risk of sabotaging the prime minister’s Brexit deal. He refused to listen to the British government on vital issues of shared concern, like Iran and climate change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe special relationship is arguably at its lowest point since the Suez Crisis of 1956, when President Eisenhower pulled the rug out from underneath Britain and France’s attempt to retake the Suez Canal.

Such a deal would include provisions on chicken and access to the National Health Service that would almost certainly not make it through the House of Commons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Trump administration castigated the British in public for their reluctance to sever ties with the Chinese technology firm Huawei, but was very slow to present evidence that Huawei posed a security risk and to work with the British on the problem. Even those modest efforts failed spectacularly when the May government said it would move ahead with granting Huawei access to parts of the U.K. telecom network. The Brexiteers, supposedly Trump’s allies, look set to continue this policy if one of them succeeds May. For instance, Dominic Rabb, a leadership contender and the former Brexit secretary, \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM5rvBNw1Eg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003etold \u003c/a\u003ethe BBC he would abide by May’s decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe British also feel as if they have gotten nothing from the Trump administration on their key foreign-policy priorities, including climate change and Iran. Privately, British diplomats vent their frustration at the administration. Publicly, they have no interest in acknowledging there is a problem solely because they have so many other problems to deal with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe U.K. and the U.S. still have deep networks of cooperation on security and intelligence, but the lamentable state of the relationship under Trump will have lasting consequences. A no deal Brexit, which the United States is working toward, would badly damage Britain. The administration’s failed diplomacy on Huawei dramatically increases the China challenge in Europe. Trump’s constant interference, insults, and needling of senior British officials, including May, weakens the case for the alliance within Britain and could empower Jeremy Corbyn, the U.K.’s opposition leader and a longstanding critic of the United States.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe United States needs the U.K. It will have to do more than to keep the bust of Winston Churchill in the Oval Office. To preserve the alliance, it needs a very different approach. It should work with the U.K. on a trade deal that is compatible with the closest possible relationship with the EU 27 and preserves the Good Friday Agreement on Northern Ireland. It should devise trilateral structures to preserve security cooperation across the Atlantic. It should open a strategic dialogue with the U.K. on China and listen to Britain on Iran and climate change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNone of this will to happen in the foreseeable future.

She started sports with swimming at the age of 13. Later on, she tried different sports.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, she chose horseback combat sports as her specialized sport.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was offered to take up “shooting with air gun” as her sport, but she went to an equestrian club after a while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They told me you can win titles in this sport if you are brave. It was then when I began working with the bow and arrow as well,” she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe learned how to shoot with the bow and arrow very soon. She was good at horseback riding , too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, she soon managed to use both skills together and was able to shoot while on horseback.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2007, she took up combat sports on horseback professionally. Saeedeh says in this field, participants hold the bow the way Robin Hood would hold it. The traditional bow and arrow are used in two ways: on horseback and in open fields where shooters would hit targets at distances of 60, 100, 500 and 600 metres. Saeedeh became a member of the national team in this field. The national team included six men and one woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat woman was Saeedeh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSaeedeh says she always longed to compete with an American woman who was very strong, and it happened in South Korea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I finished second in those competitions, and that American woman came in third.

They believe Iranians are good at horse riding as they have a long history of this activity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that is why Saeedeh managed to become world champion in 2011.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So far, I’ve been the first Iranian woman to have won an international title in this sport,” she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2014 Contests in South Korea with Pregnant Horse\u003cbr /\u003e\nHowever, she failed to win any title in the 2014 South Korea competitions only because her horse was pregnant. Horses are generally given to contenders by the draw. She was unlucky to get that horse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Under the law, I was not allowed to beat a pregnant horse in order to make it go faster. Even if there were such a law, I myself wouldn’t have done that,” she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Moreover, a pregnant horse is very careful, so that she wouldn’t hit anywhere. Therefore, she moved very slowly and carefully. That’s why I couldn’t win any titles in those contests,” said Saeedeh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe International Martial Arts Federation is located in South Korea. Unlike other disciplines in which athletes have to wear special clothes, in this field, participants must wear traditional clothes in international contests in order to present a picture of their historical background and culture to other countries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn South Korea, countries are required to attend a seminar annually and introduce themselves in ten minutes and explain to the audience about the background of his sport in their countries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2014, it was Iran’s turn to introduce itself, and this responsibility was put on Saeedeh’s shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe says she is not bad at English. She says she was easily able to prove to everybody that these sports have their roots in Iran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was not a difficult job at all. Looks like everybody knew and admitted that Iran is the cradle of sports such as archery on horseback, spear and sword on horseback, and polo,” she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHorse Riding Cure for Depression\u003cbr /\u003e\nShe says she loves horses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In modern psychology, they use horse riding in many parts of the world to cure depression,” she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHorses are very similar to humans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There are stubborn horses which won’t change their mind.

Like humans, horses feel good one day, and bad another day,” she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Female horses are more cautious and obstinate; male ones are careless and not cautious.

However, this fake news was immediately published by Reuters, Voice of America and the French Radio to fan the flames of war against Iran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe coverage of a fake news by the American, European, Arabic and Persian-language media continued until Donald Trump explicitly announced the news of the deployment of 120,000 US troops to the region was false.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe monitoring of such news and information in the current situation clearly shows that there are active elements with a specific strategy in these media who are after turning these domestic and foreign news agencies into their own news station.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe management of information and media alerts is carried out in an organised way by the United States, Israel and the neighbouring countries of the region against Iran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis suggests that an intelligence unit opposed to regional security and the national interests of Iran and the United States, which considers itself to be a rival to the United States and the party which wants to overthrow the current ruling body of Iran, is carrying out destructive operations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe actions of terrorist militants in sabotage operations against UAE ships and Katyusha attack near the US embassy in Baghdad were steps to wage a war between Iran, the United States and the countries of the region; a war to lead to downfall of the Islamic Republic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe MKO terrorist organisation is the main culprit behind such actions. They are a militant and political group who teach suicide attacks, and in the past they have committed self-immolation, and even held demonstrations in front of international bodies to disrupt Iran\u0026#8217;s relations with other countries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the moment, such events in the present situation in the region are used to create conflicts and unwanted battles between Iran, the United States and other countries of the region. They want to turn this region into a battlefield to topple the so-called “regime” of Iran to achieve their own interests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the Americans want to resolve their problems with Iran, first, it is better to resolve their problems with their international rivals without putting Iran in the middle of the story. Secondly, in order to better understand the conditions in Iran, it is necessary to close the file of such groups as the MKO. At the same time the Americans must look at them as a threat that challenge their security and intelligence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe MKO\u0026#8217;s sabotage, espionage, and intelligence services are not exclusive to Americans; they have done the same for states like France.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccordingly, it\u0026#8217;s enough for the Americans to read a little bit of history and recall how once they were the target of their number-one source of information:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEavesdropping at US embassy\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAssassination of US military personnel, such as Colonel Hawkins, Colonel Turner, Donald J.

They even asked for the interrogation of US embassy personnel in 1979. However, their request was turned down by the Revolution Council. The organisation also called for extradition of the Shah, cutting off of relations with US imperialism, stopping the export of oil to the United States, and abolishing all political-economic and military agreements with the United States. It also disclosed the CIA and SAVAK spy networks in Iran, and stressed that outright anti-authoritarian and anti-imperialist policy must be mentioned in the constitution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmericans should answer the following questions: why the MKO, which is currently playing the role of the intelligence agent of the B-Team, even after leaving Iran did not seek shelter in the US, and instead chose France as their command centre to launch campaign against the Islamic Republic?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon’t the Americans know the MKO has initiated an uninterrupted communication with representatives of the socialist and communist parties of Europe, at the same time, to secure their political life to find a way to gain power in Iran through the world powers?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHave the US authorities forgotten that when the MKO returned to France, Masoud Rajavi and other leaders of the organisation did not withdraw from their anti-American positions and uttered swearwords against US Ambassador William Sullivan who condemned the assassination of Ayatollah Beheshti?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHave the Americans been able to understand the root cause of the total change of organisation\u0026#8217;s approach towards Washington? Is it possible that the Americans have not understood the reality of the war between Iran and Iraq and the loss of the organisation\u0026#8217;s assassination machine in the Mersad Operation was the main reason for Masoud Rajavi change of mind and the MKO’s anti-imperialist and anti-American slogans?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the Americans read a little bit about Iran\u0026#8217;s recent history, it will be well known that the MKO, based on its mission in Europe, apparently put aside its leftist approach and became a friend of the United States. The organisation\u0026#8217;s strategy with this goal was launched and the new values of the organisation were announced by its leadership: “We as a revolutionary force benefited from the conflict between imperialism and the reactionary (Islamic Republic) to achieve power!\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe funny point was that the leadership of the organisation had already said to its members and sympathisers that the Islamic Republic should be destroyed to eliminate imperialism. But then argued that to destroy the Iranian ‘regime’ they must get help from imperialism!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough the Americans did not immediately accept the organisation’s change of approach, but eventually some Republican senators, who had good connections with the French Social Democrats, propagated this argument that \u0026#8220;the enemy of my enemy is my friend,\u0026#8221; and therefore the MKO, which was on the list of US terrorist groups, was supported and used by Americans as one of its service providers. The presence of figures such as John Bolton and Rudy Giuliani at the annual MKO conferences was in line with such a policy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe MKO, by paying money to people like Bolton and Giuliani, is making inroads in the US Congress and State Department, spreading Iranophobia by fabricating news. They are also trying to impose themselves on Americans as a powerful, efficient organisation and an alternative to the Islamic Republic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUndoubtedly, the ruling administration of the United States, especially the White House, is subject to great deception. This great deception can be seen from the very moment that the organisation and Maryam Rajavi condemned Trump\u0026#8217;s decision to relocate the US embassy to Jerusalem. The organisation\u0026#8217;s opposition to Trump’s decision was in line with France\u0026#8217;s interests, and perhaps this behaviour implies that the MKO still gets its main services from countries such as France, which, for historical reasons, still defines Palestine in its sphere of influence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Trump pays attention to the statements of Iran’s Leader on July 30, 2018, in which he named France and Britain as the parties receiving the organisation’s services, he will understand that the MKO terrorist organisation has provided more services for the US international rivals including French and European socialists rather than the US itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis may be enough to let Trump know that his foreign policy body with people like John Bolton is playing in MKO’s court.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe post \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ifpnews.com/exclusive/anti-iran-terrorists-making-inroads-into-us-lobby-groups/\"\u003eAnti-Iran Terrorists Making Inroads into US Lobby Groups\u003c/a\u003e appeared first on \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ifpnews.com\"\u003eIFP News\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://ifpnews.com/exclusive/anti-iran-terrorists-making-inroads-into-us-lobby-groups/","published":"2019-06-01T09:32:05Z","guid":"https://ifpnews.com/?p=142008"},{"title":"Iran FM Says He ‘Can Be in Riyadh Tomorrow’","content":"\u003cp\u003eMohammad Javad Zarif made the comment in an interview with the Iranian Arabic-language news network Al-Alam.

Trump said recently that Washington had no intention of getting involved in a military war with Iran, but that the US was involved in an economic war against Iran. That means the US government is targeting Iranian people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of our partners need to know this reality. The key issue is that the US government has broken the law, has imposed an illegal war [on the Iranian nation] and even tries to keep food and medicine from reaching Iran, and this should be stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was the message I had during my visit to countries in and out of the region.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIran Welcomes All Persian Gulf Countries with Open Arms\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAl-Alam: It seems that these trips will continue and you will visit other countries as well. What countries are you going to visit?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZarif: Our focus is on our neighbours. I have visited most neighbouring countries. The [Iranian] deputy foreign minister has also traveled to a number of neighbouring countries to the south of the Persian Gulf. A few neighbouring countries are left, which we will hopefully visit after the holy month of Ramadan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe welcome all Persian Gulf countries with open arms. Unfortunately, there are two or three Persian Gulf littoral countries which has chosen another path. We believe the path they have chosen is not an effective one, but a dangerous one, and it is most dangerous to them themselves. We have never wished these countries ill.

Unfortunately, some people say the reason behind this proposal is the pressure that Iran is under. How are you dealing with this issue and with regional countries?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZarif: By God’s grace and thanks to the Islamic Republic of Iran’s prudent policies, Iran is at its maximum power in the region today, and we are not in a tough situation, and the reason behind the United States pressure on Iran is its concerns over Iran’s power in the region.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI first put forward the idea in an article in \u003cem\u003eAsharq al-Awsat\u003c/em\u003e newspaper where I proposed a dialogue with regional countries. We said our negotiations about the region should take place with regional countries, and at that time I announced that Iran is ready for talks with member states of the Persian Gulf Cooperation Council.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, it was Saudi Arabia which announced it had no intention of holding talks with Iran and that it would drag the war into Iran. Our friends in some countries have forgotten history and think these proposals have been put forward recently. I floated the idea of a non-aggression treaty in those very articles and I said a regional Persian Gulf dialogue forum can lead to the signing of a non-aggression accord.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUS Tone Sometimes Harsh, Sometimes Positive\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAl-Alam: As for mediation, it is said that some delegations have some to Tehran confidentially. Even it is said that there have been confidential contacts with European countries. Could you let us in on this mediation issue and the confidential or non-confidential contacts?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZarif: We follow a transparent foreign policy. Our logic is clear, too. We have said that we need no mediation. The US has waged an economic war against our people. When the Americans speak, they use a harsh tone one day and use more positive comments another day. But in our view, it is action that counts. Today, the US is involved in a very active economic ear against Iran. Washington even threatens individuals and warns them against having logical economic relations with Iran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot only does the US itself violate the UN Security Council resolution, but it also forces others to do so. This is the policy that the United States is pursuing today. This policy has to stop. This is a policy of bullying, a policy of imposition, a policy of economic terrorism against the Iranian people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePolicy of Threat Should Not Be Used against Any Nation\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAl-Alam: Have you seen any softening of tone or retreat on the part of the US?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZarif: In words, yes. But what determines our policy is action, not words. Their stances are also important. It is important that they talk to Iran with respect. But respect does not mean exerting economic pressure and waging an economic war. Respect should come on an equal footing. Economic war shows a policy of imposition and bullying, and this policy never works with regards to Iran. I said once that ‘Never threaten an Iranian.’ I’m still saying that the policy of threat should not be used against any country or people. As an Iranian, I’m saying that this policy does not work with regards to Iran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eU.S. Pursuing Ambiguous Policy\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAl-Alam: Trump constantly claims that he is ready for talks with Iranians and welcomes negotiations. He says he supports Iranian people and identifies with the Iranian nation. But on the other hand, he speaks of a destructive war against Iran and he has reinforced the US military equipment in the Kuwait region. How do you interpret his threat to take military action and claims of being prepared for talks?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZarif: Washington’s policy is marked by a show of willingness to talk. This is a problem. The second problem is the ambiguity of the policy adopted by the current US administration. Moreover, Trump is saying that he is interested in Iranian people, but puts pressure on Iranians by trying to prevent the sales of food and medicine and aircraft spare parts. The US does not even allow banking transactions to take place in this regard. Such and administration cannot claim that it identifies with Iranian people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe Talked to US; They Failed to Fulfill Commitments\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAl-Alam: When will you contact Trump? Is it possible that you might answer Trump’s phone call?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZarif: Any decision in that regard should be made by Iran’s high-ranking authorities. We believe the prerequisite to that there should be a point when holding talks. Holding talks has a point only when the other side remains committed to its obligations. We held talks with the US for months before. The Obama and Trump administrations both reneged on their commitments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEurope Not Abiding by JCPOA Provisions\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAl-Alam: The European countries insist that they remain committed to the Iran nuclear deal (JCPOA) and say they do not want to withdraw from the agreement. Why don’t they put pressure on the US?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZarif: Iran has remained committed to its obligations under the JCPOA. Europe has not complied with any of the terms of the agreement in practice. Ostensibly, it has, but not in practice. What Europe has to do is to implement the deal. The UN Security Council issued a resolution on the JCPOA. The resolution follows two objectives: guarantee the peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear program and guarantee the normalization of Iran’s economic relations with the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e‘Deal of Century’ Will Turn into ‘Bankruptcy of Century’\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAl-Alam: Regarding the current issues in the region, namely exerting economic pressure on Iran, military presence in the region, the problems that the region is facing today, and even the JCPOA which is discussed from a different perspective each time, do you think all these issues are aimed at implementing Trump’s deal (Deal of the Century)?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZarif: In my opinion, the final objective is to trample Palestinians’ rights underfoot. Whatever is known as the “Deal of the Century” will definitely turn into the “Bankruptcy of the Century” through people’s resistance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe post \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\"

Files Complaint against Int’l Airports Refusing to Fuel Aircraft","content":"\u003cp\u003eMorteza Dehghan, the vice president for Aeronautical and International Affairs at the Civil Aviation Organization of Iran (CAO), told reporters Saturday Iranian aircraft face fueling problems at some airports around the world due to unilateral US sanctions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said the sanctions violated international law and contradicted the humanitarian claims by the US and its allies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The sanctions are targeting the Iranian people who use these flight services.

Besides, her book “The Resonance of Inception,” is in the second printing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSMA is a progressive disease characterised by loss of lower motor neurons and progressive muscle wasting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSamira was eight months old when her family found out she was suffering from the disease. She is 29 now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe refer to Samira’s condition as a disability, but she used it as an opportunity to accomplish new things. She continued her studies, learned pottery and started painting. She still found enough time to publish her first book in the process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the occasion of the International Day of Disabled Persons, Shahrvand daily has conducted an interview with Ms. Alipour, who for many years has been struggling with SMA. Following are excerpts from this interview:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQ: At the age of 29, how much do you feel physical and emotional changes you go through?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA: Honestly, my mother says I had no apparent symptoms at the beginning, and most of the time I could not move my legs. Gradually, more specific symptoms of my disease were revealed. In the meantime, I was having trouble swallowing food, and my spinal disorder made my heart and lungs squeezed. In fact, throughout all these years, I constantly encountered unknown pains that I had to identify and cope with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQ: Apparently, you have a strong personality. Have you always been like this, or your condition required you to be so?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA: At first, I faced personality crisis. I constantly searched on different sites about my disease. With the information I learned about the SMA, I found out how serious it is. I told myself the more you become obsessed, the harder life gets for you. So, I decided not to think too much about my disease, and not to be afraid of it. I decided to go for the things I liked, such as writing, painting and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQ: Have you studied at university?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA: Yes, I was studying computer sciences, but unfortunately my dad passed away when I was a freshman and I had to quit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQ: An obvious feature of Samira Alipour is the wheelchair she sits on. Is this built specially for you, or SMA patients generally use this type of wheelchair?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA: Since my body has changed in shape, I could not sit on ordinary wheelchairs. That’s why I ordered the wheelchair to be able to do my social activities on it. Therefore, I ordered this model, and they built it for me. Although it’s hard to use this wheelchair, I still use it to go everywhere. I go to the movies, concerts, restaurants and I do all my social activities. My first concern was to be comfortable on my chair. This electric wheelchair has belts and shields that keep me on the seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQ: What role your social networking experience has played in your life?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA: Social networks are the voice of the voiceless. The same thing happened to me as well. I feel my followers on Instagram now see me as a person who has a lot of hope for life. For example, the first dubsmash I made was very well received and people were like how wonderful this girl is doing ordinary things. They even complimented my appearance. This gave me a very good feeling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQ: Tell us about your book. How did you manage to publish your diaries as a book?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA: I published my book without the help of any association or organisation. Even after my book was published, we decided to sell it online and I still get orders for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQ: What is your book about? Is it romance or is it something else?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA: A collection of my scribbles and poems. One day a publisher called me and said it’s a pity that you do not publish them. So, I decided to publish my scribbles and in fact my writings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQ: What are the things you have always looked forward to do?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA: I’ve always wanted to teach pottery. Or, for example, I practiced Photoshop for a couple of years, and I really wanted to work in an atelier. However, traveling was a serious challenge and therefore I had stayed out of work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQ: Today is the International Day of Persons with Disabilities. What do you have to say?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA: I believe that every day is my day. I hope only one day would not be a special day for people like me. As citizens, we do have some expectations that need to be regarded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe post \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ifpnews.com/exclusive/iranian-girl-proves-disability-is-not-obstacle-to-success/\"\u003eIranian Girl Proves Disability Is Not Obstacle to Success\u003c/a\u003e appeared first on \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ifpnews.com\"\u003eIFP News\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://ifpnews.com/exclusive/iranian-girl-proves-disability-is-not-obstacle-to-success/","published":"2019-06-01T14:53:21Z","guid":"https://ifpnews.com/?p=142083"},{"title":"Iraq to Convey Iran’s Proposal to Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain","content":"\u003cp\u003eIn an interview with ISNA, Saad Abdul Wahhab Jawad Qandeel said Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has proposed the idea of signing a regional non-aggression pact during his most recent trip to Iraq.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIraqi officials have welcomed the Iranian suggestion and has announced that they will convey the proposal to the Persian Gulf littoral countries, particularly those which have no relations with Iran, including Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, he added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ambassador then confirmed that Iraq is going to play the role of a mediator by relaying the Iranian message to Riyadh, Abu Dhabi and Manama.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsked whether Iraq has taken any practical measure in this regard so far, Qandeel said Iraqi President Barham Salih must have delivered the message to those three Arab countries during his trip to Saudi Arabia for participation in the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) summit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZarif had made the proposal for a non-aggression pact among the regional countries during a trip to Iraq in late May.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIraq’s ambassador to Moscow has announced earlier that Baghdad will support any initiative for de-escalation in the Persian Gulf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe post \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ifpnews.com/exclusive/iraq-to-convey-irans-proposal-to-saudis-arabia-uae-bahrain/\"\u003eIraq to Convey Iran’s Proposal to Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain\u003c/a\u003e appeared first on \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ifpnews.com\"\u003eIFP News\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://ifpnews.com/exclusive/iraq-to-convey-irans-proposal-to-saudis-arabia-uae-bahrain/","published":"2019-06-01T14:42:10Z","guid":"https://ifpnews.com/?p=142076"},{"title":"Math Student Develops Iranian Programming Language","content":"\u003cp\u003eSeyed Ali Mohammadiye, a student of mathematics at the University of Kashan, has been working on the programming language for 7 years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExplicating his achievement, Mohammadiye said his innovative language would enable the Iranian programmers to enjoy a fully homemade program that serves as the basic tool for computer systems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young researcher noted that he has applied for a patent for his software, saying modifications have been made to the original version of the programming language in recent years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Iranian programming language can be used for a direct and independent creation of software with a machine code’s language, which obviates the need for any additional languages, even an assembly language, he explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe achievement has won first prizes in a number of national scientific conferences inside Iran and has also received the award for “best homegrown product”, given by the presidential office’s department for science and technology, ISNA reported.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe post \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ifpnews.com/exclusive/math-student-develops-iranian-programming-language/\"\u003eMath Student Develops Iranian Programming Language\u003c/a\u003e appeared first on \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ifpnews.com\"\u003eIFP News\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://ifpnews.com/exclusive/math-student-develops-iranian-programming-language/","published":"2019-06-01T14:08:52Z","guid":"https://ifpnews.com/?p=142070"},{"title":"Envoy Reveals US Sponsorship of Anti-Iran Twitter Accounts","content":"\u003cp\u003eIn a Twitter message on Saturday, Hamid Baeidinejad revealed the US role in hostile cyber activities against Iran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The US Department of State has cut off financial supports for a Twitter account dedicated to the overthrow of Iranian establishment under pressure from public opinion,” the ambassador said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This Twitter account frequently hammered the authors who criticize the US sanctions as a violation of human rights.
