The tune would be customized for 210 countries, for every buying situation. It would be slightly different—but instantly recognizable—whether it punctuated the end of a commercial, graced the inside of the corporate elevator, or even noted a financial transaction on an \u003ca href=\"/fortune500/amazon-com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAmazon\u003c/a\u003e Alexa device.

We\u0026#8217;re currently in the midst of a voice computing revolution. At least 40% of Americans now own smart speakers in their homes, shopping and searching the web by voice. By 2020, we’ll see a quarter of a billion connected cars on the roads, according to Gartner Research, vehicles teeming with virtual assistant technology. And 63% of the “Internet of Things” consists of app-enabled devices like like smart dishwashers and thermostats. Every connected device has the opportunity to interact with consumers. “The world is going into voice interactions,\u0026#8221; says Rajamannar, \u0026#8220;and we as a brand couldn’t afford not to be there.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eNot the same ol\u0026#8217; tune\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSonic branding, audio logos, and jingles are not necessarily new. Almost everyone recognizes that \u003ca href=\"/fortune500/apple-3/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eApple\u003c/a\u003e hum when you power on a Mac, the iPhone’s familiar Marimba ringtone, and even Intel’s familiar three-note signature at the end of commercials. But the conversation about signature sounds is getting louder, and more nuanced, as consumers change how they interact with the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn recent months, more media and advertising agencies and publishers have begun jumping into the game. In the past, agency creative directors made most decisions about brand sounds and music. They might write a brief, gather tracks from artists and select a winner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut this summer, \u003ca rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"\" href=\"https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/Xpx-C4x2xGsBxERGKFOw00D?domain=mediapost.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eiHeartMedia and British advertising giant WPP\u003c/a\u003e created a partnership to create a new audio branding service. Also in June, music platform Pandora created a new sonic branding consultancy called Studio Resonate that builds on the company’s scientific approach to music—dissecting melody, rhythm and psychology to help brands appeal to consumers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026#8217;s a need for this expertise; today’s sonic strategy is far more complex. In the case of Mastercard, which released its sonic brand logo this spring, the process involved McCann advertising execs, plus teams of neurologists, psychologists, musicologists, composers and musicians. Rajamannar and his team analyzed 2,000 melodies to find a sound that could be adapted for backgrounds, trade shows, sponsorships, office music, ringtones, transaction alerts, and commercials. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eUnlike a jingle, which hits people over the head and is meant to be jarring and interruptive, this would be different: a Pavlovian-style background noise, a brand’s signature sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eSetting the tone\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe credit card company had a specific criterion for what qualified as the “perfect sound.” It had to be extremely simple and neutral—likable but not so fantastic that it’d be distracting. It had to be memorable and hummable and it had to fit within a broader brand identity strategy—which started in 2016, when the company dropped the Mastercard name from its logo. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe melody must be adjustable, depending on where you are located, giving the company a Mumbai version, for instance, or a Shanghai take. It had to be customizable based on what you were buying, giving a video game purchase at \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/fortune500/gamestop-302/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGameStop\u003c/a\u003e an 8-bit feel, perhaps, while a splurge at Tiffany \u0026amp; Co. would have a more luxurious tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMastercard\u0026#8217;s audio logo became a passion project for Rajamannar, who grew up in a family made up of musicians. Unlike making decisions about the creative for an ad, this sonic branding project required people with musical knowledge, people who had musical sensibilities and who could analyze the components of a song to say why specifically it worked or not. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“You couldn’t just say, ‘I don’t like it,’” Rajamannar says. \u0026#8220;I had to make sure I didn\u0026#8217;t get carried away with my own biases.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHe personally traveled to music studios around the world where he\u0026#8217;d brainstorm with artists on melodies. Sometimes, finding the right sound involved blending together bits and pieces of music from various artists. And doing that, of course, involved a delicate balance of managing creatives who sometimes got attached to their own work. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;It took a lot of patience,\u0026#8221; says Rajamannar, who personally listened to hundreds of melodies—so many at a time that his senses would get overwhelmed. He compared the process to smelling too many perfumes, one right after another. \u0026#8220;You have to take a break and clear your head.\u0026#8221; \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo ensure Mastercard\u0026#8217;s sound was unique, the company also hired musicologists who compared its compositions to a database of music, using artificial intelligence programs like the music app Shazam. Neuroscientists chimed in. So did famous composers and musicians, including Mike Shinoda, a singer-songwriter and founder of the band Linkin Park. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral times, Rajamannar thought he had a winning melody—and then discovered through research and focus groups that the sounds didn’t translate well to certain countries. In one case, it was the Middle East and in another case, a tune couldn’t be adapted to the high energy feel needed for the Latin American market. Says Rajamannar: “We scrapped it and went back to the drawing board.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eUltimately, Mastercard settled on 20 different versions with 220 renditions. “It was a tremendous amount of work to get something so simple,” says Pierre Lipton, global executive creative director for the New York ad agency McCann.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe 30-second song could be broken down into a 3-second subset. It would be played in Mastercard office elevators, at corporate speeches, at the ends of ads, and at the end of every transaction. The tune would be adjusted to be slightly different each time you heard it over and over at a \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/fortune500/walmart-1/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWalmart\u003c/a\u003e checkout line or at a train station in Taiwan.  Rajamannar compares it to ensuring the sound doesn’t sound like the repetitive sound of a squawking crow, but instead birds chirping that blends into background.  “It couldn’t be annoying,” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eBehind the music\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhy all the fuss over a few musical notes? The answer, essentially, is science. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s well understood that sound has long been a powerful vehicle for behavior and perception. Auditory neural pathways are less complex than their visual counterpart, which means people react to sound 10 to 100 times faster than sight. In other words, the brain is literally wired to react to sound and categorize it. So whether it’s the sound of a snake or the wind in the grass, your ears will likely know it before your eyes do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eResearch also shows that music can affect our behavior, our purchases, and even our perception of flavor, scent and texture, says Steve Keller, Pandora’s new sonic strategy director. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor instance, one study by the U.K.\u0026#8217;s University of Leicester looked at how music impacted sales in a wine shop. On days that traditional French music was played, 77% of the wine sold was French, and on the days traditional German music played, 73% of the wine sold was German. Few shoppers even noticed the connection: Only 1 out of 44 customers who answered questions at checkout spontaneously mentioned that the music was the reason behind their selection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition, sound can cause chemicals to be released in our brains, producing physiological effects.

This isn’t an account of just the restaurant itself but a history of fine dining over the past 150 years, rooted in the emergence of New York’s restaurant culture, following the ebbs and flows of the city’s own tumultuous history over the second half of the 20th century.

Baum was also barking orders at subordinates (and colleagues) faster and louder than you could imagine even Gordon Ramsay doing.

Spirit Education Trust (WSET), adding that this provides the winemaker with a bit more leeway to produce a desired blend. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;The advent of the red blend in America may have something to do with the idea that if multiple varietals listed on a label, there are more chances that a consumer will see one of the ones they like and purchase the wine,\u0026#8221; Rudman says. \u0026#8221; Thus, it is much more economical for a winemaker to produce one wine with multiple varietals than producing separate varietal wines altogether. \u0026#8220;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut once acceptance of blends became more pervasive among U.S. consumers, Rudman continues, the “Red Blend” as a homogenous category (as opposed to the heterogenous category that blending actually represents) took off because it was a perfect platform upon which to build \u0026#8220;lifestyle brands.\u0026#8221;  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;In many cases now, it matters little what varietals are in the blend, and often these wines bear the most generic possible appellations, such as simply \u0026#8216;California.\u0026#8217; What matters is the design of the bottle and label, and the identity it communicates,\u0026#8221; Rudman says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMany industry experts cite similar reasons as to why red blends are in favor with both winemakers and wine drinkers right now. Basically, as Horiuchi sums up, wine drinkers like to experiment and try new things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image is-resized\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BV-Winemaker-Trevor-Durling-Ivy-Wall_0174.jpeg?w=640\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2689157\" width=\"650\" srcset=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BV-Winemaker-Trevor-Durling-Ivy-Wall_0174.jpeg 640w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BV-Winemaker-Trevor-Durling-Ivy-Wall_0174.jpeg?resize=100,150 100w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BV-Winemaker-Trevor-Durling-Ivy-Wall_0174.jpeg?resize=200,300 200w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BV-Winemaker-Trevor-Durling-Ivy-Wall_0174.jpeg?resize=141,212 141w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BV-Winemaker-Trevor-Durling-Ivy-Wall_0174.jpeg?resize=335,503 335w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BV-Winemaker-Trevor-Durling-Ivy-Wall_0174.jpeg?resize=67,100 67w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BV-Winemaker-Trevor-Durling-Ivy-Wall_0174.jpeg?resize=40,60 40w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BV-Winemaker-Trevor-Durling-Ivy-Wall_0174.jpeg?resize=103,154 103w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BV-Winemaker-Trevor-Durling-Ivy-Wall_0174.jpeg?resize=263,394 263w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BV-Winemaker-Trevor-Durling-Ivy-Wall_0174.jpeg?resize=392,588 392w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BV-Winemaker-Trevor-Durling-Ivy-Wall_0174.jpeg?resize=112,168 112w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BV-Winemaker-Trevor-Durling-Ivy-Wall_0174.jpeg?resize=310,465 310w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BV-Winemaker-Trevor-Durling-Ivy-Wall_0174.jpeg?resize=104,156 104w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BV-Winemaker-Trevor-Durling-Ivy-Wall_0174.jpeg?resize=222,333 222w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BV-Winemaker-Trevor-Durling-Ivy-Wall_0174.jpeg?resize=257,385 257w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BV-Winemaker-Trevor-Durling-Ivy-Wall_0174.jpeg?resize=533,800 533w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BV-Winemaker-Trevor-Durling-Ivy-Wall_0174.jpeg?resize=80,120 80w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BV-Winemaker-Trevor-Durling-Ivy-Wall_0174.jpeg?resize=82,123 82w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BV-Winemaker-Trevor-Durling-Ivy-Wall_0174.jpeg?resize=115,173 115w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BV-Winemaker-Trevor-Durling-Ivy-Wall_0174.jpeg?resize=328,492 328w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BV-Winemaker-Trevor-Durling-Ivy-Wall_0174.jpeg?resize=345,518 345w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eBV winemaker Trevor Durling \u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"image-credit\"\u003eBeaulieu Vineyards\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“From a winemaking perspective, the possibilities are endless,” says Trevor Durling, head winemaker at \u003ca href=\"https://www.bvwines.com/en-us\"\u003eBeaulieu Vineyards\u003c/a\u003e in the Napa Valley. “Beers and spirits are more recipe-driven and are less at the mercy of Mother Nature.

Although the library remains open today, the college closed down in 1902 because of low enrollment numbers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/facade_scan2_1903.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2690611\" srcset=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/facade_scan2_1903.jpg 2352w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/facade_scan2_1903.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/facade_scan2_1903.jpg?resize=300,197 300w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/facade_scan2_1903.jpg?resize=768,505 768w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/facade_scan2_1903.jpg?resize=1024,674 1024w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/facade_scan2_1903.jpg?resize=281,185 281w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/facade_scan2_1903.jpg?resize=765,503 765w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/facade_scan2_1903.jpg?resize=100,66 100w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/facade_scan2_1903.jpg?resize=60,39 60w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/facade_scan2_1903.jpg?resize=154,101 154w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/facade_scan2_1903.jpg?resize=599,394 599w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/facade_scan2_1903.jpg?resize=392,258 392w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/facade_scan2_1903.jpg?resize=252,166 252w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/facade_scan2_1903.jpg?resize=697,458 697w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/facade_scan2_1903.jpg?resize=234,154 234w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/facade_scan2_1903.jpg?resize=500,329 500w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/facade_scan2_1903.jpg?resize=578,380 578w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/facade_scan2_1903.jpg?resize=600,395 600w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/facade_scan2_1903.jpg?resize=90,59 90w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/facade_scan2_1903.jpg?resize=91,60 91w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/facade_scan2_1903.jpg?resize=187,123 187w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/facade_scan2_1903.jpg?resize=115,76 115w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/facade_scan2_1903.jpg?resize=748,492 748w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/facade_scan2_1903.jpg?resize=788,518 788w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2352px) 100vw, 2352px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eThe Morrin Centre in May 1902.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"image-credit\"\u003eFred C.

That narrative continues as Quebec province happens to be home to the Office Québécois de la Langue Française (OQLF), also known as the Québec Board of the French Language and referred to by many as

When confronted with the supposed local antipathy toward the English language, the executive director mentions a recent shift in attitudes, at least when measured within the Centre’s context. “We estimate, based on surveys, that somewhere in the neighborhood of 40% of our members are actually francophones,” he says. “So it’s not solely the English-speaking community that uses our services.”

The same Browns that haven\u0026#8217;t been in the NFL playoffs in 17 years, and did not win a single NFL game in 2017 could have a chance to win it all. Last season, the Browns\u0026#8217; fortune turned around as they won five out of their last seven games and ended the season with a 7-8-1 record. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe euphoria over the Browns this season is leading some to wonder if the team and star players Baker Mayfield and Odell Beckham Jr. can have as big an emotional and economic impact for Cleveland fans as NBA superstar LeBron James did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile obviously, it\u0026#8217;s too early to tell and hard to quantify such an impact, there\u0026#8217;s discussion to be had. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe economic impact of a football and a basketball team differ due to the difference in frequency of play. The Browns only play 10 home games a year, compared to the more than 40 pre-season and regular-season home games for the Cleveland Cavaliers. And during James\u0026#8217; heyday with the Cavs, they played even more because of their playoff runs. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003ca href=\"https://www.gcpartnership.com/\"\u003eGreater Cleveland Partnership\u003c/a\u003e–a regional Chamber of Commerce overseen by more than 70 CEOs in Northeast Ohio–hasn\u0026#8217;t tried to put a number on the true value of \u0026#8220;King James\u0026#8221; to the area during his two stints playing with the Cavs. The group has only safely said that James\u0026#8217; impact is in the \u0026#8220;hundreds of millions of dollars.\u0026#8221;  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe one day the once-horrific football team and its\u0026#8217; new star players could be mentioned in the same breath with LeBron economically, Shoag said. But that might prove challenging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eShoag\u0026#8217;s study, \u003ca href=\"https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/shoag/files/south_beach_and_back_01.pdf\"\u003e\u0026#8220;Taking My Talents to South Beach (and Back) \u0026#8211; Evidence on Local Externalities from a Superstar Athlete\u003c/a\u003e, co-written with Stan Veuger, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, delves into whether James\u0026#8217; economic impact would be similar in a different city. They write that James\u0026#8217; presence in Cleveland increased the number of restaurants, bars, and other establishments within one mile of the home arenas where he played by about 13%, and employment by about 23.5%.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eKeep in mind, James\u0026#8217; transcendent play led to several playoff appearances this decade, eight straight appearances in the NBA Finals, and three NBA championships. In 2016, James led the Cavs to victory, giving Cleveland its first pro championship in 40 years. More than 1.3 million people attended the championship parade downtown that year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eJames helped make Cleveland, a hardscrabble rust-belt town known for its roll-up-your-sleeves, blue-collar style, intriguing on the national level. It\u0026#8217;s no coincidence that Cleveland\u0026#8217;s prominence has also made it a top travel destination in the U.S., according to Destination Cleveland, the city\u0026#8217;s tourism and convention bureau. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe city hosted the 2016 Republican National Convention and this year\u0026#8217;s Major League Baseball All-Star Game. Cleveland will also host regional games during next year\u0026#8217;s NCAA Men\u0026#8217;s Basketball Tournament, the 2021 NFL Draft, and the 2022 NBA All-Star Game. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;I would say that the LeBron era was a part of our ability to garner these high-profile events, but not the primary reason why. We\u0026#8217;ve put billions of dollars into visitor-related infrastructure,\u0026#8221; said Emily Lauer, a Destination spokeswoman. \u0026#8220;LeBron helped create awareness.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMaintaining that type of visibility will be a tall order for the Browns, but a renewed interest in the team nationally could have them picking up where the basketball legend left off when he signed with the \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2018/07/03/lebron-james-los-angeles-economy/https://fortune.com/2018/07/03/lebron-james-los-angeles-economy/\"\u003eLos Angeles Lakers\u003c/a\u003e for a four-year $154 million deal in 2018. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eA study conducted by \u003ca href=\"https://formswift.com/request-for-proposal#study\"\u003eFormSwift\u003c/a\u003e for Black Enterprise last year predicted that L.A. would experience a $396 million economic impact if James chose either the Lakers or the Clippers over a five-year period. Additionally, L.A. would gain about 3,000 jobs and $29 million in state tax revenue. By comparison, the study said if James remained in Cleveland, he would have had a $176 million economic impact, and the city would gain about 1,500 jobs and nearly $10 million in state tax revenue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs for the Browns, their ability to bring in that type of economic stimulus remains to be seen. \u0026#8220;I would hold off on any predictions until they start winning consistently,\u0026#8221; said Adam Earnheardt, a professor at Youngstown State University in Ohio who specializes in social media and fan engagement. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eShoag, wearing both hats as an Ivy League economist and Browns super-fan, agrees. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;Emotionally, it\u0026#8217;s already been huge for the city to have a bright light with the Browns so shortly after LeBron left,\u0026#8221; Shoag said. \u0026#8220;I think you will see a big impact over time.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEarly\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eSigns of Newfound Success\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eInterest was already piqued for the Browns last season after the team selected Mayfield–the brash, cocky quarterback from Oklahoma and the 2017 Heisman Trophy winner–as the top overall pick in the 2018 NFL Draft. Rabid fans were able to witness Mayfield\u0026#8217;s rapid progression from college athlete to pro and the Browns\u0026#8217; hopeful future taking form in training camp via HBO\u0026#8217;s Hard Knocks reality show. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eViewers saw new Browns General Manager John Dorsey, a football lifer who was fresh from turning the Kansas City Chiefs into a perennial playoff club, rebuild the team\u0026#8217;s roster. A month before drafting Mayfield, Dorsey traded for stud wide receiver Jarvis Landry from the Miami Dolphins, who would not only serve as a key target for Mayfield, but also channel Dorsey\u0026#8217;s new culture of accountability and tenacity that would hopefully lead to wins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut the biggest question remained: could Mayfield, with a strong throwing arm that compensates for his undersized stature, finally be the franchise quarterback to save this team that had barely won a third of its games since it was re-established as an expansion club 20 years ago?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Browns weren\u0026#8217;t always so bad. The team started in the All-America Football Conference in 1946 and won four titles in that league before joining the NFL in 1950. They won a championship that year and three more in 1954, 1955, and 1964. During this pre-Super Bowl dynasty, the Browns were led by hall of fame running back Jim Brown, arguably the greatest football player ever. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eDuring that period, the city of Cleveland went through quite a bit of change. First, there was a population surge of nearly 1 million residents due to the city\u0026#8217;s status as one of the biggest industrial centers in the U.S. Then, scores of residents left after many steel and iron companies shut down. The Cuyahoga River, which runs through the city and feeds into Lake Erie, caught fire because of a rising pollution problem. And finally, Cleveland had to default on major bank loans in the 1970s, grabbing national headlines. Through all of this, the Browns were a stable and comforting presence, even as the city was got dubbed, \u0026#8220;The Mistake by the Lake.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBy the 1980s, the Browns were a playoff contender, led by quarterbacks Brian Sipe and Bernie Kosar, and running backs Kevin Mack and Ernest Byner. But the team was snakebitten during three key playoff games. The first is the play known infamously as \u003ca href=\"https://dawgpounddaily.com/2018/09/28/cleveland-browns-fans-still-haunted-by-oakland-raiders-and-red-right-88/\"\u003e\u0026#8220;Red Right 88,\u0026#8221;\u003c/a\u003e when Sipe threw an interception during the Browns\u0026#8217; tough loss to the eventual Super Bowl champion Oakland Raiders in 1981. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThen there\u0026#8217;s \u003ca href=\"https://www.profootballhof.com/news/the-drive/\"\u003e\u0026#8220;The Drive,\u0026#8221;\u003c/a\u003e where the Browns lost in overtime to the Denver Broncos 23-20 during the AFC championship game in 1987 after Broncos quarterback John Elway led his team on a remarkable 98-yard drive to tie the game 20-20 with 31 seconds left to play in regulation. The Broncos went on to win that game with a field goal during a nine-play 60-yard drive in overtime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMore heartbreak came for the Browns in 1988, when Byner fumbled at the 1-yard line while trying to score a touchdown to pull within a point of Denver during the AFC title game. The Broncos won 38-33 and the play is forever known as \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TM7zRs91BgI\"\u003e\u0026#8220;The Fumble.\u0026#8221;\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSeven years later, in 1995, longtime Browns owner Art Modell announced he was moving the team to Baltimore and the franchise was renamed the Ravens. Browns fans were furious. They held protests and filed lawsuits wanting their football team back. Their wishes were granted when the Browns returned as an expansion team in 1999.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSince then, Browns fans have suffered through years of futility, including the winless 2016 season and a lone victory in 2017. The only exceptions in these years of heartache are two winning seasons in 2002 and 2007, and a lone playoff appearance in 2002.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut last season, things started looking up for Browns fans when Mayfield took the field in Week 3 and rallied to beat the New York Jets 21-17 in a nationally-televised game. Fans took to the streets in jubilation and football pundits wondered if a change was around the corner. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFive weeks later, the Browns fired both head coach Hue Jackson and offensive coordinator Todd Haley. Mayfield excelled, setting a new NFL record for the most touchdown passes thrown by a quarterback in his rookie season with 27. He became a savior of sorts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;Baker has emotionally connected with the city with his grittiness,\u0026#8221; Shoag said. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn January, the team promoted offensive coordinator \u003ca href=\"https://www.clevelandbrowns.com/video/cleveland-browns-head-coach-freddie-kitchens-full-introductory-press-conference\"\u003eFreddie Kitchens\u003c/a\u003e to head coach mostly based on his success with Mayfield. Then the Browns made a bombshell move in March by trading for Beckham, the electrifying Pro Bowl receiver with the New York Giants known for his spectacular one-handed catches, touchdown celebrations, and a $95 million contract that puts him among the highest-paid players in the NFL. The trade also reunited Beckham with Landry, his best friend and college teammate from Louisiana State University.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eDemand for Browns season tickets was already high, but it exploded after the Beckham trade. The team said it has reached its max for season ticket holders for 2019 at more than 60,000–a spike of about 12,000 from last season. And all eight home games this season are sellouts.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAdditionally, the Browns said that all of the 143 suites at FirstEnergy Stadium have been sold out for months, and it has thousands of fans on its waiting list for tickets, which require a $100 deposit. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;Fans can put down a deposit, and assuming inventory is available next year, those individuals have the first opportunity to purchase,\u0026#8221; Browns spokesman Rob McBurnett told Fortune. \u0026#8220;We were trending towards reaching our season ticket maximum prior to that [Beckham trade] news, with overall team performance late in 2018 as one of the strongest factors.\u0026#8221;   \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTicket demand for the Browns has spiked in the secondary market, as well.

In fact, he said Browns\u0026#8217; secondary ticket sales are reaching the levels he saw for the 1995 and 1996 World Series-title chasing Cleveland Indians, a team that was in the midst of ending four decades of frustration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHe said the Browns\u0026#8217; Nov. 10 matchup against the lowly Buffalo Bills is generating the fifth-highest prices of the season for his website. The prices are about 20% higher than those for the 2018 season opener versus the arch-rival Pittsburgh Steelers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs for the this year\u0026#8217;s home matchup against the Steelers, a nationally-televised Thursday night game on Nov. 14, lower-level midfield tickets that were going for $450 last year are currently going for $900.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThose are his most expensive tickets–for now.

She wants to raise awareness about the protocol so that more big tech companies roll it out. Apple only recently began adding compatibility after the World Wide Web Consortium, or W3C, an Internet standards body, gave its blessing to the tech.

But Yubico won\u0026#8217;t touch Bluetooth, for fear of security issues, and Apple has so far refused to let outsiders tap into its NFC capability. So, no contactless YubiKeys for iPhone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn considering this (hopefully temporary) impasse between Yubico and Apple, one might do well to remember that it wasn\u0026#8217;t the invention of the seatbelt that saved so many lives, but the convenience of the three-point strap design that Volvo\u0026#8217;s Bohlin pioneered.

I had previously opened SkyLofts and the Wynn. The Palms was building a new tower. They had an assistant hotel manager position open and I applied. I was drawn to the energy of the property and the opportunity to get an additional opening experience prior to graduating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat was the impetus for the new look? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe renovation was sparked by new ownership. In 2016, Station Casinos purchased the Palms and owners Frank and Lorenzo Fertitta had an incredible vision to transform the property. Some of the goals were to bring back the energy the Palms had during its peak years. It was fun, high-energy, offered great service, value for locals and was the epicenter of pop culture. We wanted to bring that back yet instill a more luxury experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat was it like to oversee this particular renovation? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026#8217;ve been part of a few large-scale projects in Las Vegas, starting from my first time around at Palms building the Fantasy Tower, and then the subsequent Palms Place residential tower to building the Linq by Caesars Entertainment. However, the Palms renovation was easily one of the largest and most complex projects I\u0026#8217;ve ever been a part of. One of the challenges was the Palms had gone through a rolling renovation, meaning we kept the resort open while we renovated virtually the entire property.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the most interesting aspects of the renovation was how we communicated with guests as we completed the renovation in phases. The biggest challenge we experienced while staying open during renovation was maintaining the guest experience throughout the construction. Communication to our staff and guests was critical throughout the renovation. Our marketing campaign “From Dust to Gold,” created by AKQA Portland and the Palms team, was launched in May 2018 and was the modern version of the message “pardon our dust.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe came out strong with a message that made it very clear to consumers that we have amazing amenities complete and now open—Scotch 80 Prime, Apex Social Club and the Unknown—but we’re still working on a lot more to come such as new guestrooms, suites, restaurants and KAOS, our new pool and day club. The message resonated with the market, and we set the expectations with our guests all while signaling the Palms would be entering the luxury resort tier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere do you want to take the Palms Casino Resort in the future?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vision really came from owners Frank and Lorenzo Fertitta. It has been incredible working for them and to be part of the team dreaming and executing the vision. Our complete transformation took course over two years at a cost of $690 million and will be complete this September.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’ve added all new rooms and suites, including the most expensive hotel suite in the world, designed by Damien Hirst, as well as new restaurants by celebrity chefs Bobby Flay, Michael Symon and Marc Vetri. Palms is also home to exclusive residences in both our newly renovated Pearl Concert Theater and all new day club and nightclub, Kaos. Those acts range from Lady Antebellum, Cardi B., J Balvin, Billy Idol, and more. We’ve also unveiled one of the most extensive collections of modern and blue-chip art outside of a museum.

People want experiences over things, and there is no shortage of experiences around the world. From new festivals popping up every year to incredible experiences you can book right on your phone, amazing experiences all over the world have never been more accessible. With that comes pressure to create new experiences every day for your guest. We have to keep pushing new experiences through our doors and beyond.

At the first sight of a potential pest problem, it’s wise to call in the experts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Begin by contracting with qualified, trained pest management professionals who can conduct thorough inspections of areas that may have conditions conducive to cockroach infestations,” said Nic Ellis, board-certified entomologist, Western Pest Services. “Following their inspection, they will share their findings with the hotel management team and work to develop the appropriate management plans—preventive or reactive—depending on the results.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a hotel, grab-and-go food areas are popular and could attract ants, roaches and flies, among other pests. They’re often unstaffed and remain stocked with food for many hours of the day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Items that are dropped by patrons will likely go undetected for several hours, providing a food source to cockroaches, rodents and flies,” said John Perrone, board-certified entomologist, Western Pest Services. “These areas should be inspected to ensure that pest harborage areas are eliminated and equipped with rodent traps and discreet insect monitoring. The hotel’s IPM (integrated pest management) plan should call for a regular inspection and treatment of this space by its pest management company.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePesky fruit flies are also a concern in these areas because of the abundance of sugars from fresh fruit and fruit-based beverages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“House flies also present additional challenges because they have a wider range of food preferences. Mice and cockroaches living in the structural elements of the building may seek food and beverage spills,” added Ellis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCockroaches like to hide during the day and forage at night. Once an infestation is identified, the Western Pest Services team recommends getting to the root of the problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The most important step in managing any cockroach infestation is to determine where they are hiding, and where they are emerging to forage,” said Ellis. “Then, those ‘harborages’ are treated with the appropriate measures. I recommend that hotel owners contact the trained and certified professionals to make professional assessments of roach hideouts and the best management tactics for them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerrone added, “Cockroach elimination is most effective when varying treatment methods are employed, including baits, residual pesticides and insect growth regulators, in combination with housekeeping and exclusion methods.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe saying goes, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Perrone believes the prevention of roaches—or any pest—must always rely upon an IPM (integrated pest management) plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“IPM relies on excluding rodent entry and harborage, maintaining good housekeeping standards, monitoring for pest activity, and the use of regulated pesticides as warranted,” he said. “No hotel or foodservice professional should attempt the design or delivery of an IPM plan on their own; working with a licensed pest management professional will be the first step in prevention.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike flies to honey, pests are also drawn to a hotel’s happy hour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“During a busy time like happy hour, it is not easy for the bar staff to maintain good housekeeping standards providing many areas where fruit flies like to feed and breed,” said Perrone. “This includes spilled juices, liquors and fresh fruit, which are all high in sugar, a natural attractant for fruit flies. This elevated busy time will also see an uptick in the doors being open, providing entry for house flies following the air pattern into the bar. The installation of air curtains, which will move air out of an open door, will aid in preventing flies from flying into the establishment.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Ellis, the number-one rule of preventing a fly infestation of any type is to practice excellent sanitation to deprive flies of food, moisture and shelter: “For example, emptying trash cans and cleaning them thoroughly; keeping floors, sinks and bar tops clean of food and beverage debris; cleaning floor and tap drains; and routinely replacing drainage hoses,” he said. “Pest control companies can also provide very effective products for maintaining clean drains and trapping devices for reducing adult fly numbers.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA fly-free environment will require the hotelier to be committed to resolving any structural or sanitation issues that are contributing to flies breeding in the space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This might include the repair of cracked tiles or grout lines, the water-tight sealing of floor/wall junctions, and the adherence to a strong set of sanitation principles,” said Perrone. “The use of enzyme cleaners, like Western OE-30, is fundamental in a great sanitation program. Hotels should be equipped with Insect Light Traps, properly positioned in all applicable areas, which will aid in trapping flies 24 hours per day. Trash areas should be kept as clean as possible, cleaning or replacing trash receptacles regularly. If indoor trash storage is required, the trash room should be temperature controlled, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Western Pest Services team urges hoteliers to think outside the box when it comes to ridding spaces of unwanted visitors. While working with a professional pest management company is critical, it is also important for sanitation and other operations processes to be taken into consideration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A sanitation plan should be written out and adhered to, focusing on cleaning several times throughout the day,” said Perrone. “Eliminating standing water throughout the hotel’s back of house, food areas and trash areas will also help. Any plumbing issues should be repaired. We recommend that foodservice areas are cleaned daily and that a floor dryer is used to quickly dry up excess water used in mopping. Periodically requesting the replacement or cleansing of trash receptacles from their waste management company should also be considered. Ultimately, if a pest professional is not partnering and making these recommendations, it may be time to consider working with another.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe post \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.hotelbusiness.com/at-hotels-how-to-keep-the-bugs-at-bay/\"\u003eAt Hotels, How to Keep the Bugs at Bay\u003c/a\u003e appeared first on \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.hotelbusiness.com\"\u003eHotel Business\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://www.hotelbusiness.com/at-hotels-how-to-keep-the-bugs-at-bay/","published":"2019-09-07T12:52:29Z","guid":"https://www.hotelbusiness.com/?p=187908"}]},{"url":"https://rss.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Business.xml","items":[{"title":"Hiring Slowed in August, but Wage Gains Accelerated","content":"","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/06/business/economy/august-jobs-report.html?emc=rss\u0026partner=rss","published":"2019-09-07T01:53:31Z","guid":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/06/business/economy/august-jobs-report.html"},{"title":"Justice Dept.

Plus it was coming from the same brilliant minds who gave us \u003cem\u003eGolf Peaks\u003c/em\u003e, so really, how could this go wrong? The answer is that it couldn\u0026#8217;t, and now that I have \u003cem\u003eInbento\u003c/em\u003e in my hot little hands, it\u0026#8217;s even more fiendishly clever than I anticipated. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/inbentofeat.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1614\" height=\"1072\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-257963\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/inbentofeat.png 1614w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/inbentofeat-300x199.png 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/inbentofeat-768x510.png 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/inbentofeat-1024x680.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eInbento\u003c/em\u003e is more or less logic puzzles dressed up as you filling up bento boxes with food items. You\u0026#8217;re given a set of ingredients for every level and the shape and direction of these food items can vary. Also there is limited space in each bento box, and when you place a food item on top of one that\u0026#8217;s already in the box, the new item will take its place. So order of operation is very important if you\u0026#8217;re going to match the recipe of each box that\u0026#8217;s shown in each level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt doesn\u0026#8217;t stop there, though, because there are special non-food items that you must utilize to find certain solutions. One early special item will swap the place of two food squares, so you\u0026#8217;ll need to learn when and where to place it on top of the food in the box in order to come up with the correct recipe. Also, some food items can be rotated, but others are locked into place, making it even more challenging to figure out which item goes where and when.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"clear:both;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"video-responsive\"\u003e\n\t\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_4atTIHrmrU\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of this is presented with a clean visual style and tied together with adorable story scenes that feature cats. What is not to love? Oh, and did I mention that \u003cem\u003eInbento\u003c/em\u003e is played in portrait orientation and is an absolutely killer one-handed game? Because that\u0026#8217;s something I love a bunch too. Sometimes all you want is just a straightforward puzzle game that will challenge your brain and feels like a quality production. That\u0026#8217;s exactly what \u003cem\u003eInbento\u003c/em\u003e offers, and for your three bucks you\u0026#8217;ll get more than 100 puzzles with no ads, IAP, or shenanigans. Puzzle fans should definitely gobble this one up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://toucharcade.com/2019/09/06/toucharcade-game-of-the-week-inbento/","published":"2019-09-07T00:24:09Z","guid":"https://toucharcade.com/?p=257958"}]},{"url":"https://www.nintendolife.com/feeds/latest","items":[{"title":"Talking Point: What Are You Playing This Weekend?

events.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTraffic-wise, I saw an uptick in page views and visitors and likes and comments.  That seems to be the norm here for Blaugust.  Stats show that has happened for the last five years, an uptick from July to August.  Whether that is the impact of Blaugust or other items\u0026#8230; last year, for example, \u003cem\u003eBattle for Azeroth\u003c/em\u003e hit in August, this year \u003cem\u003eWoW Classic\u003c/em\u003e hit, and posts about both attracted search engine traffic\u0026#8230; I could not say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOddly, the uptick tends to continue into September, with that month being slightly higher in page views than August, though likes and comments tend to fall off.  Just looking at the average views per day, this September seems to be following the trend, though I also do tend to keep rolling on the daily post thing for a few weeks after Blaugust.  Once I get rolling I guess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026#8217;m not sure what else to say.  I made it.  I read a lot of other people\u0026#8217;s posts.  I tried to comment on some, link out to others, but managed to do neither to the extent that I would have liked.  I suppose I should take a moment to get in what has become my baseline advice over the various blogger events, which is:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBe the blog you

events.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTraffic-wise, I saw an uptick in page views and visitors and likes and comments.  That seems to be the norm here for Blaugust.  Stats show that has happened for the last five years, an uptick from July to August.  Whether that is the impact of Blaugust or other items\u0026#8230; last year, for example, \u003cem\u003eBattle for Azeroth\u003c/em\u003e hit in August, this year \u003cem\u003eWoW Classic\u003c/em\u003e hit, and posts about both attracted search engine traffic\u0026#8230; I could not say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOddly, the uptick tends to continue into September, with that month being slightly higher in page views than August, though likes and comments tend to fall off.  Just looking at the average views per day, this September seems to be following the trend, though I also do tend to keep rolling on the daily post thing for a few weeks after Blaugust.  Once I get rolling I guess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026#8217;m not sure what else to say.  I made it.  I read a lot of other people\u0026#8217;s posts.  I tried to comment on some, link out to others, but managed to do neither to the extent that I would have liked.  I suppose I should take a moment to get in what has become my baseline advice over the various blogger events, which is:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBe the blog you

About 20 minutes later, the National Weather Service’s office in Birmingham rushed to correct the record. “Alabama will NOT see any impacts from #Dorian. We repeat, no impacts from Hurricane #Dorian will be felt across Alabama,” it tweeted. “The system will remain too far east.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat then happened was that Hurricane Dorian did not strike Alabama—and the state certainly wasn’t “hit (much) harder than anticipated.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/09/hurricane-dorians-damage-bahamas/597271/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: Hurricane Dorian is not a freak storm\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut as my colleague David Graham has written, Trump has \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/09/trumps-pointless-lie-hurricane-dorian-and-alabama/597469/?utm_source=feed\"\u003espent the last five days\u003c/a\u003e bizarrely explaining why he was correct to warn its residents.

But this statement has turned what has become a routine type of political story (the President has said something misleading!) into one that’s slightly more Soviet—and much more worrying.

In \u003cem\u003eThe Irony of Vietnam: The System Worked\u003c/em\u003e, which he published in 1979, he argued brilliantly that the war didn’t result from a failure or perversion of the policy process—Vietnam followed logically from false assumptions about the Cold War that remained constant through six American administrations. He often talked about his generation of policy makers, those who entered government during Vietnam, as forever damaged by the war—a generation of failed promise, lacking the talent and confidence of the original Wise Men. Five years later, \u003cem\u003eOur Own Worst Enemy\u003c/em\u003e, which he co-wrote with Anthony Lake and I. M. Destler, described the deterioration of post-Vietnam foreign-policy making into ideological warfare and careerism. \u003cem\u003ePower Rules\u003c/em\u003e was a primer in realism, written in 2009 in the aftermath of the Iraq disaster, a war that Gelb saw as a prime example of the flawed mentality of the foreign-policy elite, and that he keenly regretted supporting.

But without land, many migrants settled in abandoned hillsides on the edge of the city, and constructed the ever-expanding mass of informal settlements that stretch into low-hanging clouds.

But even those most sentimental about Robert Mugabe, the first leader of Zimbabwe, will admit that if he had been hit by a bus on the streets of Harare 25 years ago, or crushed by a landslide of Chanel bags after one of his wife Grace’s shopping sprees in London or Paris, the world would be a better place. Instead Mugabe died yesterday in Singapore at the age of 95, far from the country he first liberated from white-minority rule, then laid to waste over a 37-year rule that began brutally and ended in pathetic squalor.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI understand why some might remember Mugabe mistily. He was a hero to the Non-Aligned and to liberation movements everywhere. He behaved with remarkable consistency through the years, and like Nelson Mandela — the liberation figure to whom he is so often unfavorably compared — he endured political imprisonment and emerged somehow stronger rather than weaker for it. To these heroic qualities, Mugabe added a few with special appeal to intellectuals. A teacher by training, he spent his imprisonment in near-constant study, earning degrees in law and administration from the University of London by correspondence. It is said that even while president of Zimbabwe, he sometimes flew to London secretly to \u003ca href=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/africaatlse/2019/09/06/robert-mugabe-obituary-zimbabwe/\"\u003ebrowse\u003c/a\u003e new titles at Dillons, a huge bookstore in Bloomsbury.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn spite of these highbrow tastes (and an unimposing physical presence), Mugabe became the political figure of choice for the Zimbabwean guerrillas who, during the years in the 1970s after his imprisonment, used Mozambican territory to conduct raids against the Rhodesian military. The Rhodesians hit back against civilian targets, and the black population of the borderlands suffered terribly. Aided by the Chinese, Mugabe prolonged and intensified that war, knowing that as it got worse, international support for regime change would improve. In time no other moral conclusion was possible: the white-minority government needed to negotiate its own surrender.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe standard way of absolving Mugabe for his wartime tactics is to note the justice of his cause, and the unlikelihood that it would have prevailed without violence. But history has long since granted that absolution, and indeed honored Mugabe for his courage. The sins he never even attempted to erase were against his comrades in liberation, whom he treated with brutality and suspicion.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe locked up, tortured, and assassinated members of his movement whom he suspected of loyalty to other guerrilla factions. Once in power, the maniacal power-lust of Mugabe the revolutionary became a state religion, a cult of personality that ensured that Zimbabwe under Mugabe would never develop the institutions and goodwill that would allow it to flourish as an independent nation. His ultimate crimes were against his country, and his fellow citizens, whom he abused, starved, and robbed. Between 1983 and 1987, Mugabe’s army — trained by North Korea— killed tens of thousands of civilians in the Matabele region of Zimbabwe, on the grounds that a rival revolutionary faction (Soviet- rather than Chinese-backed) still enjoyed support there, and threatened Mugabe’s rule.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMugabe left his inaugural promise — that “yesterday I fought you as an enemy, [but] today you have become a friend and ally” — unfulfilled. Indeed he made a mockery of that promise in his actions against anyone even remotely perceived as disloyal. After the genocide in Matabeleland, he turned against white Zimbabweans, sanctioning a grisly demagogue, Chenjerai “Hitler” Hunzvi, to whip up vigilante fervor against white farmers. (Hunzvi called himself “Hitler” and “Zimbabwe’s biggest terrorist.”) The Zimbabwean agricultural industry, the country’s largest earner of foreign currency, collapsed, and by the late 1990s Mugabe began resorting to mass-printing of currency to make budget.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI first visited Zimbabwe around that time, with about three hundred U.S. dollars stuffed in my socks. That fragrant currency, so desperately coveted by Zimbabweans aware that their government was laserprinting their own money into worthlessness, lasted me for nearly a month. For two dollars I could get a clean bed and a full English breakfast; for five dollars I could eat in the best restaurants in Mutare. Many Zimbabweans, by contrast, had nothing to eat at all. Stores sold their stock for outrageously low prices, with no hope of profit, just of slower immiseration. Dillons of Bloomsbury might have had the newest titles, but I once bought a hardback novel in Harare for three quarters of one cent.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHyperinflation is the perfect strategy for the corrupt, because whoever is in charge can designate cronies to receive the privilege of changing money at the government rate, and ration out hard currency to everyone else in meager quantities. Mugabe’s allies became rich, while ordinary people were reduced to starvation and supplication. Those who challenged this arrangement seldom escaped punishment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOnce I was riding a train from Harare to Bulawayo, and I shared a first-class car with a Dutch tourist and a government official from the capital. The government official was well-fed and talkative. The Dutchman, who liked horses, said that he had tried to visit the polo grounds, which were marked on his tourist map of Harare. Suddenly, while he peered over the fence in search of ponies, a Toyota screeched up next to him. Men grabbed him by his wrists and crammed him into the back seat, before leading him to the basement of a nearby building. The polo grounds were Mugabe’s private turf, he was told, and his security worried that he was a mercenary scouting the area. (Mugabe survived many assassination attempts.) The government official gave a low whistle when he heard the description of the building, and told us that few had ever emerged from that basement without injury.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMugabe’s reputation remained sterling, in many circles, through the mid-1990s, when he still had the shine of liberation, and he had not yet unleashed his vigilantes. (The international community was content to ignore the mass violence against blacks.) Universities granted him honorary degrees. If he had stepped down, he could have retired to a life of bibliophilia and listening to his favorite singers, Bing Crosby and Pat Boone. Or he could have been hit by a bus.

Elements of those elites, led by the military, removed him gently, not least to ensure that the even more sociopathic Grace would not succeed him. Mandela was mourned by the world.

Facebook’s matchmaking service, called Facebook Dating, launched Thursday in the United States after debuting in 19 other countries earlier this year, and it is explicitly trying to inject some of the more human aspects back into online dating through features that mimic the ways in which people used to meet-cute before the Tinder age.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFacebook Dating, which lives within the Facebook mobile app in a separate tab (it’s not available on the Facebook desktop site), promises to connect singles who opt into the service by algorithmically matching them according to geography and shared “interests, events, and groups”; users have the option of “unlocking” certain Facebook groups they’re part of and certain Facebook events they’ve RSVPed to in order to match with other group members or attendees. It also gives users the option of pulling biographical data from their Facebook page to populate their Facebook Dating profile: name, age, location, job title, photos.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWithin the app’s privacy settings, users can also opt in or opt out of matching with their Facebook friends’ Facebook friends. The app does not match people with their \u003cem\u003eown \u003c/em\u003eFacebook friends, unless explicitly directed to: The “Secret Crush” feature allows users to identify up to nine of their Facebook friends as people they have a crush on, and “no one will know that you’ve entered their name,” according to Facebook’s \u003ca href=\"https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2019/09/facebook-dating/\"\u003eNewsroom blog\u003c/a\u003e, unless your name also appears on \u003cem\u003etheir \u003c/em\u003eSecret Crush list. In that case, Facebook Dating notifies both parties. (Facebook makes no mention of what happens if two, three, or—God forbid—all \u003cem\u003enine\u003c/em\u003e of a person’s crushes indicate that the secret crush is reciprocated.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf those sound suspiciously like online versions of the old-school ways people used to find dates and meet partners—by joining groups and clubs, by meeting through friends, by going to events, sometimes even by telling a mutual friend about a crush and having them surreptitiously investigate and report back—that’s intentional. A representative for Facebook confirmed that developers wanted to address a couple of specific problems they saw with how existing dating apps had reformed, and arguably gamified, dating.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEarlier this summer, Facebook commissioned a survey of 3,000 Americans over the age of 18. It found that 40 percent of people who were currently online dating felt that the available apps and sites weren’t meeting their needs. It also found that similar interests were the top-ranked trait most people were looking for in a partner, over looks and financial prospects (which may be one reason apps like Bumble, which prominently features pictures and job titles but requires users to click through to a profile for more information, weren’t exactly cutting it for a good chunk of those surveyed).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs a result, the Facebook representative told me, the developers decided not to give Facebook Dating an instant “swipe” feature; instead of being able to approve or reject potential date candidates rapid-fire after having looked at only a single photo, Tinder-style, users have to open someone’s full profile before deciding to opt in or out on a potential match. The desire for deeper engagement with potential matches is also a big part of why the company decided that it will integrate Instagram stories and Facebook stories into Facebook Dating at some point in the next year, according to the representative—to show what potential matches are up to \u003cem\u003eright this minute \u003c/em\u003eand offset the “static” nature of dating profiles as we currently know them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFacebook Dating’s goal of creating meaningful matches through shared interests and activities has its skeptics; among them is Madeleine Fugère, a psychology professor at Eastern Connecticut State University who specializes in romantic relationships and sexual attraction. Fugère emphasizes that although people tend to \u003cem\u003ethink \u003c/em\u003eshared interests are more likely to lead to attraction, they’re hardly a reliable predictor. “Liking someone depends very much on that in-person ‘clicking,’ which is extremely hard to predict ahead of time,” she told me.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFugère also questioned whether Facebook Dating could find success among what one would have to assume is its target market—single people in their 20s and 30s. While Facebook is aiming to re-create virtually the experience of meeting someone in person, it’s not clear whether users will \u003cem\u003ewant \u003c/em\u003eso much information transmitted online between themselves and someone they still have not actually met: Pew research has recently suggested that \u003ca href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90232793/the-people-who-get-how-facebook-works-are-also-the-most-likely-to-leave-it\"\u003eyoung people have been leaving Facebook\u003c/a\u003e, especially after the revelation that the voter-profiling firm Cambridge Analytica \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html\"\u003eharvested the private Facebook data of millions of Americans\u003c/a\u003e ahead of the 2016 election. Perhaps relatedly, Facebook Dating is one of a few recent projects that seem intended to remind people of Facebook’s capabilities as a tool to create and maintain relationships. A recent ad campaign, for example, \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4zd7X98eOs\"\u003ereminded viewers of Facebook’s origins\u003c/a\u003e—as a platform that connected people through shared friends and \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxJk6JGl8z8\"\u003eshared interests\u003c/a\u003e and facilitated the sharing of happy or funny moments, rather than a shockingly penetrable database holding a good portion of the global population’s personal data.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile Facebook Dating may certainly be a more curated, more individually tailored alternative to other dating apps, it’s still pretty robotic and random compared with, you know, simply talking to people who seem attractive or interesting out in the real world.

It’s the fall of the Roman Republic. \u003c/strong\u003eOne could argue that the fall of Rome wasn’t so “awful” [JF note: this is Edward Gibbons’s term] because, by that time, Rome was pretty “awful” itself.  The Empire’s peak— particularly the heights of both power and intellectual advance of the Five Good Emperors—was long behind it.  \u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eHowever much as I may like Trajan and Marcus Aurelius (and I always found it interesting that \u003ci\u003eGladiator\u003c/i\u003e set its story in this period, and has Russell Crowe restore democracy at the end, as if to fantasize how great Rome would be if the history we know had simply ended after Trajan and we then got to go back to the republic … ), Rome’s true greatness begins and ends for me (and I suspect for you and most of your readers) with the Roman Republic. In fact, I don’t think the problem with the US today is that it resembles Rome at the end of the Empire, but rather that it resembles Rome at the end of the Republic.  \u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eOr, rather, not long before, with the rise of the Gracchi—the increasing economic inequality, the increasing political polarization, the total eclipse of “the greater good” by what we'd call “special interests,” the turn toward political violence, all of which led eventually to the spiral of destructive civil war, the collapse of democracy (such as it was), and the wholesale replacement of the system with the imperial dictatorship:  Looks a lot like the present moment to me ….\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003chr class=\"c-section-divider\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe real question: Where is America headed? \u003c/strong\u003eSure, you can talk about the growth of monasteries and universities in the Dark Ages as a wonderful thing, but (a) what we really mean by that is how wonderful it is that there were islands of light in what was otherwise a sea of darkness, (b) that darkness went on a long time, (c) what came out of it, which you/we now celebrate as the result, was essentially:\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003ethe rediscovery of the lost knowledge of Greece and Rome (not to mention the Islamic world) that kindled the Renaissance and Enlightenment,\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\t\u003cli\u003ethe re-emergence of something resembling “globalization,” and\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\t\u003cli\u003ethe end of the horrific destructiveness of the Middle Ages—due largely to the institution of local fiefdoms that your piece celebrates as a sort of Brandeisian laboratory—thanks to their replacement by the modern nation-state and the European state system, which represented a recentralization of authority and stability, not a devolution.\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat I actually find more interesting is what your piece says about where we’re \u003ci\u003eheaded\u003c/i\u003e, which is what I’ve been focusing on, lo! these many years.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003chr class=\"c-section-divider\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSeeing the world through a distorted 20\u003csup\u003eth\u003c/sup\u003e century lens\u003c/strong\u003e.

You quote Morley Winograd talking about “networked localities” taking control of global policy.

I feel this way about Mick Herron. Born in Newcastle upon Tyne, in England, and educated at Oxford, Herron writes squeakingly well-plotted spy thrillers. More than that, he composes—at the rate of a pulpist—the kind of efficient, darkly witty, tipped-with-imagery sentences that feel purpose-built to perforate my private daze of illiteracy. More than \u003ci\u003ethat\u003c/i\u003e, he’s a world-bringer, the creator of a still-growing fictional universe with its own gravity, lingo, and surface tension. He whacks his characters and winnows his cast with real 21st-century anti-sentimentality, but there always seems to be enough life-energy around to generate more stories. A TV series is in the works, and a new novel, \u003ci\u003eJoe Country\u003c/i\u003e, was published in June.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt the center of Herron’s mythosphere is a terrible, terrible office: Slough House. Although … can Slough House be at the center of anything? It’s a terminus, permanently dislodged from—at odds with, even—the flow of existence. A grimly nondescript building somewhere in the London borough of Finsbury, a concrescence of London dilapidation and anonymity, Slough House is where you’ll find the “slow horses”—the MI5 operatives deemed too dysfunctional, addicted, high-risk, or failure-prone for anything but the most grinding busywork. J. K. Coe is there, monastically hoodied, sizzling with PTSD, listening to Keith Jarrett in his earbuds and not talking to anyone. Shirley Dander is there, always thinking about the wrap of cocaine in her pocket. (“It wasn’t like Shirley was an habitual user. It was a weekend thing with her, strictly Thursday to Tuesday.”) The manager of Slough House, its twice-as-toxic David Brent, its stained and farting Buddha, is Jackson Lamb. Once a formidable “joe”—Herron-speak for an agent—at Berlin Station, Lamb is now a chain-smoking, whiskey-drinking shambles and a creature of coal-black cynicism. Herron’s slow horses are always being pulled into plots, called upon to exercise their latent joe skills. As rejects, they are the natural enemies of the elite. They can smell a false-flag operation a mile off. No fake news for these genuine losers. In \u003ci\u003eJoe Country\u003c/i\u003e, a hunt for the missing son of a deceased slow horse leads to an encounter with the most infernal echelons of the Establishment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHerron has written 13 novels—six in the Slough House series—but he began his literary career as a poet.

Let’s hear it for the poet’s ear. The previous Slough House novel, 2018’s \u003ci\u003eLondon Rules\u003c/i\u003e, kicks off with an assault-weapon attack on an English village: “The jeep, which had idled throughout the brief carnage, spat stones as it accelerated away.” It could be a scene from the British poet David Harsent’s apocalyptic 2005 sequence, \u003ci\u003eLegion\u003c/i\u003e: “We cut our engines, then, and the dust / settled in silence.” It’s the same wiry language, the same sensation of shock acting on space.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEspionage is a shadow battle; it looks like the psyche. “On a normal day,” muses a spy in \u003ci\u003eJoe Country\u003c/i\u003e, “London was bright and busy, full of open spaces and well-lit squares. But it was also trap streets and ghost stations; a spook realm below the real.” In this realm, people change shape; graves open and dead things rise; stories turn inside out. Like John le Carré—with whom he has been much compared—Herron is obsessed with that area of human experience, that area of the human brain, where paranoia overlaps with an essential, feral vigilance. “Since leaving the Park he’d had that uneasy sense of footsteps in synch with his own. There were tricks you could pull—double back to check a shop window, pause to fix a shoelace, halt at a bus stop …” No such thing as coincidence. Ordinary, bovine, walking-down-the-street life is an illusion, a sleep-state. Don’t get caught standing around: bad tradecraft.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/12/the-double-life-of-john-le-carre/413152/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eFrom December 2015: James Parker on the double life of John le Carré\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow and again le Carré’s Cold War—that ’70s Eastern Bloc dowdiness, all those strange drawling characters sipping their tea in a fuggy room in Cambridge Circus—reaches with long fingers into the Slough House milieu. Reckonings occur, decades delayed. The grandfather of one slow horse is a George Smiley–era spy sinking into dementia; narratives and counternarratives are coming loose in his head. But Herron was on the Underground, going to work, when London was bombed on July 7, 2005, and the mood of his spies is un–le Carré: a jazzy, jangled hyperalertness. Carnage is only a heartbeat—a switch, a trigger—away. The London where the slow horses live is an invisibly fanatical city: jihadists, rogue actors, wandering nodes of annihilation approaching the zero hour.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWorking as fast as Herron does, you can stay close to life as it’s being lived and close, also, to the hallucination known as current events. “My feeling about Brexit,” he told \u003ci\u003eThe\u003c/i\u003e \u003ci\u003eIrish Times \u003c/i\u003eearlier this year, “is people with vested interests have manipulated and lied to large sections of the community. There is a part of me that would like to go back and burn down the bastions of privilege that allowed these people to take over in such a self-serving way.” Well, there are several Brexits, but one of them, indeed, is the kind of elitist conspiracy that the slow horses—in their cack-handed, explosive way—are constantly uncovering.\u003c/p\u003e\u003caside class=\"callout-placeholder\" data-source=\"curated\"\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe installation of Boris Johnson in 10 Downing Street will have done nothing to appease Herron.

His fellow Brexiteer Nigel Farage makes an appearance, sort of, in \u003ci\u003eLondon Rules\u003c/i\u003e, as the populist Dennis Gimball: “What should have been a cameo became a career, and the whole thing went on for what felt like decades.” Spoiler alert: Gimball gets his head knocked off by a falling paint can. The novelist’s revenge.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHerron has been praised for the wit and velocity of the workplace banter at Slough House—the infighting, and the awful, un-PC things that come out of Jackson Lamb’s mouth: “I’m an ardent feminist, as you know. But haven’t you girls got better things to worry your little heads about?” A little of this, I find, goes a long way. Sections of \u003ci\u003eLondon Rules\u003c/i\u003e in particular seemed to me to be rather clogged with \u003ci\u003eVeep\u003c/i\u003e-like repartee. \u003ci\u003eJoe Country\u003c/i\u003e corrects the error. The slow horses are drawn out of fast-talking London and into wintry Wales, land of snowy ditches and burning owls. The bastions of privilege are casting their long shadow.

Landers could kick up a cloud of dust that blocks sensors from detecting the craters or boulders that a last-minute engine burn might avoid.

The spacecraft must go from a speed of thousands of miles an hour to nearly zero in about 15 minutes. It has to ignite its engines and thrust itself against the direction it is hurtling toward. As it slows, it falls, and more engine burns are needed to keep it from plummeting too fast.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e“It’s actually like landing a missile,” Landsman says.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe spacecraft is covered in sensors that track its altitude and scan the surroundings for any perilous obstacles below.

In the case of \u003cem\u003eIT Chapter 2\u003c/em\u003e, some have already taken issue with Muschietti\u0026#8217;s decision to include the scene. \u003ca href=\"https://slate.com/culture/2019/09/it-chapter-two-homophobic-killing-charlie-howard-opening-scene.html\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eSlate\u003c/em\u003e\u0026#8216;s Jeffrey Bloomer\u003c/a\u003e writes that Adrian\u0026#8217;s death is a \u0026#8220;gay-bashing scene\u0026#8221; that \u0026#8220;exploits a ghastly real-life killing for a cheap shock, delivered without context or any clear thematic underpinning.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe goes on to say that the fact that King included the scene in the book doesn\u0026#8217;t necessitate the treatment it receives in the movie. \u0026#8220;That a type of crime still happens in real life does not mean extremely graphic depictions of it are always justified,\u0026#8221; Bloomer writes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough it is barely mentioned again in the movie, the violent incident is treated as a precursor to the character arc of Richie Tozier, played by Bill Hader as an adult and \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://time.com/5617328/stranger-things-season-3-review/\" \u003eStranger Things\u003c/a\u003e\u0026#8216; \u003c/em\u003eFinn Wolfhard as a child. \u0026#8220;It sets up a canvas.

But it\u0026#8217;s not until Richie is back in Derry retrieving a specific, personal token that each Loser needs in order to perform the ritual that will allow them to defeat It, that we glimpse his inner truth. While collecting the token \u0026mdash; for him, a literal token from the Derry arcade \u0026mdash; Richie flashes back to a memory from the summer of \u0026#8217;89 when he was playing a game with another boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two boys are getting along until the bully Henry Bowers (Nicholas Hamilton) walks in and it\u0026#8217;s revealed that the boy is Henry\u0026#8217;s cousin. Henry accuses Richie of hitting on his cousin, and the cousin immediately steps away and joins in hurling homophobic slurs at Richie. Richie then runs away from the arcade crying, only to be attacked in the town square by It, which has taken on the form of Derry\u0026#8217;s massive Paul Bunyan statue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;When we see the traumatic event that started the whole suppression, we see [Richie] being himself and beginning to realize who he is, and immediately he\u0026#8217;s pointed out and he\u0026#8217;s humiliated,\u0026#8221; Muschietti explains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter leaving the arcade as an adult, Richie again has an encounter with It in the town square during which It, as Pennywise, threatens to reveal Richie\u0026#8217;s \u0026#8220;dirty little secret,\u0026#8221; implying that he will out him as gay. Muschietti says that this scene was intended to convey just how deeply Richie fears people learning the truth about his sexual orientation. \u0026#8220;We reintroduce [Richie] as someone who has built a persona around himself. For him, it\u0026#8217;s very important that people think that he has a girlfriend,\u0026#8221; Muschietti says. \u0026#8220;And in time, we understand what his fear is: He\u0026#8217;s afraid of being exposed because he had a traumatic event in the past that he never worked through.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the movie progresses, it becomes clear that Richie has long been harboring romantic feelings for Eddie (played by James Ransone as an adult and Jack Dylan Grazer as a child). In King\u0026#8217;s novel, the relationship between Richie and Eddie is an ambiguous one that has long inspired debate over whether the two shared either a mutual or a one-sided attraction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"inline-portrait_small_2x alignnone \"\u003e\u003cimg data-attachment-id=\"5663965\" data-permalink=\"https://time.com/5663676/it-chapter-2-ending-ritual-of-chud/it-chapter-two-ending/\" data-orig-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/it-chapter-two-ending.jpeg?quality=85\" data-orig-size=\"5229,3485\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"It-Chapter-Two-Ending\" data-image-description=\"p(L-r) Bill Hader as Richie Tozier and James Ransone as Eddie Kaspbrak in ‘It Chapter Two’/p\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/it-chapter-two-ending.jpeg?quality=85\u0026w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/it-chapter-two-ending.jpeg?quality=85\u0026w=600\" src=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/it-chapter-two-ending.jpeg?w=560\u0026#038;quality=85\u0026#038;h=373\" alt=\"(L-r) Bill Hader as Richie Tozier and James Ransone as Eddie Kaspbrak in 'It Chapter Two'\" height=\"373\"\u003e\n\u003cfigcaption class=\"image-caption\" \u003e\u003cspan class=\"credit\" \u003eBrooke Palmer\u0026mdash;Warner Bros.

But it never flourished because probably Eddie wasn\u0026#8217;t gay and especially because Richie was never able to come out\u0026#8221; he says. \u0026#8220;Because of that traumatic event in the past, at the time when puberty hit him and he normally would\u0026#8217;ve started acting upon his leanings or sexual identity, he didn\u0026#8217;t.

Because the revelation of Richie\u0026rsquo;s feelings for Eddie only comes at the film\u0026rsquo;s very end, without clarity as to whether either of them ever explored their queerness.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe movie, which may be headed for a $100-million opening weekend box office, is sure to continue to inspire debate as to its treatment of Adrian\u0026rsquo;s violent death, Richie and Eddie\u0026rsquo;s relationship and the ways in which it both adheres to and diverges from King\u0026rsquo;s version. For Muschietti, Richie\u0026rsquo;s final scene represents something he hopes will inspire optimism in viewers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Eddie meets a tragic end, Richie is driven nearly insane with grief. But in the wake of that loss, Muschietti says that Richie\u0026#8217;s final scene \u0026mdash; tracing back over the \u0026ldquo;R+E\u0026rdquo; he carved into Derry\u0026rsquo;s kissing bridge as a child \u0026mdash; is meant to symbolize a new chapter in his life. \u0026#8220;Something changed there,\u0026#8221; Muschietti explains. \u0026#8220;And by re-carving it, he\u0026#8217;s somehow accepting [himself].

Following Adrian Mellon\u0026#8217;s (Xavier Dolan) murder in the opening scene of the movie, it\u0026#8217;s Mike who calls up his fellow Losers to alert them of It\u0026#8217;s return, kickstarting their memories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe knowledge that It has returned proves too much for Stan (Andy Bean), who dies by suicide almost immediately after taking Mike\u0026#8217;s call. But the rest of the group all makes plans to return to Derry right away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFollowing the Losers\u0026#8217; Club reunion at the Jade of the Orient and their discovery that Stan has died, in a scene that diverges from the book, Mike takes Bill to the library in hopes of convincing him that it\u0026#8217;s possible to defeat It once and for all. Once there, Mike drugs Bill\u0026#8217;s drink with a hallucinogenic root that was given to him by a Native American tribe he visited to try to learn more about It. He goes on to reveal that he spent several years chasing down every possible lead on It, a search that led him to the descendants of the Native Americans who inhabited the future site of Derry at the time of It\u0026rsquo;s arrival.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike then pulls out a Native American artifact that he stole from the tribe, which is covered in markings that reveal the origins of It. What follows is a trippy animated sequence in which Bill sees a vision of It crash-landing on Earth in an event similar to an asteroid impact. Although It arrives in its true form of the \u003ca href=\"https://stephenking.fandom.com/wiki/Deadlights\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003eDeadlights\u003c/a\u003e, Bill watches as It transforms into a bird before rapidly shifting between a number of grotesque forms while preying upon the ancestors of the Native American tribe that Mike sought out. The tribe is then shown standing around the artifact as a fire burns inside it, signifying that they are performing the Ritual of Ch\u0026uuml;d. Unfortunately, they are only able to trap It with the ceremony instead of killing It for good. (Or so Mike says \u0026mdash; more on that later.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike is convinced that if the Losers recreate the ritual, they will be able to stop It\u0026#8217;s reign of terror forever. But to do this, they first need to each collect a token from their childhood that they can burn inside the artifact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scene from the movie in which Mike explains the Ritual of Ch\u0026uuml;d to Bill is based on a chapter in King\u0026#8217;s book in which the child Losers decide to perform an \u0026#8220;Indian ceremony\u0026#8221; that involves filling up their clubhouse with smoke to create a \u0026#8220;smoke-hole.\u0026#8221; Once the others can no longer endure the smoke, Mike and Ritchie are left alone inside the clubhouse, and both experience a vision of It\u0026#8217;s arrival on Earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the book, there are no Native Americans who teach Mike about the Ritual of Ch\u0026uuml;d. It\u0026#8217;s only mentioned in passing that the idea for the smoke-hole came from a book about Native Americans that Ben was reading while researching It. Unfortunately, the movie doesn\u0026#8217;t do much to update King\u0026#8217;s depiction of Native Americans as faceless people used only to further \u003cem\u003eIT\u003c/em\u003e\u0026#8216;s plot.

Despite the fact that nearly all of them have a solo encounter with It in the process, Bill makes it back with Georgie\u0026#8217;s paper sailboat, Bev with the haiku that Ben wrote for her when they were kids, Richie with a literal token from the arcade, Eddie with his inhaler, Ben with the page from his yearbook that Bev signed and Mike with the rock that Bev hit Henry Bowers with to save him as a kid.

However, It then breaks out and it\u0026#8217;s revealed that Mike lied: The Native Americans who first attempted to trap It were all slaughtered by It because they didn\u0026#8217;t truly believe the ritual would work. Mike was convinced that the Losers\u0026#8217; belief that they could defeat It would protect them just as it seemed to at the end of the first movie. It then transforms into its final form, a massive clown-spider hybrid, and the battle of wills between the Losers and It truly begins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the book, King emphasizes that the power of belief is the only thing that gives the Losers a fighting chance against It. But having lost their childish imaginations in the 27 years since they first battled It, to actually kill It as adults, the Losers need to dig a little deeper than they did as children.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThanks to illusions created by It, each of the Losers finds him- or herself in a situation in which they\u0026#8217;re forced to face down what they fear the most.

But they still have to face the clown-spider hybrid. When Richie gets caught in the Deadlights, Eddie hurls the fence post from the Neibolt house \u0026mdash; that Bev told him \u0026#8220;kills monsters if you believe it does\u0026#8221; \u0026mdash; at spider-Pennywise, wounding It and releasing Richie from his trance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut while Eddie stands over Richie celebrating his triumph, It runs him through with a spiked tentacle and flings him through the air.

After finally realizing that the key to It\u0026#8217;s defeat is that It must abide by the laws of nature concerning whatever form it takes, the Losers channel their strengths of will to force It to take forms that they will be able to physically defeat, like that of the old woman and the clown. Just as It has always wielded the power of belief against the Losers by making them believe that it\u0026#8217;s the incarnation of their greatest fears, the Losers are able to turn this power back around on It.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike King\u0026#8217;s novel, \u003cem\u003eIT Chapter \u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003eTwo \u003c/em\u003erelies heavily on the idea that without belief, there\u0026#8217;s no such thing as fear.

Richie is beside himself and the others are forced to drag him away from Eddie\u0026#8217;s body to escape It\u0026#8217;s lair as it collapses in on itself.

Often the density of detail is such that the sentences become verbless lists. Tartt’s narrator catalogues the world’s visual clutter as greedily as any unblinking movie camera. The descriptions of the Barbours’ huge Park Avenue apartment, with all its dark wood and chinoiserie, or the new-build Las Vegas house at the edge of the desert, where Theo has to live with his father, are like instruction sheets for set builders.

Wan\u0026#8217;s vision to make China an EV powerhouse revolutionised the global car industry. I am going to give you three numbers to explain why:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMusk became the CEO in 2008 when Tesla was making less than 1,000 cars. Around the same time, Wan was made the minister of science in China. He\u0026#8217;s an auto engineer who worked at Audi in Germany before he moved back to China. At the time, China was making less than 1,000 electric cars. Last year, Tesla struggled to make about 180,000 electric cars, China is now making 1.3 million electric cars.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTesla has raised about $6 billion in total. In the last decade, the Chinese government alone \u003ca href=\"https://qz.com/1489228/beyond-the-tesla-bubble-the-future-of-electric-cars-is-being-scripted-in-china/\"\u003ehas invested $60 billion\u003c/a\u003e and about twice or thrice as much has come from private industry.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMusk wants to electric cars to make the world a sustainable place. It\u0026#8217;ll take a long time for Musk alone to do it. Just the use of electric buses in China has already cut its oil consumption by 300,000 barrels per day, which helps it to save $5 billion on oil imports each year.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDue to Wan\u0026#8217;s efforts and strong government\u0026#8217;s policies, China is now in the race with the West.

However, to buy a petrol car, it could take up to eight years. It\u0026#8217;s the only middle-level income nation that features in the top countries pushing for the electrification of transport.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003ePolicy problem\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGhosh\u003c/strong\u003e: India does not know how to make a big bet on industrial policy. If we don\u0026#8217;t fix that, India will have a haphazard transition to EVs, where the value creation that comes with both product and services will go outside the country.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFocus on financing should also be considered. Like in China, how the manufacturers get the subsidy from the government. And, of course, the charging infrastructure needs more push and if from a policy perspective we are able to do that then I think the startup ecosystem will boom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAgarwal\u003c/strong\u003e: If you go for a low indigenisation scenario, there\u0026#8217;ll be pushback from existing automobile industry because there is value deduction since you are shutting down an existing industry. You will lose Rs5,000-6,000 crore. But in our estimation, by 2030, with high indigenisation you actually get additional industrial value of about Rs20,000 crore in the country.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo the EV transition will face major push from the traditional industry at the macroeconomic level, unless we make it a red line that we will not switch until we make the power trains and batteries in India. No other scenario will give a positive result.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLohia\u003c/strong\u003e: In countries like the US, China and Europe, you don\u0026#8217;t have to deal with the problem of potholes, water-logging on the roads, and you don\u0026#8217;t find dust. In India, we need to deal with these things first. If you think of using a European or even Chinese EV in India, you\u0026#8217;ll be wasting your time, money, and energy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eBattery supply situation\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAgarwal\u003c/strong\u003e: A lot of knowledge is needed in developing battery packs. So unless you know what you are doing with imported cells, even after an exhausting procedure, you may end up with really bad quality. In our case, we have a team of highly skilled local professionals who have worked with companies across the globe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eBattery swapping\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSrivastava\u003c/strong\u003e: The main advantage of battery swapping is that it reduces the wait time by around 60% while the cost rises by around 50%. Does that make economic sense? In Delhi itself, there are places where it works smoothly and then there are places it will not work at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAgarwal\u003c/strong\u003e: I was the biggest sceptic of battery swapping until last year. Now I have changed my view. As long as a vehicle\u0026#8217;s uptime can be increased in terms of its commercial usefulness, it makes sense. Otherwise it doesn\u0026#8217;t, owing to the huge costs involved. Our company has observed that drivers of commercial three-wheelers are able to increase their on-road time by 30% to 40% and it takes them a couple of minutes to swap, so it works. In the case of four-wheelers due to the heavy weight of the battery, it is difficult to swap. However, commercial two-wheelers and three-wheelers can able to swap very easily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eChallenge of charging infra\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSrivastava\u003c/strong\u003e: There is no other way to have charging infrastructure than to build your own. Our company realised it and we built it for us. If you rely on the government, then you are doomed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHonestly, creating charging infrastructure is not a costly affair. The real problem is can the grid support the rising load of charging stations? If you take just the Delhi government\u0026#8217;s target, by 2023, there will need to be 2500 new EVs every single day on the city\u0026#8217;s roads. Even if these are low power vehicles, we are still talking about commissioning 4 MW of power dedicatedly just for EV charging. So, for me, setting up the hardware is easier but if the grid collapses tomorrow what will happen then?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhere\u0026#8217;s the skilled labour?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLohia\u003c/strong\u003e: There\u0026#8217;s a huge gap between understanding of the product and how things actually happen on the ground. If you want to find a person who has knowledge of what\u0026#8217;s happening with the background of electrical and mechanical both combined, you will hardly find the skilled people. We need to address this knowledge gap. In India, we don\u0026#8217;t have much awareness about product development and challenges it will face on the roads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGhosh\u003c/strong\u003e: Recently, I was teaching at IIT Madras. The general sense among the students there is that they trained themselves for the wrong sector. Today, even the traditional auto industry demands labour skilled in the software developing, which for the EV industry is a must. So the question isn\u0026#8217;t what do we need to provide extra on-job training, but are we providing enough education to start with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eCare for the climate?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGhosh\u003c/strong\u003e: The emissions from the transport sector in India are very small, unlike in the US or Europe. In India, power sector decarbonisation is already happening, and industrial decarbonisation will be the next task. There sectors contribute between 20% and 35% of national emissions. The share of the transport sector is less than 10%.

The fashion calendar itself is based in a system that emerged in the latter half of the 19th century with couturiers such as \u003ca href=\"https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/wrth/hd_wrth.htm\"\u003eCharles Fredrick Worth\u003c/a\u003e, who once a season used live models to present a variety of designs for interested clients to choose from. Before that point, designers made their clothes to order. (An aggressive self-promoter, Worth also pioneered the practice of designers putting their names into their garments.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis innovation led to the cycle of seasonal collections that came to define designer fashion: Brands showed their collections to buyers—which have since become mostly retailers rather than individuals—and then produced the clothes they sold. It took several months for runway looks to hit store racks. All the while, magazines were the main avenue for the general public to see these latest designs, making editors the ones designers had to impress to get their work in front of a wide audience. Runway shows were a matter of public interest, but their main audiences were those editors and store buyers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"attachment_1704230\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\u003e\u003cimg aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1704230\" class=\"size-hero-m wp-image-1704230\" src=\"https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AP_480208022.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;w=640\" alt=\"A woman walks in a black and white checkered, flamed jacket with matching gaiters.

On the contrary, more are happening than ever. Cities beyond the big four of Paris, Milan, London, and New York have created their own events, including Shanghai, Seoul, and Tbilisi.

It is now widely expected the bill, known as AB5, will pass a full Senate vote before the legislative session ends Sept. 13 and be signed by governor Gavin Newsom. The bill would likely force many gig companies to reclassify their independent contractors as employees, pulling the very foundation of the gig economy out from under it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNewsom had kept his cards close to the vest on AB5, but on Sept. 2—Labor Day in the US—he publicly declared his support for the bill in an \u003ca href=\"https://www.sacbee.com/opinion/article234624897.html\"\u003eop-ed\u003c/a\u003e in the Sacramento Bee. “Reversing the trend of misclassification is a necessary and important step to improve the lives of working people,” Newsom wrote. “That’s why, this Labor Day, I am proud to be supporting \u003ca href=\"https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article234477082.html\"\u003eAssembly Bill 5\u003c/a\u003e, which extends critical labor protections to more workers by curbing misclassification.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eEasy as 1, 2, 3\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAB5 would codify the test for determining whether a worker is a contractor or an employee that was outlined by California\u0026#8217;s supreme court last year in its \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.courts.ca.gov/opinions/archive/S222732.PDF\"\u003eDynamex \u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.courts.ca.gov/opinions/archive/S222732.PDF\"\u003edecision\u003c/a\u003e (pdf). The court instructed hiring firms to apply a standard commonly referred to as the “ABC” test, which says a worker is “properly considered” an independent contractor to whom certain wage and hour regulations don’t apply only if:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e(A) that the worker is free from the control and direction of the hirer in connection with the performance of the work, both under the contract for the performance of such work and in fact;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(B) that the worker performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity’s business;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand (C) that the worker is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, or business of the same nature as the work performed for the hiring entity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrevious debates over whether workers such as Uber drivers or DoorDash couriers are contractors, as the companies tend to claim, or employees have focused on how much control these firms exercise over their workers. This is similar to A in the ABC test, and there is evidence for both sides. Uber drivers set their own schedules and enjoy a degree of flexibility uncommon in many employee positions. They do not, however, set the rates they earn as an independent contractor like a plumber might, or have much control over where their work takes them. Gig companies also tend to manage their workers indirectly—through algorithms and user-based \u003ca href=\"https://qz.com/1244155/good-luck-leaving-your-uber-driver-less-than-five-stars/\"\u003eratings systems\u003c/a\u003e—and can “deactivate” workers who fall below a certain threshold, which is tech-speak for firing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s harder to argue both sides on B. Do Uber or Lyft drivers perform work “outside the usual course of the hiring entity’s business”? It seems pretty clear that drivers drive, and driving is essential to the “usual course” of business for Uber and Lyft. You could say the same of couriers who deliver food for food-delivery companies such as DoorDash and Postmates. As for C, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi planted the idea that Uber drivers are independent business operators on the company’s second-quarter earnings call on Aug. 8, noting that they “run their own business.” It’s an old Uber talking point that seems to have been rehabbed recently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003ePlan B(allot)\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps the surest sign that AB5 will become law is that gig companies have shifted gears from trying to crush the bill to \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/29/technology/uber-lyft-ballot-initiative.html\"\u003eplanning a ballot initiative\u003c/a\u003e that would exempt them from it. Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash last week pledged $90 million to a ballot initiative that would give preserve the independent-contractor status of drivers while allowing the companies to provide some benefits. That’s not cheap, but it’s a lot less than the \u003ca href=\"https://qz.com/1643263/the-cost-to-uber-and-lyft-if-drivers-were-employees/\"\u003eestimated $800 million\u003c/a\u003e Uber and Lyft combined would owe per year in added payroll taxes, training costs, and workers comp if their workers were employees. “As a Plan B, we are reluctantly funding this initiative,” Uber chief legal officer Tony West \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/29/technology/uber-lyft-ballot-initiative.html\"\u003etold the New York Times\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUber’s latest \u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/uber-under-the-hood/moving-work-forward-in-california-7de60b6827b4\"\u003eproposal\u003c/a\u003e includes paying drivers a minimum of $21 per hour, including the cost of average expenses, while on a trip. That sounds pretty good until you consider that the average ride-hail driver across six US metro areas spends about 33% of their time waiting for a fare, another 9-10% driving to pick up that fare, and only about 58% of the time with an actual passenger in the car, according to a \u003ca href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FIUskVkj9lsAnWJQ6kLhAhNoVLjfFdx3/view\"\u003erecent study\u003c/a\u003e commissioned by Uber and Lyft. Depending how you define “on a trip,” that means the typical driver isn’t “working” for 33% to 43% of every hour, putting the effective hourly wage at closer to $12 to $14. (New York City’s \u003ca href=\"https://qz.com/1320449/this-simple-formula-could-increase-pay-for-uber-drivers-in-new-york/\"\u003epay floor\u003c/a\u003e for ride-hail drivers cleverly solved this problem by adjusting for driver wait-time with a “utilization” rate.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther gig companies have also offered concessions.

It’s one thing to talk about reclassifying hundreds of thousands of workers from contractors o employees and another to actually do it. Presumably there would be a lot of paperwork. In addition to having to deal with payroll taxes and workers compensation and minimum wage and other things like that, there’s also the very real question of how many workers these companies could actually sustain once employee-related costs got added to the equation. The uncertainty of it all is rattling investors. After Newsom endorsed AB5, Uber’s and Lyft’s stock prices, already trading well below their IPO prices, sunk to fresh lows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"atlas-chart\" data-id=\"9ThgwzZMF\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"449\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/qz-production-atlas-assets/charts/atlas_9ThgwzZMF.png\" style=\"max-width: 100%; min-width:100%;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a research note published Sept. 5, analysts at Morgan Stanley said they expect the ride-hail giants to fight AB5 if it passes with lobbying and litigation, delaying enforcement of the law and \u0026#8220;any material fundamental impact\u0026#8221; from the bill until 2021. If and when that impact occurred, the analysts said they expected Uber to pass the bulk of increased costs along to consumers, leading to fare increases of around 25%. They estimate that could cause global ride-hail bookings to fall by 1% to 2%, and 5% to 9% if similar legislation were adopted nationally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyft late last month released a report from Beacon Economics, a consulting firm, that said reclassifying drivers as employees mean the company could require as many as 300,673 fewer drivers. The report, prepared by Beacon Economics, relies heavily on \u003ca href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w22627.pdf\"\u003eprevious research\u003c/a\u003e (pdf) co-authored by economists at Uber.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;We are working on a solution that provides drivers with strong protections that include an earnings guarantee, a system of worker-directed portable benefits, and first-of-its kind industry-wide sectoral bargaining, without jeopardizing the flexibility drivers tell us they value so much,\u0026#8221; Adrian Durbin, a Lyft spokesman, said in an emailed statement. \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/9/2/20838782/unions-for-all-seiu-sectoral-bargaining-labor-unions\"\u003eSectoral bargaining\u003c/a\u003e is a form of collective bargaining favored by politicians including \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/8/21/20826661/bernie-sanders-union-plan-labor-worker-rights-2020\"\u003eBernie Sanders\u003c/a\u003e that aims to change workplace policies across an entire industry or sector rather than at the individual company level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUber has repeatedly \u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/uber-under-the-hood/moving-work-forward-in-california-7de60b6827b4\"\u003esaid\u003c/a\u003e if drivers were employees, it would “likely have to exert more control over drivers” and “would likely hire far fewer drivers than we currently support.” As much as that sounds like a threat, it also may be the truth. A 2017 \u003ca href=\"https://qz.com/1129367/driving-for-uber-will-never-be-a-great-job-thanks-to-these-simple-economics/\"\u003eeconomics paper\u003c/a\u003e co-authored by Uber researchers and John Horton of NYU argued Uber could do little to raise fares so long as it maintained an open market where drivers could come on and off as they pleased. The logical inversion was that for Uber to raise wages, it would have to close the market, limiting the number of drivers who could come on at any given time, and the hours they could work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is already proving the case in New York City, the only metro area to have set a pay floor for ride-hail drivers. After the pay floor took effect, both \u003ca href=\"https://www.lyft.com/driver/cities/new-york-city-ny\"\u003eLyft\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://www.uber.com/drive/new-york/\"\u003eUber\u003c/a\u003e stopped accepting new drivers.

That could anger gig workers who find themselves out of jobs, so to speak, if the platforms they depend on tighten their work requirements and offer fewer work slots. Any ballot initiative companies like Uber and Lyft end up pursuing will likely attempt to portray AB5 as a misguided policy choice that hurts workers more than it helps them, and that punishes consumers with higher prices, in hopes of swinging voters to their side and gaining an exemption from the legislation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eAn earlier version of this post appeared in Oversharing, Alison Griswold’s newsletter about the sharing economy. \u003ca href=\"https://oversharing.substack.com/welcome\"\u003eSign up for it here\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://qz.com/1703897/californias-ab5-will-rewrite-the-rules-of-the-gig-economy/","published":"2019-09-07T12:00:16Z","guid":"https://qz.com/1703897/auto-draft/"},{"title":"The many failures and betrayals of Robert Mugabe to his people","content":"\u003cimg width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/mugabe-cropped.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;w=1024\" class=\"attachment-medium_10 size-medium_10 wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/mugabe-cropped.jpg 3133w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/mugabe-cropped.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/mugabe-cropped.jpg?resize=50,28 50w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/mugabe-cropped.jpg?resize=160,90 160w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/mugabe-cropped.jpg?resize=320,180 320w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/mugabe-cropped.jpg?resize=640,360 640w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/mugabe-cropped.jpg?resize=940,529 940w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/mugabe-cropped.jpg?resize=1600,900 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne wishes one could say “rest in peace”.

But Ito at the Media Lab accepted and requested Epstein\u0026#8217;s contributions and directed employees to record them as anonymous long after that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFarrow also notes that Epstein claimed to be the impetus for a $2 million donation from the philanthropic billionaire Bill Gates, among others. An email from a \u0026#8220;Jeffrey E\u0026#8221; to Ito in 2014 states, for example, that “Gates would like a write up on our one science program for tues next week.” The Gates foundation denied that Epstein was behind any of the Microsoft founder\u0026#8217;s contributions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe university MIT in August apologized for accepting $800,000 from Epstein, pledging to give the same amount to fund a charity for victims of sexual abuse. But the latest investigation into Epstein\u0026#8217;s contributions, aided by whistleblower and former MIT and Media Lab development associate Signe Swenson, shows that Ito and other Media Lab bigwigs communicated with Epstein regularly, directly asked him for money, hosted him at the institution, and amassed more than $7 million in funding thanks to the financier\u0026#8217;s efforts. Reportedly, employees at the lab were aware of Epstein\u0026#8217;s involvement and urged not to interfere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeetings with Epstein on Ito\u0026#8217;s public calendar years after the financier was known to be involved with underage girls were marked only as \u0026#8220;JE,\u0026#8221; although full names were used for everyone else. And people at the Media Lab reportedly referred to the donor internally as \u0026#8220;he who shall not be named.\u0026#8221; Swenson, whose willingness to help cover up involvement with Epstein was tested in her interview for a job there, she says, noted that taking money from Epstein wasn\u0026#8217;t \u0026#8220;a great idea.\u0026#8221; Still, she accepted an offer of employment and participated in the coverup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt a Media Lab town hall this week, Ito said he accepted $525,000 from Epstein, money which was spent on everyone at the lab and a slew of different activities.

They found that gray squirrels adjust their vigilance levels in relation to the sounds around them, including the chatter of birds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn other words, when birds call, squirrels listen, and when the avians simply chitchat, the rodents know that they are safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo reach this conclusion, a behavioral ecology student, Marie Lilly, created various recordings and took to the streets with buckets full of equipment to collect data about the effects of these tweets on foraging gray squirrels. Lilly hid behind trees as she played five sets of sounds for the squirrels. To indicate danger, she played the call of a red-tail hawk and to indicate safety, she played either ambient sound or one of three different recordings of chattering birds. Then, using a specially created app, she noted the squirrels\u0026#8217; behaviors, logging how much time a squirrel spent freezing, foraging, fleeing, resting, standing, or looking skyward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile she was collecting the data, Lilly \u003ca href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/09/04/757530544/the-other-twitterverse-squirrels-eavesdrop-on-birds-researchers-say\"\u003etold NPR\u003c/a\u003e, she couldn\u0026#8217;t necessarily make sense of the squirrels\u0026#8217; behavior. \u0026#8220;In the field, I couldn\u0026#8217;t tell if their vigilance level was going down or not because I was just recording their raw behavior,\u0026#8221; she explains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, when she analyzed the collected data after 67 experiments—30 with tweeting bird sounds and 37 with ambient noise—a pattern emerged. Lilly found that the squirrels became more vigilant after hearing the cry of the red-tail hawk—freezing, fleeing, or looking up. But when she played the sound of birds chitchatting—no matter which of the three recordings—the squirrels quickly resumed regular activities, foraging busily, apparently reassured that danger had passed, based on the exchanging birds. The squirrels responded more rapidly to calm birdsong than they did to ambient noise, indicating that they rely more heavily on the inadvertent informants to assess the dangers they face than they do on the mere absence of threatening sounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the paper published with Oberlin professor Keith Tarvin, Lilly and her fellow researchers argue that the findings indicate animals aren\u0026#8217;t just relying on vocal species to convey information about danger but are also listening closely for indications of safety.

In support of this position, TSO argued that the employee wasn\u0026#8217;t even in the hotel room secured by the company during the encounter. Not only that, but the liaison was adulterous and with \u0026#8220;a perfect stranger.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps unsurprisingly, French judges were unmoved by these prudish arguments. They noted that an employee traveling for work is the employer\u0026#8217;s responsibility, whatever the employee may do and even off work hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSex is just a part of daily life, like taking a shower or having a meal, they said. An employer is liable for the worker throughout an assignment unless the company can show evidence that the employee actually deviated from the company\u0026#8217;s mission at the time of injury. TSO, however, did not provide proof that the employee\u0026#8217;s sexual liaison constituted an interruption of his work mission—the sexual liaison thus did not shift the company\u0026#8217;s liability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is a stark contrast to cases in the US, for example, where employer liability during business trips is generally limited to injuries arising \u0026#8220;within the course and scope of employment.\u0026#8221; An employee on a business trip may be entitled to \u0026#8220;continuous coverage\u0026#8221; but that coverage is interrupted if the worker deviates from the work mission for purely personal reasons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnlike the Paris appeals court judges, American jurists tend to make a much less generous view of what a worker might do on a business trip and what counts as an interruption of their employer\u0026#8217;s mission. For example, in 2015, \u003ca href=\"https://caselaw.findlaw.com/tx-court-of-appeals/1717629.html\"\u003ea Texas appeals court ruled\u003c/a\u003e that an employee away on business who was severely injured in a car accident while going from work to dinner with his son was not acting within the course and scope of employment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The first step [in determining whether an activity is in the course and scope of employment] requires determining whether the activity (1) originates in the employer\u0026#8217;s work, business, trade, or profession and (2) furthers the employer\u0026#8217;s affairs,” the court noted. Although the employee eventually died from injuries related to the accident, the judges did not find liability under worker compensation law, noting that the dinner meeting with family was purely personal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can just imagine then how they would have felt about a claim arising from a sexual liaison with \u0026#8220;a perfect stranger.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://qz.com/work/1704474/paris-court-rules-sex-induced-death-a-workplace-accident/","published":"2019-09-07T13:51:29Z","guid":"https://qz.com/1704474/auto-draft/"},{"title":"The Democrats aren’t trying to take away your light bulbs","content":"\u003cimg width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/RTS1AXKG-e1567862760360.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;w=1024\" class=\"attachment-medium_10 size-medium_10 wp-post-image\" alt=\"The filament of an incandescent light bulb\" /\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn Sept. 4, Donald Trump announced the rollback of Obama-era\u003ca href=\"https://qz.com/1546400/more-efficient-light-bulbs-trump-administration-would-rather-not/\"\u003e standards for energy-efficient light bulbs\u003c/a\u003e—a gradual phase-out of incandescent and halogen bulbs that would have kicked in on New Year’s Day 2020.

Small changes beget larger ones. Yet most of those choices would happen naturally, as new products and services become cost-effective through subsidies and other economic incentives—like, for example, newfangled light bulbs that last longer and use four or five times less energy.

Tesla\u0026#8217;s latest flagship vehicle has dominated the US electric vehicle (EV) market since its debut in 2017. It has racked up more than 190,000 sales in the US, according to IHS Markit, and it captured \u003ca href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2019/08/10/tesla-model-3-67-of-us-electric-vehicle-sales-in-2nd-quarter/\"\u003e67% of the market\u003c/a\u003e for electric cars in the US last quarter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"atlas-chart\" data-id=\"Pyh3AzX1r\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"449\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/qz-production-atlas-assets/charts/atlas_Pyh3AzX1r.png\" style=\"max-width: 100%; min-width:100%;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026#8217;s a first for an electric car maker.

That\u0026#8217;s given it a healthy lead over rivals such as the GM\u0026#8217;s Chevy Bolt and the Nissan Leaf (on the market since 2010).

Overseas, the Nissan Leaf remains the world\u0026#8217;s most popular electric car. It has racked up 400,000 in cumulative sales, Nissan \u003ca href=\"https://usa.nissannews.com/en-US/releases/release-a70f8c4b4ee0499b978e217ab10f37be-nissan-leaf-first-electric-car-to-pass-400-000-sales\"\u003eannounced this March\u003c/a\u003e, and is on track to hit half a million next year.

Three of them, in Japan, England, and the US (Tennessee), produce the Leaf, allowing the hatchback to be modified for local markets. To keep costs low, much of the tooling and assembly lines exist in shared facilities. That\u0026#8217;s kept the Leaf\u0026#8217;s price at \u003ca href=\"https://www.edmunds.com/nissan/leaf/\"\u003e$29,990\u003c/a\u003e for a standard 2019 model, and as low as \u003ca href=\"https://www.cargurus.com/Cars/price-trends/Nissan-Leaf-d2077\"\u003e$11,000\u003c/a\u003e for a used model from 2015.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Tesla flaunts its style, Nissan owes its success to those low prices and functionality. The dynamic playing out in the global EV market resembles the war over smartphones. Apple has grabbed the high-end of the market with powerful, high-priced iPhones running its iOS operating system, while Google\u0026#8217;s Android owns most of the rest. There\u0026#8217;s a stark domestic and international split in market share. In the US, Apple \u003ca href=\"https://www.counterpointresearch.com/us-market-smartphone-share/\"\u003ehas about 40%\u003c/a\u003e of US mobile operating systems.

Other carmakers are eager to snap up the rest. There are around 40 plug-in EVs on showroom floors this year, and we\u0026#8217;re about to see\u003ca href=\"https://insideevs.com/features/342054/2020-electric-vehicles-the-big-breakthrough-year-for-evs/\"\u003e the arrival of at least a dozen more\u003c/a\u003e electric models as carmakers turn their factories over to electric drivetrains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat wouldn\u0026#8217;t be a worst-case scenario for Tesla. Apple has routinely \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2016/11/04/apple-smartphone-profits/\"\u003ecaptured most of the profits\u003c/a\u003e in the smartphone market (some years, nearly all of them), even as other manufacturers sell far more phones on razor-thin margins. Tesla, like Apple, could enjoy the fruits of a highly differentiated product and vertical integration in its supply chain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut David Undercoffler, the editor-in-chief of Autolist.com, predicts Tesla\u0026#8217;s transition to selling mass-market vehicles will not be easy. After building a name selling luxury EVs, Tesla will find it hard to push down costs. The company has \u003ca href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/24/tesla-earnings-q2-2019.html\"\u003ebragged about\u003c/a\u003e trimming its capital expenditures, but it\u0026#8217;s up against manufacturers with decades of experience in squeezing out efficiencies (and amortizing equipment and plants over long production runs).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith EV competition heating up, and \u003ca href=\"https://qz.com/1695602/the-average-electric-vehicle-is-getting-cheaper-in-the-us/\"\u003emedian EV prices falling\u003c/a\u003e, the dominance of the Model 3 is no longer as sure as it seemed when it launched. Tesla is now aiming to sell as many as 400,000 cars this year, many of them the Model 3. As of last quarter, it was not quite halfway to its goal, having \u003ca href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2019/07/27/tesla-model-3-set-to-grab-global-1-premium-vehicle-spot-in-2020-crushing-mercedes-c-class-bmw-3-series/\"\u003esold 158,375 cars\u003c/a\u003e over the first half of this year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;It may not be when the Model 3 surpasses the Leaf but if,\u0026#8221; says Undercoffler. Much rests on whether demand for Model 3 has peaked, and whether the Model Y steals away future growth. Nissan isn\u0026#8217;t sitting idle. Its new 226-mile-range battery (up from 150 miles) promises to push Leaf sales up even as popularity of the current model has grown. \u0026#8220;The Model 3 will have its work cut out for it if it hopes to someday catch the Leaf,\u0026#8221; says Undercoffler.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://qz.com/1703260/teslas-model-3-may-never-catch-up-to-the-nissan-leaf/","published":"2019-09-07T13:07:55Z","guid":"https://qz.com/1703260/auto-draft/"},{"title":"One of the biggest threats to children across the world begins in hospitals","content":"\u003cimg width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/RTXHE-e1567016474119.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;w=1024\" class=\"attachment-medium_10 size-medium_10 wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/RTXHE-e1567016474119.jpg 2622w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/RTXHE-e1567016474119.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/RTXHE-e1567016474119.jpg?resize=50,28 50w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/RTXHE-e1567016474119.jpg?resize=160,90 160w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/RTXHE-e1567016474119.jpg?resize=320,180 320w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/RTXHE-e1567016474119.jpg?resize=640,360 640w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/RTXHE-e1567016474119.jpg?resize=940,529 940w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/RTXHE-e1567016474119.jpg?resize=1600,900 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /\u003e\u003cp\u003eHave you ever seen an adult with a cleft lip?

Right now, policy changes are the surest way to improve access to surgery for children.\u003cem\u003e \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome low- and middle-income countries are adopting \u003ca href=\"https://www.pgssc.org/national-surgical-planning\"\u003eNational Surgical and Obstetric Plans\u003c/a\u003e (NSOAPs), a global health initiative created by government and private groups that focus on improving access to surgery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe NSOAP uses hospital and population data to outline how to scale up surgical services under the auspices of a broader national health plan. To date, multiple countries, primarily in Africa, have signed up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’ve also seen some forward-thinking medical NGOs begin to transition away from medical mission models—in which doctors from usually affluent countries spend short periods of time treating patients in less affluent countries during a temporary residency or training program—to more sustainable models, where physicians work to build a communities’ local capacity for surgery and anesthesia, instead of temporarily flying it in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut we still need more research and resources dedicated to training doctors for pediatric surgery and anesthesia in the developing world, where more children need it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis means focusing on programs that train surgeons, anesthesiologists, nurses and researchers, and building local hospitals that are supported under the guidance of local ministries of health.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis also means creating more practical incentives in the field of surgical medicine. The College of Surgeons of East, Central and Southern Africa has \u003ca href=\"http://www.cosecsa.org/\"\u003etrained over 650 local surgeons from Africa\u003c/a\u003e who pledge to serve their home villages as a condition of enrollment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOperation Smile, which has traditionally been a mission trip-based organization, has \u003ca href=\"https://www.operationsmile.org/press-release/operation-smile-announces-global-strategy-improve-access-safe-surgery?gclid=CjwKCAjwscDpBRBnEiwAnQ0HQMK-p08FhZP4Q8PuOdT4vbn3nLVQpcSr59-X0dN30HWpk3qfjw7-yBoCSAgQAvD_BwE\"\u003erecognized the need for strengthening health systems\u003c/a\u003e instead of supplementing them. In 2016 the organization committed to spending $250 million to increase surgical capacity in 40 countries. They have now supported pediatric and surgical hospitals in Nicaragua, Madagascar, Vietnam and India, and have trained pediatric surgeons and nurses in over 30 countries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’ve made some great strides in reducing global child mortality. Worldwide \u003ca href=\"https://data.unicef.org/topic/child-survival/under-five-mortality/\"\u003erates have fallen by more than half since\u003c/a\u003e 1990.

Wants to Give Landlords Even More Power Over People With Criminal Records","content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWant the best of VICE News straight to your inbox? \u003ca href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/page/subscribe-to-the-vice-news-daily-brief\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSign up here.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e Landlords have a lot of power. They can, for example, deny renters’ applications for housing for a slew of reasons, including having a criminal history. Now, the Trump administration wants to take away one of the only tools available to people with criminal records in their fight for fair housing — and give landlords even greater ability to discriminate. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e Under federal law, people can sue landlords if they're denied housing based on their criminal histories — particularly if the crime is old or unrelated to housing. But the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) proposed a new rule last month that would give landlords a free pass if they hired a third-party company to vet their applicants, which as many as 90% of landlords do, according to experts. The companies use software to analyze prospective tenants’ credit and criminal histories and give landlords a recommendation about whether to offer them a lease. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e The new rule, which could go into effect as early as October, would allow landlords to avoid legal liability for acting on the recommendations provided to them — even in cases where they deny housing to someone with a decade-old shoplifting charge. And those decisions could disproportionately affect people of color and turn deny housing to those who need it the most. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e “If you take away all these restrictions, and give landlords carte blanche to just turn people down willy nilly for whatever they want ... it’s going to fall on people who have those records more often,” said Eric Dunn, the National Housing Law Project’s Director of Litigation. “So it’s going to be African Americans, it’s going to be Latinos.” \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e While people with criminal histories aren’t a protected class under the Fair Housing Act, the seminal 1968 law that still guides housing law today, previous presidential administrations have tried to make discriminating against tenants more difficult. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"article__pull-quote\"\u003e\"It is a form of proxy discrimination to prohibit someone solely based on their possession of a criminal record.\"\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e In 2016, for example, then-HUD chief Julian Castro issued guidelines about blanket policies refusing to rent to someone based on their criminal history. They could, in some cases, violate federal law, because race is a protected class and people of color have disproportionately high incarceration rates. (African Americans, for example, are incarcerated \u003ca href=\"https://www.naacp.org/criminal-justice-fact-sheet/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003efive times more frequently\u003c/a\u003e than white people.) \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e But when current HUD Secretary Ben Carson announced the proposed change, he argued the new rules would clarify the law. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e “At the end of the day, this rule not only increases Americans’ access to fair and affordable housing, but also permits businesses and local governments to make valid policy choices,” \u003ca href=\"https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_19_122\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehe said.\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e But the algorithms tenant screening companies use to make rental decisions on behalf of landlords are inherently discriminatory, according to experts. That’s because the “risk factors” they use to judge an applicant’s rental worthiness include factors like credit history and eviction records, both of which incarceration can affect. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e For example, nearly half of all people convicted of a crime are unable to pay the court fines and fees and become saddled with debt, research by a coalition of \u003ca href=\"https://ellabakercenter.org/sites/default/files/downloads/who-pays.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eprison reform groups shows\u003c/a\u003e. And when people are incarcerated, they can’t build credit or make existing payments, which lowers their credit scores.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e “The common thread logically is that, because our system of mass incarceration disproportionately targets African Americans, it is a form of proxy discrimination to prohibit someone solely based on their possession of a criminal record,” Wanda Bertram, a staffer at the Prison Policy Initiative, said.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e A spokesperson for HUD declined to comment.\u003c/p\u003e \u003ch2\u003e Green flag, red flag \u003c/h2\u003e \u003cp\u003e Pre-internet, landlords who received written applications from prospective tenants had to do their own recon. But the use of rental screening companies has \u003ca href=\"https://www.multifamilyexecutive.com/property-management/transunion-landlords-report-profitable-attractive-conditions_o\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eexploded over the last two decades\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e As more personal information became available online, the tenant screening industry boomed: Background check companies started to offer screening reports with 50-state searches of criminal histories and eviction records. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e As more of these companies began to pop up, they also needed to distinguish themselves from others on the market. So some of them started to tell landlords that, not only would they provide them with background information about the prospective tenant, they would also provide landlords with a decision about whether they should rent to a certain applicant.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e “The landlord will basically just get basically a green flag: rent to the person, or red flag: turn them down. And the landlord may not have access to information that’s based on,” Dunn said.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e In some cases, that means tenants are turned away from housing for having once committed a crime that isn’t housing related, or one so old that they give no indication about the kind of person you’d be renting to, Dunn said.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e But in March, a federal judge in Connecticut ruled that, because tenant screening companies make rental recommendations on behalf of landlords, they \u003ca href=\"https://files.constantcontact.com/f10f35b7601/8a7e3281-7561-41f6-82be-c4f9be53a87a.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehave to comply with\u003c/a\u003e fair housing laws.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e The decision came after a housing advocacy organization sued tenant screening company CoreLogic, which suggested that a disabled Latino man should not be allowed to move in with his elderly mother because he had a “disqualifying criminal record.” But the extent of that criminal record was a shoplifting charge that was later dropped. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e HUD’s new proposal would undermine the precedent set by that case, though a coalition of national housing nonprofits have already \u003ca href=\"https://www.fightforhousingjustice.org/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003elaunched a campaign\u003c/a\u003e to fight the administration’s proposal. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e “Obviously, it has very significant implications for the future of rental screening,” Dunn said. “Because really, fair housing laws are the only real regulations that impose any kind of limits on who housing providers can accept and turn down.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv data-iframely-id=\"oEuuLb3\" data-embedded-url=\"https://video.vice.com/en_us/video/the-cost-of-climate-change-in-miami-beach/58af6d1d1ba6f12311b0e322\" class=\"article__embed article__embed--iframely\"\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;\" data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"\u003e\u003ciframe data-img=\"\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/oEuuLb3\" style=\"border:0;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;\" allowfullscreen allow=\"encrypted-media\" data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eCover image: Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson speaks during a news conference after touring the Hollins House, a high rise building housing seniors and persons with disabilities, during a trip to Baltimore, Wednesday, July 31, 2019.

King was living in Bangor when he wrote \u003cem\u003eIT \u003c/em\u003eand used the city as inspiration for Derry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;At the time I started writing \u003cem\u003eIT\u003c/em\u003e, the Howard murder had just happened.

And when it came to adapting \u003cem\u003eIT\u003c/em\u003e, that theme is still very present and important for me, the dark side of the human equation,\u0026#8221; he says. \u0026#8220;Leaving bigotry and homophobia and that kind of violence out would not only not be accurate to the times that we\u0026#8217;re living in, it would be omitting something that is still happening to this day and is horrible.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhether and how to depict certain types of violence onscreen is a much debated question. The issue has come up recently with portrayals of violence against women\u0026mdash;as in Hulu\u0026#8217;s adaptation of \u003cem\u003eThe Handmaid\u0026#8217;s Tale\u003c/em\u003e and the recent movie \u003ca href=\"https://time.com/5641192/the-nightingale-violence-women-in-film/\" \u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Nightingale\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. In the case of \u003cem\u003eIT Chapter 2\u003c/em\u003e, some have already taken issue with Muschietti\u0026#8217;s decision to include the scene. \u003ca href=\"https://slate.com/culture/2019/09/it-chapter-two-homophobic-killing-charlie-howard-opening-scene.html\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eSlate\u003c/em\u003e\u0026#8216;s Jeffrey Bloomer\u003c/a\u003e writes that Adrian\u0026#8217;s death is a \u0026#8220;gay-bashing scene\u0026#8221; that \u0026#8220;exploits a ghastly real-life killing for a cheap shock, delivered without context or any clear thematic underpinning.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe goes on to say that the fact that King included the scene in the book doesn\u0026#8217;t necessitate the treatment it receives in the movie. \u0026#8220;That a type of crime still happens in real life does not mean extremely graphic depictions of it are always justified,\u0026#8221; Bloomer writes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough it is barely mentioned again in the movie, the violent incident is treated as a precursor to the character arc of Richie Tozier, played by Bill Hader as an adult and \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://time.com/5617328/stranger-things-season-3-review/\" \u003eStranger Things\u003c/a\u003e\u0026#8216; \u003c/em\u003eFinn Wolfhard as a child. \u0026#8220;It sets up a canvas.

But it\u0026#8217;s not until Richie is back in Derry retrieving a specific, personal token that each Loser needs in order to perform the ritual that will allow them to defeat It, that we glimpse his inner truth. While collecting the token \u0026mdash; for him, a literal token from the Derry arcade \u0026mdash; Richie flashes back to a memory from the summer of \u0026#8217;89 when he was playing a game with another boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two boys are getting along until the bully Henry Bowers (Nicholas Hamilton) walks in and it\u0026#8217;s revealed that the boy is Henry\u0026#8217;s cousin. Henry accuses Richie of hitting on his cousin, and the cousin immediately steps away and joins in hurling homophobic slurs at Richie. Richie then runs away from the arcade crying, only to be attacked in the town square by It, which has taken on the form of Derry\u0026#8217;s massive Paul Bunyan statue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;When we see the traumatic event that started the whole suppression, we see [Richie] being himself and beginning to realize who he is, and immediately he\u0026#8217;s pointed out and he\u0026#8217;s humiliated,\u0026#8221; Muschietti explains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter leaving the arcade as an adult, Richie again has an encounter with It in the town square during which It, as Pennywise, threatens to reveal Richie\u0026#8217;s \u0026#8220;dirty little secret,\u0026#8221; implying that he will out him as gay. Muschietti says that this scene was intended to convey just how deeply Richie fears people learning the truth about his sexual orientation. \u0026#8220;We reintroduce [Richie] as someone who has built a persona around himself. For him, it\u0026#8217;s very important that people think that he has a girlfriend,\u0026#8221; Muschietti says. \u0026#8220;And in time, we understand what his fear is: He\u0026#8217;s afraid of being exposed because he had a traumatic event in the past that he never worked through.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the movie progresses, it becomes clear that Richie has long been harboring romantic feelings for Eddie (played by James Ransone as an adult and Jack Dylan Grazer as a child). In King\u0026#8217;s novel, the relationship between Richie and Eddie is an ambiguous one that has long inspired debate over whether the two shared either a mutual or a one-sided attraction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"inline-portrait_small_2x alignnone \"\u003e\u003cimg data-attachment-id=\"5663965\" data-permalink=\"https://time.com/5663676/it-chapter-2-ending-ritual-of-chud/it-chapter-two-ending/\" data-orig-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/it-chapter-two-ending.jpeg?quality=85\" data-orig-size=\"5229,3485\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"It-Chapter-Two-Ending\" data-image-description=\"p(L-r) Bill Hader as Richie Tozier and James Ransone as Eddie Kaspbrak in ‘It Chapter Two’/p\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/it-chapter-two-ending.jpeg?quality=85\u0026w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/it-chapter-two-ending.jpeg?quality=85\u0026w=600\" src=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/it-chapter-two-ending.jpeg?w=560\u0026#038;quality=85\u0026#038;h=373\" alt=\"(L-r) Bill Hader as Richie Tozier and James Ransone as Eddie Kaspbrak in 'It Chapter Two'\" height=\"373\"\u003e\n\u003cfigcaption class=\"image-caption\" \u003e\u003cspan class=\"credit\" \u003eBrooke Palmer\u0026mdash;Warner Bros.

But it never flourished because probably Eddie wasn\u0026#8217;t gay and especially because Richie was never able to come out\u0026#8221; he says. \u0026#8220;Because of that traumatic event in the past, at the time when puberty hit him and he normally would\u0026#8217;ve started acting upon his leanings or sexual identity, he didn\u0026#8217;t.

Louis Petizman of Conde Nast\u0026#8217;s LGBTQ publication \u003ca href=\"https://www.them.us/story/it-chapter-two\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eThem\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e writes that while the movie improves upon the book in terms of LGBTQ representation, it still misses the mark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;While the film\u0026rsquo;s slightly more overt queerness is a step in the right direction, particularly in the context of King\u0026rsquo;s LGBTQ+ track record, it\u0026rsquo;s not exactly a milestone for queer inclusion,\u0026#8221; Peitzman writes. \u0026#8220;In fact, there\u0026rsquo;s something retrograde about Richie and Eddie\u0026rsquo;s storyline. Because the revelation of Richie\u0026rsquo;s feelings for Eddie only comes at the film\u0026rsquo;s very end, without clarity as to whether either of them ever explored their queerness.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe movie, which may be headed for a $100-million opening weekend box office, is sure to continue to inspire debate as to its treatment of Adrian\u0026rsquo;s violent death, Richie and Eddie\u0026rsquo;s relationship and the ways in which it both adheres to and diverges from King\u0026rsquo;s version. For Muschietti, Richie\u0026rsquo;s final scene represents something he hopes will inspire optimism in viewers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Eddie meets a tragic end, Richie is driven nearly insane with grief. But in the wake of that loss, Muschietti says that Richie\u0026#8217;s final scene \u0026mdash; tracing back over the \u0026ldquo;R+E\u0026rdquo; he carved into Derry\u0026rsquo;s kissing bridge as a child \u0026mdash; is meant to symbolize a new chapter in his life. \u0026#8220;Something changed there,\u0026#8221; Muschietti explains. \u0026#8220;And by re-carving it, he\u0026#8217;s somehow accepting [himself].

However, they\u0026#8217;re unaware that part of the hold that It has on Derry is It\u0026#8217;s ability to make people forget the atrocities It has committed, especially those who move away from the town.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCut to \u003cem\u003eIT\u003c/em\u003e: \u003cem\u003eChapter Two\u003c/em\u003e, a.k.a. 27 years after the events of the first movie, and we learn that the Losers have all moved away and forgotten nearly everything about their lives in Derry. That is, with the exception of Mike, who never left Derry and has found ways to force himself to remember what happened. Following Adrian Mellon\u0026#8217;s (Xavier Dolan) murder in the opening scene of the movie, it\u0026#8217;s Mike who calls up his fellow Losers to alert them of It\u0026#8217;s return, kickstarting their memories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe knowledge that It has returned proves too much for Stan (Andy Bean), who dies by suicide almost immediately after taking Mike\u0026#8217;s call.

Once there, Mike drugs Bill\u0026#8217;s drink with a hallucinogenic root that was given to him by a Native American tribe he visited to try to learn more about It. He goes on to reveal that he spent several years chasing down every possible lead on It, a search that led him to the descendants of the Native Americans who inhabited the future site of Derry at the time of It\u0026rsquo;s arrival.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike then pulls out a Native American artifact that he stole from the tribe, which is covered in markings that reveal the origins of It. What follows is a trippy animated sequence in which Bill sees a vision of It crash-landing on Earth in an event similar to an asteroid impact. Although It arrives in its true form of the \u003ca href=\"https://stephenking.fandom.com/wiki/Deadlights\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003eDeadlights\u003c/a\u003e, Bill watches as It transforms into a bird before rapidly shifting between a number of grotesque forms while preying upon the ancestors of the Native American tribe that Mike sought out. The tribe is then shown standing around the artifact as a fire burns inside it, signifying that they are performing the Ritual of Ch\u0026uuml;d. Unfortunately, they are only able to trap It with the ceremony instead of killing It for good. (Or so Mike says \u0026mdash; more on that later.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike is convinced that if the Losers recreate the ritual, they will be able to stop It\u0026#8217;s reign of terror forever. But to do this, they first need to each collect a token from their childhood that they can burn inside the artifact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scene from the movie in which Mike explains the Ritual of Ch\u0026uuml;d to Bill is based on a chapter in King\u0026#8217;s book in which the child Losers decide to perform an \u0026#8220;Indian ceremony\u0026#8221; that involves filling up their clubhouse with smoke to create a \u0026#8220;smoke-hole.\u0026#8221; Once the others can no longer endure the smoke, Mike and Ritchie are left alone inside the clubhouse, and both experience a vision of It\u0026#8217;s arrival on Earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the book, there are no Native Americans who teach Mike about the Ritual of Ch\u0026uuml;d. It\u0026#8217;s only mentioned in passing that the idea for the smoke-hole came from a book about Native Americans that Ben was reading while researching It.

Despite the fact that nearly all of them have a solo encounter with It in the process, Bill makes it back with Georgie\u0026#8217;s paper sailboat, Bev with the haiku that Ben wrote for her when they were kids, Richie with a literal token from the arcade, Eddie with his inhaler, Ben with the page from his yearbook that Bev signed and Mike with the rock that Bev hit Henry Bowers with to save him as a kid.

However, It then breaks out and it\u0026#8217;s revealed that Mike lied: The Native Americans who first attempted to trap It were all slaughtered by It because they didn\u0026#8217;t truly believe the ritual would work. Mike was convinced that the Losers\u0026#8217; belief that they could defeat It would protect them just as it seemed to at the end of the first movie. It then transforms into its final form, a massive clown-spider hybrid, and the battle of wills between the Losers and It truly begins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the book, King emphasizes that the power of belief is the only thing that gives the Losers a fighting chance against It. But having lost their childish imaginations in the 27 years since they first battled It, to actually kill It as adults, the Losers need to dig a little deeper than they did as children.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThanks to illusions created by It, each of the Losers finds him- or herself in a situation in which they\u0026#8217;re forced to face down what they fear the most.

But they still have to face the clown-spider hybrid. When Richie gets caught in the Deadlights, Eddie hurls the fence post from the Neibolt house \u0026mdash; that Bev told him \u0026#8220;kills monsters if you believe it does\u0026#8221; \u0026mdash; at spider-Pennywise, wounding It and releasing Richie from his trance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut while Eddie stands over Richie celebrating his triumph, It runs him through with a spiked tentacle and flings him through the air.

After finally realizing that the key to It\u0026#8217;s defeat is that It must abide by the laws of nature concerning whatever form it takes, the Losers channel their strengths of will to force It to take forms that they will be able to physically defeat, like that of the old woman and the clown. Just as It has always wielded the power of belief against the Losers by making them believe that it\u0026#8217;s the incarnation of their greatest fears, the Losers are able to turn this power back around on It.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike King\u0026#8217;s novel, \u003cem\u003eIT Chapter \u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003eTwo \u003c/em\u003erelies heavily on the idea that without belief, there\u0026#8217;s no such thing as fear.

Richie is beside himself and the others are forced to drag him away from Eddie\u0026#8217;s body to escape It\u0026#8217;s lair as it collapses in on itself.

updated Thinkbook. That's not a derogatory statement—the Thinkbook 13s is quite attractive, and I wouldn't guess that it's a notebook with a $734 starting price. It has a slate gray color scheme that uses a lighter gray color on its anodized aluminum chassis, a darker gray on its keycaps, and shiny accents on the edges of the trackpad and a few other locations.

closes $8.6M round for its platform aimed to help retail investors","content":"\u003cp id=\"speakable-summary\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.primarybid.com\"\u003ePrimaryBid\u003c/a\u003e, a UK-regulated platform connecting publicly listed companies with everyday investors for discounted share issuances has previously raised $3M. It\u0026#8217;s now upped those stakes with an $8.6M funding round, led by UK VCs \u003ca href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/pentech-ventures\"\u003ePentech\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/outward-vc\"\u003eOutward VC\u003c/a\u003e with participation from new and existing investors. Craig Anderson, a partner at Pentech, will join the PrimaryBidBoard of Directors with Outward VC having a Board Observer seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis investment is representative of the trend towards unpacking complex financial investment products for the average person, especially in the UK.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003ca href=\"https://www.fca.org.uk\"\u003eFCA\u003c/a\u003e-regulated platform recently made a long-term commercial agreement with Euronext, the leading pan-European exchange in the Eurozone. The partnership gives the company access to nine new geographies, with the first new site launching in France later this year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCommenting, Anand Sambasivan, co-founder and CEO of PrimaryBid, said:  “Everyday investors are a vital part of the stock market and yet unable to buy discounted share deals – a longstanding imbalance in the public markets. This is true whether it is a government selling down its holding in a large company or a quoted company is raising growth capital.  Our platform addresses this challenge, giving small investors the same access as traditionally afforded to large institutional investors.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInvestors can tap into PrimaryBid’s centralizing infrastructure that allows access to everyday investors as part of a share issuance, including block sales.  The inclusion of retail investors can improve pricing and liquidity outcomes for their clients. The company’s solution allows private investors to participate, at the same time and the same price, delivering open access regardless of the size of their investment. The service is free of charge for investors, from £100 upwards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrimaryBid doesn\u0026#8217;t have competitors because Retail investors have not previously had access to discounted equity offerings run by investment banks. This is because the retail investment market is too fragmented, and these deals are highly time-sensitive. As a result, only clients of Investment Banks (i.e. institutional investors) could previously access these attractive deals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo now, listed companies that want to raise more capital on the stock exchange by issuing new shares can now connect with retail investors and offer these retail investors these shares at the same discounted rates as those offered to institutional investors. \u0026#8220;In the past, these retail investors just couldn\u0026#8217;t access these attractive deals for these new shares,” explains Sambasivan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCraig Anderson of Pentech said: “We believe equity capital markets infrastructure is dominated by an institutional focus and is not geared for retail investors, which unfairly restricts consumer access to the primary equity markets.  PrimaryBid addresses this problem by using technology to democratize the equity capital markets to provide a new asset class to retail investors.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKevin Chong of Outward VC said: “By bringing publicly listed companies directly to ordinary investors, PrimaryBid addresses increasing frustrations felt by equity issuers and potentially expands global equity markets to the benefit of all players \u0026#8211; investors, issuers and investment bank advisers.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePentech previously invested in Nutmeg (which recently closed a £45m funding round led by \u003ca class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/goldman-sachs\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"goldman-sachs\"\u003eGoldman Sachs) \u003cspan class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.

That money might have previously been spent on acquiring access to underage girls, or murder, or espionage, but now it is being spent on something productive, something useful. Isn’t that ultimately a net win for society?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat culture of fundraising is under an exacting microscope this week after \u003ca href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/614264/mit-media-lab-jeffrey-epstein-joi-ito-nicholas-negroponte-funding-sex-abuse/\"\u003ethe MIT Technology Review reported\u003c/a\u003e that Nicholas Negroponte, the founder of the famed MIT Media Lab, would have continued to take convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein’s donations to the research center.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e[… He] said he had recommended that [Joichi Ito, the lab’s current director] take Epstein’s money. “If you wind back the clock,” he added, “I would still say, ‘Take it.’” And he repeated, more emphatically, “‘\u003ci\u003eTake it\u003c/i\u003e.’”\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe comments, made during a meeting of the lab’s staff, shocked many of the participants, with some angrily replying in the heat of the moment. As the Review noted, “Kate Darling, a research scientist at the MIT Media Lab, shouted, ‘Nicholas, shut up!’ Negroponte responded that he would not shut up and that he had founded the Lab, to which Darling said, ‘We’ve been cleaning up your messes for the past eight years.’”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEpstein funded projects widely in the tech world \u003ca href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/154826/jeffrey-epsteins-intellectual-enabler\"\u003ethrough the Edge Foundation\u003c/a\u003e and other initiatives, and \u003ca href=\"http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/07/jeffrey-epstein-high-society-contacts.html\"\u003ehis acquaintances read like a who’s-who of tech luminaries\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet, this week’s controversy over fundraising is hardly novel.

Through \u003ca href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/04/wtf-is-cfius/\"\u003ethe modernization of legal tools like CFIUS\u003c/a\u003e, to \u003ca href=\"https://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/articles/2019/8/20/pentagon-to-roll-out-trusted-capital-marketplace-this-fall\"\u003ethe Pentagon’s creation of a Trusted Capital Marketplace\u003c/a\u003e, to reversals of acquisitions like \u003ca href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/27/report-grindrs-chinese-owner-kunlun-is-selling-the-dating-app-after-cfius-raised-personal-data-concerns/\"\u003ethe unwinding of Chinese company Kunlun’s purchase of gay dating app Grindr\u003c/a\u003e, the government has repeatedly been telling entrepreneurs: it matters where your capital comes from.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIndeed, that’s the very quandary that Silicon Valley is facing these days. Its amoral view of capital is increasingly clashing with the reality that it matters a whole heck of a lot where that capital comes from. And it is about time that founders and investors take responsibility for cleaning up a capital base that has become more and more squalid over time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy can’t capital just be immoral? Well, Epstein’s web of donations provided him with a philanthropic sheen that eased access to the highest echelons of society while he committed his crimes. Saudi Arabia is \u003ca href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/saudi-backlash-threatens-u-s-startups-1539707574\"\u003ethe largest investor in Silicon Valley\u003c/a\u003e not only because it drives a return and diversifies its oil-dependent economy, but also because it can Valley-wash the horrific rights abuses and atrocities it commits against all of its citizens, including women, LGBT people, and immigrants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(But hey, \u003ca href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-49208737\"\u003ewomen can drive now\u003c/a\u003e, just in time for autonomous vehicles.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis amoral versus moral view of capital is just the classic debate in philosophy between utilitarianism versus \u003ca href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-deontological/\"\u003edeontological duties\u003c/a\u003e, but Silicon Valley has almost exclusively chosen the former rather than the latter. My bank asks me more questions about my $50 deposits than many founders ask about where that $500 million check comes from.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s perhaps understandable in context. Founders — as with non-profit leaders — fundraise around-the-clock. When a check finally arrives, they don’t bother to ask a bunch of due diligence questions. They just want that money to hit the bank and get back to building what they were intending to the entire time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s a mode of operating that continues to the present day. I was chatting with a founder this week, and during demo day last week, he got an emailed check for $50,000 from an investor in the audience. It was amazing, he said with exclamation points to me, and it sounded like he just added the check to the pile he had accumulated. Who is this person? Do we know where his capital comes from? Is there going to be some scandal that shocks the startup in a couple of years? Yet the excitement was palpable — the round was closed, and it was the easiest $50,000 ever fundraised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose diligence questions probably didn’t need to be asked a decade or two in the Valley, back when a few dozen firms mostly raised from blue-chip university and non-profit endowments as well as state pension funds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday though, there are all kinds of sources of capital, with little clarity about where the capital is coming from. Take, for instance, Carlos Ghosn, who once headed Nissan Motors and is \u003ca href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/carlos-ghosn-indicted-on-new-charges-of-misappropriating-funds-11555911045\"\u003ecurrently on trial in Japan for a variety of financial crimes\u003c/a\u003e. He has been \u003ca href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/carlos-ghosn-ran-tech-fundusing-millions-from-an-executive-at-a-nissan-partner-11566836112\"\u003eaccused of embezzling millions of dollars for a VC fund run by his son\u003c/a\u003e by running a kickback scheme through a Nissan distributor in Lebanon. As \u003ca href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/carlos-ghosn-ran-tech-fundusing-millions-from-an-executive-at-a-nissan-partner-11566836112\"\u003ethe Wall Street Journal reported\u003c/a\u003e a little more than a week ago:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn March 2015, the Ghosns set up in Delaware an investment vehicle called Shogun Investments, which Mr. Ghosn described as a fund that would invest in Silicon Valley startups. Mr. Ghosn was majority owner while his son, Anthony, held a stake, according to people familiar with the matter. The younger Mr. Ghosn, who was about to graduate from Stanford University, was working at the time as chief of staff for Silicon Valley venture capitalist Joe Lonsdale, providing the elder Mr. Ghosn a close-up view of the tech investment world. The lofty returns had stunned him, according to one of the people.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat fund would go on to fund some of the most well-known unicorns in the world:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Following our phone conversation, I ordered a transfer of $3 million,” Carlos Ghosn wrote in a December 2017 email to his son, who was 22 years old at the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf that amount, $2 million was for an investment in Grab, a Southeast Asian competitor to Uber Technologies Inc., Mr. Ghosn wrote, adding that he was sending “$1 million for the company of your friend that you think will do very well.” It wasn’t clear which company Mr. Ghosn was referring to.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would love a world in which founders asked all the right due diligence questions. I would love for them to inquire about limited partners, about how wealth was created, and how it has been invested. But I am also aware that in what can be a desperate search for funds, those questions may well never get asked in the first place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you want to stop the capital laundering taking place every day in the Valley, you have to create active, real-time antidotes. That means stopping it at every point of contact, every single opportunity where it can infect the ecosystem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so, we need better systems as a community and as an ecosystem to cleanse ourselves of this dirty money. We need “know-your-capital” processes that are standardized, robust, and accurate so that every check can be verified before it hits the bank. We need tools to verify that a startup or non-profit has actually followed those KYC processes, so that employees don’t suddenly show up at work and realize they are making money for a bunch of murderers. It’s “trust but verify.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSystematization and process are key to execution, but that doesn’t disclaim the responsibility for the Valley’s leaders to take a moral stance here. Utilitarianism only takes you so far — it does matter that you take capital from a bad actor. Negroponte is wrong to say that he would still take Epstein’s money, regardless of what that capital might have funded at the MIT Media Lab.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking responsibility for your capital is part of being a leader of an organization today.

This type of quiet shutdown has become an expected and unfortunate trend in the smart home space. Running these platforms in-house can sound like a great, cost-saving idea at first, but doing so over months and years appears to be difficult and costly. Customers are then left hung out to dry when the platforms are inevitably shuttered. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"dKZ9n9\"\u003eWe saw the same exact scenario play out like this earlier this year, when Lowe’s decided to \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/2/18208407/lowes-iris-smart-home-platform-shutting-down-march-2019\"\u003estop supporting its Iris smart home platform\u003c/a\u003e and instead send its customers over to Samsung’s Smart Things instead.

Hisense UK will release its first TVs powered by Roku in the fourth quarter of this year. Previously, Roku’s television operating system has only been used in the US market where it’s been featured in TVs from TCL, Sharp, and Hisense’s US arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"5848mF\"\u003eWe’ve always liked Roku’s TV operating system, so it’s great to see it launch outside of the US.

So he pulled the number down to 300,000 and dismissed it as inconsequential. “Here’s another bit of context on those 300,000 additional workers: The U.S. economy gained nearly 450,000 employees just in the months of June and July,” he wrote. “In context, and properly counted, it’s a real stretch to speak of ‘enormous’ job losses.” His economically ignorant assessment\u003ca href=\"https://www.epi.org/blog/four-pinocchios-for-the-washington-post-fact-checker/\"\u003e was ridiculed\u003c/a\u003e, clicks successfully driven to the Post.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the firestorm of protest has risen to its highest levels yet in the heat of the 2020 presidential campaign.

The statement compared “apples to oranges,” he argued, because “people in the bottom half have essentially no wealth, as debts cancel out whatever assets they might have.” Kessler is smart enough to know that the explicit suggestion that rich people and poor people simply can’t be compared to each other is wildly offensive, especially in a nation that fancies itself not to have rigid class distinctions.

Blauhaus, a libertarian economist, published a study in 2018 that included a data point Democrats seized on: If enacted, he concluded, \u003ca href=\"https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/2018/07/30/mercatus-study-finds-medicare-for-all-saves-2-trillion/\"\u003eMedicare for All would save $2 trillion \u003c/a\u003eover a 10-year period, compared to current health care spending projections.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Democrats pounced on the irony that even a Koch-backed think tank confirmed that Medicare for All reduced health care spending, Kessler fact-checked the claim. He went back to the embarrassed Blauhaus, who said that no matter what his study said, he didn’t believe that it would be possible to enact the Medicare for All bill as Sanders had written it. To pass it through Congress, he argued, reimbursement rates would need to be increased, which would then cost more money. Kessler wrote that he was siding with the author of the study. “All too often,” he wrote, “politicians mischaracterize conclusions that are contained in academic or think tank studies. At the Fact Checker, we rely heavily on how a study’s author says the data should be presented.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, to recap, a Medicare for All opponent is given the leeway to change the presentation of his non-peer-reviewed white paper, but Himmelstein is not, even though his editorial went through the peer-review process. “Apparently they implement that policy when it’s convenient for them,” Himmelstein told me. No explanation other than the blinders of ideology explain such disparate treatment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough Kessler had checked, \u003ca href=\"https://beta.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2018/08/07/democrats-seize-on-cherry-picked-claim-that-medicare-for-all-will-save-2-trillion/\"\u003ein that case\u003c/a\u003e, a statement made by Andrew Gillum, Sanders was mentioned in the piece, and a spokesperson, Warren Gunnels, called to complain. “I’ve known Chuck for years, and I trust what he has to say,” Kessler told him, according to Gunnels. Case closed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHimmelstein demanded a retraction, saying that the false claim that the editorial wasn’t peer-reviewed “besmirched” his reputation. The \u0026#8220;Fact Checker\u0026#8221; refused to issue a correction, saying that its language — “the editorial did not undergo the same peer-reviewed editing process as a research article” — was technically correct, as the processes are different.

it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis would mean only two or three committee-vetted candidates who \u0026#8220;love the country\u0026#8221; would be able to run \u0026#8211; and proved the final straw

as a figure who initially reached out to the country\u0026#8217;s white population after the long war between black guerrillas and the white rulers of Rhodesia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTourism and mining flourished and Zimbabwe was a regional breadbasket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut a brutal military campaign waged against an uprising in western Matabeleland in the mid-198os, in which thousands died, signalled a bitter turn in Zimbabwe\u0026#8217;s fortunes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the years went by, Mugabe was widely accused of hanging on to power through violence and vote fraud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe country began experiencing severe economic problems traced to a campaign to evict white farmers from their land in the early 2000s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLand reform was supposed to take much of the country\u0026#8217;s most fertile land owned by about 4,500 white descendants of mainly British and South African colonial-era settlers and redistribute it to poor blacks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_9874573\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 668px\"\u003e\u003cimg

killed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe action served to undermine the already battered economy as Zimbabwe\u0026#8217;s once valuable agricultural industry fell into

Warned by Putin 2 Days before 9/11: Ex-Official","content":"\u003cp\u003eThe warning is mentioned by George Beebee, a senior Bush-era CIA analyst, in his book titled “The Russia Trap: How Our Shadow War with Russia Could Spiral into Nuclear Catastrophe,” which was released earlier this week, according to RT.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Putin had telephoned President Bush two days before the attacks to warn that Russian intelligence has detected signs of an incipient terrorist campaign, ‘something long in preparation,’ coming out of Afghanistan,” reads part of the book.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough Moscow’s warning to Washington has been public knowledge for years as top Russian intelligence officials talked about them shortly after the incident, Beebee suggested Bush had been warned by Putin personally meaning that it was not just limited to exchange between the intelligence agencies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe September, 11, 2001 attacks, also known as \u003ca href=\"http://physics911.net/\"\u003ethe 9/11 attacks\u003c/a\u003e, were a series of strikes in the US which killed nearly 3,000 people and caused about $10 billion worth of property and infrastructure damage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUS officials assert that the attacks were carried out by 19 al-Qaeda terrorists but many experts have raised questions about the official account.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey believe that rogue elements within the US government, such as former Vice President Dick Cheney, orchestrated or at least encouraged the 9/11 attacks in order to accelerate the US war machine and advance the Zionist agenda.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition to Russia, Britain’s intelligence service and that of the United States itself had also warned of such an incident, however, it remains a mystery whether the White House heeded those warnings and did anything to prevent it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCondoleezza Rice, then national security adviser and later secretary of state, also hinted at the mindset of the White House officials at the time in her memoirs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn ‘No Higher Honor,’ Rice did say that she had ignored an earlier warning from Putin about Saudi-funded extremists in Pakistan that the Russian president then said would cause a “major catastrophe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRice wrote, after
