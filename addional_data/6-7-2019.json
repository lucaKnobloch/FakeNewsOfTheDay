The 30-year-old medical plastics industry salesperson living in the Utrecht province of the Netherlands initially planned to pick up his metallic blue Model 3 from a Tesla facility in Tilburg about 90 kilometers (56 miles) from home before finding out he’d been chosen for direct delivery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe program, called Tesla Direct, offers some buyers of the \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2018/05/21/tesla-model-3-consumer-reports-recommendation-brakes-brakes-test/\"\u003eModel 3\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/2019/03/01/tesla-lower-prices-model-s-model-x/\"\u003eS, and X\u003c/a\u003e the option to have their car dropped off right to their home or office.

Several years ago, Power had a “typical” IT department—computers on desks, servers in the server room, and a team of technicians to service all of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut Wenhold saw some of the typical challenges emerging because the teams didn’t understand each other. “What I realized early on was language was a big barrier to getting people to work together,” he says. \u0026#8220;The way the technical people spoke about things and the way the businesspeople spoke about things, they had two separate lexicons—it was completely different.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo Power changed the name of the IT department to the “business technology” (or BT) department, and began to cross-train teams and departments so they understood the requirements and demands of each other’s jobs. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, after an HR platform vendor went bankrupt and Power\u0026#8217;s HR department lost a resource managing nearly 3,000 resumes received weekly. Working closely with the company’s director of talent acquisition to get another system up and running, Power paired with the new BT department to build Nitro, a proprietary technology platform that supports sales and marketing, accounting, human resources (HR), internal communications, and other areas. Nitro uses agile development processes that involve the business units depending on each offering. Power says building the platform was only possible because the company already had experience with successful cross-functional integration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt Walmart, McFarlane heads agile project management scrum teams to address many of the cross-functional issues that arise between IT and business teams. Projects are broken into smaller increments based on common understanding. Teams work quickly and iteratively, completing a certain amount of work on a project in a period of time. Then, regular check-ins identify issues, improvements, or new directions, educating the team members along the way and leaving little room for misunderstanding. “As you do the same sort of co-collaboration from start to finish, you can really try and bring those two entities or [two stakeholders] together,” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnother area of opportunity is soft-skills training, Layok says. Many of the problem areas the West Monroe survey uncovered could be improved with better communication and collaboration skills. The lack of skills led to delays and other disruptions. Human resources and IT leaders are starting to see the importance of written and verbal communication and the ability to work well with others, testing for such skills in the hiring process and developing them within their employee base, he says. But, there’s still a long way to go—just half of these leaders are working on soft skills development with their teams, he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBy breaking down the walls and skill deficiencies that separate IT teams from the business functions they support, companies can improve their performance on many fronts. In addition, team members that work well together and understand each other are more likely to remain engaged and be enthusiastic about the outcomes that have an impact on the entire business, Wenhold says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eMore must-read stories from \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—Here’s when \u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/2019/06/04/next-recession-2020-predictions/\"\u003emost economists think the next recession will happen\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—\u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/longform/single-family-home-ai-algorithms/\"\u003eMeet the A.I. landlord\u003c/a\u003e that’s building a single-family-home empire\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—Doctors can now give out \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/longform/montreal-museums-health-prescriptions\"\u003eprescriptions for a visit to the museum\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—This island escape is \u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/longform/pantelleria-italy-island/\"\u003eItaly’s best-kept secret\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—Will \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/06/28/facebook-libra-developing-world-india-africa/\"\u003eFacebook’s Libra\u003c/a\u003e become the go-to payment system where banks fall short?Subscribe to \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e’s \u003ca href=\"https://cloud.newsletters.fortune.com/fortune/nloptin?nl=CEO_DAILY\u0026amp;source=LinkStack\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eCEO Daily\u003c/em\u003e newsletter\u003c/a\u003e for the latest business news and analysis.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://fortune.com/2019/07/06/it-information-technology-internal-collaboration/","published":"2019-07-06T12:00:36Z","guid":"https://fortune.com/?p=2662555"},{"title":"‘Blue Bonds’: Selling Seychelles for the Seashore","content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCan we financially\u003c/strong\u003e engineer our way out of climate change and polluted oceans? Maybe not, but financial innovation is emerging as a popular tool to help in the race to protect the planet. Last year, the market for “green bonds,” a decade-old asset class that funds environmentally friendly projects, reached a record $163.7 billion, up from $36.6 billion issued in 2014, according to the Climate Bonds Initiative, an international not-for-profit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow there is a wave of novel financial instruments aimed at saving the oceans and alleviating the world’s water crises. They include “blue bonds,” which, structured like their chromatic cousins, are being used to raise money to tackle issues from the ocean’s plastic waste problem (Morgan Stanley recently sold $10 million worth) to wastewater management. Last year, Seychelles launched a multimillion-dollar blue bond, and the Nordic Investment Bank, on behalf of Baltic and Nordic countries, did so this year. “We’re just scratching the surface,” says Navindu Katugampola, head of green, social, and sustainability bonds at \u003ca href=\"http://content.fortune.com/fortune500/morgan-stanley-78/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMorgan Stanley\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeychelles, whose economy—largely, tourism and fish—heavily depend on healthy oceans, also did a groundbreaking deal with the international nonprofit The Nature Conservancy (TNC). In exchange for TNC purchasing and refinancing a chunk of the nation’s debt, the government committed to using the newly raised capital to protect and manage marine resources. TNC, which structured the deal like previous (and successful) debt-for-nature swaps in Latin America, plans to work with dozens of other coastal and island nations on similar financing maneuvers. Done right, says TNC’s Robert Weary, the whole “blue economy”—livelihoods and the environment—should be better off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eA version of this article appears in the July 2019 issue of Fortune with the headline \u0026#8220;Selling Seychelles for the Seashore.\u0026#8221;\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eMore must-read stories from \u003c/span\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eFortune\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eMeet the A.I. landlord that’s building a \u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/longform/single-family-home-ai-algorithms/\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003esingle-family-home empire\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eWhat \u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/06/28/jony-ive-leaving-apple-stock/\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eJony Ive’s departure\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e means for Apple’s stock\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/2019/06/18/facebook-project-libra-crypto-coin-cryptocurrency-how-it-works/\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e5 things to know\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e about Facebook’s new cryptocurrency, Libra\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eSwitzerland’s stock-trading standoff with the EU provides \u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/07/01/switzerland-eu-stock-exchanges-equivalence/\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ea glimpse of life after Brexit\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eWhen the \u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/2019/06/19/next-recession-assets-mortgage-rates/\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003enext recession hits\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e, four good things could happen\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDon\u0026#8217;t miss the daily \u003ca href=\"https://cloud.newsletters.fortune.com/fortune/nloptin?nl=TERM_SHEET\u0026amp;source=LinkStack\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eTerm Sheet\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ci\u003eFortune\u003c/i\u003e\u0026#8216;s newsletter on deals and dealmakers.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://fortune.com/2019/07/06/seychelles-blue-bonds/","published":"2019-07-06T14:00:48Z","guid":"https://fortune.com/?p=2663314"}]},{"url":"https://www.hotelbusiness.com/feed","items":[]},{"url":"https://rss.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Business.xml","items":[{"title":"Strong Jobs Report Eases Fears of Damage From Trade War","content":"","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/05/business/economy/june-jobs-report.html?emc=rss\u0026partner=rss","published":"2019-07-06T05:46:35Z","guid":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/05/business/economy/june-jobs-report.html"},{"title":"Mad Magazine, Irreverent Baby Boomer Humor Bible, Is All but Dead","content":"","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/05/business/media/mad-magazine-publication-demise.html?emc=rss\u0026partner=rss","published":"2019-07-06T02:45:33Z","guid":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/05/business/media/mad-magazine-publication-demise.html"},{"title":"Ben Barenholtz, Midnight-Movie Innovator, Is Dead at 83","content":"","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/05/movies/ben-barenholtz-dead.html?emc=rss\u0026partner=rss","published":"2019-07-06T01:43:29Z","guid":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/05/movies/ben-barenholtz-dead.html"},{"title":"Protests Over Incinerator Rattle Officials in Chinese City","content":"","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/05/world/asia/wuhan-china-protests.html?emc=rss\u0026partner=rss","published":"2019-07-06T04:34:54Z","guid":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/05/world/asia/wuhan-china-protests.html"},{"title":"‘Modern Slavery’ Ring in U.K. Ensnared up to 400 Polish People, Authorities Say","content":"","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/05/world/europe/uk-modern-slavery.html?emc=rss\u0026partner=rss","published":"2019-07-06T03:41:53Z","guid":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/05/world/europe/uk-modern-slavery.html"},{"title":"G.M.

Now, before anyone goes over-thinking this, it doesn\u0026#8217;t necessarily mean our Game of the Week pick is the highest scoring game in a review, the game with the best graphics, or really any other quantifiable \u0026#8220;best\" thing. Instead, it\u0026#8217;s more just us picking out the single game out of the week\u0026#8217;s releases that we think is the most noteworthy, surprising, interesting, or really any other hard to describe quality that makes it worth having if you were just going to pick up \u003cem\u003eone\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese picks might be controversial, and that\u0026#8217;s OK.

To pass each level you\u0026#8217;ll need to, well, sacrifice one or more of your own party members by utilizing each one\u0026#8217;s unique ability. The Knight can knock another party member with his sword, thus launching him across a level and to otherwise inaccessible areas. The Mage can freeze a party member into a block of ice that can be used as a platform. The Archer can shoot arrows which move objects or pin another party member to a wall to create a usable platform. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe real enjoyment in \u003cem\u003eTotal Party Kill\u003c/em\u003e is figuring out the clever ways in which each level is designed to utilize these various skills. Often you\u0026#8217;ll even need to combine a couple of your party members\u0026#8217; skills to create a combo effect that\u0026#8217;ll get you out of a jam. For instance, you may need to freeze the Knight using the Mage, but then use the Archer to shoot arrows at the frozen Knight to move that block of ice over to a button that will open up the exit door. It\u0026#8217;s basically a nonstop parade of levels that will make you smile once you realize the trick to solving them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"clear:both;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"video-responsive\"\u003e\n\t\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KWetBJd9rUE\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I had one criticism of \u003cem\u003eTotal Party Kill\u003c/em\u003e, it\u0026#8217;s that I enjoy it so much I wish there was more of it. There\u0026#8217;s 60 levels in total, but many of them are over really quickly and so far none have really tested my skills all that much. It\u0026#8217;s satisfying to figure out HOW to solve a level, but it\u0026#8217;s rarely a challenge to actually execute that solution. Which is expected as this is a puzzle game first and foremost, with platforming being secondary, but I wouldn\u0026#8217;t at all mind more levels, especially some with a more hardcore challenge. That said, what\u0026#8217;s here in the initial release of \u003cem\u003eTotal Party Kill\u003c/em\u003e is a total blast through and through, and it\u0026#8217;s free with ads on both iOS and \u003ca href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adventureislands.totalpartykill\"\u003eAndroid\u003c/a\u003e with a one-time IAP to remove them, so there\u0026#8217;s no reason not to check this one out for yourself right this minute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://toucharcade.com/2019/07/05/toucharcade-game-of-the-week-total-party-kill/","published":"2019-07-06T00:34:15Z","guid":"https://toucharcade.com/?p=255211"}]},{"url":"https://www.nintendolife.com/feeds/latest","items":[{"title":"Miyamoto Believes Nintendo Have Not Fallen Behind With VR","content":"","url":"https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/07/miyamoto_believes_nintendo_have_not_fallen_behind_with_vr","published":"2019-07-06T13:10:00Z","guid":"https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/07/miyamoto_believes_nintendo_have_not_fallen_behind_with_vr"},{"title":"Nintendo Intends To Create The Next Generation Of Controllers","content":"","url":"https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/07/nintendo_intends_to_create_the_next_generation_of_controllers","published":"2019-07-06T13:05:00Z","guid":"https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/07/nintendo_intends_to_create_the_next_generation_of_controllers"},{"title":"Nintendo Wants The Switch Business To Continue For As Long As Possible","content":"","url":"https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/07/nintendo_wants_the_switch_business_to_continue_for_as_long_as_possible","published":"2019-07-06T12:45:00Z","guid":"https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/07/nintendo_wants_the_switch_business_to_continue_for_as_long_as_possible"},{"title":"Nintendo Focusing On Switch Install Base To Combat Next-Gen Performance Gap","content":"","url":"https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/07/nintendo_focusing_on_switch_install_base_to_combat_next-gen_performance_gap","published":"2019-07-06T12:25:00Z","guid":"https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/07/nintendo_focusing_on_switch_install_base_to_combat_next-gen_performance_gap"},{"title":"Fire Emblem: Three Houses Director Reveals It Took Him 80 Hours To Complete One Pathway","content":"","url":"https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/07/fire_emblem_three_houses_director_reveals_it_took_him_80_hours_to_complete_one_pathway","published":"2019-07-06T11:30:00Z","guid":"https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/07/fire_emblem_three_houses_director_reveals_it_took_him_80_hours_to_complete_one_pathway"},{"title":"Anniversary: Pokémon GO Turns Three Years Old Today","content":"","url":"https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/07/anniversary_pokemon_go_turns_three_years_old_today","published":"2019-07-06T11:00:00Z","guid":"https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/07/anniversary_pokemon_go_turns_three_years_old_today"},{"title":"Talking Point: What Are You Playing This Weekend?

He cannot shut them to the fact that there is mixed up with the woman’s movement much mental disorder; and he cannot conceal from himself the physiological emergencies which lie behind.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThis particular concern had reverberated among male doctors for decades, with little to counter it. But at least one doctor—Mary Putnam Jacobi—saw the problem differently.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eAt the end of the 19th century, Edward Clarke, a physician in Boston, perceived an alarming shift in American culture: More and more women were enrolling in universities. He argued that women could not handle the rigors of higher education, especially while on their periods. “Girls lose health, strength, blood, and nerve, by a regimen that ignores the periodical tides and [the] reproductive apparatus of their organization,” Clarke wrote in his book in 1873, which received considerable attention.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe concept fit in nicely with the larger discussion women’s health in the medical field.

(This was also before exercise became a popular and more effective remedy for certain illnesses.)

To her, Clarke was utterly wrong. Jacobi was a well-regarded doctor, one of the few women practicing medicine in America in the 1870s. She came from a middle-class New York family, the eldest of 11 children. Her interest in anatomy emerged early, when as a young girl she discovered a dead rat in her family’s barn on Staten Island and, as she put it, felt overcome with the desire to cut open the cadaver and take a peek inside.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eDespite some resistance from her father, who worried higher education would abrade her femininity, Jacobi studied at the New York College of Pharmacy and then the Female Medical College of Pennsylvania, as it was known then, where she received a medical degree in 1864. Jacobi got a second medical degree at the École de Médecine in Paris, where she was the first woman to attend.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eBy these measures, Jacobi was a living contradiction of Clarke’s conclusions. The year Clarke published his book on girls and education, Jacobi was a lecturer at the Woman’s Medical College of the New York Infirmary and treating patients at the clinic. Those who disapproved of women practicing medicine sounded the warnings Clarke did; they argued that strenuous medical work threatened their feminine qualities and reproductive health.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIn a rebuttal published in 1877, Jacobi thoroughly dragged Clarke. His recommendations, she wrote, lacked “experimental proof,” relied on “exaggeration of fact,” and served “many interests besides those of scientific truth.” In her view, Clarke’s assertions weren’t medical at all, but a deliberate attempt to bar women from classrooms and offices and to keep them in the home.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eSure, some women experience pain and discomfort during their periods, Jacobi said, but menstruation doesn’t ruin the mind. In fact, women were more healthy when they were engaged in activity in general. Jacobi prescribed one of her patients, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, the author of \u003cem\u003eThe Yellow Wallpaper\u003c/em\u003e, a regimen of mental and physical activity for an ailment that now would likely be diagnosed as depression. Jacobi’s treatment proved more successful than the “rest cure” Gilman had previously received from a male doctor.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eClarke insisted that mental labor and menstruation were conflicting functions because they taxed the brain in similar ways. Jacobi said the opposite was true; menstruation was not so different than digestion, and no one needed a week’s worth of rest after a meal. Clarke argued that education exacerbated women’s emotions during their periods; Jacobi countered that mental stimulation provided a salve for the discomfort. Unlike Clarke, she had data to back up her thinking. She had conducted a questionnaire of 268 women, she reported, and the results showed the effects of rest were “quite superfluous.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e“She really wanted to normalize and show a healthy female body during menstruation,” says Carla Bittel, a history professor at Loyola Marymount University and the author of a 2012\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Politics-Medicine-Nineteenth-Century-America-Studies-ebook/dp/B0086VH5EE/ref=sr_1_2\"\u003e biography\u003c/a\u003e of Jacobi.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eJacobi’s rebuttal appeared years before the women’s suffrage movement picked up steam, and she quietly opposed suffrage at first. She believed women could achieve more equality by participating in higher education and serious professions—as she had—than by casting votes. Her thinking eventually changed, though, and she publicly joined the movement in the 1880s. She likened a functioning society to a healthy organism; when one part was excluded—women—the whole suffered. (There were limits to this analogy: Jacobi didn’t believe the contributions of minorities, immigrants, and the working class played an equal part in maintaining a healthy society, Bittel says.)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003eRead: \u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/06/most-dangerous-women-american-politics/590959/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eThe ‘undesirable militants’ behind the nineteenth amendment\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eBut her essay buttressed the fight against bad ideas about female biology, which were readily invoked by suffrage opponents as the movement moved into the 20th century. The perceived inferiority of women was at the core of the debate, and menstruation fit neatly as a predictable weakness. Just as Clarke had used physiology to reinforce female subordination, so did anti-suffrage activists during the height of the movement. “Opponents basically boiled women down to their sex, which basically means to their reproductive organs and function,” says Carolyn Skinner, an English professor at Ohio State University who studies the rhetoric of 19th-century American women physicians.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTwentieth-century suffragists were the picture of the kind of women Clarke feared.

One speaker, identified in\u003ca href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=36o_AAAAYAAJ\u0026amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage\u0026amp;q\u0026amp;f=false\"\u003e congressional documents\u003c/a\u003e as Mrs. William Kent of California, came from California, which granted women the right to vote nearly three years earlier.

The last politician to make the jump directly from the House to the presidency was James Garfield in 1881. Ryan, Swalwell, and Moulton lack the star power of Beto O’Rourke, the former Texas congressman whose near-win over Senator Ted Cruz last year made him a household name.

In Ohio, Ryan has repeatedly passed on chances to run for statewide office, to the point where he developed a reputation as something of a political Hamlet.

We spoke after he left a campaign stop in Sioux City, Iowa, where he said the coffee shop was “packed” for his speech at 9 a.m.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eStill, Ryan has not registered higher than 1 percent in a single poll, and he could struggle to clear the stiffer threshold for the fall debates. “The plan is to be in until the voting starts,” he told me. “That’s the plan.” As for a potential fallback plan of seeking statewide office in Ohio, Ryan said: “I’ve not gotten that far ahead.

Yet they also acknowledge that the enhanced name recognition Ryan gets from even a losing national run could make him a stronger statewide candidate back home, where despite having served 17 years in the House, he is not well known across the entire state.

At last month’s debate, he made a bid for a viral moment when \u003ca href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/video/swalwell-hits-biden-over-his-age-62832709872\"\u003ehe told Biden to “pass the torch”\u003c/a\u003e to the next generation of leaders. But Swalwell, like most others on the stage alongside the former vice president, was overshadowed by Harris, his California colleague. His back-of-the-pack standing didn’t budge in the initial round of post-debate polls.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Everyone just assumes he’s trying to establish some name ID in order to run for U.S. Senate,” one well-connected California Democrat who is unaffiliated in the presidential race told me, repeating a bit of speculation that two other Democratic operatives also mentioned on the condition of anonymity to speak freely. The state’s senior senator, Dianne Feinstein, just won reelection to another term but is 86 years old. The other seat would open up after 2020 if Harris, who surged in the polls after her debate performance, wins election as president or serves as  vice president.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eUnsurprisingly, Swalwell denied having interest in any office besides the presidency—at least for now. “I’m running to win,” he told me in a recent phone interview. “This is a hell of a way to do anything else.” Swalwell noted that he had missed his son’s first day of preschool to campaign. “You lose more than you gain doing this,” he said. “If I’m thinking about the day after this election, whatever that means, then I’m not focused on what the people care about.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eSwalwell said he had not given “an inch of thought” to what his next step might be if he doesn’t win. He has said he won’t seek reelection to his House seat while running for president, prompting a number of local Democrats to jump into that race to succeed him. But the filing deadline isn’t until December, giving him several more months to change his mind if his campaign doesn’t take off. Candidates could begin dropping out of the race by the fall if they don’t make the debate stage in September and if they are running out of money after the end of the critical third-quarter fundraising period.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"dropcap\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003eRyan and Swalwell have struggled to break through, but the congressman running for president who’s in the most precarious position, both nationally and locally, is Moulton.

Your campaign has to stand for something, and Seth’s record in the district speaks for itself.” Corridoni said Moulton is “focused on running for president, and he’s running to win.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eFor Democratic candidates as well as the party’s voters, the great motivator remains Trump. “Donald Trump made everyone think, \u003cem\u003eIf he can do it, so can I\u003c/em\u003e. The barrier to entry has been lowered,” an aide to one long-shot candidate told me, speaking on the condition of anonymity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eEven in a primary field of nearly two dozen, candidates can raise money and get attention faster than ever before. The upside potential of beating expectations—name recognition, higher office, a cable show or the paid-speaking circuit—seems to outweigh the downside risk. “In some ways, it’s easier,” Gephardt told me, reflecting on the differences between a dark-horse campaign now and when he first ran for president more than three decades ago. “Because of communication technology today, it is easier to catch that fire—to become someone that everyone instantaneously knows.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eGephardt did briefly catch fire in 1988. He won the Iowa caucuses before fading in the spring, losing to the eventual nominee that year, Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis. Gephardt returned to the House, where he rose to become the Democratic leader for eight years. When he ran again for the White House in 2004, he was a top-tier candidate and a finalist to be Senator John Kerry’s running mate. For the past 15 years, Gephardt has been a prominent D.C. lobbyist.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eFor Ryan, Swalwell, and Moulton, perhaps Gephardt’s story serves as inspiration—an underdog campaign that doesn’t end in the presidency, but opens the door to opportunities that didn’t exist before. And while they—and the others struggling to break out of the pack—may genuinely not have given much thought to the potential consolation prizes of a failed presidential bid, if they don’t catch that fire soon, they may have no other choice.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/ytGmrcby0Z0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/ytGmrcby0Z0/","published":"2019-07-06T11:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-593323"},{"title":"E. Jean Carroll and the ‘Hideosity Bar’","content":"\u003cp\u003eThe accusation landed with a thud in the media, briefly disturbing the public conversation one sunny Friday afternoon the way a spilled glass of wine momentarily disturbs a dinner party. E. Jean Carroll, the longtime \u003cem\u003eElle\u003c/em\u003e advice columnist, had published an excerpt from her forthcoming memoir on the cover of \u003cem\u003eNew York \u003c/em\u003emagazine, in which she accused President Donald Trump of sexually assaulting her in a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room more than 20 years ago. According to Carroll, the incident likely took place in 1996, when Trump was merely a crass businessman with a thirst for tabloid fame. Two friends she called in the immediate aftermath of the attack confirmed Carroll’s story to \u003cem\u003eNew York\u003c/em\u003e, then to \u003cem\u003eThe\u003c/em\u003e \u003cem\u003eNew York Times\u003c/em\u003e. Carroll did not use the word \u003cem\u003erape\u003c/em\u003e in her account of what happened in the dressing room with the man who would become president, but there was little room for doubt that it fit the legal definition.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe revelation had the quality of déjà vu, not shocking but familiar, probably because we have quite literally been here before. Carroll is at least the 22nd woman to publicly accuse Trump of sexual misconduct, and the second to accuse him of rape—the first was Trump’s first wife, Ivana Trump, the mother of three of his children, who later rescinded her allegation. Carroll’s piece garnered much praise for its elegant style and for the integrity she showed in publishing it, but it generated nothing like shock. \u003cem\u003eYeah\u003c/em\u003e, I thought.\u003cem\u003e That sounds about right.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd so the accusation did not lead the front page of major newspapers the day after Carroll’s piece went live; it was largely not discussed on the major morning news shows that Sunday. \u003cem\u003eThe\u003c/em\u003e \u003cem\u003eNew York Times \u003c/em\u003einitially confined its coverage to the books section, an editorial choice that implicitly lent credence to the response from the Trump camp, which denied the allegation and implied that Carroll had fabricated it to sell her book. Trump also suggested that he would not have raped Carroll because, he said, she is not his type.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe \u003cem\u003eTimes\u003c/em\u003e’ executive editor, Dean Baquet, was later contrite about his paper’s decision to downplay the Carroll allegation, saying, “We were overly cautious.” It would perhaps have been more honest of him to say that the paper was exercising news judgment, and did not find the rape allegation newsworthy. It was immoral and despicable, but it was not out of step with what we know of the president’s character. To be a scandal, the allegation would have had to be surprising.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat does it mean for the office of the presidency that no one is at all surprised that the man who occupies it has been accused of rape?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBeyond “media fatigue,” or what Soraya Chemaly, writing for CNN, \u003ca href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/27/opinions/donald-trump-jean-carroll-rape-allegation-chemaly/index.html\"\u003ecalled\u003c/a\u003e “profound societal misogyny,” or what the \u003cem\u003eNew Yorker\u003c/em\u003e writer Jia Tolentino \u003ca href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/e-jean-carrolls-accusation-against-donald-trump-and-the-raising-and-lowering-of-the-bar\"\u003edescribed\u003c/a\u003e as “the hardening of [her] own heart,” I detect something else at play in the underwhelmed response to Carroll’s allegation. That something is at once more sinister and more jaded: We have stopped pretending, collectively, that we expect those on whom we bestow tremendous power to behave with commensurate responsibility.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the not-so-recent past, the possibility that a powerful or respected man had committed sexual assault created cognitive dissonance; the crudeness of the behavior did not match up with the dignity of his position. Society at large responded to allegations with equal parts outrage and disbelief. But if you'd been assaulted or knew people who had been assaulted, there was no dissonance at all. It was just a fact of life, as ordinary and reliable as the knowledge that the sky is blue.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLately our whole culture has been brought into the circle of mistrust, to this little secret: We pretend we hold elites to a high standard, but we do not. We pretend we value women’s dignity, but we do not.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCarroll, in listing the predatory men of her life, wrote that many unpleasant sexual encounters did not make the cut: “My hideosity bar is high.” This is one way, too, to understand the muted response to an allegation that, if we all really held the values that we claim to, should have been explosive.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThose of us inclined to believe Carroll agree that her allegation should be a much bigger deal. Nearly two years into the collective cultural reckoning of the #MeToo movement, the story holds a particular weight for us, a quality of social seriousness that goes beyond the already ample evidence of Trump’s selfishness, corruption, and greed. But perhaps we have endured so much, witnessed so much that is grotesque and dishonest from this president, from these times, that our bar for what we consider hideous has been raised high, and our standards for what we expect from those in power have sunk low. Or it might be more accurate to say not that we do not consider these things hideous, but that we have become comfortable with the hideous, made a friendly acquaintance with it, and are now at home being ugly, content to live alongside horrible things.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn her account of the rape, Carroll wrote that she was laughing during the attack, and she has also \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/us/politics/jean-carroll-trump-sexual-assault.html\"\u003esaid\u003c/a\u003e that she was laughing as she ran out of the department store, and still laughing when she called a friend for help. In Carroll’s account, the laughter functions as a psychic defense mechanism, like the hardening of Tolentino’s heart; an irrational response to an unthinkable event, something meant to distance the mind from the horror it just encountered. Laughter is, perhaps, also an appropriate response to the country that allows a man like Trump to maintain his status, his money, and the respect of his peers, a country that would allow a man like him to become president and still have the audacity to pretend that women are equals, in status or in law. In that sense, her story really is laughable.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/Z2ELgVqHAiU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/Z2ELgVqHAiU/","published":"2019-07-06T10:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-593299"},{"title":"The More You Watch, the More You Vote Populist","content":"\u003cp\u003eDoes watching television make people stupid?

And it also makes you more likely to vote for populist parties.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"dropcap\"\u003eUntil the late 1970s, Italian television was an earnest affair. The only national channels were run by RAI, the state broadcaster. On average, RAI only broadcast for about 10 hours a day. Nearly two-thirds of its content consisted of serious news or educational programming. Even advertising had to meet high moral standards; ads for pet food, for example, were not allowed to show moving images of cats or dogs. Apparently the bosses at RAI thought it was inappropriate for companies to hawk food for Fluffy or Rover while people in the developing world were suffering from famine.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll of this changed when Silvio Berlusconi, one of Italy’s richest entrepreneurs, started buying up regional channels in the 1980s. Though Italian courts repeatedly declared his activities illegal, Berlusconi’s close connections to leading politicians allowed him to build Italy’s first private network, Mediaset.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe difference between RAI and Mediaset was about as big as that between American networks of the 1960s and the cable shows of the 2010s. Less than 10 percent of Mediaset’s content consisted of news or educational programming. Whereas RAI devoted hours to earnest politicians and professors debating the most pressing issues of the day, Berlusconi’s channels homed in on the lowest common denominator. On one of Mediaset’s most infamous shows, a model would take off a piece of clothing every time a contestant answered a question correctly or had a lucky turn at the roulette wheel; when she was (nearly) naked, he won.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGradual introduction of Berlusconi’s networks into different regions of Italy makes it possible to study the effect that entertainment television had on voting behavior. For example, Durante, Pinotti, and Tesei found that parts of Italy that had earlier access to Mediaset were substantially more likely to vote for Forza Italia, Berlusconi’s new political party, in 1994, when it first entered the political scene.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe effect persisted throughout the 1990s and 2000s, with regions that were exposed to Mediaset earlier than others voting for Berlusconi in greater numbers. To verify that Mediaset was the relevant factor, the authors compared towns and villages that were able to get good reception with neighboring ones that initially had a poor signal due to physical obstacles, such as a mountain range. Amazingly, Italians who had good access to Mediaset for random geographical reasons voted for populists in greater numbers than their neighbors who did not.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAmong older Italians, the authors of the study argue, “the larger support for \u003cem\u003eForza Italia\u003c/em\u003e could be attributed to their exposure to the markedly pro-Berlusconi bias of Mediaset newscasts.” The earlier they had been exposed to Mediaset, the more they watched, the more easily they were manipulated when Mediaset anchors sang Berlusconi’s praises. Simple enough.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat about younger Italians? According to the authors, regular consumers of entertainment television preferred Berlusconi because they had poor cognitive skills. That sounds like a dumb Ivy League joke—but the study did find that Italians who watched a lot of Mediaset before the age of 10 performed worse on a series of numeracy and literacy tests. And the more exposure conscripts to Italy’s army had to entertainment television, the more likely they were to be exempted from military service because they had failed to meet its minimum intelligence requirements.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis decrease in sophistication favored Berlusconi, so the theory goes, because populist parties deliberately appeal to voters who are less informed about politics. (Before he became president, Donald Trump famously declared, “I love the poorly educated.”) In the seminars Berlusconi ran for members of his party who were running for office for the first time—many of whom had, not coincidentally, been ad salesmen for Mediaset in their previous lives—he emphasized the importance of appealing to ordinary folk: The average voter, he told them, left school well before the age of 18, and had never been at the top of his class.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnalyzing Berlusconi’s television appearances, Durante, Pinotti, and Tesei found that he consistently “adopted a much simpler communication style than other parties and leaders.” As a result, he performed much better among less educated citizens. Taken together, this suggests that “early exposure to entertainment TV influenced political preferences through an impoverishment of cognitive skills.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e(It would be tempting to think that the causation runs the other way around: Perhaps people with poor cognitive skills are more likely to watch a lot of television? Once again, the authors of the study were able to exclude this possibility by focusing on random geographic variation: Places with earlier access to Mediaset contained a greater proportion of people with poor cognitive skills.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor two long decades, Berlusconi was the undisputed master of promising Italians easy solutions to complicated problems. When his promises failed to materialize, the patience of his countrymen finally ran out. The main beneficiary was the Five Star Movement, a new populist party started by the comedian Beppe Grillo. Though it had sprung up on the left rather than the right, and loudly opposed rather than praised Berlusconi, the Five Star Movement shared his populist style. As Durante, Pinotto, and Tesei show, it too adopted very simple language—and promised to defend the people against an unaccountable elite.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs it happens, early exposure to entertainment television did not only make Italian citizens more likely to vote for Berlusconi in the 1990s; it also made them more likely to vote for Grillo in the 2010s. The enmity between Grillo and Berlusconi makes this effect all the more striking. Since Mediaset never hyped Grillo in the way it had Berlusconi, direct propaganda can’t explain the voting pattern. Perhaps, though, Mediaset had primed viewers to prefer simplistic, populist appeals. Here, then, is evidence that low-quality television can coarsen political discourse—and favor populist movements—even decades after it is first introduced.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"dropcap\"\u003eWhen assessing social-science studies, it is worth keeping a simple principle in mind: The more counterintuitive a finding, the stronger the evidence we should require before we believe it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA few decades ago, \u003ca href=\"https://ib.ethz.ch/content/dam/ethz/special-interest/gess/cis/international-relations-dam/Teaching/pwgrundlagenopenaccess/Weitere/AchenBartels.pdf\"\u003ea famous paper\u003c/a\u003e by two widely respected political scientists argued that shark attacks along the New Jersey coast lowered Woodrow Wilson’s vote share when he ran for his second presidential term in 1916. The attacks, so the theory went, had kept away tourists and crashed the local economy. Though Wilson was hardly at fault, voters punished him for their suffering.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe story was a perfect encapsulation of the belief, strongly held by a growing number of scholars, that voters are thoroughly irrational. But when some younger political scientists \u003ca href=\"http://www.andrewbenjaminhall.com/FowlerHall_Sharks.pdf\"\u003etried to replicate the original study\u003c/a\u003e, they concluded that the sharks might not have cost Wilson any votes after all. The story might have been too perfect to be true.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe methodology that Durante, Pinotti, and Tesei use is sophisticated enough for me to take their findings seriously. It seems possible that Mediaset’s impact on Italy really has been as disastrous and long-lasting as they say. But until some other researchers have had time to pick holes in their argument, and to play around with their data, I’ll hold off on buying their conclusions. Only someone whose brain has been turned into mush by watching too much entertainment television would immediately accept an argument that fits elite ideological priors quite as neatly as this one.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/4QstOEQ-roo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/4QstOEQ-roo/","published":"2019-07-06T10:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-593287"},{"title":"The ‘Selectorate’ Picking Britain’s Next Prime Minister","content":"\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eBritain’s next prime minister will govern a country of 66 million, but the pool of citizens deciding who that individual will be is decidedly smaller: 165,000.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe reason for that is simple: When Theresa May resigned from office in May, \u003ca href=\"http://links.e.theatlantic.com/ctt?kn=43\u0026amp;ms=MjE3MTgyMTMS1\u0026amp;r=MzEwMTkxNDg5NzM3S0\u0026amp;b=0\u0026amp;j=MTUyMTc2NDgwNAS2\u0026amp;mt=1\u0026amp;rt=0\"\u003eciting her failure\u003c/a\u003e to get her Brexit deal through Parliament, she did so as the leader of Britain’s Conservative Party.

On paper, they are the dues-paying members of the Conservative Party. A closer look reveals a group that is whiter, older, more male, and wealthier than the rest of the country.

Tory members are committed to seeing Brexit delivered by the end of October, whether or not Britain has a deal with the European Union managing its withdrawal. And unlike the rest of the country, most of them are willing to see that happen at virtually any cost. The majority of the British public view a no-deal scenario—where the country would leave the bloc without any agreement on a litany of core issues such as tariffs, border management, pharmaceutical regulation, and the like—and the adverse impact it would have on the country’s economy as a \u003ca href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2019/04/04/what-do-public-think-about-no-deal-brexit\"\u003ebad outcome\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eTo understand the makeup of the Conservative Party, it helps to look at the numbers.

Stephen King’s Dark Tower series is not unfilmable, but the 2017 take starring Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey might make you wish it was.

A group of researchers in the UK this week released the first major survey on the question. The responses could help inform an international protocol for responding to first contact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"mmYtpj\"\u003eThis is a big deal because, as Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/28/magazine/greetings-et-please-dont-murder-us.html?_r=0\"\u003ehave warned\u003c/a\u003e, communicating with extraterrestrials could pose a catastrophic risk to humanity. In fact, if we send out a message and it’s received by less-than-friendly aliens, that could pose an existential threat not only to the human species but to every species on Earth. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"7zUQCP\"\u003eDespite the high stakes, scientists have already sent out signals intended to be picked up by aliens. The first one went out in 1974, when the Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003etransmitted a broadcast containing information on everything from the position of Earth in our solar system to the double helix structure of DNA. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"WFksVB\"\u003eThe Arecibo Observatory is currently running \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/2/21/18224984/arecibo-message-aliens-kids-contest-seti-meti-extraterrestrial\"\u003ea contest that invites kids to design our next message to E.T.\u003c/a\u003e And later this year, an organization called Messaging Extraterrestrial Intelligence (METI) plans to transmit a new message containing information on the periodic table. There’s no law saying they can’t, or even that they need to get some international buy-in. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"UKykq7\"\u003eBut the scientists at the \u003ca href=\"https://uksetiresearchnetwork.wordpress.com/\"\u003eUK SETI Research Network\u003c/a\u003e (UKSRN) think we’re woefully unprepared to handle an alien message if we receive one. And they say no one class of people should unilaterally decide humanity’s response. As astronomer Martin Dominik \u003ca href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jul/01/do-you-think-that-there-is-alien-life-beyond-earth-first-contact\"\u003eput it\u003c/a\u003e, “We want to hear people’s views. The consequences affect more people than just scientists.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"9yk8v5\"\u003eSo UKSRN has launched \u003ca href=\"https://www.fromafar.world/opinion\"\u003ea survey\u003c/a\u003e online and at \u003ca href=\"https://royalsociety.org/science-events-and-lectures/2019/summer-science-exhibition/\"\u003ethe Royal Society’s summer science exhibition\u003c/a\u003e in London, which runs July 1-7. Here are three of the questions they’re asking the public:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"wQO1Iv\"\u003e1) Some people think we should send messages into space even if we don’t receive a message first. What is your opinion?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Yb3DR5\"\u003e2) If we receive a message, do you think we should reply/make contact or not? Why?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"0YM7cF\"\u003e3) What would you consider a credible source?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"oTmwct\"\u003eThat third question reflects a worry I’ve been hearing from astronomers over the past couple of years: If a newly discovered message from aliens is announced, members of the public may use social media to spread all sorts of fake news and conspiracy theories about the aliens, their message, and what it will mean for humanity to communicate with them. In the weeks or months or years it could take scientists to decode the interstellar missive, fear-mongering could tank our chances of responding wisely — or at all. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"otsJQ2\"\u003eAn alien message “will take time to understand and if that work starts to drag out and there is nothing new we can say, the information vacuum will be filled with speculation,” John Elliott, a UKSRN co-founder, \u003ca href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jul/01/do-you-think-that-there-is-alien-life-beyond-earth-first-contact\"\u003etold the Guardian\u003c/a\u003e. “Conjecture and rumor will take over.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"95jCED\"\u003eIn hopes of figuring out how to minimize the problem, the survey asks which information sources you’d trust: Main news channels? Direct quotes from scientists? Official government statements? Other sources?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"qoPEjI\"\u003eIt also asks if you’d post on social media about the discovery of an alien message. If so, would you restrict yourself to defending the scientific evidence? Or would you maybe engage in speculation? Would the absence of any news on the signal’s decoding encourage you to speculate?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"0bVcRJ\"\u003eYou can see how it’d be useful to scientists to be able to predict the public’s response in these scenarios. But there’s a difference between how I say I’d react when I’m filling out a questionnaire, and how I’d actually react in real life. In addition to that limitation, the UKSRN survey is weakened by the fact that the same person can take it more than once from different devices. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"lFhVSl\"\u003eStill, it’s an improvement over the lack of public consultation we’ve seen on these questions in the past. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"kmFl4C\"\u003eWho gets to make rules about what happens in space?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"loXUE2\"\u003eFor decades, the international community has been exploring the possibility of establishing a mechanism for global oversight when it comes to our engagement with outer space. But even if everyone were to agree that’s a good idea, the question of how to set it up and make it enforceable is incredibly complicated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"4QZfJm\"\u003eThe 1967 \u003ca href=\"http://www.unoosa.org/oosa/en/ourwork/spacelaw/treaties/introouterspacetreaty.html\"\u003eOuter Space Treaty\u003c/a\u003e was an early effort in this vein. Ratified by dozens of countries and adopted by the United Nations against the backdrop of the Cold War, it laid out a framework for international space law. Among other things, it stipulated that the moon and other celestial bodies can only be used for peaceful purposes, and that states can’t store their nuclear weapons in space. The treaty suited its historical context, but it didn’t tackle the concerns people have nowadays about messaging an alien intelligence.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\"Carl Sagan helped design this early pictorial message to aliens.

One of its principles reads: “No response to a signal or other evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence should be sent until appropriate international consultations have taken place.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"KlYEYx\"\u003eThis protocol was put on file as a brief with the Outer Space Treaty at the UN, and it was endorsed by the International Academy of Astronautics and the International Institute for Space Law. But it has no regulatory force when it comes to those who actively send out messages à la METI.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ZI8E5J\"\u003eIn 2015, SETI researchers, Musk, and others released \u003ca href=\"https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/meti_statement_0.html\"\u003ea statement\u003c/a\u003e criticizing METI efforts. “We feel the decision whether or not to transmit must be based upon a worldwide consensus, and not a decision based upon the wishes of a few individuals with access to powerful communications equipment,” it said. “We strongly encourage vigorous international debate by a broadly representative body prior to engaging further in this activity.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"qIOi5A\"\u003eSo far, though, there is still no “broadly representative body” regulating what messages can be sent into space or by whom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"lounxj\"\u003eAlessandra Abe Pacini, a researcher at Arecibo who helped generate the idea for the kids’ contest, told me the question of whether any message should be transmitted at all is “very controversial,” adding: “Even here among the scientists at Arecibo, there is no consensus.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"hQTFec\"\u003eIf some of the smartest astronomers in the world\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003ecan’t come to an in-house agreement, is there any hope that the international community will ever agree?

Perhaps most important, the Rolling Stone rankings are for June 28 to July 4, while the most recently available Billboard rankings used data from June 24 to June 30.

The impact of not including radio play is apparent in the ranking of \u0026#8220;Talk\u0026#8221; by Khalid, which is number four on the Billboard chart, but just missed Rolling Stone\u0026#8217;s top 10 (it is number 11). \u0026#8220;Talk\u0026#8221; is the \u003ca href=\"https://www.billboard.com/charts/radio-songs\"\u003enumber one radio song\u003c/a\u003e in the country, according to Billboard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTop ten songs in the US, as they appeared on July 5, 2019\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"qz-table-container\"\u003e\n\u003ctable class=\"qz-table cf multi-column\"\u003e\n\u003cthead class=\"qz-table-header cf\"\u003e\n\u003ctr\u003e\n\u003cth\u003eRanking\u003c/th\u003e\n\u003cth\u003eBillboard\u003c/th\u003e\n\u003cth\u003eRolling Stone\u003c/th\u003e\n\u003c/tr\u003e\n\u003c/thead\u003e\n\u003ctbody\u003e\n\u003ctr class=\"qz-table-row\"\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003e1\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003e\u0026#8220;Old Town Road\u0026#8221; by Lil Nas X\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003e\u0026#8220;Old Town Road\u0026#8221; by Lil Nas X\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003c/tr\u003e\n\u003ctr class=\"qz-table-row qz-table-row-alt\"\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003e2\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003e\u0026#8220;Señorita\u0026#8221; by Shawn Mendes \u0026amp; Camila Cabello\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003e\u0026#8220;Señorita\u0026#8221; by Shawn Mendes \u0026amp; Camila Cabello\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003c/tr\u003e\n\u003ctr class=\"qz-table-row\"\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003e3\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003e\u0026#8220;Bad Guy\u0026#8221; by Billie Eilish\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003e\u0026#8220;Money in the Grave\u0026#8221; by Drake\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003c/tr\u003e\n\u003ctr class=\"qz-table-row qz-table-row-alt\"\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003e4\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003e\u0026#8220;Talk\u0026#8221; by Khalid\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003e\u0026#8220;Truth Hurts\u0026#8221; by Lizzo\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003c/tr\u003e\n\u003ctr class=\"qz-table-row\"\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003e5\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003e\u0026#8220;I Don\u0026#8217;t Care\u0026#8221; by Ed Sheeran \u0026amp; Justin Bieber\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003e\u0026#8220;No Guidance\u0026#8221; by Chris Brown\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003c/tr\u003e\n\u003ctr class=\"qz-table-row qz-table-row-alt\"\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003e6\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003e\u0026#8220;Sucker\u0026#8221; by Jonas Brothers\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003e\u0026#8220;Panini\u0026#8221; by Lil Nas X\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003c/tr\u003e\n\u003ctr class=\"qz-table-row\"\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003e7\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003e \u0026#8220;DaBaby\u0026#8221; by Suge\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003e\u0026#8220;Bad Guy\u0026#8221; by Billie Eilish\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003c/tr\u003e\n\u003ctr class=\"qz-table-row qz-table-row-alt\"\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003e8\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003e\u0026#8220;Money in the Grave\u0026#8221; by Drake\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003e\u0026#8220;Sunflower\u0026#8221; by Swae Lee \u0026amp; Post Malone\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003c/tr\u003e\n\u003ctr class=\"qz-table-row\"\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003e9\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003e\u0026#8220;No Guidance\u0026#8221; by Chris Brown\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003e\u0026#8220;You Need to Calm Down\u0026#8221; by Taylor Swift\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003c/tr\u003e\n\u003ctr class=\"qz-table-row qz-table-row-alt\"\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003e10\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003e\u0026#8220;Wow\u0026#8221; by Post Malone\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003e\u0026#8220;DaBaby\u0026#8221; by Suge\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003c/tr\u003e\n\u003c/tbody\u003e\n\u003c/table\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRolling Stone\u0026#8217;s new chart begs the question: Why do rankings even matter? Most centrally, they are useful for music industry watchers who need to understand which artists are most popular and which artists and genres are trending upwards. Music labels use them to figure out which kinds of artists they should be seeking out, and which of their artists\u0026#8217; songs are resonating. Concert promoters and advertisers also find rankings useful as a way to identify high-profile artists that they may want to work with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rankings also play to a sense of competition and ego, and are a way for record labels to show an artist that they are properly marketing their music. A recent battle for the \u003ca href=\"https://variety.com/2019/biz/news/dj-khaled-tyler-the-creator-billboard-chart-1203237841/\"\u003enumber one spot\u003c/a\u003e on Billboard\u0026#8217;s album chart between the artists DJ Khaled and Tyler the Creator led to controversy. Billboard disqualified some of DJ Khaled\u0026#8217;s sales because the album was bundled with the sale of energy drinks. DJ Khaled was reportedly furious when his album did not get the top spot due to this disqualification.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother fun role of charts is that they allow music analysts to look at how popular music has changed over time. Among other insights, Billboard\u0026#8217;s historical data has been used to show that songs have been \u003ca href=\"https://qz.com/quartzy/1438412/the-reason-why-your-favorite-pop-songs-are-getting-shorter/\"\u003egetting shorter\u003c/a\u003e over the past several decades, and the declining number of \u0026#8220;\u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20160805094220/http://priceonomics.com/the-death-of-the-one-hit-wonder/\"\u003eone-hit wonders\u003c/a\u003e.\u0026#8221; The new Rolling Stone chart won\u0026#8217;t be able to be used for this purpose, meaning that Billboard has at least one clear advantage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven without historical data, Rolling Stone\u0026#8217;s offering is almost certainly good news.

With just one or two weeks to discover a new place, there\u0026#8217;s time to see the must-sees, try some great restaurants, and even discover a spot or two off the beaten path. But you leave with little more than a vague impression of the place, and when someone asks you about it a few weeks later, all you can say is, \u0026#8220;It was great!\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is natural. Everything in a new place is a little bit different: the sounds, the accents, the foliage, the signage, the architecture, the birds, the width of the roads, the thickness of the air, the taste of the water. One or two weeks is not enough to internalize all of that newness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne solution, of course, is to move there forever, or at least until you can rattle off the names of underground music venues and give a halfway-decent walking tour. But here\u0026#8217;s a more straightforward approach: Next time you take a trip to a new destination, limit the range of things you see and experience by focusing on one topic or theme. Go exclusive and deep on one thing, versus shallow on a broad set of them. I call this \u0026#8220;traveling with a lens.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFocusing \u003cem\u003eexclusively\u003c/em\u003e on the theme is important. Let\u0026#8217;s say, for example, that you\u0026#8217;re traveling to Kenya, and the lens you\u0026#8217;ve chosen is coffee. You can\u0026#8217;t just occasionally pop into coffee shops in Nairobi. \u0026#8220;Coffee\u0026#8221; should be the driving force behind nearly every decision you make about what to do and where to go. You will explore the best and worst cafes in various cities, chat with their managers, go to coffee-growing regions of the country, tour coffee farms, learn about which beans are grown where and why they are different. And on and on. You will approach your trip as if you are writing a thesis, titled \u0026#8220;Caffeine Country: Situating Kenya\u0026#8217;s postcolonial history in coffee culture,\u0026#8221; that is due as soon as you get back.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI learned how to travel with a lens—in this case, a literal one–from reporting trips. In Zambia, reporting on telecoms infrastructure \u003ca href=\"https://qz.com/1620656/what-happens-when-china-builds-your-countrys-internet/\"\u003efor a news video\u003c/a\u003e (Quartz member exclusive), my eyes were trained to spot cell towers, top-up stations, construction workers, and electronics shops—things I would have normally ignored. In an effort to test the limits of Zambia\u0026#8217;s cell service, my colleague and I went not to Victoria Falls—the most famous sight in the country—but to the less-visited, nevertheless spectacular Lake Bangweulu and its surrounding villages, where we saw Zambian life wholly different from that of the cities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis approach to travel is preferable in a number of ways. For one thing, you\u0026#8217;ll come back very knowledgeable on your theme. You will understand deeply some \u003cem\u003ething\u003c/em\u003e about a place, rather than just having absorbed a feeling of it. It will be like having read several books on coffee and Kenya, except better, because you were there: You saw the beans, you smelled them, they gave you a caffeine buzz. You will be able to say a lot more than, \u0026#8220;It was great!\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA lens also makes it easy to step outside the usual tourist guardrails and engage with people who live in the place you are visiting. You will be encountering locals who have a shared interest with you, whether it\u0026#8217;s coffee or techno music or tropical birds, and you will readily strike up interesting conversations. You will be seeing the things \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e want to see, not the things everyone \u0026#8220;must see,\u0026#8221; and the simple mathematics of that mean there will be fewer tourists around. It will also bring you to parts of a country or city that you would never have thought to go to otherwise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this point you might be thinking, \u0026#8220;Hey, this already exists. It\u0026#8217;s called a \u0026#8216;tour.'\u0026#8221; Yes, culinary tours of Italy, wine tours of Napa Valley, and World War 1 tours of Germany are somewhat lens-y. But they\u0026#8217;re not the same. The intermediary of a tour operator creates a certain distance between you and your destination. And if a certain stop on the tour isn\u0026#8217;t to your liking, well, too bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou don\u0026#8217;t have to be a journalist to travel with a lens, nor do you have to do it all the time. Sometimes, you just want to see as much as you can, or listen to a tour guide telling you what to do. Maybe you\u0026#8217;ll return, next time with a lens. But don\u0026#8217;t make a broad approach to travel your default.

One other important part of the ceremony is the presence of the baby\u0026#8217;s \u003ca href=\"https://time.com/5566871/meghan-markle-baby-godparents/\" \u003egodparents\u003c/a\u003e, who are often named in advance of the event.

Over the past year or so, Dell has taken premium features that come standard in XPS machines and translated them for the Inspiron line. The company knows it can't rely on the XPS family alone to draw in customers that care about how their laptops look and feel—it needs more machines that feel as versatile as those XPSes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe improved Inspiron line will offer a lot to these users: aluminum designs, 8th-gen Intel processors, 4K touchscreen support, optional Optane memory, inking abilities, and more. The new Inspiron 13 7000 2-in-1 Black Edition comes as close as the line gets to an XPS, but it has a convenient twist. In addition to all of the features previously listed, the new design includes a top-mounted webcam and IR camera along with a magnetic pen garage built into the hinge. While it can get expensive even for an Inspiron, it has a lot of things that are omitted in the XPS family—things some users will definitely want in their primary

You have to find a spot to use it that’s dark enough (not to mention a surface that’s large and flat enough to project on). You have to ensure it’s aligned and straight and focused. You have to figure out how to get the video you actually want to watch on it. You have to figure out how to get enough sound out of it so everybody can hear it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"dVjlcX\"\u003eWith a regular projector, you do all of that fiddling ahead of time. You create a permanent setup somewhere in your home over a weekend (or three) so that using your projector is as simple as turning on a traditional TV. With a portable mini projector, you face those challenges pretty much every time you want to use it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Xr0ps2\"\u003eThe whole premise of the Capsule II is that it reduces the number of things you have to fiddle with. It is almost entirely successful in that — with a few unforced errors that are annoying but don’t ruin the experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-wide-block\"\u003e  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V39P_OEy28vahm7l1__bE_Vep1Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16025948/vpavic_190409_3357_0165.jpg\"\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p--has-dropcap\" id=\"RKNkWn\"\u003eOn a practical level, the Capsule II solves two problems that few other portable projectors manage. First, it has a decently loud, decently good 8W speaker built in, which means you have one less thing to worry about when you set up to watch a movie. You can even use it in a Bluetooth Speaker mode, which has the added benefit of lasting way longer than the standard three-ish hours it can run in projector mode.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Tva3ni\"\u003eThe second problem the Capsule II solves is just getting content into the projector so that it can project it. It has an HDMI-in port, but most of the time, you don’t need it because it runs a clean, native version of Android TV. That means you can use standard smart TV apps downloaded directly from the Google Play Store. As long as you can get a Wi-Fi connection, you can stream video from any app that’s installed on the device. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"mjEn2k\"\u003eIt will support Chromecast from several apps if you have the video saved locally on your phone.

Netflix’s certification block also applies to casting video, unfortunately. So to watch Netflix, you either have to be \u003ca href=\"https://www.howtogeek.com/280763/how-to-sideload-apps-on-android-tv/\"\u003eclever enough to sideload it yourself\u003c/a\u003e or you have to do it Anker’s way. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"zJdl45\"\u003eAnker’s way is to install the smartphone app controller app, then send you through a series of convoluted steps to sideload Netflix on the device directly. (If you were hoping to just use Cast for Netflix, sorry, that doesn’t work either.) From now on, you can only run Netflix by hitting the button in the smartphone app. It all works, technically, but it’s an awful experience. It’s pretty rough to ask users to install a literal file browser app, and it’s just as rough to have to use a button on the phone to launch Netflix.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"35lwd7\"\u003eSpeaking of rough: Amazon Prime Video is not compatible with this device, either. Aside from those limitations, I was able to watch all sorts of movies, HBO shows, and YouTube videos on it. Hulu, Spotify, Pandora.

When you set down the Capsule II, it is able to use lasers to autofocus. So far, so good. Unfortunately, the likelihood that you’d get the picture exactly where you want it on the first try is going to be low, so you’ll move the capsule a little to fix it. Once you do, it’ll go out of focus. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ST6Lmy\"\u003eAnker set up the software to trigger autofocus when the device is moved, but it doesn’t work very well. The fix is to hold down the HDMI button on the remote to activate the autofocus, which is fine. But if you don’t have the remote handy, the only way to fix the autofocus — and this is what Anker suggested — is to pick the thing up and \u003cem\u003eshake\u003c/em\u003e it. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-float-right c-float-hang\"\u003e\n  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Li275SoJyfNoyB5EQIDm0cwSo5Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16025943/vpavic_190409_3357_0151.jpg\"\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NX5wyOm-_Wm4SLzr1Tw5_BidjD4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16025942/vpavic_190409_3357_0066.jpg\"\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"dgqOcz\"\u003eThe last fiddly thing you need to do in order to get a good picture is the “keystone” adjustment, the thing that makes your picture look like a proper rectangle instead of a trapezoid. The Capsule II can only do vertical keystone adjustment, not horizontal. That means that you will need to position your projector centered directly in front of the surface you want to project on. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"sKEL7v\"\u003eGetting both vertical and horizontal keystone adjustments in something this small would be difficult, and Anker also tells me that to “comply with the Android TV certification regulations, we had to use only a vertical keystone.” It’s not a big deal, but you should be aware of it. There is a standard tripod mount on the bottom of the projector, so I just use it with a \u003ca href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734\u0026amp;xs=1\u0026amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FGorillaPod-Compact-Ballhead-Mirrorless-Charcoal%2Fdp%2FB074WFNNKY%2F\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003estandard Joby GorillaPod tripod\u003c/a\u003e to make it easier to place in the right spot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"EYv3K3\"\u003eThis all sounds dire, but in practice, it’s not — at least not if you have the remote and something good to set the Capsule II down on. You center it on a wall, point it up, hit the button to autofocus, and you’re done. Then it’s time to start playing a movie, and so long as you’ve got some kind of Wi-Fi, that’s as easy as doing it on your TV (minus Netflix and Amazon Prime video). Pro tip: make sure that Google Play movies is hooked up to your Movies Anywhere account so you can access movies that were purchased on Amazon or iTunes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"3Gx8yf\"\u003eOnce a video is going, the experience is nice. The picture can get really big and doesn’t seem to drift out of focus over time. The battery life really can reach just short of three hours in my experience, though you might want to have a charger or backup battery (it charges via USB-C) handy just in case. There is a fan that you can definitely hear inside, but it’s not loud enough to distract from the actual sound of the video you’re watching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"2k17Xf\"\u003eAs for picture quality, don’t expect this to be as good as your TV. You’ll need a dark area, and the larger you make the screen, the darker your room should be. Anker rates it at 200 ANSI lumens, which is to say it’s brighter than many other tiny projectors, but nowhere near as bright as a dedicated projector you plug in. I projected it on lots of different surfaces and as long as the surface was flat, it produced a clean and sharp 720p image.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-wide-block\"\u003e  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KOvkPp_ihKm7rVlOHzTYA31v7Gw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16025951/vpavic_190409_3357_0138.jpg\"\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p--has-dropcap\" id=\"SKA44r\"\u003eA portable projector is definitely an “aspirational” gadget. You can easily imagine all sorts of situations where you would be the hero with a TV in your bag. I personally like having it because I don’t want a TV in my bedroom.

The father and child drowned attempting to cross from Mexico to Texas. Dozens have died this year alone trying to cross the Rio Grande, where water levels rage the highest in 20 years due to unprecedented snowmelt runoff. The deserts that straddle the U.S.-Mexico border create another dangerous landscape for migrants: Just a few days prior to the Martínezes\u0026#8217; deaths, the bodies of a young woman, a toddler, and two infants were discovered in the Texas desert; they are believed to have died from heat exposure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the time of Alan Kurdi’s death, the \u003ca href=\"https://genius.com/Warsan-shire-home-annotated\"\u003ewords\u003c/a\u003e of British-Somali poet Warsan Shire became a rallying cry in support of the million-plus migrants risking their lives to seek safety in Europe:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eyou have to understand,\u003cbr /\u003e\nthat no one puts their children in a boat\u003cbr /\u003e\nunless the water is safer than the land\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe poem’s point, borne out again and again by the millions of displaced people who continue to undertake harrowing, deadly journeys to seek safer lives, is that deterrence efforts make little sense in the face of desperation. The same lines have been reposted a number of times on social media since the photo of Martínez and his daughter went viral, and in the wake of chilling \u003ca href=\"http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/07/the-inhumane-conditions-at-migrant-detention-camps.html\"\u003ereports\u003c/a\u003e from the U.S. border’s concentration camps, where children and infants, \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/06/19/children-separated-from-parents-family-separation-immigration/\"\u003eseparated\u003c/a\u003e from their parents, are among the tortured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe European Union killed Alan Kurdi; the United States killed Valeria and Óscar Alberto Martínez Ramírez. The 18,000-plus migrant deaths in the Mediterranean Sea since 2014, as well as the over 7,000 deaths around the U.S.-Mexico border since 1994, were state-sanctioned murders. This isn’t hyperbole: Last month, the International Criminal Court \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/06/09/europe-migrants-mediterranean-rescues/\"\u003esubmitted\u003c/a\u003e an indictment, claiming that the EU and its member states should be prosecuted for the deaths of thousands of migrants fleeing Libya who drowned in the Mediterranean. The Mediterranean stretch between northern Africa and Italy is only treacherous if you have to travel on an overcrowded smuggler’s dinghy, without the possibility of a rescue boat saving you if the vessel capsizes. The U.S. border crossing isn’t deadly unless you are on foot for days without water, shelter, or sustenance, hiding from law enforcement, cartels, and militias.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProponents of deterrence policies recognize that “no one puts their children in a boat, unless the water is safer than the land”; they just choose to make the water more perilous still. Consider President Donald Trump\u0026#8217;s \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1146514575048790019\"\u003etweet\u003c/a\u003e in the wake of reports about horrific conditions at migrant detention centers, including those intended to hold children: \u0026#8220;If Illegal Immigrants are unhappy with the conditions in the quickly built or refitted detentions centers, just tell them not to come.

But the assertion that migration deterrence policies are no less than murderous on a mass scale is a proposition that must be embraced and taken to its logical conclusion. The current immigration policies of the U.S. and the EU should already be understood as necropolitical; that is, they organize the lives of migrants in constant proximity to death, to bare life. Risk death by staying in a country destabilized by war, violence, economic and climate devastation, or risk death by fleeing to a purportedly more stable, prosperous state. There is no option which is not framed by exposure to death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe United Nations refugee agency \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/19/world/refugees-record-un.html\"\u003eannounced\u003c/a\u003e in late June that the number of people fleeing violence is the highest recorded since World War II. In a world where the number of displaced people is inexorably rising from conflict and climate decimation, wealthy countries will have only one of two options when it comes to mass migration: acceptance and opening borders, or genocide through deterrence. In order to avoid the latter, the entire racist, nationalist logic behind migrant deterrence must be rejected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cu\u003eIn the years\u003c/u\u003e since Kurdi’s death stirred international outrage, Fortress Europe has only hardened its ramparts against those seeking safety. Internal borders have been shuttered to close well-trodden routes, deportations were sped up, and thousands of refugee boats sent straight back to allegedly safe “third countries,” like war-torn Libya and authoritarian Turkey. Programs for sea rescue operations were ended, aid ships turned away at Italian ports; Europe has led the charge in \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/09/16/migrant-rescue-mediterranean-sea/\"\u003eprosecuting humanitarian workers\u003c/a\u003e.

Twenty percent of the world’s fresh water cycles through its rivers, plants, soils, and air. This moisture fuels and regulates multiple planet-scale systems, including the production of “rivers in the air” by evapotranspiration, a ceaseless churning flux in which the forest breathes its water into great hemispheric conveyer belts that carry it as far as the breadbaskets of Argentina and the American Midwest, where it is released as rain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the last half-century, about one-fifth of this forest, or some 300,000 square miles, has been cut and burned in Brazil, whose borders contain almost two-thirds of the Amazon basin.

To create pasture, the land-grabbers hacked miles of path through the forest with machetes and used motorcycles to transport long-blade chainsaws and drums of kerosene.

Thirty years later, the junta revived Vargas’s unrealized dream with Soviet-style five-year plans to “flood the Amazon with civilization.” Army engineers led dawn-to-dusk work crews that cut the first roads west of Mato Grosso, usually following old Indigenous hunting paths. State television ads promoted land and credit programs to spur transmigration from the overcrowded coasts and over-farmed savannah. They imagined an Amazon transformed: Out of an impenetrable wilderness, settlers would build a dense grid of ranches and small farms, each one connected to coastal ports and global commodity markets by a mighty network of roads and highways. The inhabitants of the forest, both Indians and non-Indigenous people living traditionally, would have to make way, adapt, and integrate. “Amazonian occupation will proceed as though we are waging a strategically conducted war,” said Castelo Branco, one of the generals who led the 1964 coup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-bleed large-bleed width-auto' style='width: auto;'\u003e\n\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-257569\" src=\"https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/07/AP_6403130328-brazil-coup-1562184245.jpg\" alt=\"Boy observes soldiers and war tank during rally organized by then President João Goulart, known as Jango, at which base reforms were defended, in Rio de Janeiro, southeastern Brazil, March 13, 1964.

The logistical challenges of settling the “green hell” were greater than the generals imagined, and the quality of the soils far worse. But if the regime failed to build a yeoman’s paradise on the ashes of the Amazon, it did produce the ashes. In 1988, when a new constitution was adopted three years after the return of civilian rule, more than a tenth of Brazil’s Amazon had been burned or degraded by government-supported settlers and industry.

(It also placed rules delimiting activity on the other 57 percent.) It established an environmental monitoring and enforcement agency, IBAMA, and revamped FUNAI to help Indigenous communities protect their lands and develop sustainable forest industries.

He couldn’t imagine a forest’s edge, because none of the roughly 10,000 Jupaú living at the time had ever seen one. Only after 1970, when army engineers completed a dirt road connecting neighboring Mato Grasso to Porto Velho, Rondônia’s capital, did the concept of the frontier gain meaning. As settlers poured into the region on 364 — a half-million over the decade — the Jupaú learned to fear the frontier as a place of disease and violence, a buzzsaw that would cut them down to the verge of extinction. “We would retreat, and every time, when we looked out from the hills, we felt safe,” remembers Arima, one of 200 surviving Jupaú. “We thought they could never reach us.

The Jupaú waged war in return. “We told the whites to leave, but they didn’t listen,” said Arima, who led raids as an adolescent and was celebrated for the accuracy of his longbow. “We killed them and burned their houses.

The area is at the center of the local red zone, targeted by a rising number of invaders working on behalf of local cattle interests.

Awapu knelt down, cleared some dirt, and drew a right angle with a stick. “They start with this ‘L’ shape,” he said, motioning toward the path. “A group of 15 men with machetes can clear lines through 20 kilometers of forest in a week. Marking the plot, making entrances. When the rains stop, they come back with chainsaws to cut the smaller trees and clear the way for tractors, if there is a road nearby. They burn what’s left.

But any violence is surely to be asymmetrical, as it has always been. The Pastoral Land Commission, operated by Brazil’s Catholic Church, has recorded more than 600 land-related murders in the country since 2003, most in the Amazon region, with a 20 percent increase in 2018.

Abruptly the cool shadow world of closed canopy forest gave way to the blinding oven-hot world of open grassland baking under the midday equatorial sun. On one side of the split screen, the primordial tangle of what the 19th-century Brazilian historian Euclides da Cunha called “the last unwritten page of Genesis.” On the other, a group of humped zebu cows dumbly chewed their cud.

A social and political movement coalesced to reject the false choice between conservation and development. Uniting Indigenous and non-Indigenous forest peoples, it spoke the modern language of justice, something new in the Amazon. Its leader was a rubber tapper and union leader from southern Acre named Chico Mendes. As the fires from Rondônia roared west, Mendes organized a coalition of people who depended on a living forest. This coalition pioneered a form of nonviolent direct action called the \u003cem\u003eempate\u003c/em\u003e, or stalemate. In some \u003cem\u003eempates\u003c/em\u003e, men, women, and children formed human walls around trees, daring the cut crews, their fellow poor, to kill them. In others, armed groups would overwhelm the clearcutters’ camps and hold the workers hostage while smashing chainsaws and decommissioning tractors.

His renown peaked just as the world began acknowledging the challenged posed by climate change, a development that timed with Brazil’s transition to civilian rule. Because of this lucky confluence of history, Mendes’s legacy survived in the new constitution and government, most notably in the creation of an archipelago of large “extractive reserves” set aside for the harvesting of rubber, nuts, berries, and other sustainable forest industries. In 2007, when then-President Lula da Silva established a conservation institute inside the Ministry of Environment, he named it after Mendes, his fellow unionist and comrade from the early 1980s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-right  width-fixed' style='width: 768px;'\u003e\n\u003cimg class=\"alignright size-large wp-image-257598\" src=\"https://prod01-cdn06.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/07/AP_8812250168-lula-chico-1562186412-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Luiz Inácio da Silva, now the President of Brazil, delivers speech during funeral of Chico Mendes, environmentalist killed in his hometown of Xapuri.

If we put value on Acre’s Indigenous groups and others who manage forest resources sustainably, they’ll put more into the economy than expanding cattle and soy.

Take away this vegetation, and the region’s topsoil dries and depletes quickly, requiring expensive systems of short-term life support and the constant creation of new land. Most pasture is degraded and abandoned within 10 or 15 years, meaning the industry’s existence (never mind its expansion) is predicated on a permanent cycle of destruction: More forest must always be cut to keep ahead of the processes triggered by the last cutting, which removed the soil’s natural source of nutrients. The Amazon’s soy industry likewise struggles to keep pace with rapidly fading soils by creating land and saturating it with ever larger dosages of chemical fertilizers and pesticides.

But the most important difference is one that can’t be quantified. The latter approach preserves the Amazon’s biodiversity and what the ethnobotanist and anthropologist Wade Davis calls its “ethnosphere” — the last remaining cultures that hold a worldview and values fundamentally different from those that brought us the Anthropocene epoch.

Trinta anos depois, o governo militar retomou o sonho não realizado de Vargas com planos de desenvolvimento para “inundar de civilização” a Amazônia. Engenheiros militares comandavam equipes de operários que trabalhavam o dia inteiro para abrir as primeiras estradas a oeste do Mato Grosso – muitas delas copiavam o traçado das antigas trilhas de caça dos índios. Anúncios do governo na TV ofereciam terras e crédito para incentivar a emigração do superpopuloso litoral e das terras já cultivadas do cerrado.

Índios ou não, os habitantes da floresta que levavam um modo de vida tradicional teriam que se adaptar e abrir passagem. “A ocupação da Amazônia será conduzida estrategicamente como uma guerra”, disse Castelo Branco, um dos líderes do golpe de 1964.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-bleed xtra-large-bleed width-auto' style='width: auto;'\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/07/AP_6403130328-brazil-coup-1562184245-1562359192.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-257867\" src=\"https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/07/AP_6403130328-brazil-coup-1562184245-1562359192.jpg\" alt=\"Rally in 1964\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"caption overlayed\"\u003eUm menino observa soldados do Exército num comício do então presidente João Goulart, no Rio, em março de 1964.

Os índios sofreram ainda mais: se, no início do século XX, seu número era estimado em alguns milhões, no fim da década de 1980 só restavam cerca de 200 mil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDesde então a população indígena quadruplicou, um renascimento que se deve aos esforços do Brasil em conter e reverter a onda de desmatamento que começou a se intensificar no fim dos anos 1960. A Constituição de 1988 demarcou 43% da Amazônia como zona proibida para a atividade industrial e o desmatamento – uma área que inclui centenas de novos parques, reservas e mais de 400 terras indígenas, equivalente a duas vezes o tamanho da Espanha –, e estabeleceu normas e limites para os 57% restantes. Foi criado um órgão de fiscalização, o Instituto Brasileiro do Meio Ambiente e dos Recursos Naturais Renováveis (Ibama), e a Funai foi reformulada para ajudar comunidades indígenas a protegerem suas terras e desenvolverem atividades silvícolas sustentáveis. Além disso, os bancos de desenvolvimento internacionais endureceram os requisitos ambientais e sociais de ajudas e empréstimos, e ONGs e ativistas organizaram boicotes internacionais de sucesso, culminando na histórica \u003ca href=\"https://news.mongabay.com/2015/01/brazils-soy-moratorium-dramatically-reduced-amazon-deforestation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eMoratória da Soja\u003c/a\u003e, em 2006.

No fim dos anos 1960, os pastos que hoje vão até onde a vista alcança estavam cobertos de mata virgem, exuberante e cheia de vida. Ele não sabia o que era a fronteira da floresta, porque nenhum dos 10 mil jupaús que ali viviam jamais havia visto tal coisa. Foi só em 1970, quando os engenheiros militares abriram uma estrada de terra ligando o Mato Grosso a Porto Velho, que ele conheceu na prática o conceito de fronteira. À medida em que os colonos iam chegando – meio milhão ao longo da década –, os jupaús aprenderam a temer a beira da mata como um lugar de doenças e violência, uma gigantesca lâmina que os deixaria à beira da extinção. “Nós fugíamos, e toda vez que olhávamos lá do alto, a sensação era de segurança”, recorda Arima, um dos 200 jupaús que restaram. “Achávamos que eles nunca nos alcançariam. Que a floresta era grande demais”, acrescenta.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eO homem branco não parava de chegar. Ele vinha semear a terra, criar gado, extrair madeira e garimpar ouro e cassiterita, o principal minério do estanho. Os colonos mais agressivos formavam esquadrões da morte e massacravam todos os índios que encontrassem. Uma das primeiras lembranças de Arima foi a pele do seu tio esticada por pedaços de pau, como um espantalho – um recado de um grupo de garimpeiros do local. Os jupaús reagiram. “Falamos para os brancos irem embora, mas eles não ouviram”, conta Arima, que, ainda adolescente, comandava os ataques e era famoso pela pontaria no arco. “Nós os matamos e queimamos as casas deles.

A BR-364, um artéria crucial para o plano de desenvolvimento da região, virava um verdadeiro atoleiro no inverno, a estação das chuvas – e a situação não era muito melhor nos meses de estio. Para desbravar o oeste, a estrada precisava ser pavimentada. O Banco Mundial apoiou o projeto, apesar de um parecer interno que alertava: a pavimentação de 1.400km de estrada intensificaria as catástrofes ambientais e humanas que já ocorriam na região. E foi exatamente o que aconteceu.

Um movimento social e político surgiu para refutar o falso dilema entre preservação e desenvolvimento. Unindo os povos da floresta – indígenas ou não –, ele falava a língua moderna da justiça, uma novidade na Amazônia. Seu líder era um seringueiro e sindicalista do sul do Acre chamado Chico Mendes. Enquanto as queimadas lambiam Rondônia em direção ao oeste, Mendes organizou uma coalizão de pessoas que dependiam da conservação da floresta. Essa aliança criou uma forma de ação não-violenta chamada “empate”. Em alguns empates, homens, mulheres e crianças formavam barreiras humanas em volta de árvores, desafiando os invasores – pobres como eles – a matá-los. Em outros, grupos armados atacavam as bases dos desmatadores, destruindo equipamentos e fazendo reféns. O jornalista Andrew Revkin presenciou aulas de ecologia e teoria marxista ministradas aos prisioneiros pelos homens de Mendes antes da destruição de um desses acampamentos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMendes ganhou o apelido de “Gandhi da Amazônia” antes de ser assassinado em 1988. Ele chegou ao auge da fama numa época em que o mundo começava a reconhecer os perigos da mudança climática e o Brasil se redemocratizava. Graças a essa feliz coincidência histórica, o legado do líder seringueiro sobreviveu na nova Constituição e no novo governo, principalmente por meio da criação de um arquipélago de “reservas extrativistas” destinadas à extração de borracha, castanha, frutas e outras atividades silvícolas sustentáveis. Em 2007, o então presidente Lula criou um instituto de conservação no seio do Ministério do Meio Ambiente. O órgão foi batizado com o nome de Chico Mendes, seu colega de sindicalismo no início dos anos 1980.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-right  width-fixed' style='width: 1000px;'\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/07/AP_8812250168-lula-chico-1562186412-1562361337.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg class=\"alignright size-article-large wp-image-257885\" src=\"https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/07/AP_8812250168-lula-chico-1562186412-1562361337-1000x1333.jpg\" alt=\"Lula discursa em funeral de Chico Mendes, no dia 25 de dezembro de 1988.\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"caption\"\u003eLula discursa em funeral de Chico Mendes, no dia 25 de dezembro de 1988.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class='caption source' style=''\u003eFoto: Ricardo Chaves/Agência Estado via AP\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eO nome de Mendes é tabu no governo Bolsonaro, e tem força o suficiente para incomodar.

Este sentimento encontra eco no estado de nascença do seringueiro, o Acre, que em outubro elegeu Gladson Cameli – um barão da soja de segunda geração – para governador, cargo que já havia sido ocupado por um ex-conselheiro de Chico Mendes, o ecologista Jorge Viana. Cameli comemorou a vitória convocando uma reunião com executivos do agronegócio em Porto Velho. “A salvação econômica do Acre é o agronegócio. Rondônia, nosso vizinho e irmão, é a prova disso”, declarou.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eO enfraquecimento do legado de Chico Mendes atinge até a reserva extrativista que leva o seu nome, na fronteira do Acre com o Peru e a Bolívia. Com a decadência da indústria da borracha, os filhos e netos da geração do “empate” – que cresceram ouvindo histórias de tratores sabotados, correntes humanas em volta de árvores e latifundiários fugindo com o rabo entre as pernas – estão virando pecuaristas.

Mas este fato não é suficiente para convencer famílias à mercê das vicissitudes de um mercado global que valoriza madeiras de lei e hambúrgueres. “A pecuária é um negócio seguro. Dá pra ter uma boa renda vendendo um bezerro ou um boi”, afirmou um morador da Reserva Chico Mendes a Lisa Song, repórter da ProPublica, que escreveu uma matéria recentemente sobre o fracasso da comunidade internacional em incentivar e proteger economias silvícolas sustentáveis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class='stylized pull-left'data-shortcode-type='pullquote' data-pull='left'\u003eUma floresta que renova a si mesma e permanece rica em biodiversidade traz mais benefícios – tanto econômicos quanto ambientais – do que a criação de um semiárido bovino, cuja expansão acaba tendo como resultado a seca.\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNa Assembleia Legislativa do Acre, uma bancada minoritária de deputados vem tentando modernizar a visão de Chico Mendes e impedir que um novo arco de fogo devore as florestas do estado, ainda intactas em sua maioria.

Se agregarmos valor à gestão sustentável que os povos indígenas e outros fazem dos recursos da floresta, veremos que eles contribuem muito mais para economia do que a pecuária e a soja.

Sem essa flora, a camada fértil do solo seca e se esgota rapidamente. Para que a produção se mantenha, é preciso fazer uso de onerosos sistemas de fertilização ou sair à procura de novas terras. A maioria dos pastos se degradam e são abandonados depois de 10 ou 15 anos. Ou seja, a própria existência desta atividade (para não falar de sua expansão) depende de um ciclo interminável de destruição: é preciso desmatar mais para superar os problemas causados pela última derrubada, que eliminou a fonte natural de nutrientes do solo. A indústria da soja na Amazônia também tenta lidar com a rápida degradação do solo criando mais terras cultiváveis, saturando-as de doses cada vez maiores de fertilizantes e agrotóxicos.

The Volcano can be used to emplace tactical minefields; reinforce existing obstacles; close lanes, gaps, and defiles; protect flanks. Volcano minefields are ideal for flank protection of advancing forces and for operating in concert with air and ground cavalry units on flank-guard or screen missions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA high-speed mine dispensing system can use onto helicopter or truck platforms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to GlobalSecurity.org, the M139 dispenser consists of an electronic DCU and four launcher racks; each rack holds 40 M87-series mine canisters. The racks provide the structural strength and the mechanical support required for launch and provide the electrical interface between the mine canisters and the DCU.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe operator uses the DCU to electrically control the dispensing operation from within the aircraft. The DCU provides controls for the arming sequence and the delivery speed selection, and it sets mine SD times. The DCU allows the operator to start and stop mine dispensing at anytime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Soldier-selectable, self-destruct mechanism destroys the mine at the end of its active lifecycle – 4 hours to 15 days – depending on the time selected. Using a ground vehicle, a 1,000-meter minefield can be laid in 4 to 12 minutes based on terrain and vehicle speed. A helicopter can complete the mission in 20 seconds. Advantages of this system include faster response, increased lethality, greater efficiency and enhanced safety.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_43317\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-43317\" style=\"width: 1340px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\u003e\u003cimg class=\"size-full wp-image-43317\" src=\"https://defence-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/5552373.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1340\" height=\"894\" srcset=\"https://defence-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/5552373.jpg 1340w, https://defence-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/5552373-300x200.jpg 300w, https://defence-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/5552373-768x512.jpg 768w, https://defence-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/5552373-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://defence-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/5552373-750x500.jpg 750w, https://defence-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/5552373-1140x761.jpg 1140w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1340px) 100vw, 1340px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-43317\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"\u003ePhoto by Sgt.

couldn’t ignore the contradictions of his foreign policy any longer","content":"\u003cp\u003eBy Thomas Wright\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eVyacheslav Molotov served in senior positions in the Soviet Union for more than a quarter century, including 10 years as Stalin’s foreign minister. He was dismissed in 1949 when he fell out of favor with Stalin, but he found his way back in to the Foreign Ministry after the dictator’s death in 1953. Over the next four years, he fought with the new Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev. \u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B006PHOHBA/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8\u0026amp;btkr=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eAccording \u003c/a\u003eto Molotov’s biographer, Geoffrey Roberts, Khrushchev “accused Molotov of being a dogmatist whose actions as foreign minister had united the USSR’s imperialist enemies.” The Soviet plenum passed a resolution that charged Molotov with opposing measures “to reduce international tension and strengthen world peace.” Molotov was dismissed from his post and named ambassador to Outer Mongolia (what is now independent Mongolia). This role wasn’t unimportant, and his fate was sweeter than those of Khrushchev’s other party rivals—Georgy Malenkov was made to manage a power station in Kazakhstan and Lazar Kaganovich a potash factory in the Urals. Even so, Molotov was far, far from the action. \u003cem\u003eBanished to Outer Mongolia\u003c/em\u003e quickly entered the English lexicon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn June 30, another mustachioed foreign-policy chief found himself in Outer Mongolia. John Bolton was sent to the capital, Ulaanbaatar, while President Donald Trump stepped into North Korea to meet Kim Jong Un. Trump was accompanied by loyalists—Mike Pompeo, Mick Mulvaney, Jared and Ivanka Trump—and a new adviser, Fox News’s Tucker Carlson, who is \u003ca href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/fox-news-tucker-carlson-privately-advises-trump-against-iran-war\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003ecredited \u003c/a\u003ewith talking the president out of striking Iran as his Cabinet had recommended. Trump invited Kim to the White House, and reports swirled that the United States would settle for a nuclear freeze by North Korea instead of denuclearization. In response, Bolton \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/AmbJohnBolton/status/1145646367865528320?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003etweeted\u003c/a\u003e, “Neither the NSC staff or I have discussed or heard of any desire to ‘settle for a nuclear freeze by North Korea.’ This was a reprehensible attempt by someone to box in the President. There should be consequences.” The words \u003cem\u003eNSC staff or I\u003c/em\u003e were doing a lot of work, implying that others in the administration were behind the move. We now know that Stephen Biegun, the State Department’s special envoy to North Korea, \u003ca href=\"https://www.axios.com/trump-negotiator-steve-biegun-signals-flexibility-in-north-korea-talks-0b1f9a53-2599-49ac-b236-0fa819d175f8.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003ebriefed \u003c/a\u003ereporters on Pompeo’s plane back from Korea that the administration was considering a “complete freeze” to unlock the talks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrump’s foreign policy has been full of twists and turns, but it has also followed a clear narrative arc. The 10-day period from June 20—when Trump reversed himself on Iran strikes—to the DMZ visit was among the most significant of his presidency, as he was forced to come to terms with the consequences and contradictions of his own decisions. Over the course of three decades, Trump has carefully nurtured two images of himself—as a dealmaker, and as a militarist. Bolton did all he could to encourage the latter. But even from faraway Ulaanbaatar this past weekend, it was clear that, when made to choose, Trump would opt for the former.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo understand where we are and where we are going, we must first understand where we have been. Trump became president with a set of deeply rooted visceral instincts about the world—hostility to alliances, skepticism of free trade, and support for authoritarian strongmen—but little idea about how to convert these beliefs into policy. He had few advisers qualified for high office who believed what he believed. He was insecure. And so he turned to a number of highly experienced businessmen and former military officers to fill key national-security and foreign-policy positions—John Kelly, James Mattis, H. R. McMaster, Gary Cohn, and Rex Tillerson. These men saw their role as constraining the president, not empowering him. They measured their success by what they prevented from happening, rather than by what they made happen. In the Trump epoch, this was the age of constraint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe president did not always listen to the “axis of adults.” In fact, he took pleasure in defying them on occasion, but he usually returned to the fold under pressure. While delivering a speech at the new NATO headquarters in May 2017, Trump raised doubts about his commitment to the alliance when he took out a sentence endorsing Article 5, the mutual-defense clause of the NATO charter. After the ensuing uproar, he was persuaded to state his support for Article 5 at a press conference with the Romanian president and in a subsequent speech in Poland. Under the leadership of the axis of adults, the administration produced strategic documents reflecting the views of the establishment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe president grew weary of the adult supervision and he gradually realized that he was the president. He could order his Cabinet members to do what he wished, even if they all objected. We can identify precisely when the age of constraint reached its peak and when it ended. The peak \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/17/us/politics/trump-iran-nuclear-deal-recertify.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003ecame \u003c/a\u003eon July 17, 2017, when the president sat in an interagency meeting to discuss the Iran nuclear deal—specifically the question of whether to recertify Iran’s compliance, an assessment that the United States was required to make every six months. Trump’s team presented him with three options, none of which involved leaving the deal. Trump was furious—he approved a recertification but promised that it would be the last one. By the next deadline, he wanted the option to leave. Bolton immediately began auditioning for the job as Trump’s top security adviser, writing an \u003ca href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/2017/08/iran-nuclear-deal-exit-strategy-john-bolton-memo-trump/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003earticle \u003c/a\u003ein National Review that laid out a plan to leave the Iran deal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the next few months, it was clear that Trump was intent on a change. He forced out the axis of adults, replacing Tillerson, Cohn, and McMaster with individuals who placed loyalty to the president over their own independent judgment. This ushered in the second phase of his presidency—the age of action. Trump now acted more freely, pursuing his instincts even when they conflicted with the advice of his officials. He announced talks with Kim Jong Un without consulting his Cabinet. He moved the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. He pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal. He imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum. He had a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki. He started a trade war with China. His national security adviser, Bolton, effectively abolished the interagency process through which the Pentagon, State Department, CIA, and other entities have formal seats at the table where decisions are made. The removal of constraints was complete when Mattis resigned in December 2018 following Trump’s promise to withdraw troops from Syria.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor Trump, the age of action was exhilarating. It fulfilled his expectations of what it meant to be president. But it couldn’t last forever. His actions were always focused on the short term. They were frequently riven with contradictions. There never was an end goal or a strategy for how to get there. The United States is a very powerful country. It can make mistakes for some time without incurring the costs that normal powers would experience if they pursued the same path. But it cannot do so indefinitely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe age of reckoning finally arrived on June 21, when Trump ordered air strikes on Iran and then changed his mind. At this moment, the contradictions in his Iran policy were laid bare. Trump wanted to shred the Iran nuclear deal and impose maximum pressure on the Iranian regime. He also wanted to avoid embroiling America in a new conflict in the Middle East. He could not have both. But for more than a year, he pretended as if these two goals were not in conflict. Perhaps he believed the Iranians would surrender without a fight. Or that they would come to the negotiating table from a position of weakness. Or perhaps he did not think about the endgame at all until he had to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor all his own flaws, Trump was not well served by his national security team. The axis of adults manipulated Trump by delaying, blocking, or blunting his requests. Bolton manipulated him by advocating for the most extreme options—such as imposing secondary sanctions on European countries to truly destroy the Iran nuclear deal, and pulling out of the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty—when more modest ones would have sufficed. \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/04/john-bolton-trump-national-security-adviser/583246/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eBolton’s priority\u003c/a\u003e has always been to advance his unilateralist theory of international law, and he seems unable to think strategically about America’s interests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt has been obvious for months that Trump did not want war with Iran, but Bolton kept the president from hearing from officials who would offer a contrary view to the hawks. Never one for protocol, Trump decided to go outside normal channels and started talking with Carlson, who now appears to be a confidant. It says a lot about Bolton’s own insecurity that he would prefer to put his boss in the position of relying on a talk-show host rather than allow an interagency meeting where a diversity of views might be raised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the reckoning, there is some clarity. It is now clear that Trump wants talks with Iran, just like with North Korea. Calling off the strikes was the right judgment call, but things should never have gotten to that point. Foreign governments now know what makes Trump tick. Pyongyang, Moscow, Beijing, Tehran, and others are no doubt taking copious notes. Trump’s team will be tempted to correct course—as it did by imposing tough new sanctions in the days after the Iran-strike decision—but the damage is done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe contradictions are catching up with Trump elsewhere. The DMZ summit confirmed that, if forced to choose between denuclearization and a good relationship with Kim Jong Un, he will choose Kim. In Venezuela, he was told that forcing Nicolás Maduro out of power would be an easy win. It was not. Faced with the choice between escalation and intervention on the one hand and disengagement on the other, he admonished his hawkish aides and chose the latter course. He was right not to intervene, but once again a crisis had reached a point it shouldn’t have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn China, Trump embraced foreign-policy hawks to create leverage that would compel Beijing to reach a trade deal. However, it looks like he has to choose between an agreement and efforts to counterbalance Chinese power. In Osaka, he \u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/trade-war-hangs-in-balance-as-trump-and-xi-finally-meet/2019/06/28/bb065eb2-9a02-11e9-830a-21b9b36b64ad_story.html?utm_term=.6c18892cb396\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003echose \u003c/a\u003eto keep the deal alive and reversed his decision to ban American companies from providing Huawei with technology. As time goes on, he may continue to prioritize economic gains over strategic concerns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe era of action ultimately forced Trump to choose dealmaking over militarism. He could change his mind in the future—particularly if he thinks he will look weak for not responding to new provocations, real or perceived—but the frame for the next 18 months appears to be set. A former senior official in the George W. Bush administration who is sympathetic to Bolton on some issues told me that Trump is so wrapped up in the image of a dealmaker, yet so ignorant of the issues, that he will “sign on to half-assed deals that he does not understand.” Referring to Iran, he said, “Does anyone think Pompeo’s strict conditions and objectives for negotiations will remain in place” once Trump gets involved? When a business deal that Trump made as a developer turned sour, he would go to court for a do-over. But taking a foreign-policy risk is different. As the former Bush official pointed out, the president has “no option of taking the country into Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings if it doesn’t work out.” By the time the bill comes due, the 2020 election will probably be over, so he’s unlikely to care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrump will still act freely in accordance with his own instincts on other fronts. It was obvious in Osaka that his heart is with other authoritarian leaders. He embraced Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and joked with Putin about Russian election interference. He did not know what Putin meant by his comment that Western liberalism is obsolete, and didn’t care to find out. Meanwhile, U.S. relations with the United Kingdom, Germany, and Japan are at post–Cold War lows. It is often, and rightly, said of Trump that he is undisciplined and loses interest in subjects quickly. But he has slowly and steadily chipped away at the pillars of the free world and used the rubble to lay the foundations of an illiberal alternative.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs during the previous twist in the narrative, Trump now finds himself with a national-security team out of sync with his preferences. Changes are inevitable. Pompeo will likely survive. He is nothing if not adaptable. After the Iran decision, he and Vice President Mike Pence let it be known that although they supported military action, they were equally enthusiastic about the president’s U-turn. It’s hard to see how Bolton can stay. Trump has long known that Bolton wants war more than he does. He sidelined him on North Korea and overruled him on Iran. For his part, Bolton has privately attacked Pompeo, long a Trump favorite, as falling captive to the State Department bureaucracy and has predicted that the North Korea policy will fail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBolton has given an unusually large number of interviews to reporters and has been rewarded with positive profiles lauding his influence and bureaucratic prowess. Those of us who predicted that he would cling to the post of national security adviser, as it would be the last job he’d ever get, may have been wrong. In fact, Bolton looks and sounds as if he is preparing to exit on his own terms. Better that than being sent on a never-ending tour of the world’s most obscure places. For Bolton, leaving because he’s too tough for Trump is the perfect way to save face. Otherwise, he may be remembered as the man who presided over one of the weakest national-security teams in modern American history and someone whose myopic obsessions—such as international treaties and communism in Venezuela—meant the United States lost precious time in preparing for the national-security challenges of the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho will replace Bolton is unclear. The best-case scenario would be Biegun, the North Korea envoy. He was rumored to be the runner-up to Bolton for the post in 2018. (Mattis and Kelly pushed for him, although at that point he had not spent time with Trump. Now he has.) Trump may see him as the man to oversee his various negotiations, as he has on North Korea. But will Trump go for a mainstream figure who would not be out of place in a traditional Republican presidency?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the past is prelude, Trump may turn instead to his favorite source of information, Fox News, just as he did for Bolton. One of Tucker Carlson’s frequent guests on his show is a retired Army colonel by the name of Douglas Macgregor. Macgregor served in the first Gulf War and appears to be ideologically aligned with Carlson, favoring retrenchment from the Middle East and good relations with authoritarian states. His appointment would be treated as a calamity by the Republican foreign-policy establishment—which is one reason it may appeal to the president. Appointing a cheerleading cable-news commentator to one of the nation’s most senior posts sounds ludicrous, but—as Carlson’s recent role demonstrates—it is the way we live now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne way or another, Trump seems determined to present an image of himself in 2020 as a dealmaker who is getting tough with allies who have taken advantage of the United States and making peace with the country’s enemies. The risks are enormous. Trump may strike bad deals. He could permanently weaken America’s influence and encourage aggression against allies. But it may work for him politically, throwing the Democrats off balance and setting the stage for a second term in which he will be empowered to follow his instincts to their logical conclusion. The bullets Trump never fired in his first term—such as withdrawal from NATO and the World Trade Organization—may be put back in the chamber. The 75-year-old American-led international order will be back in his firing line. Men like Pompeo may tell themselves they can steer him in a different direction. But if they finally stand up to him, they may find themselves with urgent business to attend to in Ulaanbaatar or, worse still, at a potash factory in the Urals.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2019/07/06/trump-couldnt-ignore-the-contradictions-of-his-foreign-policy-any-longer/","published":"2019-07-06T11:00:02Z","guid":"https://www.brookings.edu/?p=597670"}]},{"url":"https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/world/rss","items":[]},{"url":"https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/world/feed","items":[]},{"url":"https://www.pri.org/stories/feed/everything","items":[]},{"url":"https://rss.csmonitor.com/feeds/world","items":[]},{"url":"https://www.rand.org/topics/international-affairs.xml/feed","items":[]},{"url":"https://www.thelocal.es/feeds/rss.php","items":[{"title":"BACK

presidential election,” he noted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think Trump suffers from a political bipolar disease. Today he says something but tomorrow makes a completely different move. But the Leader of the Islamic Revolution rightly made a resolute decision by rejecting his offer for talks,” he said, stressing that Iran cannot trust such a moody person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Trump seeks to hold talks with Iran without conditions to gain more votes in the next election but it goes without saying that he would intensify his aggression against Iran in his next presidency,” he noted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Trump will definitely adopt a more aggressive approach towards Iran after gaining victory in the next election. Iran’s leader has got the point and said he doesn’t see Trump deserving a reply.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe then referred to the latest visit of Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to Iran who carried a message from Trump to the Iranian leaders and said the message was deceitful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The message said that Israel and some Arab states of the region as well as the US Republicans are after war with Iran. It was aimed at pressurizing Iran into sitting for talks with the US to resolve the current conflicts,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegarding the Iran nuclear deal, he said Iran has already lived up to its pledges under the deal and now it is the US which should do so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Unfortunately, the US has not yet fulfilled its commitments under the deal. So, how on the earth can we get back to the JCPOA? Does the US have the legal right to put sanctions on Iran’s oil industry based on the JCPOA? How about its sanctions on Iran’s Central Bank and oil tankers? So, the measures make returning to the JCPOA nonsense.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It is not acceptable that the US puts sanctions on the Iran’s Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC). The Iranian force has been fighting the regional terrorists. The Americans are after undermining the IRGC. So, talks with the US have no justification,” he added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe also touched on the European Union mechanism for financial transactions with Iran, the Instrument in Support of Trade Exchanges, known as INSTEX, and said neither the US, nor the Europeans recognize the INSTEX as an efficient mechanism.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If Iran gets involved in a financial exchange with the EU within the INSTEX, it is not clear whether or not it can follow up any related dispute with the EU through international bodies. I think the response is negative because Iran is a government but the other side is not a government. It is a private company,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to the analyst, the Europeans are seeking to confine Iran within a certain framework and leave it empty-handed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, Trump is seeking to buy time on the one hand to exert more pressure on Iran and to gain victory in the next presidential elections on the other hand,” he concluded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe post \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ifpnews.com/exclusive/trump-to-lose-2020-elections-if-he-wages-war-on-iran-analyst/\"\u003eTrump to Lose 2020 Elections If He Wages War on Iran: Analyst\u003c/a\u003e appeared first on \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ifpnews.com\"\u003eIran Front Page\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://ifpnews.com/exclusive/trump-to-lose-2020-elections-if-he-wages-war-on-iran-analyst/","published":"2019-07-06T10:26:11Z","guid":"https://ifpnews.com/?p=145494"},{"title":"‘Abducted Iranian Diplomats Still Alive, Held in Israeli Jail’","content":"\u003cp\u003eIn a post on his Twitter account on the 37\u003csup\u003eth\u003c/sup\u003e anniversary of the abduction of the Iranian diplomats in Lebanon, advisor to the Iranian Parliament Speaker Hossein Amir Abdollahian said the four abducted Iranian diplomats Seyyed Mohsen Mousavi, Ahmad Motevasselian, Taqi Rastegar Moqaddam and Kazem Akhavan were brave man who are still held in Israeli jails.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe diplomats were kidnapped by a group of gunmen at an inspection post in northern Lebanon on July 4, 1982.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEarlier, Iranian Foreign Ministry issued a statement on the 37\u003csup\u003eth\u003c/sup\u003e anniversary of the abduction of the diplomats, reiterating its call on the international bodies to follow up on their fate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the Friday statement, the Foreign Ministry stressed that based on ample evidence, the Islamic Republic of Iran holds the Zionist regime of Israel and its allies legally and politically responsible for the abduction and the terrorist move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFour Iranian diplomats – the then charge d’affaires of the Iranian embassy in Beirut Seyyed Mohsen Mousavi, military attaché Ahmad Motevasselian, embassy technician Taqi Rastegar Moqaddam and a journalist working for the Islamic Republic News Agency Kazem Akhavan were kidnapped by a group of Israel-backed gunmen at an inspection post in northern Lebanon on July 4, 1982.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe post \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ifpnews.com/exclusive/abducted-iranian-diplomats-still-alive-held-in-israeli-jail/\"\u003e‘Abducted Iranian Diplomats Still Alive, Held in Israeli Jail’\u003c/a\u003e appeared first on \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ifpnews.com\"\u003eIran Front Page\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://ifpnews.com/exclusive/abducted-iranian-diplomats-still-alive-held-in-israeli-jail/","published":"2019-07-06T09:49:58Z","guid":"https://ifpnews.com/?p=145487"},{"title":"Sources in Iran Deny Reports of Seizing UK Oil Tanker","content":"\u003cp\u003eEarlier in the day, certain journalists and observers tracked the movement of the UK-flagged supertanker \u0026#8216;Pacific Voyager\u0026#8217;

Later reports showed he was actually supposed to make those offers during the visit. Informed sources say Abe had received the offers from the American side and was supposed to share them with Iran with the aim of easing tensions and prepare the grounds for the beginning of Tehran-Washington talks. It becomes even more convincing when we recall that ahead of Abe\u0026#8217;s visit to Tehran, Donald Trump had travelled to Tokyo and held long talks on Iran with the Japanese side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe offers had reportedly been conveyed to Iran before Abe\u0026#8217;s trip, and Tehran had implicitly expressed its satisfaction, saying that it would wait for Abe’s visit to hear the offers from himself and make its final decision, but it was OK with the offers in general. According to informed sources, the offer of reducing restrictions on oil exports was indeed based on giving temporary waivers to some of Iran\u0026#8217;s oil clients. This was actually the main demand of Japan and Abe, who has in recent years always tried to maintain Tokyo\u0026#8217;s economic relations with Tehran, and meet its oil demands through Iran. On average, Japan used to import about 300,000 barrels of oil per day from Iran before the re-imposition of Washington\u0026#8217;s unilateral sanctions against the Islamic Republic. Also when it comes to sanctions on the auto industry, we see that Japanese carmakers are active in Iran and Tokyo is looking for a solution to be able to secure their continued operation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe issue of waivers was so serious that, amid Abe\u0026#8217;s visit to Tehran, some sources reported the US administration was set to extend Iran\u0026#8217;s oil waivers for some countries including Japan, South Korea, and China. Informed sources also say Iran had told the Japanese side it did not want to hold direct talks with Washington, but considered Tokyo a good mediator for such negotiations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, everything suddenly changed. Two days before the Japanese premier\u0026#8217;s visit to Iran, in a move that came against Tokyo\u0026#8217;s expectations, the US imposed petrochemical sanctions against Iran. Abe thought Trump\u0026#8217;s offers were still in place. However, when the Japanese leader was starting his trip, he was suddenly informed by the White House that the Trump administration had taken back its offers. High-ranking informed sources say when Abe went to meet with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and Iran\u0026#8217;s Leader Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei, he did not raise any of those offers. This comes as according to sources familiar with the issue, Abe had shared those offers with Iran ahead of his visit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNevertheless, Abe believes his visit had two important achievements: the first one was Rouhani\u0026#8217;s remark that Iran is not after a war, and the second was the Leader\u0026#8217;s emphasis on the fact that Iran considers development of nuclear weapons \u0026#8220;haram\u0026#8221; based on his fatwa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTherefore, the visit – that could not only ease regional tensions and de-escalate Tehran-Washington relations, but also mark the beginning of a new diplomatic initiative – was neutralized by the US itself. Informed sources say the team of anti-Iran hawks surrounding Trump – who are against any serious talks with Tehran and have been known as the B-Team – were directly behind the sudden change in Trump’s approach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe post \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ifpnews.com/exclusive/why-shinzo-abes-iran-visit-turned-into-failure/\"\u003eWhy Shinzo Abe\u0026#8217;s Iran Visit Turned into Failure\u003c/a\u003e appeared first on \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ifpnews.com\"\u003eIran Front Page\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://ifpnews.com/exclusive/why-shinzo-abes-iran-visit-turned-into-failure/","published":"2019-07-06T05:03:41Z","guid":"https://ifpnews.com/?p=145386"},{"title":"Tehran Raps US for Requesting IAEA to Hold Meeting on Iran","content":"\u003cp\u003eIran’s mission to the IAEA said in a statement on Friday that the recent developments related to the Iran nuclear deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) have nothing to do with the responsibilities of the IAEA’s Board of Governors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Iranian mission described as a “sad irony” Washington’s asking the IAEA to hold a meeting to discuss Iran’s reduction of its commitments under the nuclear deal in reaction to the US withdrawal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;It is indeed a bitter irony that the concern about the JCPOA\u0026#8217;s implementation is being raised by the very regime which has practically violated the deal through its illegal and unilateral withdrawal, and has pressured others to do the same,\u0026#8221; read the statement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;The fact that the US, as the first and main violator of the JCPOA, has made such a request indicates its isolation, which results from its opposition to multilateralism and the rule of law in international affairs,\u0026#8221; it added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe statement also read that Iran’s decision to scale back its commitments under the JCPOA is in response to the situation created by the US and is aimed at restoring the “lost balance” to the nuclear deal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Iran’s decision completely conforms to the provisions of this agreement,” read the statement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Moreover, the recent developments [ in the JCPOA] have nothing to do with issues related to the IAEA’s Safeguards Agreement and responsibilities of the IAEA’s Board of Governors.
