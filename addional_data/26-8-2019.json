From this perspective, our economy is now in a favorable place, and I will describe how we are working to sustain these conditions in the face of significant risks we have been monitoring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe current U.S. expansion has entered its 11th year and is now the longest on record.\u003ca title=\"footnote 1\" href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190823a.htm#fn1\"\u003e\u003csup\u003e1\u003c/sup\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca name=\"f1\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e The unemployment rate has fallen steadily throughout the expansion and has been near half-century lows since early 2018. But that rate alone does not fully capture the benefits of this historically strong job market. Labor force participation by people in their prime working years has been rising. While unemployment for minorities generally remains higher than for the workforce as a whole, the rate for African Americans, at 6 percent, is the lowest since the government began tracking it in 1972. For the past few years, wages have been increasing the most for people at the lower end of the wage scale. People who live and work in low- and middle-income communities tell us that this job market is the best anyone can recall. We increasingly hear reports that employers are training workers who lack required skills, adapting jobs to the needs of employees with family responsibilities, and offering second chances to people who need one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInflation has been surprisingly stable during the expansion: not falling much when the economy was weak and not rising much as the expansion gained strength. Inflation ran close to our symmetric 2 percent objective for most of last year but has been running somewhat below 2 percent this year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThus, after a decade of progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the economy is close to both goals. Our challenge now is to do what monetary policy can do to sustain the expansion so that the benefits of the strong jobs market extend to more of those still left behind, and so that inflation is centered firmly around 2 percent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday I will explore what history tells us about sustaining long, steady expansions. A good place to start is with the passage of the Employment Act of 1946, which stated that it is the \u0026#8220;continuing policy and responsibility of the Federal Government \u0026#8230; to promote maximum employment, production, and purchasing power.\u0026#8221;\u003ca title=\"footnote 2\" href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190823a.htm#fn2\"\u003e\u003csup\u003e2\u003c/sup\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca name=\"f2\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e Some version of these goals has been in place ever since. I will divide the history since World War II into three eras organized around some well-known \u0026#8220;Greats.\u0026#8221; The first era comprises the postwar years through the Great Inflation. The second era brought the Great Moderation but ended in the Great Recession. The third era is still under way, and time will tell what \u0026#8220;Greats\u0026#8221; may emerge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach era presents a key question for the Fed and for society more generally. The first era raises the question whether a central bank can resist the temptations that led to the Great Inflation. The second era raises the question whether long expansions supported by better monetary policy inevitably lead to destabilizing financial excesses like those seen in the Great Moderation. The third era confronts us with the question of how best to promote sustained prosperity in a world of slow global growth, low inflation, and low interest rates. Near the end of my remarks, I will discuss the current context, and the ways these questions are shaping policy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEra I, 1950–1982: Policy Breeds Macroeconomic Instability and the Great Inflation\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\nThe late 1940s were a period of adjustment to a peacetime economy. As the 1940s turned to the 1950s, the state of knowledge about how best to promote macroeconomic stability was limited. The 1950s and early 1960s saw the economy oscillating sharply between recession and growth above 6 percent (\u003ca id=\"fig1\" href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/powell-figure1-20190823.png\" data-caption=\"\" data-content=\"\" data-flickr=\"false\" data-gallery=\"global-figures\" data-title=\"\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\"\u003efigure 1, panel A\u003c/a\u003e). Three expansions and contractions came in quick succession. With the benefit of hindsight, the lack of stability is generally attributed to \u0026#8220;stop and go\u0026#8221; stabilization policy, as monetary and fiscal authorities grappled with how best to modulate the use of their blunt but powerful tools.\u003ca title=\"footnote 3\" href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190823a.htm#fn3\"\u003e\u003csup\u003e3\u003c/sup\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca name=\"f3\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeginning in the mid-1960s, \u0026#8220;stop and go\u0026#8221; policy gave way to \u0026#8220;too much go and not enough stop\u0026#8221;—not enough, that is, to quell rising inflation pressures.

The Fed was cutting, not raising, rates in the months prior to the end of the first two expansions in this era, and the ensuing recessions were mild by historical standards. And twice during the long expansion of the 1990s, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) eased policy in response to threats to growth. In 1995, responding to evidence of slowing in the United States and abroad, the FOMC reduced the federal funds rate over a few months. In 1998, the Russian debt default and the related collapse of the hedge fund Long‑Term Capital Management rocked financial markets that were already fragile from the Asian financial crisis. Given the risks posed to the U.S. economy, the FOMC again lowered the federal funds rate over a period of months until events quieted. The 10-year expansion weathered both events with no discernible inflation cost.\u003ca title=\"footnote 7\" href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190823a.htm#fn7\"\u003e\u003csup\u003e7\u003c/sup\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca name=\"f7\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the turn of the century, it was beginning to look like financial excesses and global events would pose the main threats to stability in this new era rather than overheating and rising inflation.

Before turning to issues occupying center stage at present, I want to address a long-running issue that I discussed here last year: tracking the \u0026#8220;stars\u0026#8221; that serve as guideposts for monetary policy.\u003ca title=\"footnote 10\" href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190823a.htm#fn10\"\u003e\u003csup\u003e10\u003c/sup\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca name=\"f10\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e These include u*, the natural rate of unemployment, and r*, the neutral real rate of interest.

The first era raised the question of whether the Fed can avoid excessive inflation. Inflation has averaged less than 2 percent over the past 25 years, and low inflation has been the main concern for the past decade. Low inflation seems to be the problem of this era, not high inflation. Nonetheless, in the unlikely event that signs of too-high inflation return, we have proven tools to address such a situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second era\u0026#8217;s question—whether long expansions inevitably breed financial excesses—is a challenging and timely one. Hyman Minsky long argued that, as an expansion continues and memories of the previous downturn fade, financial risk management deteriorates and risks are increasingly underappreciated.\u003ca title=\"footnote 13\" href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190823a.htm#fn13\"\u003e\u003csup\u003e13\u003c/sup\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca name=\"f13\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e This observation has spurred much discussion. At the end of the day, we cannot prevent people from finding ways to take excessive financial risks. But we can work to make sure that they bear the costs of their decisions, and that the financial system as a whole continues to function effectively. Since the crisis, Congress, the Fed, and other regulatory authorities here and around the world have taken substantial steps to achieve these goals. Banks and other key institutions have significantly more capital and more stable funding than before the crisis. We comprehensively review financial stability every quarter and release our assessments twice a year to highlight areas of concern and allow oversight of our efforts. We have not seen unsustainable borrowing, financial booms, or other excesses of the sort that occurred at times during the Great Moderation, and I continue to judge overall financial stability risks to be moderate. But we remain vigilant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat leaves the third question of how, in this low r* world, the Fed can best support the economy. A low neutral interest rate presents both near-term and longer-term challenges. I will begin with the current context. Because today\u0026#8217;s setting is both challenging and unique in many ways, it may be useful to lay out some general principles for assessing and implementing appropriate policy and to describe how we have been applying those principles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough the FOMC\u0026#8217;s setting of the federal funds rate target range and our communications about the likely path forward for policy and the economy, we seek to influence broader financial conditions to promote maximum employment and price stability. In forming judgments about the appropriate stance of policy, the Committee digests a broad range of data and other information to assess the current state of the economy, the most likely outlook for the future, and meaningful risks to that outlook. Because the most important effects of monetary policy are felt with uncertain lags of a year or more, the Committee must attempt to look through what may be passing developments and focus on things that seem likely to affect the outlook over time or that pose a material risk of doing so. Risk management enters our decisionmaking because of both the uncertainty about the effects of recent developments and the uncertainty we face regarding structural aspects of the economy, including the natural rate of unemployment and the neutral rate of interest. It will at times be appropriate for us to tilt policy one way or the other because of prominent risks. Finally, we have a responsibility to explain what we are doing and why we are doing it so the American people and their elected representatives in Congress can provide oversight and hold us accountable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe have much experience in addressing typical macroeconomic developments under this framework. But fitting trade policy uncertainty into this framework is a new challenge. Setting trade policy is the business of Congress and the Administration, not that of the Fed. Our assignment is to use monetary policy to foster our statutory goals. In principle, anything that affects the outlook for employment and inflation could also affect the appropriate stance of monetary policy, and that could include uncertainty about trade policy. There are, however, no recent precedents to guide any policy response to the current situation. Moreover, while monetary policy is a powerful tool that works to support consumer spending, business investment, and public confidence, it cannot provide a settled rulebook for international trade. We can, however, try to look through what may be passing events, focus on how trade developments are affecting the outlook, and adjust policy to promote our objectives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis approach is illustrated by the way incoming data have shaped the likely path of policy this year. The outlook for the U.S. economy since the start of the year has continued to be a favorable one. Business investment and manufacturing have weakened, but solid job growth and rising wages have been driving robust consumption and supporting moderate growth overall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the year has progressed, we have been monitoring three factors that are weighing on this favorable outlook: slowing global growth, trade policy uncertainty, and muted inflation. The global growth outlook has been deteriorating since the middle of last year. Trade policy uncertainty seems to be playing a role in the global slowdown and in weak manufacturing and capital spending in the United States. Inflation fell below our objective at the start of the year. It appears to be moving back up closer to our symmetric 2 percent objective, but there are concerns about a more prolonged shortfall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCommittee participants have generally reacted to these developments and the risks they pose by shifting down their projections of the appropriate federal funds rate path. Along with July\u0026#8217;s rate cut, the shifts in the anticipated path of policy have eased financial conditions and help explain why the outlook for inflation and employment remains largely favorable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning to the current context, we are carefully watching developments as we assess their implications for the U.S. outlook and the path of monetary policy. The three weeks since our July FOMC meeting have been eventful, beginning with the announcement of new tariffs on imports from China. We have seen further evidence of a global slowdown, notably in Germany and China. Geopolitical events have been much in the news, including the growing possibility of a hard Brexit, rising tensions in Hong Kong, and the dissolution of the Italian government. Financial markets have reacted strongly to this complex, turbulent picture. Equity markets have been volatile. Long-term bond rates around the world have moved down sharply to near post-crisis lows. Meanwhile, the U.S. economy has continued to perform well overall, driven by consumer spending. Job creation has slowed from last year\u0026#8217;s pace but is still above overall labor force growth. Inflation seems to be moving up closer to 2 percent. Based on our assessment of the implications of these developments, we will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor market and inflation near its symmetric 2 percent objective.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Three Questions in the Longer Run\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\nLooking back over the three eras, monetary policy has evolved to address new challenges as they have arisen. The inflation targeting regime that emerged after the Great Inflation has led to vastly improved outcomes for employment and price stability around the world. One result has been much longer expansions, which often brought with them the buildup of financial risk. This new pattern has led us to understand that assuring financial stability over time requires much greater resilience in our financial system, particularly for our largest, most complex banks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs we look back over the decade since the end of the financial crisis, we can again see fundamental economic changes that call for a reassessment of our policy framework. The current era has been characterized by much lower neutral interest rates, disinflationary pressures, and slower growth. We face heightened risks of lengthy, difficult-to-escape periods in which our policy interest rate is pinned near zero. To address this new normal, we are conducting a public review of our monetary policy strategy, tools, and communications—the first of its kind for the Federal Reserve. We are evaluating the pros and cons of strategies that aim to reverse past misses of our inflation objective. We are examining the monetary policy tools we have used both in calm times and in crisis, and we are asking whether we should expand our toolkit. In addition, we are looking at how we might improve the communication of our policy framework.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePublic engagement, unprecedented in scope for the Fed, is at the heart of this effort.

As discussed by Faust (1996), the structure of FOMC governance was motivated by the traditional view that governments are tempted to resort to inflation in times of stress. With the post–World War II emphasis on full employment and understanding the role of inflation expectations, this tendency was reformulated as seeking near-term gains on employment at the cost of long-term inflation (Kydland and Prescott, 1977; Barro and Gordon, 1983).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca name=\"fn5\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e5. Overall inflation, which is the subject of our symmetric 2 percent objective, has been somewhat more volatile, but it is neither practical nor wise to try to smooth purely transitory inflation fluctuations. As such transitory fluctuations are frequently driven by volatile food and energy prices, I am citing the stability of core inflation on a four-quarter basis as a proxy for Fed performance in achieving the relevant sense of stability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca name=\"fn6\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e6. Analysts debate the role that monetary policy and other factors, such as luck and structural change in the economy, played in bringing about the Great Moderation. For example, Ahmed, Levin, and Wilson (2004) find an important role for luck. Stock and Watson (2003) attribute much of the change to an unexplained improvement in the tradeoff between inflation and output variability. Like Bernanke (2004), I believe that better policy was an important factor behind the better outcomes, perhaps allowing other factors to show through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca name=\"fn7\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e7.

For presidents, the economy has historically been one of the key drivers of election wins, traditionally only falling behind war time issues in importance. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhat’s less clear is how voters judge the economy’s health and how much policy initiatives and campaign promises, like tax cuts, can tip the scales. In general, decades of studies and research have shown voters to be sociotropic, considering wider economic conditions over their own personal (pocketbook) finances. Still, many of the nuances of voter behavior around the economy are the subject of vigorous debate. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor starters, voters tend to have what experts call “myopia,” or a shortsighted view. An incumbent’s share of the popular vote is largely correlated to GDP growth in the year of the election, but adding economic data from previous years does not improve election projections, according to Vanessa Williamson, public policy researcher and author of \u003cem\u003eRead My Lips: Why Americans Are Proud to Pay Taxes.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the models predict the popular vote well,\nshe added, that does not always equate to a victory in our electoral college\nsystem. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe idea of what weighs more in the voters minds—their family’s personal finances or the general welfare of their community and the nation—is an ongoing heated debate among experts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“On balance people weigh the whole economy more\nheavily than personal or family income,” University of Iowa political scientist\nMichael Lewis-Beck said, adding that surveys show that voters impressions of\nthe economy correlate strongly to GDP growth in any given year. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“The pocketbook is weaker than the sociotropic\ninfluence but it’s not zero,” he said. “If they are suffering, they may not be\nlikely to vote at all, or if they do, they are more likely to vote against the\nincumbent. It’s not as big an effect as if they judge the whole economy as\nsuffering.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the economy is often a key variable in an\nelection outcome, some research has shown that despite positive economic\nfactors in an election year, media coverage can influence the perception of the\neconomy enough to shift votes. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn a \u003ca href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2111629?read-now=1\u0026amp;seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents\"\u003estudy of Bill Clinton’s win\u003c/a\u003e over George H.W. Bush in 1992, political scientist Marc Hetherington found although the early \u0026#8217;90s recession had technically ended by election year and GDP was once again positive, persistent coverage signaling an ongoing fiscal crisis negatively colored voters perceptions, swaying them to the Democrat.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAdditionally, recent studies indicate the voter’s “patrimony,” their land, property, and assets outside of a typical salary, also plays into their choice, as those with more resources tend to vote Republican. That may be a concern for the GOP, as the U.S. homeownership rate fell in the first quarter for the first time in two years and is at a 50-year low for African Americans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe economy has grown under Trump, and by some\nindicators—unemployment rate, consumer confidence, productivity—is healthy.\nOther signs are less promising. A recent trend of rising wages appears to be\nstalling as blue-collar job growth is at its lowest level since Trump’s\ninauguration. Surveys show manufacturing activity is falling toward recession\nlevels. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“Unemployment rates may be low, but that doesn’t\naccount for people who have stopped looking for work,” Lewis-Beck said. “And if\npeople are working two to three jobs to get by, sure they have a job, but they\nare scrambling to pay rent with multiple jobs. That’s not a good economy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTaking a look around the globe, several nations are teetering on the brink of extended contraction. Three of Europe\u0026#8217;s four largest economies, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Italy, are on the path to recession by the new year. China is growing at its slowest pace in 27 years, and Japan appears headed for recession, as well. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTrump’s signature domestic economic initiative,\nthe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, also may have come too early in his presidency to\ngive him any noticeable election-year boost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“Voters have previously forgotten much larger and\nmore popular middle-class tax cuts,” said Williamson, also a senior fellow of\ngovernance studies at the Brookings Institute, arguing early cuts under George\nW. Bush and Barack Obama did little to boost their polling later in their\nterms. “In general American’s don’t recognize the benefits of public policy\ndone through the tax code as well as they do more direct and straightforward\nprograms such as Social Security.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePolling indicates presidential approval rates are\ngrowing less closely related to the state of the economy, according to Williamson,\na trend she first noticed under Obama but has grown stronger with Trump’s first\nterm. The \u003ca href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/1675/most-important-problem.aspx\"\u003emost recent Gallup Poll \u003c/a\u003ehad both\n“government/poor leadership” and “immigration” ahead of economic issues as the\nnation’s “most important problem,” and the percentage of people placing\neconomic problems at the top of the list is steadily falling. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“We are living in a time of extremely high\npartisanship and that does explain a lot,” she said. “Partisanship is swamping\nother considerations and makes it less likely to see changes in attitude.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNonetheless, the economy is still the crux around which successful campaigns are built. In her book, \u003ca href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/titles/8937.html\"\u003eThe Message Matters\u003c/a\u003e, UCLA public policy professor Lynn Vavreck argues campaign fortunes are intricately linked to the economy and messaging. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn boom times the challenger must run an “insurgent campaign,” hitting on a new, salient issue where the incumbent has a less popular position. In contrast, the incumbent runs a “clarifying campaign,” consistently highlighting the economy. John Kennedy and Jimmy Carter were “insurgent candidates” who defeated incumbents backed by strong economies because they hit on issues of U.S. military inferiority to the Soviet Union and Washington, D.C., cronyism and corruption, respectively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile voters still play close attention to the\neconomy, how they score may be changing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“One thing I’m seeing that is more in play than before is inequality,” Lewis-Beck said. “Historically people in the U.S. don’t care much about inequality, they cared more about opportunity to get ahead and climb to the top … That’s starting to change and is coming to the fore as inequality gets more severe, and it hasn’t been used much as an issue in past elections.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eMore must-read stories from \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—\u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/19/joe-biden-gaffes-rally-2020/\"\u003eWill gaffes hurt Biden’s chances of a 2020 win?\u003c/a\u003e Strategists are divided\u003cbr\u003e—These are the \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/22/2020-senate-elections-arizona-texas-maine-colorado-alabama/\"\u003e2020 senate races to watch\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e—\u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/19/what-is-bds-in-relation-to-israel/\"\u003eWhat is BDS?\u003c/a\u003e Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions explained\u003cbr\u003e—When does Congress reconvene? \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/16/when-does-congress-reconvene/\"\u003eAugust recess, explained\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e—\u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/16/trump-china-trade-war-winner-data/\"\u003eTrump thinks he is winning the trade war,\u003c/a\u003e but the data tell a different story\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eGet up to speed on your morning commute with Fortune’s \u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://cloud.newsletters.fortune.com/fortune/nloptin?nl=CEO_DAILY\u0026amp;source=LinkStack\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eCEO Daily\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e newsletter.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://fortune.com/2019/08/26/main-reason-voters-choose-political-candidates/","published":"2019-08-26T15:08:34Z","guid":"https://fortune.com/?p=2688395"},{"title":"‘Succession’ Recap, S2E3: Takeover Defense","content":"\n\u003cp\u003eSuccession \u003cem\u003eis a show about family.

The best way to ward off his hostile suitors is to make himself too big to swallow, so he plots an acquisition of rival media conglomerate PGM, owned by the Pierce family. “The bigger, the better,” Logan says, noting that his would-be raiders, Sandy Furness and Stewy Hosseini, would “choke” trying to digest the supersized Waystar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe silent reservations among those in the room are almost palpable, but no one says anything—at least not to Logan’s face. Once he leaves, the second thoughts emerge; Roman notes that PGM is Uncle Ewan’s favorite news channel and Logan simply wants to piss off his estranged brother, while Gerri cites an old grudge with PGM over an old \u003cem\u003eNew York Mail \u003c/em\u003earticle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eKendall can see the sense behind the move; PGM would be “a force multiplier,” its acquisition “basically plug-and-play for us,” and Waystar would further strengthen its hold upon American media (“One sector, many brands,” Ken says). But he can see why Karl is afraid they’re “rolling the dice on a $20 billion crapshoot.” The deal would be heavily leveraged, and if the debt from the acquisition becomes unmanageable for Waystar, Kendall acknowledges that the fortunes of the company, as well as their own professional reputations, “could death spiral.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eYet the extent to which all concerned are terrified of Logan Roy—and the manner in which he wields this power to his own ends—is a central theme of this week’s episode, and none concerned are willing to voice their opposition to the deal.

Mark Dixon, IWG\u0026#8217;s CEO, is in talks with investment banks about creating a standalone business that would become a publicly traded rival to WeWork, \u003ca href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/regus-owner-iwg-targets-wework-with-plan-for-3bn-us-float-11792787\"\u003eaccording to SkyNews.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIWG\u0026#8217;s current market cap in London is £3.64 billion ($4.5 billion), and if the company pursues this plan, its US business could be worth as much as £3 billion ($3.7 billion) as a standalone franchise. IWG generated about 41% of its $3.4 billion of revenue in the Americas last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHere’s what’s interesting: IWG is larger than WeWork in terms of space. The company has ~60 million square feet (5.6 million square meters) globally, while WeWork had 45 million square feet as of March. WeWork’s largest backer SoftBank has valued the company at $47 billion, which is way more than IWG’s market cap as noted above. Plus, WeWork’s IPO may be among the year’s biggest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIWG CEO Mark Dixon said earlier this month that WeWork’s visibility has helped his company’s U.S. business. “That’s a market that’s deemed to be very competitive,” Dixon said. “It is the home of WeWork, so by WeWork and others talking more in the market, it generates more business for us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs I noted on Friday, the co-working market is out of control.

Less predictably, the corporate stakeholders whose status the CEOs elevated may also be disappointed, legal experts say, and even some of the CEOs themselves might come to regret what they’ve done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Business Roundtable’s landmark \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/longform/business-roundtable-ceos-corporations-purpose/\"\u003e“Statement on the Purpose of a Corporation”\u003c/a\u003e repudiates its\u003ca href=\"http://www.ralphgomory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Business-Roundtable-1997.pdf\"\u003e 1997 declaration\u003c/a\u003e that “the paramount duty of management and of boards of directors is to the corporation’s stockholders.” The new statement pledges commitments to five groups of stakeholders—customers, employees, suppliers, communities, shareholders—without hierarchy; shareholders are listed fifth, suggesting to some that they are in effect last among equals. Of the Roundtable’s 193 members, 181 signed the statement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWithin hours of its release, the Council of Institutional Investors \u003ca href=\"https://www.cii.org/aug19_brt_response\"\u003efired back\u003c/a\u003e on behalf of its members, which include more than 100 employee benefit plans, endowments, and foundations with some $4 trillion of assets. The Roundtable is “working to diminish shareholder rights,” the CII said. “If ‘stakeholder governance’ and ‘sustainability’ become hiding places for poor management, or for stalling needed change, the economy more generally will lose out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSimilar concerns come from Charles Elson, director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware, and also a lawyer and member of several corporate boards over the past 20 years. “The idea that you’re accountable to everyone means you’re accountable to no one,” he says. “The Roundtable statement destroys managerial accountability, perhaps on purpose.” His conclusion: The CEOs who signed the statement “have deep-sixed the working men and women of America – firefighters, teachers, police officers, and others who depend on pension funds.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral states over the past 30 years have enacted “constituency statutes,” which put into law what the Roundtable is pledging. Such laws permit or require corporate boards to consider the interests of multiple stakeholders, not just shareholders. In practice, “they’re just a cover to avoid accountability and excuse corporate malfeasance,” claims Mark Lebovitch, head of the corporate governance practice at Bernstein Litowitz Berger \u0026amp; Grossman, a law firm that has represented shareholders in actions against \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/fortune500/wells-fargo-27/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWells Fargo\u003c/a\u003e, WorldCom, HealthSouth, and other major companies. “States with constituency statutes have had some of the worst corporate malfeasance.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou might suppose that even if some shareholders don’t like the Roundtable’s new stance, at least the other, newly elevated stakeholders should be delighted. Those constituencies could be in for a surprise, however. The Roundtable CEOs may have decided not to put shareholders first, but shareholder primacy is still the law; even companies in states with constituency laws, while required to consider all stakeholders’ interests, still owe a fiduciary duty to shareholders only.\u003cstrong\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003e“I look at the statement as in line with current corporate law,” says Holly Gregory, a partner in the Sidley law firm, which was retained by the Roundtable to advise on the new statement; she provided comments to the Roundtable staff on iterations of the text. “It shouldn’t be read as suggesting or necessitating a change in the board’s or management’s fiduciary duty, nor changing the legal landscape,” she says. That means directors and managers must still place shareholders’ interests above others, even their own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe fiduciary-duty mandate seems tough to square with what the Roundtable has committed to, at least in spirit, and it’s almost inevitable that we’ll soon see the conflict play out. When one of those 181 signatory companies stumbles, some shareholders will sue and cite the statement as evidence that the company wasn’t serving its owners as required by law. That may not count for much in court. “I’m hard pressed to think of the legal claim where the fact of this statement would be dispositive or even influential,” says Gregory, and Lebovitch, who sues companies for a living, agrees: “I don’t\nthink the statement itself will get the CEOs who signed it sued.” But it would definitely look awkward in the media. “Certainly a plaintiff is going to use it,” says Elson. “And it’s going to be embarrassing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe CEOs who signed the statement are among the world’s most adept managers. They now must navigate an extraordinarily narrow path: On one side are stakeholders to whom they’ve given equal status with shareholders; on the other, courts enforcing shareholder primacy. It will demand every bit of skill they’ve got.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eMore must-read stories from \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—\u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/change-the-world/2019\"\u003eChange the World 2019\u003c/a\u003e: See which companies made the list\u003cbr\u003e—\u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/17/ge-madoff-accountant-next-enron-standoff/\"\u003eCorporate America’s most fascinating standoff\u003c/a\u003e: The accountant who exposed Madoff vs. GE\u003cbr\u003e—America’s CEOs seek \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/longform/business-roundtable-ceos-corporations-purpose/\"\u003ea new purpose for the corporation\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e—How the \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/07/22/global-500-industry-dominance/\"\u003eworld’s biggest companies\u003c/a\u003e stay ahead\u003cbr\u003e—What \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/longform/sturgis-motorcycle-rally-food-drink/\"\u003ethe world’s biggest motorcycle rally\u003c/a\u003e reveals about the state of festival food\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eSubscribe to Fortune’s \u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://cloud.newsletters.fortune.com/fortune/nloptin?nl=CEO_DAILY\u0026amp;source=LinkStack\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eCEO Daily newsletter\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e for the latest business news and analysis.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://fortune.com/2019/08/26/business-roundtable-shareholders-rights-law/","published":"2019-08-26T13:33:36Z","guid":"https://fortune.com/?p=2688243"},{"title":"How Tech Business Interests and Politics Could Clash in India—Data Sheet","content":"\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis is the web version of Data Sheet, Fortune’s daily newsletter on the top tech news.

They were in the business of making music, not necessarily making videos. The times have changed to where all artists have the pressure to stand out and be unique. During these early years of the videos we did, Missy and Busta were some of the only ones really courageous enough to stand out. Most artists wanted to stay conservative in a sense, stay within the box of their genre and what is expected of them. It was a young medium at the time and Missy just cherished it as an art form. Whereas now, most videos really reflect the personality of the artist, and the artists are more self-possessed. I attribute that to social media.

Decades ago, iconic series like \u003cem\u003eLeave It to Beaver\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eDiff’rent Strokes\u003c/em\u003e switched homes during their runs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut in recent years, the pace has noticeably accelerated because of the proliferation of cable networks and new streaming services hungry for content. Once viewed by Hollywood as “damaged goods,” canceled shows are now considered to be opportunities. After all, developing a series from scratch costs millions of dollars. Furthermore, many canceled shows have existing fans who will inevitably gush about the revivals on Facebook and Twitter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s so hard to get attention to break through in this peak-TV climate that you can be a little ahead of the game by having something people already know and love,” says Brad Schwartz, president of Pop TV, the niche CBS-owned network that recently picked up sitcom \u003cem\u003eOne Day at a Time\u003c/em\u003e from Netflix.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn March, Netflix pulled the plug on \u003cem\u003eOne Day at a Time\u003c/em\u003e, a reboot of Norman Lear’s hit show from the late 1970s and early ’80s about a single mother and her kids. Three months later, Pop TV announced that it would give the show a second life (or third, if you count the original).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“We thought it was a perfect fit,” Schwartz says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHis channel plans to go all out in marketing its newly adopted series to get as big an audience as possible for its comeback next year. But Schwartz also points out the huge gap between what Pop TV considers success and what streaming giant Netflix does.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“If 5 million people watch \u003cem\u003eOne Day at a Time\u003c/em\u003e, that might not be a huge hit for them, but it would be great for us,” says Schwartz. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNetflix, which did not respond to \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e’s requests for comment, has never publicly discussed viewership numbers for \u003cem\u003eOne Day at a Time\u003c/em\u003e, which ran for three seasons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"wp-block-image\"\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/TEL-Sidebar-Opt2.jpg?w=295\" alt=\"TEL09.19-Sidebar\" class=\"wp-image-2682389\" width=\"650\" srcset=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/TEL-Sidebar-Opt2.jpg 2880w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/TEL-Sidebar-Opt2.jpg?resize=43,150 43w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/TEL-Sidebar-Opt2.jpg?resize=86,300 86w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/TEL-Sidebar-Opt2.jpg?resize=768,2667 768w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/TEL-Sidebar-Opt2.jpg?resize=295,1024 295w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/TEL-Sidebar-Opt2.jpg?resize=61,212 61w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/TEL-Sidebar-Opt2.jpg?resize=145,503 145w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/TEL-Sidebar-Opt2.jpg?resize=29,100 29w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/TEL-Sidebar-Opt2.jpg?resize=17,60 17w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/TEL-Sidebar-Opt2.jpg?resize=44,154 44w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/TEL-Sidebar-Opt2.jpg?resize=311,1080 311w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/TEL-Sidebar-Opt2.jpg?resize=169,588 169w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/TEL-Sidebar-Opt2.jpg?resize=48,168 48w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/TEL-Sidebar-Opt2.jpg?resize=134,465 134w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/TEL-Sidebar-Opt2.jpg?resize=45,156 45w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/TEL-Sidebar-Opt2.jpg?resize=96,333 96w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/TEL-Sidebar-Opt2.jpg?resize=111,385 111w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/TEL-Sidebar-Opt2.jpg?resize=230,800 230w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/TEL-Sidebar-Opt2.jpg?resize=35,123 35w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/TEL-Sidebar-Opt2.jpg?resize=115,399 115w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/TEL-Sidebar-Opt2.jpg?resize=142,492 142w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/TEL-Sidebar-Opt2.jpg?resize=149,518 149w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2880px) 100vw, 2880px\" /\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"image-credit\"\u003eCourtesy of Netflix; Fox/Everret Collection; Fox via Getty Images\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn general, says Dan Rayburn, an analyst at Frost \u0026amp; Sullivan, the multiplying number of streaming services with deep pockets is at least partially responsible for the rise in show swapping. In addition to big players like Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu, newcomers include the upcoming \u003ca href=\"/fortune500/apple-3/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eApple\u003c/a\u003e TV+ and Disney+, as well as NBCUniversal’s streaming service and WarnerMedia’s HBO Max.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eRayburn says a show like \u003cem\u003eThe Orville\u003c/em\u003e, a sci‑fi dramedy that will move to Hulu from Fox in late 2020, could thrive at its new home. The series wasn’t canceled. Instead, its creator, Seth MacFarlane, has explained the move by saying it was difficult to deliver the show to the network in time for its mid-season slot. Rayburn says shifting to streaming can make sense for some shows because the medium “lends itself to flexibility, creativity, and a different way of marketing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, just because a series is rescued doesn’t mean its survival is guaranteed. For example, in July, Netflix killed political thriller \u003cem\u003eDesignated Survivor\u003c/em\u003e, which it had adopted from ABC, after just one season.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eA relatively new wrinkle in the show-swap phenomenon is the series that switches from broadcast to streaming but stays in the corporate family. That happened in July, when NBCUniversal’s planned streaming service picked up NBC’s recently canceled high school comedy \u003cem\u003eA.P. Bio\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eRob Kenneally, an agent at talent firm Creative Artists Agency, expects show swapping to continue evolving as Hollywood adapts to the threat and opportunity of streaming. What is clear is that second chances, once relatively rare in TV, are now routine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSays Kenneally, it’s “a great era” for creators.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis article appears in the September 2019 issue of Fortune.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eMore must-read stories from \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—What we know so far about the \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/20/whistleblower-allegations-disney/\"\u003ewhistleblower allegations at Disney\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e—\u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/19/disney-streaming-service/\"\u003eDisney’s new streaming service\u003c/a\u003e won’t be available on most popular streaming devices\u003cbr\u003e—Can Apple afford to make its \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/20/apple-tv-plus-disney-plus-price-free-trial/\"\u003estreaming video service\u003c/a\u003e free?\u003cbr\u003e—\u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/19/good-boys-universal-comedy-box-office/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eGood Boys\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e: Why the comedy’s first-place finish has Hollywood cheering\u003cbr\u003e—Has \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/15/disney-family-films-summer-2019/\"\u003eDisney cornered the family film market\u003c/a\u003e as rivals hit summer slumps?\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://flipboard.com/@fortune\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eFollow Fortune on Flipboard\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e to stay up-to-date on the latest news and analysis.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://fortune.com/2019/08/26/tv-shows-switch-network-channel-streaming-service/","published":"2019-08-26T10:30:53Z","guid":"https://fortune.com/?p=2688134"},{"title":"A Stagflationary Shock: CEO Daily","content":"\u003cp\u003eGood morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarkets are on a trade-driven roller coaster ride.

It can also impact a hotel’s bottom line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Smell is the most powerful of the senses,” said Janice Nath, an ambiance expert at Ambius, a global provider of scenting solutions for commercial spaces. “When introduced to a scent, guests tap into powerful memories and emotions. Hotels have a unique opportunity to achieve multisensory relationships with guests through the scents that are attributed to their brand. Guests strive to connect with brands; therefore, with the addition of scenting, brands are given a powerful opportunity to create long-lasting and more profitable relationships.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to findings in a report commissioned by Ambius titled “2019 Business Impact of Scenting,” customers are demanding a more pleasant scent as part of the overall brand experience. In the study, Ambius found that 91% of hotel guests said a pleasant smell had a positive impact, and 67% of people said a pleasant smell in a hotel would make them feel more relaxed and patient. By designing the right scent experience, Nath explained, hotels can create a deeper connection with guests, ultimately driving loyalty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A great opportunity occurs the moment the guest walks through the doors,” she said. “In our report, we discovered that this pleasant association can encourage repeat visits, strengthen the brand affiliation, drive loyalty, create an immersive guest experience and encourage more positive reviews. Scent is a part of design. When decor is selected, a feeling, an emotion is being created. Scent can deepen that emotion and enhance the decor in the room. For instance, if you add soft colors, like rose gold into a space with a soft floral scent, that will feel different from a room with blues and greens with a salty ocean scent.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoteliers are employing scent in a variety of effective ways. Through research, Nath found that there are three key drivers for scenting in hotel design: elevating the ambiance for a more immersive guest experience; to enhance the branding strategy; and as a location-specific fragrance to evoke a particular atmosphere for a space drawing guests throughout the hotel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Branding and guest experience are key factors in driving repeat clientele for hoteliers,\u0026#8221; she said. \u0026#8220;It is crucial guest experience is engaged from the moment the guest arrives on property.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hotel brand-specific scent can serve the guest in different ways. \u003ca href=\"https://www.hotelbusiness.com/through-scent-andaz-connects-guests-to-locale/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eAndaz uses scent to connect guests to the locale\u003c/a\u003e, while hotels using a diffuser in guestrooms can help travelers to \u003ca href=\"https://www.hotelbusiness.com/inhale-exhale-hotel-scents-make-a-difference/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ereduce the feeling of pain, sleep, stress and nausea.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The power of scent memory brings a lot of potential in influencing the mood and memories a guest will associate with your hotel. Through the awareness of scent memory, hotels can strategically create brand-associated memories and associations for their guests,” she said. “By using a bespoke scent throughout the hotel, guests come to associate the smell with that specific brand and their stay. This means that whenever they encounter the hotel and scent again, it will revive happy memories of their prior stay. This is what is referred to as the ‘welcome home’ effect.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNath explained that a signature scent can establish a strong brand association and unity across various locations in a chain. “When a guest visits a hotel in another city or country, the recognizable scent will remind them of previous visits—thus, providing a sense of comfort as well as linking the two places in the guest\u0026#8217;s memory,” she said. “In our study, it was reported that 48% of people say that a pleasant smell in a hotel would make them more likely to return in the future.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScent is personal, but some guests can also be allergic to heavily fragranced areas. At Ambius, the team’s consultative approach enables them to find the right bespoke scent solution specific to the business and location.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fragrance components are regulated by many different legislations globally. Our Premium Scenting range complies with our internal safety standards, general product safety, REACH, CLP/ GHS, Workplace Health and Safety and International Fragrance Association (IFRA) standards to ensure the safety of our products,” she said. “Concentrated fragrance in liquid form can be an irritant to eyes and skin. When used in products, there should be no exposure to the concentrated fragrance itself, therefore reducing the likelihood of any hazards. In our Premium Scenting units, concentrated exposure does not occur, reducing the risk further. Premium Scenting fragrances do not contain any known respiratory sensitizers as required by the IFRA Code of Practice, as they are prohibited.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen discussing the scent experience with hoteliers, Nath asks two questions: “How do you want your guests to feel?” and “What do you want them to remember?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This will typically tie into their property, their mission and everything from how the lobby feels and smells  at check-in to how the shampoo smells in their rooms,” she said. “As we partner with designers on new hotel projects, especially boutique hotels, it is wonderful to see them embrace scent just as critical as a color to be included in their palette. In line with hotels looking to deliver the ultimate experience, you will see hoteliers connecting scent as an essential part of their guest and brand experience.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe post \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.hotelbusiness.com/how-scenting-impacts-a-hotels-business/\"\u003eHow Scenting Impacts a Hotel’s Business\u003c/a\u003e appeared first on \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.hotelbusiness.com\"\u003eHotel Business\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://www.hotelbusiness.com/how-scenting-impacts-a-hotels-business/","published":"2019-08-26T13:03:47Z","guid":"https://www.hotelbusiness.com/?p=187081"},{"title":"With This App, Temporary Hotel Staffing Is at Your Fingertips","content":"\u003cp\u003eNATIONAL REPORT—Dealing with low staffing issues can be a real headache, and finding a skilled temp to fill a last-minute no-show for a shift is an even bigger challenge for hospitality venues.

From this perspective, our economy is now in a favorable place, and I will describe how we are working to sustain these conditions in the face of significant risks we have been monitoring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe current U.S. expansion has entered its 11th year and is now the longest on record.\u003ca title=\"footnote 1\" href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190823a.htm#fn1\"\u003e\u003csup\u003e1\u003c/sup\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca name=\"f1\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e The unemployment rate has fallen steadily throughout the expansion and has been near half-century lows since early 2018. But that rate alone does not fully capture the benefits of this historically strong job market. Labor force participation by people in their prime working years has been rising. While unemployment for minorities generally remains higher than for the workforce as a whole, the rate for African Americans, at 6 percent, is the lowest since the government began tracking it in 1972. For the past few years, wages have been increasing the most for people at the lower end of the wage scale. People who live and work in low- and middle-income communities tell us that this job market is the best anyone can recall. We increasingly hear reports that employers are training workers who lack required skills, adapting jobs to the needs of employees with family responsibilities, and offering second chances to people who need one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInflation has been surprisingly stable during the expansion: not falling much when the economy was weak and not rising much as the expansion gained strength. Inflation ran close to our symmetric 2 percent objective for most of last year but has been running somewhat below 2 percent this year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThus, after a decade of progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the economy is close to both goals. Our challenge now is to do what monetary policy can do to sustain the expansion so that the benefits of the strong jobs market extend to more of those still left behind, and so that inflation is centered firmly around 2 percent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday I will explore what history tells us about sustaining long, steady expansions. A good place to start is with the passage of the Employment Act of 1946, which stated that it is the \u0026#8220;continuing policy and responsibility of the Federal Government \u0026#8230; to promote maximum employment, production, and purchasing power.\u0026#8221;\u003ca title=\"footnote 2\" href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190823a.htm#fn2\"\u003e\u003csup\u003e2\u003c/sup\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca name=\"f2\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e Some version of these goals has been in place ever since. I will divide the history since World War II into three eras organized around some well-known \u0026#8220;Greats.\u0026#8221; The first era comprises the postwar years through the Great Inflation. The second era brought the Great Moderation but ended in the Great Recession. The third era is still under way, and time will tell what \u0026#8220;Greats\u0026#8221; may emerge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach era presents a key question for the Fed and for society more generally. The first era raises the question whether a central bank can resist the temptations that led to the Great Inflation. The second era raises the question whether long expansions supported by better monetary policy inevitably lead to destabilizing financial excesses like those seen in the Great Moderation. The third era confronts us with the question of how best to promote sustained prosperity in a world of slow global growth, low inflation, and low interest rates. Near the end of my remarks, I will discuss the current context, and the ways these questions are shaping policy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEra I, 1950–1982: Policy Breeds Macroeconomic Instability and the Great Inflation\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\nThe late 1940s were a period of adjustment to a peacetime economy. As the 1940s turned to the 1950s, the state of knowledge about how best to promote macroeconomic stability was limited. The 1950s and early 1960s saw the economy oscillating sharply between recession and growth above 6 percent (\u003ca id=\"fig1\" href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/powell-figure1-20190823.png\" data-caption=\"\" data-content=\"\" data-flickr=\"false\" data-gallery=\"global-figures\" data-title=\"\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\"\u003efigure 1, panel A\u003c/a\u003e). Three expansions and contractions came in quick succession. With the benefit of hindsight, the lack of stability is generally attributed to \u0026#8220;stop and go\u0026#8221; stabilization policy, as monetary and fiscal authorities grappled with how best to modulate the use of their blunt but powerful tools.\u003ca title=\"footnote 3\" href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190823a.htm#fn3\"\u003e\u003csup\u003e3\u003c/sup\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca name=\"f3\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeginning in the mid-1960s, \u0026#8220;stop and go\u0026#8221; policy gave way to \u0026#8220;too much go and not enough stop\u0026#8221;—not enough, that is, to quell rising inflation pressures.

The Fed was cutting, not raising, rates in the months prior to the end of the first two expansions in this era, and the ensuing recessions were mild by historical standards. And twice during the long expansion of the 1990s, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) eased policy in response to threats to growth. In 1995, responding to evidence of slowing in the United States and abroad, the FOMC reduced the federal funds rate over a few months. In 1998, the Russian debt default and the related collapse of the hedge fund Long‑Term Capital Management rocked financial markets that were already fragile from the Asian financial crisis. Given the risks posed to the U.S. economy, the FOMC again lowered the federal funds rate over a period of months until events quieted. The 10-year expansion weathered both events with no discernible inflation cost.\u003ca title=\"footnote 7\" href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190823a.htm#fn7\"\u003e\u003csup\u003e7\u003c/sup\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca name=\"f7\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the turn of the century, it was beginning to look like financial excesses and global events would pose the main threats to stability in this new era rather than overheating and rising inflation.

Before turning to issues occupying center stage at present, I want to address a long-running issue that I discussed here last year: tracking the \u0026#8220;stars\u0026#8221; that serve as guideposts for monetary policy.\u003ca title=\"footnote 10\" href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190823a.htm#fn10\"\u003e\u003csup\u003e10\u003c/sup\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca name=\"f10\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e These include u*, the natural rate of unemployment, and r*, the neutral real rate of interest.

The first era raised the question of whether the Fed can avoid excessive inflation. Inflation has averaged less than 2 percent over the past 25 years, and low inflation has been the main concern for the past decade. Low inflation seems to be the problem of this era, not high inflation. Nonetheless, in the unlikely event that signs of too-high inflation return, we have proven tools to address such a situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second era\u0026#8217;s question—whether long expansions inevitably breed financial excesses—is a challenging and timely one. Hyman Minsky long argued that, as an expansion continues and memories of the previous downturn fade, financial risk management deteriorates and risks are increasingly underappreciated.\u003ca title=\"footnote 13\" href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190823a.htm#fn13\"\u003e\u003csup\u003e13\u003c/sup\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca name=\"f13\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e This observation has spurred much discussion. At the end of the day, we cannot prevent people from finding ways to take excessive financial risks. But we can work to make sure that they bear the costs of their decisions, and that the financial system as a whole continues to function effectively. Since the crisis, Congress, the Fed, and other regulatory authorities here and around the world have taken substantial steps to achieve these goals. Banks and other key institutions have significantly more capital and more stable funding than before the crisis. We comprehensively review financial stability every quarter and release our assessments twice a year to highlight areas of concern and allow oversight of our efforts. We have not seen unsustainable borrowing, financial booms, or other excesses of the sort that occurred at times during the Great Moderation, and I continue to judge overall financial stability risks to be moderate. But we remain vigilant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat leaves the third question of how, in this low r* world, the Fed can best support the economy. A low neutral interest rate presents both near-term and longer-term challenges. I will begin with the current context. Because today\u0026#8217;s setting is both challenging and unique in many ways, it may be useful to lay out some general principles for assessing and implementing appropriate policy and to describe how we have been applying those principles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough the FOMC\u0026#8217;s setting of the federal funds rate target range and our communications about the likely path forward for policy and the economy, we seek to influence broader financial conditions to promote maximum employment and price stability. In forming judgments about the appropriate stance of policy, the Committee digests a broad range of data and other information to assess the current state of the economy, the most likely outlook for the future, and meaningful risks to that outlook. Because the most important effects of monetary policy are felt with uncertain lags of a year or more, the Committee must attempt to look through what may be passing developments and focus on things that seem likely to affect the outlook over time or that pose a material risk of doing so. Risk management enters our decisionmaking because of both the uncertainty about the effects of recent developments and the uncertainty we face regarding structural aspects of the economy, including the natural rate of unemployment and the neutral rate of interest. It will at times be appropriate for us to tilt policy one way or the other because of prominent risks. Finally, we have a responsibility to explain what we are doing and why we are doing it so the American people and their elected representatives in Congress can provide oversight and hold us accountable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe have much experience in addressing typical macroeconomic developments under this framework. But fitting trade policy uncertainty into this framework is a new challenge. Setting trade policy is the business of Congress and the Administration, not that of the Fed. Our assignment is to use monetary policy to foster our statutory goals. In principle, anything that affects the outlook for employment and inflation could also affect the appropriate stance of monetary policy, and that could include uncertainty about trade policy. There are, however, no recent precedents to guide any policy response to the current situation. Moreover, while monetary policy is a powerful tool that works to support consumer spending, business investment, and public confidence, it cannot provide a settled rulebook for international trade. We can, however, try to look through what may be passing events, focus on how trade developments are affecting the outlook, and adjust policy to promote our objectives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis approach is illustrated by the way incoming data have shaped the likely path of policy this year. The outlook for the U.S. economy since the start of the year has continued to be a favorable one. Business investment and manufacturing have weakened, but solid job growth and rising wages have been driving robust consumption and supporting moderate growth overall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the year has progressed, we have been monitoring three factors that are weighing on this favorable outlook: slowing global growth, trade policy uncertainty, and muted inflation. The global growth outlook has been deteriorating since the middle of last year. Trade policy uncertainty seems to be playing a role in the global slowdown and in weak manufacturing and capital spending in the United States. Inflation fell below our objective at the start of the year. It appears to be moving back up closer to our symmetric 2 percent objective, but there are concerns about a more prolonged shortfall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCommittee participants have generally reacted to these developments and the risks they pose by shifting down their projections of the appropriate federal funds rate path. Along with July\u0026#8217;s rate cut, the shifts in the anticipated path of policy have eased financial conditions and help explain why the outlook for inflation and employment remains largely favorable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning to the current context, we are carefully watching developments as we assess their implications for the U.S. outlook and the path of monetary policy. The three weeks since our July FOMC meeting have been eventful, beginning with the announcement of new tariffs on imports from China. We have seen further evidence of a global slowdown, notably in Germany and China. Geopolitical events have been much in the news, including the growing possibility of a hard Brexit, rising tensions in Hong Kong, and the dissolution of the Italian government. Financial markets have reacted strongly to this complex, turbulent picture. Equity markets have been volatile. Long-term bond rates around the world have moved down sharply to near post-crisis lows. Meanwhile, the U.S. economy has continued to perform well overall, driven by consumer spending. Job creation has slowed from last year\u0026#8217;s pace but is still above overall labor force growth. Inflation seems to be moving up closer to 2 percent. Based on our assessment of the implications of these developments, we will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor market and inflation near its symmetric 2 percent objective.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Three Questions in the Longer Run\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\nLooking back over the three eras, monetary policy has evolved to address new challenges as they have arisen. The inflation targeting regime that emerged after the Great Inflation has led to vastly improved outcomes for employment and price stability around the world. One result has been much longer expansions, which often brought with them the buildup of financial risk. This new pattern has led us to understand that assuring financial stability over time requires much greater resilience in our financial system, particularly for our largest, most complex banks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs we look back over the decade since the end of the financial crisis, we can again see fundamental economic changes that call for a reassessment of our policy framework. The current era has been characterized by much lower neutral interest rates, disinflationary pressures, and slower growth. We face heightened risks of lengthy, difficult-to-escape periods in which our policy interest rate is pinned near zero. To address this new normal, we are conducting a public review of our monetary policy strategy, tools, and communications—the first of its kind for the Federal Reserve. We are evaluating the pros and cons of strategies that aim to reverse past misses of our inflation objective. We are examining the monetary policy tools we have used both in calm times and in crisis, and we are asking whether we should expand our toolkit. In addition, we are looking at how we might improve the communication of our policy framework.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePublic engagement, unprecedented in scope for the Fed, is at the heart of this effort.

As discussed by Faust (1996), the structure of FOMC governance was motivated by the traditional view that governments are tempted to resort to inflation in times of stress. With the post–World War II emphasis on full employment and understanding the role of inflation expectations, this tendency was reformulated as seeking near-term gains on employment at the cost of long-term inflation (Kydland and Prescott, 1977; Barro and Gordon, 1983).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca name=\"fn5\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e5. Overall inflation, which is the subject of our symmetric 2 percent objective, has been somewhat more volatile, but it is neither practical nor wise to try to smooth purely transitory inflation fluctuations. As such transitory fluctuations are frequently driven by volatile food and energy prices, I am citing the stability of core inflation on a four-quarter basis as a proxy for Fed performance in achieving the relevant sense of stability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca name=\"fn6\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e6. Analysts debate the role that monetary policy and other factors, such as luck and structural change in the economy, played in bringing about the Great Moderation. For example, Ahmed, Levin, and Wilson (2004) find an important role for luck. Stock and Watson (2003) attribute much of the change to an unexplained improvement in the tradeoff between inflation and output variability. Like Bernanke (2004), I believe that better policy was an important factor behind the better outcomes, perhaps allowing other factors to show through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca name=\"fn7\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e7.

The news came as a shock. Luck had \u003ca href=\"https://www.sbnation.com/2017/10/16/16469416/andrew-luck-shoulder-injury-history-timeline-colts-return\"\u003ea history of injuries\u003c/a\u003e: Most recently, he missed the 2017 campaign following complications from shoulder surgery and, after returning last year, had been \u003ca href=\"http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000001041194/article/colts-gm-andrew-lucks-calf-injury-is-highankle-issue\"\u003eheld out of this year’s preseason\u003c/a\u003e due to calf and ankle issues. But he was just 29 years old in a league where top quarterbacks can now aim to play into their 40s. When healthy, he was o\u003ca href=\"https://www.theringer.com/nfl/2019/8/25/20832159/andrew-luck-retirement-indianapolis-colts-generational-qb-talent\"\u003ene of the NFL’s most valuable players\u003c/a\u003e, and last season was one of his best; he threw for 39 touchdowns and a career-high 4,593 yards for a Colts team that reached the playoffs and seemed \u003ca href=\"http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000001034929/article/state-of-the-franchise-colts-viable-contenders-for-super-bowl\"\u003epoised to reestablish itself\u003c/a\u003e as a title contender. He was a true franchise quarterback, perhaps the most envied status in American pro sports.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe news of his retirement broke during the Colts’ game against the Chicago Bears, and, after walking off the sideline to \u003ca href=\"https://ftw.usatoday.com/2019/08/colts-andrew-luck-booed-by-fans-after-retirement-news-breaks\"\u003ea chorus of boos\u003c/a\u003e, Luck \u003ca href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/27456682/luck-retires-calls-decision-hardest-my-life\"\u003eheld a press conference\u003c/a\u003e explaining his decision. “I haven’t been able to live the life I want to live,” he said, referring both to the pain of his injuries and the degree of dedication required to recover from them. “It’s taken the joy out of this game.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe past half-decade has seen a number of NFL players quit the sport earlier than expected due to concerns over long-term health. In March, at the age of 29, the Patriots tight end \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/01/super-bowl-patriots-rob-gronkowski-cost-of-greatness/581650/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRob Gronkowski\u003c/a\u003e joined the \u003ca href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/dbrickashaw-ferguson-nfl-early-retirement-no-surprise_n_5707c4d5e4b0c4e26a2273fa\"\u003elengthening list\u003c/a\u003e. But if Luck’s decision is one data point in a developing pattern, it’s a particularly harrowing one. Throughout his career, Luck had a poster-boy aspect: smart and tough, skilled enough to unlock a defense and courageous enough to battle back from the damage it would inflict on him. He had been the NFL’s \u003ca href=\"http://www.nfl.com/draft/story/09000d5d8289eb9b/article/andrew-luck-selected-by-indianapolis-colts-no-1-overall-in-draft\"\u003eNo. 1 overall pick\u003c/a\u003e, then its \u003ca href=\"https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2014/leaders.htm\"\u003eleader in passing touchdowns\u003c/a\u003e, then its \u003ca href=\"https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2814637-andrew-luck-wins-2018-nfl-comeback-player-of-the-year-award-after-injury\"\u003ecomeback player of the year\u003c/a\u003e, a kind of unofficial ambassador figuring heavily in pregame shows and TV promos. Now he is the latest and most startling example of the toll the sport exacts—and of the willingness of some players to walk away from it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn the field, Luck lacked nothing but health. He had a talent for understanding the weak points in opposing defenses, a knack he credited in part to his \u003ca href=\"https://engineering.stanford.edu/news/andrew-luck-architectural-design-class-2012\"\u003earchitecture studies\u003c/a\u003e at Stanford. He was an accurate passer, a bold and burly runner, and a well-respected leader, and he loved the game enough to \u003ca href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/andrew-luck-the-nfls-most-perplexing-trash-talker-1418663249\"\u003ecompliment opponents\u003c/a\u003e on their hits against him. After inheriting the Colts’ starting job from Peyton Manning—as daunting a task as a quarterback is likely to find—he set about making his own mark on the franchise. His 4,374 passing yards in his first season remain an NFL rookie record, and Indianapolis won 53 of the 86 games he started in six seasons, reaching the playoffs four times. Luck’s defining moment came in January 2014, when he \u003ca href=\"https://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2014/1/4/5274800/colts-chiefs-2014-nfl-playoffs-afc-wild-card-results\"\u003eled the Colts back from a 28-point deficit\u003c/a\u003e against the Kansas City Chiefs, the second-largest postseason comeback ever. One late touchdown came when he recovered a fumble and dove headfirst into the end zone, another when he found the receiver T. Y. Hilton with a 64-yard strike.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOwing to a combination of his physical style of play and plain misfortune, though, Luck was beset by injury. His \u003ca href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/andrew-luck-retires-lets-take-a-look-at-the-colts-quarterbacks-injury-history-in-wake-of-shocking-decision/\"\u003eailments\u003c/a\u003e included a lacerated kidney, torn rib cartilage, and a concussion. “After 2016, where I played in pain and was unable to regularly practice [because of a shoulder injury], I made a vow to myself that I would not go down that path again,” Luck said this weekend. The leg injury that hampered him this summer—which was reported, at various times, to center on his calf, ankle, or, in the \u003ca href=\"https://deadspin.com/andrew-lucks-small-little-bone-injury-is-apparently-o-1837222894\"\u003ewords\u003c/a\u003e of the Colts owner Jim Irsay, a “small little bone”—suggested a similarly murky road to recovery.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLuck’s retirement demonstrates to the extent to which football and bodily harm remain inseparable, even as the NFL espouses its commitment to player safety. The quarterback is often the safest player on the field, with \u003ca href=\"https://www.si.com/nfl/2018/09/12/nfl-body-weight-rule-roughing-passer-penalty-myles-garrett\"\u003eamended league rules\u003c/a\u003e protecting him from hits receivers or linemen incur throughout the game, but no amount of helmet technology or rulebook tinkering can change the basic fact of one world-class athlete bringing another swiftly to the ground. Saturday night, Luck seemed to face what players have to try to forget in order to do their jobs: that pain is not incidental but central to the game. “The only way forward for me,” he said, “is to remove myself from football.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe jeering from some Indianapolis fans as Luck left the field Saturday night was soon echoed by \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/dandakich/status/1165454716739956736\"\u003epredictably\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/GottliebShow/status/1165442952832811008?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1165465965959819264\u0026amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fftw.usatoday.com%2F2019%2F08%2Ftorrey-smith-doug-gottlieb-andrew-luck\"\u003emacho\u003c/a\u003e perspectives from sports commentators, but Luck’s fellow players voiced their support of his decision. “I think it takes an immense amount of courage, an immense amount of self-reflection and a lot of guts to do what he’s doing,” the Houston Texans defensive lineman J.

The son of a former quarterback and football executive, he grew up in the game, and on the field and sideline he could be as \u003ca href=\"https://images.app.goo.gl/TYiAr7XLiYeKS4zB9\"\u003egiddily enthusiastic\u003c/a\u003e as any diehard.

The advent of social-media platforms such as Facebook in the mid-2000s, some residence-life administrators told me, fueled that impulse. Many new students join groups online to connect with one another before freshman year, and they submit roommate requests based on the information they glean there. But in recent years, many colleges have started to restrict—if not altogether remove—incoming freshmen’s say in the roommate-matching process. Schools want to maintain careful control over that process so that they can fulfill higher education’s democratic mission at the micro-level of the dorm room.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMost residential colleges in the United States have some sort of official process for roommate matching in place. In the Association of College and University Housing Officers–International’s 2018–19 survey, 56 percent of respondents said their institution has incoming freshmen fill out a questionnaire to determine dorm assignments. Another 34 percent said their school asks new students to create a profile on the college’s virtual roommate-matching platform, some of which let students match themselves, some of which don’t. And while the most common criteria schools used to pair students were personal habits (such as cleanliness and smoking status), slightly more than half of the survey’s respondents reported considering characteristics such as academic interests and hobbies. Some colleges are so meticulous, they have incoming students take personality tests. North Carolina’s Davidson College, for instance, has for decades incorporated into its freshman-roommate assignments each student’s personality traits as determined by the Myers-Briggs test—especially where the individual falls on the extroversion-introversion scale.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMany schools, including Davidson, give students the option to request a specific roommate in advance, and consider those requests on a case-by-case basis. But some schools have recently stopped allowing student input on the process. For example, in 2013, NYU \u003ca href=\"http://www.nxtbook.com/nxtbooks/acuho/talkingstick_20160102/index.php#/42\"\u003estopped\u003c/a\u003e allowing first-year students \u003ca href=\"https://www.collegemagazine.com/thank-you-nyu-random-roommate/\"\u003eto choose\u003c/a\u003e their roommates in order \u003ca href=\"https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20130205/greenwich-village/nyu-wont-let-incoming-freshmen-pick-their-own-roommates-anymore/\"\u003eto mix people\u003c/a\u003e from different parts of the country and the world.

But the common practice of students sorting themselves on social media is regarded skeptically by some student-affairs administrators. “There is a limitation to [what you can learn by] looking at Facebook, looking at profiles, looking at posts,” says Carlos Gonzalez, who oversees residential services at Northwestern University.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd the roommates students want might not always be the best roommates for them, in schools’ eyes. As the Dartmouth College economist Bruce Sacerdote, who’s studied the effects of random roommate assignments, \u003ca href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-to-expect-when-a-college-assigns-students-to-random-roommates-92802\"\u003ewrote\u003c/a\u003e last year in an analysis for \u003cem\u003eThe Conversation\u003c/em\u003e, “Natural instincts do not always benefit us in the long run.” “As human beings we naturally gravitate towards our comfort zone and find peers who look a lot like ourselves,” he went on. But as campus administrators have long argued, people (ought to) attend college not only to get a degree, but also to transcend their comfort zone—by engaging with people, disciplines, and ideas that diverge from what they are used to.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“I absolutely do not think we would have found each other [if we’d been allowed to choose],” Rachel Harshaw says of her college roommates. Harshaw graduated from New York’s Hamilton College in 2017. Incoming Hamilton freshmen fill out a detailed questionnaire, and a team in the college’s residence-life office pairs each student with one or more living buddies. This system assigned Harshaw to a suite of six freshmen total, none of whom appealed to her when she did her pre-matriculation internet sleuthing. One of them was a softball player who looked like she would be the outgoing, Greek-life, jock type; another was a blond theater lover who appeared to be a serial dater.

She currently lives with two of them in Boston. “I was so upset that they were being handed to me, and I was so nervous about it,” Harshaw said. “But at the end of the day, if I hadn’t taken those friendship risks, it’s kind of scary to think about where I’d be.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRoommate assignments are a high-stakes endeavor, given how important that relationship can end up being. The bond can be so tight, \u003ca href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/11pEP0x_EXMWdXS8izioJYegENr1egf57/view\"\u003eone study found\u003c/a\u003e, that the two students—if they’re friendly—tend to adopt each other’s speech patterns. Even roommates who aren’t super close can have a profound influence on each other, if only because of how much time they spend together: While only 37 percent of the student participants in \u003ca href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047272706000259\"\u003ea 2006 study\u003c/a\u003e identified their roommate as their “best friend,” close to half of the respondents said they spent more time with their roommate than with any other friend.

Schools have an interest in ensuring that students thrive, and whom a freshman lives with can have an immense impact on her long-term success in college and beyond. As Sacerdote alluded to, a peer who on paper may seem appealing to a roommate-seeking freshman may not end up being the best match for that freshman—or may be so similar that living with her undermines the freshman’s ability to experience new things in college. “The purpose of living on campus is to be exposed to more diversity in all arenas of life,” Northwestern’s Gonzalez says, “whether it’s ethnicity or culture or socioeconomic status or where we’ve grown up.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s hard to suss out how students’ satisfaction with college-assigned roommates stacks up against their satisfaction with self-selected ones, because apples-to-apples data don’t exist. But statistics from individual schools that are more hands-on with roommate matching indicate, at the very least, that most students are satisfied with their roommates, even when they don’t get to pick. Students at Northwestern and Davidson, for example, generally seem to buy into their college’s roommate-matching strategy, with an estimated one in 10 incoming freshmen at each school opting to request a dorm buddy. At Davidson, the majority of students go on to live with their freshmen roommates as upperclassmen, according to Jason Shaffer, the college’s associate dean of students.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd in a survey \u003ca href=\"http://skyfactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/2017-Room-Assignment-Research-Note.pdf\"\u003econducted\u003c/a\u003e by the research firm Skyfactor during the 2015–16 school year among 20,000 students at 15 participating institutions with varying roommate-assignment protocols, more than half of the respondents said they were happy with the roommate to whom they were assigned as a freshman; just one in 10 of them requested a roommate change that year.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePerhaps that’s because students, too, understand the stakes of a roommate relationship. After all, as Yanni noted, “a lot of students come to college for the social life, not for the academics.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“College was so much for me, and for my roommates, about catapulting ourselves outside of our comfort zones,” Harshaw said, “and there were a lot of instances of catapulting that I was not happy with at the time [I started freshman year]. But, I mean, that’s the point of college, and they really enriched me and made me the person I am today.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/7DyhqxXk8Ak\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/7DyhqxXk8Ak/","published":"2019-08-26T15:51:33Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-596803"},{"title":"A Tale of Two Tennis G.O.A.T.s","content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eSerena Williams and Roger Federer are two of the greatest tennis players of all time. \u003c/em\u003eThat idea has been reiterated so often by journalists and commentators, by current and former players, that it’s assumed an almost self-evident quality. Williams has broken records and wowed fans for years on the women’s tour; Federer has done the same on the men’s. Federer is 38 years old, while Williams will turn that age this September. Both are in the twilight stages of illustrious careers, and both enter the 2019 U.S. Open, which begins play today, as nominal contenders. Which is to say you have to at least pencil them in as potential winners—even though there’s a solid chance they’ll go home empty-handed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNeither Williams nor Federer needs to win another grand-slam title to justify their respective legacies.

If she wins, she’ll tie Margaret Court’s record of 24 grand-slam singles titles, the most of any tennis player. For Federer, it’s the need to preserve history. He currently holds 20 grand-slam singles titles, the most for a male player. But Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic—his two greatest rivals—are on his heels. Nadal has 18 grand-slam singles titles, Djokovic 16. Both are notably younger than Federer and playing tennis at the highest level (\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/07/wimbledon-novak-djokovic-outlasts-roger-federer/593947/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eDjokovic is currently ranked No. 1\u003c/a\u003e in the world while Nadal is No. 2), meaning they each have a legitimate shot to surpass the Swiss maestro in tennis’s most important statistical category.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStill, arguments for a player’s G.O.A.T. status have never relied solely on statistical justification; the full picture of an athlete’s career matters, too. Williams’s narrative has always been heavily grounded in the circumstances of her ascension. She’s the quintessential outsider-turned-icon, having overcome remarkable odds to enter a sport that didn’t welcome her with open arms before proceeding to dominate it. She began playing tennis during her childhood in Compton, California, far from a traditional hotbed of tennis talent, where she worked under the instruction of her father and coach, Richard Williams. She spent the early stages of her career in the shadow of her big sister, Venus Williams, a former world No. 1 who has won seven grand-slam singles titles of her own.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn the court, Serena Williams combines raw power with courageous shot making in a manner that tends to overwhelm even her most talented opponents. In the first round of this year’s U.S. Open, she will face the five-time grand-slam singles champion Maria Sharapova, an accomplished player whose game breaks down just about every time she faces Williams. Everything that Williams has achieved—often despite \u003ca href=\"https://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/02/serena-williams-end-indian-wells-boycott-14-years-after-racist-incident\"\u003einordinately hostile conditions\u003c/a\u003e—affirms her virtuosity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the case of Federer, it’s the specific way he plays the game that’s always enthralled so many. The quality of his shot making and the seeming ease with which he annihilates competitors are unparalleled in the history of men’s tennis. There are \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYqp5Xv6-GOlE73HIrEejQCakK0fSYrP8\"\u003elegions of YouTube playlists\u003c/a\u003e documenting the incredible winners Federer has hit over the years.

Even John McEnroe, who in his day was considered the game’s greatest shot maker and a true artist with a racket, made tennis look grueling.

Should Williams advance to the final of the women’s draw, she’ll have to overcome her recent struggles in culminating matches of majors.

Omar voted in favor of the bill, which would have introduced felony criminal charges for parents who forced their daughters to undergo the procedure, and would have allowed Child Protective Services to remove the injured daughters from their parents’ care.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eHowever, she had serious objections to the core aspect of the bill. “What I would have liked to have been done is for us to advocate for their parents to be charged with the laws that are currently in place,” she said—although no Minnesota laws were in place that punished parents specifically for FGM. There was only an as-yet-untested federal law that would later be found unconstitutional on the grounds that the matter was best left to the states. “What I would have liked,” Omar said, “for this bill to actually propose is what kind of level of charges that we would like to see brought up.” But what level of charges would be too much for a procedure that she had publicly called “the very worse form of child abuse”? She objected to barring the state from returning children to their parents’ homes if those parents arranged for them to be cut, questioning what further harm might befall them, and she suggested that the bill was just an attempt for media attention on the part of its sponsor. On the day of the vote, according to the bill’s sponsor, State Representative Mary Franson, Omar sat in an office watching the vote on television. She entered the House floor only to cast her own vote in favor of the law, despite her reservations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/04/trumps-attack-ilhan-omar-trap-democrats/587128/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: Democrats are falling into the Ilhan Omar trap\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe bill failed to clear the state Senate, and did not become law, in large part because community groups representing the African diaspora in Minnesota objected to it. Isuroon, a nonprofit Somali women’s organization, argued that the penalties on parents were too harsh, and called the state efforts to eradicate FGM a “witch hunt.” The Council for Minnesotans of African Heritage also opposed the law. Republican State Senator Karin Housley, who wrote the counterpart bill in the Senate, \u003ca href=\"http://www.startribune.com/minnesota-bill-against-female-mutilation-raises-opposition/423070383/\"\u003etold\u003c/a\u003e the \u003cem\u003eStar Tribune\u003c/em\u003e that she had come to fear that the bill would force the state into the position of “Big Brother,” rather than allowing immigrant communities to solve the problem from within their own ranks. And this is the only direct protection that the girls in Omar’s district have against parents imposing FGM: no specific state or federal law, just the recommendation of a white Minnesota legislator that the state “empower communities to address this practice from within.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eSo this is where the matter stands in the American congressional district with the highest number of girls at risk of having their genitals mutilated. The feds have turned the matter over to the states, and in Minnesota there is no law specifically tailored to punish parents who allow this obscenity to be forced on their female children. The only hope of these girls lies in their “community.” In other words, we have allowed these girls—American girls, full citizens of this country—to be identified as “other.” We have done to them exactly what Omar claims she does not want done to her: allowed their racial, ethnic, and religious identities to supersede their American one. And it is a profound shame on all of us.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThere is no room in this country, not one inch, for these gruesome practices. Nothing—not a witless respect for the cultural traditions of others, not a craven impulse to avoid looking intolerant—nothing should stop us from protecting every single American girl from being abused in this manner. Nothing should stop us from unequivocally prohibiting this kind of savagery, least of all the absurd insinuation that to do so would be somehow racist or ethnocentric. We do not reject FGM because it is practiced primarily by dark-skinned people, or because it is often erroneously presented as an Islamic commandment. We reject FGM because it is barbarism.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWe have planted every flag we have in the name of civilization, and it is time to plant one now. America is the inheritor of that long tradition that slowly, over centuries, produced John Locke, Mary Wollstonecraft, Abigail Adams, Frederick Douglass, and Martin Luther King Jr. Want to fight the patriarchy? Look no further than Somalia, where women are disbarred from making every major decision, including that most delicate and tender decision of how to manage one’s own fledgling sexuality. The Somalis take that right from 98 percent of their girls when they cut them open and rip away parts of their vagina. But this is America. These are our girls.

Not “smelled a little ripe,” not “could use a shower,” but \u003cem\u003estank\u003c/em\u003e. An aroma was emanating from deep within my body. As the afternoon sun strained the building’s air-conditioning and my odor situation deteriorated, I furtively sniffed at myself and began running through a list of things that could have gone wrong. Had I forgotten deodorant? Had I plucked my dress out of the wrong bedroom pile? Was I sweating out the previous night’s hot wings and Coors Light?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen I remembered the new vitamins.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat morning, I had torn open a plastic pouch and swallowed two giant ivory pills, two giant green pills, one mottled-gray gelcap, and an enormous capsule of golden fish oil. The supplement regimen was made by Goop Wellness, one of several product lines that have grown out of Gwyneth Paltrow’s influential lifestyle website, Goop. I’m no expert on the physics of odor suppression, but my instinct was to sink low in my chair in an effort to trap as much stink under my desk as possible. From there, I opened a new browser tab to find out what I had done to myself.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe vitamin cocktail I’d picked up at Goop’s downtown-Manhattan boutique was called Balls in the Air. It promised to defeat fatigue and promote productivity (and maybe make an arch little joke about testicles). Its ingredients include dozens of substances, but the star of the show is a cannonball of B vitamins, including 4,000 percent of the recommended daily dose of niacin and 3,333 percent of the recommended B12. A Google search confirmed my fears: As B-complex supplements break down, they create choline, which can turn bodily fluids into the vat of stink in which I was marinating.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHalf-hidden under my desk and paranoid that my co-workers would have to draw straws to see who would give me the talk about proper office hygiene, I tore through digital pages of supplement breakdowns and pseudoscientific ravings about the wonders of megadosing B vitamins. Another Balls in the Air reaction, “efficient energy levels,” aided my search; as far as I could tell, the term was a polite euphemism for feeling like I had done a bump of cocaine. But I found little information beyond a sketchy doctor promising that niacin could cure schizophrenia. I do not have schizophrenia. I had stink lines radiating off of me, like a real-life Pig-Pen from \u003cem\u003ePeanuts.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003caside class=\"callout-placeholder\" data-source=\"curated\"\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003cp\u003eEventually, I had to admit to myself that I was looking down the barrel of a much bigger problem. I still had 29 packets of vitamins to go, and the ones I had ingested were only prologue. I was in the first days of a quixotic, expense-account-straining journalistic mission to Goopify my existence. Goop, a one-stop shop for people hell-bent on perfecting themselves, has helped sell Americans on the idea that “wellness” means buying things until you feel better. So I had dropped more than $1,000 on Goop products to see whether they really could improve my life.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"dropcap\"\u003eM\u003cspan class=\"smallcaps\"\u003ey first indication\u003c/span\u003e of what was ahead of me came right as I walked up to the Goop store in Manhattan. When I turned down the boutique’s stretch of Bond Street on a sunny weekday afternoon, dark paparazzi SUVs were idling on the cobblestones, waiting for someone famous to arrive at a starlet-bait restaurant across the street. Sitting in the store’s doorway was a $600 Ralph Lauren umbrella stand, draped in fragile, porous calfskin, which often discolors and loses its lush texture when exposed to water. Using it to upholster an umbrella bucket felt like an elaborate joke.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInside, the store looked less like a mecca of rich-hippie wellness and more like the high-end clothing boutiques that dot all of New York City’s wealthiest neighborhoods. The walls were painted a creamy shade somewhere between beige and blush, lined with gleaming golden racks of silk dresses and shelves stacked with delicate summer knits; I flipped over a few tags and found four-figure prices and tiny sizes. Earlier that day, I had read an article on Goop.com about how to create a “judgment-free wellness space,” illustrated with an image of a plus-size woman doing yoga. In the store, the available clothing stopped far short of anything that would fit her—or me.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"c-recirculation-link\" data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2017/09/goop-popularity/539064/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: The baffling rise of Goop\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGoop most often makes headlines when it attempts to mainstream fringe health practices by, say, selling chunks of crystal \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/9/6/17826924/goop-yoni-egg-gwyneth-paltrow-settlement\"\u003eintended for vaginal insertion\u003c/a\u003e or hosting talks by controversial doctors, like \u003ca href=\"https://jezebel.com/anti-medication-goop-summit-expert-claims-aids-treatmen-1820919802\"\u003eone who claims\u003c/a\u003e that depression is a nutritional ailment. But Goop is primarily oriented around wealth and its trappings, particularly luxury fashion. Goop launched in 2008 as a newsletter for Paltrow’s travel and shopping recommendations, before transmogrifying into a $250 million retail, “content,” and events business. A third of the store in front of me was dedicated to casual gold and diamond jewelry. Two rare Hermes handbags were displayed behind glass.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI strolled to the back, where Goop’s marble-countered “clean beauty apothecary”—a mix of nutritional supplements, makeup and skin-care products, home decor, cookware, and two shelves of vibrators—was waiting for me to begin my version of \u003cem\u003eSupermarket Sweep.\u003c/em\u003e I spent a decade covering the fashion industry, so I’m intimately familiar with all the luxuries money can buy. But I’ve never been able to afford most of them. This time, there would be no anxiety about the looming bill, no internal debate over what it means for some stupid thing to be “worth” $78. For an hour or so, I would shop like a truly rich person: with no consequences.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI asked the two women working in the store—pretty blond 20-somethings who could have been cousins, or sorority sisters, or cousins in the same sorority—if they could show me the things people liked the most. The pair pointed to vitamins and an artfully mismatched selection of vintage crystal goblets. Gleefully, I started grabbing things: a skin-care starter kit, a water bottle that contained a chunk of rose quartz, a pair of Millennial-pink cut-glass goblets. I selected a mint-green blow-dryer that has been advertised to seemingly every woman with an internet connection and a credit card. One of the saleswomen sold me on a giant ceramic bowl with the assurance that it would be great for nights when I just want a big salad. Nothing about the bowl seemed different from what you could buy at Crate \u0026amp; Barrel, but her enthusiasm for it seemed profound, and I didn’t want to disappoint her by distrusting the bowl’s potential.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter a few minutes of browsing, I was offered a gratis carton of organic, calorie-free grapefruit- and elderflower-essenced alkaline spring water. It tasted like the ghost of a grapefruit, or like you finish your morning juice and fill the unrinsed cup with water. A second customer—another young woman—came into the store and asked to be shown the things people like, and the sorority sisters pointed her to different stuff from what they had shown me. Meanwhile, my pile of ostensibly life-improving Paltrow-approved products was growing. The only thing I wanted but resisted was a $300 serum made by Barbara Sturm, the Instagram-famous dermatologist to the stars. I was afraid that if I tried it, it might work \u003cem\u003etoo\u003c/em\u003e well—make me too beautiful, too radiant, too dewy. I would be haunted by the knowledge of what I was missing for the rest of my life.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn all, I spent $1,279. One of the clerks loaded my purchases into three giant shopping bags, all white with thick black grosgrain handles. The inside lip of each bag said, “Have a Goop day.” They were heavy enough that the clerk helped me out to the sidewalk, where she assumed an idling black Audi was mine. It wasn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"dropcap\"\u003eI\u003cspan class=\"smallcaps\"\u003ef shopping is a thrill\u003c/span\u003e, then the process of unpacking and inspecting a fresh haul of stuff is the blissful afterglow. I lugged my Goop acquisitions into my apartment and, one by one, lovingly removed them from their boxes like it was self-help Christmas. Like many people who enter the wellness market with little more than a vague sense that they could probably feel better than they do, I didn’t know exactly what anything I’d bought would do for me. Goop’s website doesn’t let its shoppers review their purchases, so I simply read the packaging and guessed what effects the various objects and potions might have.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI started my experiment with something I felt I could handle: blow-drying my hair. I grabbed the Christophe Robin round brush ($103) and the Harry Josh blow-dryer ($249), which promised to combine their powers to create smooth, loose, effortless curls. That amount of cash should have gotten me the hair of an \u003ca href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/davidmack/christian-girl-autumn-meme-caitlin-convington-emily-gemma\"\u003eInstagram influencer\u003c/a\u003e, but I hit an obstacle almost immediately. I’d gotten a haircut only eight weeks earlier, but women who use hundred-dollar brushes apparently get more frequent trims. The brush snagged knots in the ends of my hair that were invisible to the human eye. (A hair appointment two weeks later proved my suspicion: After a trim, the brush worked fine.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe brush and blow-dryer, like most of my Goop purchases, were intended to be used in the privacy of my own home, but it wasn’t long before the Glacce Crystal Elixir Water Bottle ($80), which features a large rose-quartz crystal shaped vaguely like the Washington Monument jutting up its center, forced me to go public with my wellness experiment. The market for bottles that promise to infuse water with crystal-derived “healing energies” is \u003ca href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/02/192072/crystal-water-bottles-vitajuwel-glacee-gemstone-elixir\"\u003emore crowded\u003c/a\u003e than you might think, but the Glacce version goes a step beyond many of its competitors by putting a big chunk of rock directly in the water chamber, instead of embedding a few small stones behind an interior layer of glass.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"c-recirculation-link\" data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2019/02/luxury-water-bottles/582595/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: How fancy water bottles became a 21st-century status symbol\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGlacce’s packaging is careful to stipulate that the company makes no medical claims. Still, its website notes that drinking rose-quartz water is “helpful in enhancing communication and has the ability to make surrounding environments feel open and safe.” I chose to forgo the glass bottle’s optional opaque sleeve and open myself up to questions in the office, and my water bottle indeed “enhanced communication” by drawing the attention of people from departments far and wide. It did not make me feel safer, but it did let me taste the distinct minerality imparted by drinking something with a rock in it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"A Glacce Crystal Elixir Water Bottle, slip silk scrunchies, and a rose-quartz face roller\" height=\"847\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/08/GoopedGroup/5fad11e54.jpg\" width=\"672\"\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"credit\"\u003ePaul Spella / The Atlantic\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter the vitamin mishap, I began to read the instructions for my remaining purchases more carefully. But Goop’s products kept thwarting me. The Kosas Tinted Face Oil ($42) promised to hydrate my face while evening my skin tone. The first time I tried to use it, it disappeared into the core of my Beauty Blender makeup sponge and was never seen again. I felt like the raccoon in that \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfbb4yRBH64\"\u003eviral video\u003c/a\u003e, trying to wash its cotton candy. When I squirted the oil onto the back of my hand to dab it on with a brush, it dripped onto the floor in seconds. I still have no idea how I’m supposed to put it on my face.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Goop Martini Emotional Detox Bath Soak ($35) was most unhelpful. It came in a pouch with a detailed image of pink salt crystals, but when I dumped it in my bath, it was brown. My tub looked like someone had taken a shit in it. It also smelled terrible, but not in a way that matched up with how it looked. The online product listing provided two clues as to why: frankincense and myrrh. Goop’s gifts of the Magi are as musty as you might expect resins that got name-checked in the Bible to smell in 2019. I felt very middle-class for wanting something dyed pink and artificially scented instead.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen there was the vibrator. Determined to become the first person ever to expense a sex toy to \u003cem\u003eThe Atlantic\u003c/em\u003e (though, really, who knows for sure what Thoreau submitted for reimbursement), I had chosen the Smile Makers Fireman Vibrator ($55), a little flame-shaped chunk of coral-colored silicone that looks silly enough not to scream \u003cem\u003emarital aid\u003c/em\u003e if a houseguest opens the wrong drawer. It was one of four slightly infantilizing options that Goop carries, themed around cutesy stereotypical objects of feminine yearning: the Fireman, the Tennis Coach, the Frenchman, the Millionaire.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, the vibrator violated a cardinal rule of all toys, sex or otherwise: It didn’t come with a battery. I didn’t realize this until late in the game, and I was left wandering around my apartment in just a T-shirt, trying to decide which remote control would yield a battery with the most life. Later, when the time came to shut my laptop and pretend nothing had just happened, I couldn’t figure out how to turn the vibrator off. I jabbed at its single button, but that only made it vibrate harder. All I could do was muffle the toy under my duvet and wander my apartment once again, to track down the instructions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"dropcap\"\u003eS\u003cspan class=\"smallcaps\"\u003eome of my Goop products\u003c/span\u003e, I must note, worked beautifully. The Slip silk scrunchies ($39) fulfilled their promise to be kinder to my hair than the skinny elastics that have been yanking strands out of my head for years. The Goop Beauty skin-care “discovery set” ($125) included two facial moisturizers that I loved, reaffirming my belief that rich women over 40, like Paltrow herself, really do know about all the best creams. I bought a Lisse Luxe Hair Towel ($30) that was exactly as long and thin as hair towels should be for optimal hair-twisting.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Necessaire Body Lotion ($25), which is sold with no health claims at all, ended an eczema flare that had plagued me for more than a year—exactly the type of chronic illness that inspires many people to look for relief in internet tips and alternative remedies. Its success gave me the same sense of hope that sells millions of dollars of unproven treatments.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEven so, as the experiment went on, I began to suspect that the health company I had been promised would never quite materialize. I tried to take every vitamin sachet and dose of Goop-branded melatonin with the sincere belief that I might just be one day away from feeling better than I ever knew I could. But Goop’s primary focus on merely maintaining appearances was inescapable: vitamins to quicken metabolism and maximize energy, supplement powder for glowing skin, cooking manuals and equipment to food-restrict my way to well-being.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor these products to be considered successful, the result wouldn’t necessarily be a stronger, more resilient, more competent me, or a more peaceful relationship with my body. It would be a person who is better-dressed, who hasn’t succumbed to the indignities of visible aging, whose hair doesn’t frizz, who never goes back for seconds at dinner.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInstead of questioning long-standing assumptions about women’s bodies, as Goop often claims is its goal, the company’s products embrace one of America’s oldest health myths: that physical beauty is proof not only of a person’s health but of her essential righteousness. If the outside is perfect, the inside must be too. It’s a retrograde vision of womanhood for a company that so frequently deploys the word \u003cem\u003eempowerment\u003c/em\u003e. It’s also a clever bit of vertical integration. Some companies sell weight-loss products; others, the clothes you get to wear after you conscientiously starve yourself. Few companies sell both.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWellness companies can feel predatory, even those not making Gwyneth Paltrow richer. It’s a largely unregulated industry, and it operates in an environment of open desperation. Many women \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2018/08/womens-health-care-gaslighting/567149/?utm_source=feed\"\u003ejustifiably mistrust\u003c/a\u003e the ways conventional doctors address their concerns and treat their pain.

Its spokespeople usually wind up telling journalists that any claims the company makes should be considered functionally meaningless. “As we have always explained, advice and recommendations included on Goop are not formal endorsements,” a Goop spokesperson told Rae Paoletta, the journalist who \u003ca href=\"https://gizmodo.com/nasa-calls-bullshit-on-goops-120-bio-frequency-healing-1796309360\"\u003edebunked its NASA stickers\u003c/a\u003e. When people charge Goop with classism or elitism, Paltrow frequently reminds them that its recommendations, product listings, and information about fringe health services such as vaginal steaming are free, and always have been.

Last year, Goop’s chief content officer, Elise Loehnen, \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/25/magazine/big-business-gwyneth-paltrow-wellness.html\"\u003etold the journalist Taffy Brodesser-Akner\u003c/a\u003e that the company’s amplification of unproven cures and uncredentialed health gurus is evidence that its employees are “just asking questions” about women’s health and well-being. “Just asking questions” is also a defense frequently invoked by anti-vaxxers, 9/11 truthers, and eugenicists.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRunning a luxury lifestyle business and running an organization sincerely trying to address the medical maltreatment of American women are distinct pursuits. Chronic illness and the state of women’s health care are both enormous problems in America that disproportionately harm people living in poverty, black and Hispanic people, and people who live in rural and urban areas without adequate medical resources. Certainly, wealthy women face these problems, too; no amount of money can guard against certain illnesses or biased doctors. But wealthy women have better access to help than so many other Americans do. By that measure, Goop's customers are already \u003ca href=\"https://www.apa.org/monitor/2013/10/health-wealth\"\u003ethe wellest among us\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFundamental to Goop’s sales philosophy is the idea that the female body is a matter of opinion, and that “asking questions” is the best way to resist a medical establishment determined to tell women how to feel. The biggest question I had while using Goop’s products was a little different: How had a celebrity convinced so many women who can afford all the designer dresses and diamond jewelry they want that their problems, health or otherwise, can be solved by buying even more stuff?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"dropcap\"\u003eM\u003cspan class=\"smallcaps\"\u003ey quest to Goopify\u003c/span\u003e my life didn’t end so much as peter out. After a few weeks, the good products were mostly gone. The really bad products had terrorized me so thoroughly that I stopped using them. And the products in between simply started to slip from my mind. I took a little more than half of the vitamin packets in my 30-day supply before I lapsed into my lifelong habit of owning vitamins instead of consuming them. My Goop rose-quartz face roller ($45) offered a refreshing jolt whenever I plucked it out of the refrigerator, but I usually forgot it was in there. The pink cut-glass goblets ($40 for a pair) sat idle inside my cabinets.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSuch is the life cycle of American stuff. The things that fall under the banner of “trying something new” often end up in junk drawers or the backs of closets, given away to friends or donated to Goodwill a few years down the line. \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/video/index/583372/consumerism/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eClutter is the country’s way of life\u003c/a\u003e, and buying the most luxurious version of a thing you don’t really need doesn’t make it more useful.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut here’s the thing about shopping that often goes unsaid: The \u003cem\u003estuff\u003c/em\u003e doesn’t matter, not really. The act of shopping itself is the salve. With most of my Goop purchases, the joy was all up front—in selecting, acquiring, and unwrapping things that seemed special, in feeling like something about me might change. That feeling is carefully cultivated, and it’s especially potent when a brand targets people who feel that their concerns and problems have been overlooked. When the hook is “Your problem matters,” whatever package of vitamins or tube of lotion gets thrown in the bag is almost beside the point. The act of buying from a business that makes you feel cared for and understood can seem like a course of treatment in and of itself.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"c-recirculation-link\" data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/video/index/583372/consumerism/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eWatch: America’s dopamine-fueled shopping addiction\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn an era when many people take the idea of “voting with their wallet” quite seriously, it’s no wonder that self-care, a concept first articulated by the radical poet and civil-rights activist Audre Lorde, was commodified into a righteous cry for fancy bath products. Goop, with its $3,000 dresses and $95 drinkable skin care, is the company you get when people believe that having nice things and being a good person are achieved through the same means.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe irony of the wellness industry is its obvious limitations. A new moisturizer can’t stop you from getting older. A new supplement pack can’t dispel the exhaustion of raising three kids. A new cookbook can’t change your genetic disposition to gaining weight around your waist. But a good entrepreneur will always come up with a few more problems for you to solve if you’ve got money to burn. During just a few weeks of wellness experimentation, I found myself sucked into the paranoid skepticism that drives people to buy more products, read more pseudoscience, and orient their lives around ailments that might not even exist.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDid I have a vitamin deficiency?

We have lived together for a year in my home. He has 50/50 custody of his son and I have my daughter the majority of the time. Both of our children are 5 years old.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIn the past six months, his son has changed how he treats me. We used to enjoy our time together—he’d snuggle with me and tell me he loved me. Now he tells me he doesn’t have to listen to me, or that I’m mean, and he even told me to get out of his room when I tried to help him after he had an accident. I used to pick both kids up from school so they could play before dinnertime, and take them to school in the morning since they enjoyed each other’s company. But I haven’t been able to handle him, so I scaled back on caring for him without his father present.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIn addition to his changed behavior toward me, he has been having issues at pre-K: biting, punching, and choking other children. To top things off, his mother has a drinking issue, and child protective services has gotten involved, including an interview with me and my child.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eAlthough the son has never exhibited these behaviors toward my daughter, I don’t want to jeopardize my own parenting time because I have this angry little fellow in my home sometimes. I am also uncomfortable with some of the exchanges between my boyfriend and his ex. She is verbally abusive and has mental-health issues on top of the alcoholism. He will say he is going to speak to her only via email, then go back to texting and calling. He even offered to attend AA with her. I feel that he puts her feelings way higher on his list of priorities than he should. He is always verbally appreciative and grateful to me, but I almost get jealous when I think of his behavior toward his ex.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eMy boyfriend and I plan to get married soon, but I am not sure how to deal with his ex and his child’s behavior. I suggested therapy for his son, but my boyfriend doesn’t think he needs it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eI’ve been in several long-term relationships, so I truly value the one I have now with my boyfriend, but it feels like these issues are growing out of control. I go back and forth between wanting to be helpful and understanding toward everyone involved, and angry that I am involved in this circus and wondering whether I should continue to be. I don’t know what to do.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJoy\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eCherry Hill, N.J.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDear Joy,\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eEven in the best of circumstances, blended families tend to be complicated for all involved—the parents, the exes, and the children from both families. In your case, though, you have the added layer of an unstable family member, and you’re wise to consider the implications for you and your daughter because if you marry your boyfriend, he (like you) is going to be a package deal.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe fact that both of you are package deals may sound obvious, but so many people I see in therapy tell me that, for some reason, they hadn’t anticipated how different dating would be the second time around. Many imagined that they would meet someone and fall in love, and that while there would be some adjustment in store for their kids and those of their new partner, everyone would eventually get along fine. But what they come to discover is that it’s not just the kids who might become a challenging part of their world—it’s also their partner’s ex.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThis last part is worth highlighting, because a blended family isn’t just two adults and their children. It consists of all of these children’s parents, even the ones not in the new marriage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eSo let’s look at your situation, starting with your boyfriend’s 5-year-old son. I have a feeling that your frustration with your boyfriend and his ex is potentially getting in the way of a greater understanding or empathy for what this boy may be going through. Young children don’t have the language or cognitive sophistication to articulate their feelings, so they tend to express them through behaviors, which would explain his acting out at school and also the change in his behavior with you. If his mother is struggling with addiction and mental-health issues that have required the involvement of child protective services, he is going to be affected by this. I imagine that he feels some combination of scared, confused, angry, sad, and unsafe around this person he loves who is supposed to care for him. Meanwhile, he’s expected to acclimate to a new parental figure and her child. The combination of these events would be a lot for anyone—but especially a 5-year-old—to manage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIt’s worth noting, too, that he’s not acting out with your daughter, and the behavior you mentioned at home—his saying that you’re mean or that he doesn’t have to listen to you—is par for the course with kids adjusting to a potential stepparent. So is the shame he may have felt when he had an accident and sent you away. Yes, he didn’t used to react this way, but children are very good at sensing how adults feel about them, and I imagine that it would be very hard to separate the frustration you have toward his mom and dad from the way you feel about their son. For instance, if your daughter said that you were mean or that she doesn’t have to listen to you (as kids sometimes do), you’d probably try to understand where she was coming from rather than decide that you couldn’t “handle” her, distance yourself, and tell your ex that he should take care of her from now on because you can’t be alone with her. Yet you’ve done just that with your boyfriend’s son—and this, too, will affect his behavior.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWhat this boy needs is stability, love, and understanding, but it doesn’t sound like anyone is talking to him about his experience. His father may not think he needs therapy, and in one sense, he’s right—the boy has become what therapists call the “identified patient” (IP) in this family system, the person who acts out the family’s struggles. The IP, while seeming to be the troubled family member, is actually the healthiest one in the sense that he’s having a normal reaction to an untenable situation. But it’s the IP who suffers, unless the family gets help.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe problem here isn’t the ex-wife, or your boyfriend, or his son. The problem is that this family—and by “this family,” I mean this entire blended family—needs support and guidance. Sending a 5-year-old to therapy when the adults in his life are struggling so much right now wouldn’t address the bigger issues swirling around him. But family therapy would benefit all of you greatly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIn family therapy, a therapist would see you in different combinations—both kids with you and your boyfriend, just the two of you as a couple, your daughter with you, your boyfriend’s son with each of his parents, your boyfriend with his ex, perhaps the three of you adults together, depending on his ex’s level of volatility—and help bring some balance to the new family system. Through this process, you’d gain a better understanding of and deeper empathy for why it might be important for your boyfriend to support the mother of his child in her recovery by accompanying her to AA meetings, taking her calls, and being an available co-parent when his child’s safety and well-being are at stake. Your boyfriend will get support for what he’s going through, which will in turn open up communication between the two of you. The kids will have the opportunity to be seen and heard in a more effective way. And you will have a safe place to negotiate rules and boundaries as you navigate this new chapter in all of your lives.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eYou may decide that you’re not willing to put in this kind of effort. You may dig deep into your capacity for joining a family that includes a troubled mother to your potential stepchild and candidly conclude that it feels too risky for you and your daughter and that you must leave. But you say that you value this relationship, and if you do, family therapy may be worth a try. In the end, you can’t have it both ways—you can’t complain about the circumstances but do nothing to improve them. At the very least, taking a positive, active step will lend clarity to your decision, whichever one you ultimately make. And at best, it may help create a strong foundation for the more peaceful home you’re seeking.\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eDear Therapist is for informational purposes only, does not constitute medical advice, and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

From the start, Warren’s campaign was built on the theory that she’s an outsider whom insiders can live with, and an insider who has credibility with outsiders—in 2016 terms, someone who can attract both Sanders and Hillary Clinton voters. Primary voting is months away. The DNC’s 2020 convention is almost a year from now. But on Friday afternoon, in the huge, bland hotel ballroom where the DNC meeting was held, Warren’s theory seemed to be working out.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/07/warren-democrat-2020/594430/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: Elizabeth Warren has momentum.

Explaining what he thinks her appeal is to establishment Democrats, Fowler told me that for all of Warren’s talk of “big, structural change”—by fundamentally reworking the economy—“she does not include in her presentation the implication of being against things, except the current president.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWarren’s insider-outsider routine is one reason Democratic operatives and analysts told me—and one another, in private conversations—that they’ve begun to see her as the odds-on favorite to win her party’s nomination. However, a few of the Democrats I spoke with noted that her positioning could become a trap: With Sanders and Warren expected to battle even more intensely in the coming months, the change-hungry part of the Democratic base might begin to ask why establishment insiders seem so comfortable with her.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eJay Jacobs, the chair of the New York Democratic Party, told me a few hours after Warren’s Friday speech that although his politics aren’t as far left as Warren’s, “there wasn’t a thing she said today that I could not have written.” Jacobs, who was made chair by the Biden-backing Governor Andrew Cuomo, added, “The times do call for bolder action.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e“I hope Sanders supporters see Warren’s broadening support as a good thing and won’t now cynically try to paint her as beholden to insiders, because she’s not,” said a DNC member who isn’t currently committed to any candidates and who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “We will see.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eMost of the Democrats I talked to didn’t seem especially upset that Biden did not attend the summer meeting.

In her speech on Thursday, she reminded the audience that in March 2018, she wrote $5,000 checks to each state party from her campaign account, part of an overall $11 million she raised for Democratic Party efforts. During the midterms, she also endorsed and campaigned for candidates across the country.

But what these recent cases suggest is that the intelligence war is escalating—that China has increased both the scope and the sophistication of its efforts to steal secrets from the U.S. “The fact that we have caught three at the same time is telling of how focused China is on the U.S.,” John Demers, the head of the National Security Division at the Justice Department, which brought the charges against Mallory, Hansen, and Lee, told me. “If you think about what it takes to co-opt three people, you start to appreciate the actual extent of their efforts. There may be people we haven’t caught, and then you have to acknowledge that probably a small percentage of the people who’ve been approached ever go as far as these three did.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMany espionage cases don’t go public. “Some of the cases rarely see the light of a courtroom, because there’s classified material we’re not willing to risk,” one U.S. intelligence official told me, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the topic. “Sometimes they’re not charged at all and are handled through other means. And there are others that remain ongoing that have not and will not become public.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese recent cases provide just a small glimpse of the growing intelligence war that is playing out in the shadows of the U.S.-China struggle for global dominance, and of the aggressiveness and skillfulness with which China is waging it. As China advances economically and technologically, its spy services are keeping pace: Their intelligence officers are more sophisticated, the tools at their disposal are more powerful, and they are engaged in what appears to be an intensifying array of espionage operations that have their American counterparts on the defensive. China’s efforts aimed at former U.S. intelligence officers are just one part of a Chinese campaign that U.S. officials say also includes cyberattacks against U.S. government databases and \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/20/18150275/chinese-hackers-stealing-data-nasa-ibm-charged\"\u003ecompanies\u003c/a\u003e, stealing trade \u003ca href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-us-china-trade-war-ip-theft-20190221-story.html\"\u003esecrets\u003c/a\u003e from the private sector, using \u003ca href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-targets-u-s-tech-startups-in-investment-loophole-1531742441?mod=article_inline\"\u003eventure-capital investment\u003c/a\u003e to acquire sensitive technology, and targeting \u003ca href=\"https://www.csis.org/programs/technology-policy-program/significant-cyber-incidents\"\u003euniversities\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-us-china-trade-war-ip-theft-20190221-story.html\"\u003eresearch institutions\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBy their nature, espionage wars are conducted in the shadows and hard to see clearly. But in recent weeks I spoke with several current and former U.S. officials, including America’s counterintelligence chief, who have been on the front lines of the one being waged between the U.S. and China, to get a sense of how it is being fought, of China’s intelligence operations—the methods, the targets, the goals—and of what the U.S. needs to do to combat it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr class=\"c-section-divider\"\u003e\u003cp class=\"dropcap\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003eChina has been seeking to turn American spies for decades. But the rules of the game have changed. About 10 years ago, Charity Wright was a young U.S. military linguist training at the elite Defense Language Institute Foreign Language Center at a base called the Presidio in Monterey, California. Like many of her peers, Wright relied on taxis to visit the city. There were usually a few waiting outside the base’s gate. She’d been assigned to the institute’s Mandarin program, so she felt lucky to frequently find herself in the cab of an old man who told her he’d emigrated from China years ago. He was inquisitive in a way she found charming at first, letting her practice her new language skills as he asked about her background and family. After several months, though, she grew suspicious. The old man seemed to have an unusually good memory, and his questions were becoming more specific: \u003cem\u003eWhere is it that your father works? What will you be doing for the military once you graduate? \u003c/em\u003eWright had been briefed on the possibility of foreign intelligence operatives collecting information on the institute’s trainees, building profiles for potential recruitment, given that many of them would move on to careers in intelligence. She reported the man to an officer at the base. Not long after, she heard that he’d been arrested and that there had been a crackdown in Monterey on a suspected Chinese spy ring.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWright went on to spend five years as a cryptologic language analyst with the National Security Agency, assessing communications intercepts from China. Now she works in private-sector cybersecurity. As a reservist, she still holds a U.S. government clearance that allows her access to classified secrets. And she’s still the target of what she suspects are Chinese espionage efforts. Only these days, the agents don’t approach her in person. They get in touch the same way they reached Kevin Mallory: online. She gets messages through LinkedIn and other social-media sites proposing various opportunities in China: a contract with a consulting firm, a trip to speak at a conference for a generous stipend. The offers seem tempting, but this type of outreach comes straight from the Chinese-spy playbook. “I’ve heard that they can be very convincing, and by the time you fly over, they’ve got you in their lair,” Wright told me.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe tactics she saw from the old man in Monterey were “cut and dry HUMINT,” or human intelligence, she said. They were old school. But those tactics have been amplified by the tools of the social-media age, which allow intelligence officers to reach out to their targets en masse from China, where there’s no risk of getting caught. Meanwhile, intelligence experts tell me, Chinese intelligence officers have only been getting better at the traditional skills involved in persuading a target to turn on his or her country.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2019/07/chinas-influence-efforts-germany-students/593689/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: The Chinese influence effort happening in plain sight\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eDonald Trump has made getting tough on China a central aspect of his foreign policy.

U.S. political and business leaders for decades pushed the idea that embracing trade with China would help to normalize its behavior, but Beijing’s aggressive espionage efforts have fueled an emerging bipartisan consensus in Washington that the hope was misplaced. Since 2017, the DOJ has brought at least a dozen cases against alleged agents and spies for conducting cyber- and economic espionage on behalf of China. “The hope was, as they develop, as they become more wealthy, as they start being a part of the club of developed nations, they’re going to change their behavior—once they get closer to the top, they’re going to operate by our rules,” John Demers told me. “What we’ve seen instead is [China] becoming better resourced and more methodical about the theft of information.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eFor the past 20 years, America’s intelligence community’s top priority has been counterterrorism. A generation of operations officers and analysts has been geared more toward finding and killing America’s enemies and preventing extremist attacks than toward the more patient and strategic work that comes with peer competition and counterintelligence. If America is indeed entering an era of “great power” conflict with China, then the crux of the struggle will likely take place not on a battlefield, but in the race for information, at least for now. And here China is using an age-old human frailty to gain advantage in the competition with its more powerful adversary: greed. U.S. officials have been warning companies and research institutions not just of the strings that might be attached to Chinese money, but of the danger of corrupted employees turned spies. They are also worried about current and former U.S. officials who have been entrusted with protecting the nation’s secrets.\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr class=\"c-section-divider\"\u003e\u003cp class=\"dropcap\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWhen I told William Evanina, America’s top counterintelligence official, Wright’s story about the cab driver in Monterey, he replied: “Of course.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eSpy rings operating out of taxis are relatively unoriginal, he told me, and have long been an issue around U.S. military and intelligence installations. An FBI and CIA veteran who is now the director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, Evanina has a suspicious mind—and perhaps one of the country’s worst Uber ratings. He sees the risk of intelligence collection and hidden cameras in any hired car, he told me, and if a driver ever tries to make small talk, he immediately shuts it down.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eKnowing someone’s background can help an intelligence agency build a profile for potential recruitment. The person might have medical bills piling up, a parent in debt, a sibling in jail, or an infidelity that exposes him or her to blackmail. What really worries Evanina is that so much of this information can now be obtained online, legally and illegally. People can ignore Uber drivers all they want, but a good hacker or even someone savvy at mining social media might be able to track down targets’ financial records, their political views, profiles of their family members, and their upcoming travel plans. “It makes it so damn easy,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eSecurity breaches happen with alarming regularity. Capital One \u003ca href=\"https://www.capitalone.com/facts2019/\"\u003eannounced\u003c/a\u003e in July that a data breach had exposed about 100 million people in America. During one of my conversations with Wright, she mused that whatever information the old man in the taxi might have wanted to glean from her, all that and much more may have been revealed in the 2015 breach of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. In that sophisticated attack, widely believed to have been carried out by state-sponsored Chinese hackers, an enormous batch of data was stolen, including detailed information the government collects as part of the process of approving security clearances. The stolen information contained “probing questions about an applicant’s personal finances, past substance abuse, and psychiatric care,” \u003ca href=\"https://www.wired.com/2016/10/inside-cyberattack-shocked-us-government/\"\u003eaccording\u003c/a\u003e to \u003cem\u003eWired\u003c/em\u003e, as well as “everything from lie detector results to notes about whether an applicant engages in risky sexual behavior.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/03/theres-no-real-difference-between-online-espionage-and-online-attack/284233/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: There’s no real difference between online espionage and online attack\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eRussia, the U.S. adversary that is often included with China in discussions of “near peer” conflict, has a modus operandi when it comes to recruiting spies that is similar to America’s, Evanina said. While some of their intelligence efforts, such as election interference, are loud and aggressive and seemingly unconcerned with being discovered, Russians are careful and targeted when trying to turn a well-placed asset. Russia tends to have veteran intelligence operatives make contact in person and proceed with care and patience. “Their worst-case scenario is getting caught,” Evanina told me. “They take pride in their HUMINT operations. They’re very targeted. They take extra time to increase the percentage of success. Whereas the Chinese don’t care.” (This doesn’t mean that the Chinese can’t also be targeted and discreet when needed, he added.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e“What you have is an intelligence officer sitting in Beijing,” he said. “And he can send out 30,000 emails a day. And if he gets 300 replies, that’s a high-yield, low-risk intelligence operation.” Concerning those who have left government for the private sector—and who sometimes keep their clearance to continue doing sensitive government work—it can be hard to know where to draw the line. Evanina said China will sometimes wait years to target former officials: “Your Spidey sense goes down.” But “your memory is not erased”—that is, they’ve still got the information the Chinese want.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"left\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" height=\"332\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/08/Tatone_Atlantic_Chinese_Recruiting_US_Spies_Inline/fb4e9dbcb.jpg\" width=\"332\"\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"caption\"\u003e(Alicia Tatone)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eOften, Chinese spies don’t even have to look too hard. Many of those who have left U.S. intelligence jobs reveal on their LinkedIn profiles which agencies they worked for and the countries and topics on which they focused. If they still have a government clearance, they might advertise that too. Buried in the questionnaire Evanina filled out for his Senate confirmation is a question asking whether he had any plans for a career after government. “I currently have no plans subsequent to completing government service,” he wrote. When I asked him about this, he admitted that this is becoming less common among intelligence officials his age. (He’s 52.) “All of my friends are leaving like crazy now because they have kids in college,” he said. “The money is [better]. It’s hard to say no.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIf a former intelligence officer lands a job at a prominent government contractor, such as Booz Allen Hamilton or DynCorp International, he or she can expect to be well compensated. But others find themselves in less lucrative posts, or try to strike out on their own. Evanina told me that Chinese intelligence operatives pose online as Chinese professors, think-tank experts, or executives. They usually propose a trip to China as a business opportunity. “Especially the ones who have retired from the CIA, DIA, and are now contractors—they have to make the bucks,” Evanina said. “And a lot of times that’s in China. And they get compromised.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eOnce a target is in China, Chinese operatives might try to get the person to start passing over sensitive information in degrees. The first request could be for information that doesn’t seem like a big deal. But by then the trap is set. “When they get that [first] envelope, it’s being photographed. And then they can blackmail you. And then you’re being sucked in,” Evanina said. “One document becomes 10 documents becomes 15 documents. And then you have to rationalize that in your mind: \u003cem\u003eI am not a spy, because they’re forcing me to do this\u003c/em\u003e.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the cases of Mallory, Hansen, and Lee, Evanina said, the lure wasn’t ideology. It was money. Money was also the lure in two similar cases, in which suspects were convicted of lesser charges than espionage. Both apparently began their relationship with Chinese intelligence officers while still employed in sensitive U.S. government jobs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 2016, \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/02/nyregion/fbi-employee-pleads-guilty-to-acting-as-an-agent-of-china.html\"\u003eKun Shan Chun\u003c/a\u003e, a veteran FBI employee who had a top-secret security clearance, pleaded guilty to acting as an agent of China.

In exchange, Claiborne provided copies of State Department documents and analysis, prosecutors said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEvanina’s office in Bethesda, Maryland, features a so-called Wall of Shame, on which hang the photographs of dozens of convicted American traitors—a testament to the struggles that have always plagued the U.S. intelligence community. The Cold War, for example, was marked by disastrous leaks from people such as the CIA officer Aldrich Ames and the FBI agent Robert Hanssen. Larry Chin, a CIA translator, was arrested in 1985 on charges of selling classified information to China over the course of three decades. That came during the so-called \u003ca href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/history/famous-cases/year-of-the-spy-1985\"\u003eYear of the Spy\u003c/a\u003e, as the FBI made a series of high-profile arrests of U.S. government officials spying for the Soviet Union, Israel, and even Ghana. The Wall of Shame is currently being renovated, and when it’s unveiled in the fall, it will feature several new faces.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhenever a current or former U.S. intelligence officer has been turned, it takes years to assess the full repercussions. “We have to mitigate that damage for sometimes a decade,” Evanina said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr class=\"c-section-divider\"\u003e\u003cp class=\"dropcap\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003eTwo decades ago, Chinese intelligence officers were largely seen as relatively amateurish, even sloppy, a former U.S. intelligence official who spent years focusing on China told me. Usually, their English was poor. They were clumsy. They used predictable covers. Chinese military intelligence officers masquerading as civilians often failed to hide a military bearing and could come across as almost laughably uptight. Typically their main targets tended to be of Chinese descent. In recent years, however, Chinese intelligence officers have become more sophisticated—they can come across as suave, personable, even genteel. Their manners can be fluid. Their English is usually good. “Now this is the norm,” the former official said, speaking with me on condition of anonymity due to security concerns. “They really have learned quite a bit and grown up.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eRodney Faraon, a former senior analyst at the CIA, told me that the Mallory and Hansen cases show just how far China’s espionage services have come. “They’ve broadened their tactics to go beyond relatively easy targets, from recruiting among the ethnically Chinese community to a much more diverse set of human assets,” he said. “In a sense, they’ve become more traditional.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003caside class=\"callout-placeholder\" data-source=\"curated\"\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn his recently published \u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Catch-Spy-Art-Counterintelligence/dp/1626166803\"\u003ebook\u003c/a\u003e, \u003cem\u003eTo Catch a Spy: The Art of Counterintelligence\u003c/em\u003e, James Olson, a veteran of the CIA’s clandestine service and its former chief of counterintelligence, breaks down the basics of China’s espionage services and how they operate. The Ministry of State Security (MSS), its main service, focuses on overseas intelligence. The Ministry of Public Security focuses on domestic intelligence, but also has agents abroad. The People’s Liberation Army, which focuses on military intelligence, “has defined its role broadly and has competed with the MSS in a wide range of economic, political, and technological intelligence collection operations overseas, in addition to its more traditional military targeting.” Olson adds that “the PLA has been responsible for the bulk” of China’s cyberespionage, though the MSS may also be expanding in this realm. Both the MSS and PLA, meanwhile, “make regular use of diplomatic, commercial, journalistic, and student covers for their operations in the United States. They aggressively use Chinese travelers to the US, especially business representatives, academics, scientists, students, and tourists, to supplement their intelligence collection. US intelligence experts have been amazed at how voracious the Chinese have been in their collection activity.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOlson notes that China has “always been adept at espionage,” but writes with a kind of awe at the extent of its efforts today. “If I were to start my CIA career all over again, I would try to get into our China program, learn Mandarin, and become a Chinese counterintelligence specialist … Our top priority in US counterintelligence today—and into the future—must be to stop or to drastically curtail China’s spying.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf veteran American spies are vulnerable to Chinese espionage, U.S. companies may be faring even worse. In some cases, targeting the private sector and targeting U.S. national security can mix. A former U.S. security official, who now works for a prominent American aviation company that is involved in highly sensitive U.S. government projects, told me that the company had a suspected intelligence collector linked to China in its midst. “I would say that he’s had tradecraft training,” this person said, speaking anonymously due to an ongoing law-enforcement investigation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe former security official was hired by the company to monitor such threats, and initially found the lack of effective prevention measures and training at the company jarring. “When I walked in and got the briefing here, I thought it was a joke ... Now we do take some measures to protect against [insider threats], but in a sense it’s fox in a henhouse,” this person said. “We as an industry are woefully inadequate at protecting ourselves from a foreign-intelligence threat.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/10/china-cambodia-infrastructure-myanmar-rohingya-trump-xi-jinping/543168/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: China’s plan to buy influence and undermine democracy\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIn a sense, going after American spies and government officials is fair game in the intelligence world. The U.S. does the same against the Chinese. “Intelligence operations are universal, with every country—other than a few isolated island-states who are concerned mainly with the danger of approaching cyclones—engaging in them, to one degree or another,” Loch K. Johnson, a professor emeritus at the University of Georgia, the author of \u003cem\u003eSpy Watching: Intelligence Accountability in the United States\u003c/em\u003e, and one of America’s foremost intelligence scholars, told me in an email. He added that while almost every nation fields capabilities to both collect information about its adversaries and defend itself against espionage, a much smaller number have meaningful networks for covert action, which he described as “secret propaganda; political and economic manipulation; even paramilitary activities.” Both America and China count themselves among this group.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“The United States used propaganda, political, and economic ops during the Cold War and (somewhat less aggressively) since. China returns [the] favor,” Johnson said. “Both are major powers and have a full complement of intelligence capabilities, aimed at each other and other significant targets around the world. This means that the United States (like China in reverse) is constantly trying to learn what China is doing when it comes to military, economic, political, and cultural activities, since they may impinge upon U.S. interests in Asia and elsewhere.” To that end, the U.S. uses signals intelligence, geospatial intelligence, and HUMINT, Johnson said, “all aided by a diligent searching through the available (and voluminous) [open-source intelligence] materials for background.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut he noted a key difference between the two countries: China’s aggressive approach to economic espionage. These Chinese efforts are partly what have prompted U.S. officials and \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jTVk3CvPBU\"\u003epoliticians\u003c/a\u003e to turn to a newly popular refrain that China’s not playing by the rules. U.S. officials insist that American intelligence agencies do not target foreign companies with the aim of helping domestic ones.

And they still see an American hand in events such as the protests in Hong Kong today. “So we’re all sitting here scratching our heads and saying, ‘Do they really believe we’re behind Hong Kong? And the answer is, yes they do. They really believe that the fundamental American goal is the destruction and demise of Chinese Communism,” he said. “Now, if you believe that the other guy is bent on your destruction, then it’s kind of anything goes. So for the Chinese, stealing, espionage, cyberespionage against American corporations for the good of the Chinese state, are just part and parcel of the need for survival against this very formidable enemy.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eChina denies that it is spying against the U.S.  on the scale alleged by American officials. When presented with the details of this story, a spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington, D.C., Fang Hong, said via email that she had no knowledge of the cases involving Mallory, Hansen, Lee, and others. “China has always fully respected the sovereignty of all countries and does not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries,” she said. Fang also disparaged U.S. attempts to root out Chinese spies, citing a quote commonly attributed to a great American writer. U.S. views on Chinese espionage, she remarked, “remind me of what Mark Twain said: ‘To a man with a hammer, everything looks like a nail.’”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFang continued, “U.S. officials’ accusations against Chinese students and researchers are groundless.

Often, however, the distinction between a Chinese company and the Chinese state is not clear-cut. Chinese law mandates that all corporations cooperate with the government on national security. This was one \u003ca href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/02/07/we-cant-tell-if-chinese-firms-work-for-the-party/\"\u003econcern\u003c/a\u003e U.S. officials cited after announcing indictments against the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei earlier this year; the Trump administration has banned U.S. companies from doing business with it. (Huawei has pleaded \u003ca href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/technology/432104-huawei-pleads-not-guilty-to-trying-to-steal-trade-secrets\"\u003enot guilty\u003c/a\u003e to attempted U.S. trade-theft allegations.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDemers told me that China uses economic espionage as a form of “R\u0026amp;D,” or research and development. “They also have very talented, smart people who are using their resources in legitimate ways, which is, I think, some of the frustration that folks have right now—that you could do this differently. You could fight fair, right? You’re not the 80-pound weakling who has to throw dirt in somebody’s eye to get ahead.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe open business climate between America and China—the sort of climate that did not exist between America and the Soviet Union during the Cold War—makes addressing Chinese espionage trickier: China is both a rival and a top trade partner. The economic and research relationship between the two countries benefits them both. At the same time, Chinese immigrants and visitors to America risk being unfairly targeted if U.S. officials fail to find the right balance, which would cast a chill on legitimate exchange between the two countries while raising the specter of American overreactions during past struggles, from the Cold War to the War on Terror. As U.S. officials warn about the Chinese espionage threat and the U.S. intelligence community reorients to face it, they must be careful not to undermine the American values—openness, civil liberty, enterprise—that remain perhaps the country’s greatest advantage over China.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRodney Faraon, who worked on the President’s Daily Briefing team at the CIA during the Bill Clinton and George W. Bush administrations and is now a partner at Crumpton Group, a business intelligence firm, told me that it will take a major push not just from America’s intelligence agencies but from the U.S. government overall to find the right strategy. And despite the Trump administration’s combative stance on trade negotiations and other issues, this has yet to happen. “The approach must be whole of government and must involve the private sector,” Faraon said. “The Chinese use and value intelligence better than we do, seeing its applicability in nearly every aspect of private and public life—military, social, commercial. We have been slow to recognize this for ourselves.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/r5bLE7SrVLk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/r5bLE7SrVLk/","published":"2019-08-26T09:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-595747"},{"title":"\u003cem\u003eSuccession\u003c/em\u003e Invents a Terrifying New Game","content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis post contains major spoilers for Season 2, Episode 3 of \u003c/em\u003eSuccession\u003ci\u003e.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe most recent episode of HBO’s \u003ci\u003eSuccession\u003c/i\u003e, “Hunting,” will be most remembered for one phrase: “boar on the floor.” That’s the catchy name of the “game” that the Waystar Royco mogul Logan Roy (played by Brian Cox) inflicts on his potentially traitorous underlings, forcing some of them to oink like piggies and scuffle for sausages. A hilarious and awful spectacle with no rules other than Logan’s whims, boar on the floor transforms a dining room full of polished executives into a fraternity hazing basement. “It’s fun!” Logan shouts, and to viewers, it is that—while also being disturbing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut the key to understanding this particularly genius episode of this \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/08/succession-review-hbo-season-two/595822/?utm_source=feed\"\u003egenius TV comedy\u003c/a\u003e is in a more commonplace phrase than\u003cem\u003e \u003c/em\u003e“boar on the floor.” It’s in the word \u003cem\u003eokay\u003c/em\u003e. No show’s writers are better at capturing the fumbling, pseudo-jocular, not-all-that-witty way that real people actually talk. Most of Sunday’s episode amounted to a symphony of people saying “okay” to one another, which subtly underscored \u003ci\u003eSuccession\u003c/i\u003e’s big insights about fear and power.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eOkay\u003c/em\u003e is a versatile word. There’s the \u003cem\u003eyes\u003c/em\u003e-like version, which is how Frank (Peter Friedman) replies to being asked to give a toast by the CEO who will soon roast him as “a creep.” There’s the time-stalling, doubtful “okay …” that Gerri (J. Smith-Cameron) issues when Logan announces his plan to buy Pierce (the Warner Media to Waystar Royco’s Fox Corporation). And there are the similar versions of \u003cem\u003eokay\u003c/em\u003e that Gerri, Karl (David Rasche), and Tom (Matthew Macfadyen) use when trying to flatter one another into being the one to stand up to Logan about that plan. Connor (Alan Ruck), rebuffing his sister’s attempt to stop him from releasing a tax-protesting campaign video, is like a pull-string doll who mostly says—blankly, placatingly—“okay.” (Well, that and, “You don’t hyperdecant?”).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen there are all the implied, unstated “okays\u003ci\u003e”\u003c/i\u003e that meet Logan’s preposterous demands: to pee in a bucket, to get on all fours, to try to buy a $20 billion competitor possibly just to fulfill a long-held grudge.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLogan, however, only says “okay” once. It’s after he orders Siobhan (Sarah Snook) on a mission she doesn’t want to go on, and hangs up the phone without getting her answer. Otherwise, he has no use for bland affirmations and conversational truces. At both the beginning and end of the episode, he is directly informed of his team’s doubts about his vision to acquire another huge company. He notes their dissent with an “uh-huh” or a “well”—and then declares that the bid is happening anyway. There is no negotiation, no softening, to be seen.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA man uninterested in compromise is a frightening man, and it’s a given that Logan “can be scary, vindictive, paranoid, violent,” as Cousin Greg (Nicholas Braun) reveals to a journalist at the beginning of the episode. Waystar Royco unmistakably operates on a “\u003ca href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/lizryan/2017/03/07/ten-unmistakable-signs-of-a-fear-based-workplace/\"\u003eculture of fear,\u003c/a\u003e” a term that sociologists have applied to myriad\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003ereal-life cultures and companies. But \u003ci\u003eSuccession\u003c/i\u003e is less interested in \u003ci\u003ewhat\u003c/i\u003e happens in corporate America than \u003cem\u003ehow\u003c/em\u003e. The Roy family, it’s plenty clear by now, is replete with incompetence. The media properties they own are rapidly becoming obsolete. The CEO’s health is faltering. How does Logan\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003estill hold steel-wire leashes on his minions and his investors? How does he get everyone around him to meet his every dictate with “okay”?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe first way is through the blunt-force power of threats. We haven’t seen Logan kill anyone. But we’ve seen him \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/08/succession-finale-review-hbo/566855/?utm_source=feed\"\u003ecover up a death\u003c/a\u003e, and the briefing on that matter that his security manager gave in the Season 2 premiere was all-too-businesslike. So the macho and gruesome language thrown around in the Waystar offices has a certain unsettling credibility. In “Hunting,” one underling says he’s burned villages and overthrown governments on Logan’s behalf—is he kidding? When Logan hears news that an associate talked with the CEO’s would-be biographer, he erupts, saying that person is dead to him, and Kendall (Jeremy Strong) elaborates that they’ll be chopped up and thrown in the Danube. As to the question of why there’s a corporate retreat in Hungary: Gerri says, unblinkingly, that it’s because you can shoot whatever you want and get away with it. “Here’s the safety briefing,” Logan barks on the way to the hog hunt. “If you move against me, I’ll put a hole in the back of your fucking head!”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLogan’s rampage against traitors doesn’t quite come to the point of murder. But it’s clear that another kind of threat he often issues is very real: blackmail. All season long, the once-rebellious Kendall has played Logan’s dead-eyed servant, a conversion that happened because of the dirt that his father has on him. Now, in front of a room full of colleagues, Logan not-so-subtly implies that Waystar’s lawyer Karl has a habit of visiting prostitutes. “Does your old lady know about that?” Logan asks, to which Karl replies, “She knows I’m something of a libertine.” Logan: “Is that a yes?” Karl closes his eyes and issues a surrender, a plea of \u003ci\u003euncle\u003c/i\u003e: “Okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe grilling of Karl is part of Logan’s larger tactic for dominance—humiliation. Boar on the floor morphs professionals into pigs, and the hooting and jeering from onlookers is a clear demonstration of how easily civilization can collapse into something more animalistic; see the \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwbSMIuVdLM\"\u003einfamous dinner-party scene from 2017’s \u003ci\u003eThe Square\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e for a yet-starker depiction of this dynamic. What’s excellent about \u003ci\u003eSuccession\u003c/i\u003e’s version is that you witness, via nervous laughter and stammered refusals, the incremental way that collegiality crumbles and a tyrant’s ability to rule through fear is recognized. “Logan, what the fuck?” Karl asks, early in the belittling process. Later, Cousin Greg protests that the rules say he doesn’t deserve to be sent into the boar pit, but Logan corrects him: There are no rules.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe particularities of Logan’s mind games are telling. Boar on the floor is quite clearly something Logan made up, inspired by the boar they’d hunted that day and were eating that night. You can see him inventing it in real time, blurting out the name—Karl seems to think it’s an insult toward him at first—and only later filling in the details. It’s also the sort of “game” Logan used as a father to create a dominance hierarchy among his kids: Last season, we learned of Roman (Kieran Culkin) being locked in a dog cage by his brothers at the goading of their dad. By definition, these tactics are dehumanizing. That they have mythic resonance—Logan is Circe, turning sailors to swine—speaks to their power.   \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eShame has \u003ca href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/is-psychology-making-us-sick/201301/shame-the-master-emotion\"\u003ebeen called\u003c/a\u003e the “master emotion” by psychologists, and its effects are palpable in the breakfast scene after the chaotic dinner party. Tom pretends he drank too much to remember what he did, but his chief rival, Cyd Peach (Jeannie Berlin), lets him know \u003ci\u003eshe\u003c/i\u003e remembers by asking whether he wants a sausage. It’s obvious she’ll never treat him the same. Meanwhile, Frank—viciously insulted by Logan just after being brought back into the fold—shrugs his shoulders when telling Gerri that he’s considering taking a job offer at Waystar. He also all-too-willingly nods when Logan writes off the night before as a product of drinking and jet lag. That BS explanation is as close to an apology as Logan will ever give for his monstrousness, and his employees have essentially said “okay” to being treated, forevermore, like livestock.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/BUUPS5JQ1b0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/BUUPS5JQ1b0/","published":"2019-08-26T02:05:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-596584"}]},{"url":"https://feeds.feedburner.com/time/topstories?format=xml","items":[{"title":"Here’s Where That Over-the-Top Castle in Succession Is Really Located","content":"\u003caside class=\"right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad\" id=\"right-rail__ad-5661580\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module video-2\" data-src=\"https://time.com/5661580/succession-hungary-castle/\" data-widget-id=\"SB_4\" data-ob-template=\"timemag\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHBO\u0026#8217;s latest \u003ca href=\"https://time.com/5646634/succession-season-2-power-rankings/\" \u003ehit show \u003cem\u003eSuccession\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e is not always easy to watch: the characters are spiteful, and the subject matter dark.

But zooming in before you take the shot is not the solution. Digital zoom shots are simply cropped and resized images, unlike the optical zoom functionality you might find on a full-blown camera. Digital zoom will not only yield a grainy image, it will reduce the resolution of the overall photo and exacerbate any vibrations from your hands, leaving you with an inferior representation of that adorable canine. \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eThat includes shots taken on phones with multiple camera lenses, like the iPhone XS or Samsung Galaxy Note 10+. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eIn general, avoid digital zoom as often as possible \u0026mdash; but knock yourself out with the telephoto lens on your smartphone, if it has one. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cb\u003eLook for light before making your own\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eThe flash of an LED light from a smartphone doesn\u0026rsquo;t flatter anyone, no matter what pose you\u0026rsquo;re striking.

I was there to offer some historical background about their city\u0026#8217;s star turn in the drama of the 19th Amendment, while reminding them that the suffrage victory had been woefully incomplete: following ratification, black women (and men) in Jim Crow states like Tennessee were prevented from voting for decades.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut as I prepared to deliver my remarks, I realized that this history lesson was not sufficient.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this centennial year, I told the Rotarians, Nashville and Tennessee will be in the spotlight of the national celebration of the 19th Amendment\u0026mdash;a celebration of women\u0026#8217;s rights and voting rights. Back in 1920, even under enormous pressure from opponents of woman suffrage, the Tennessee legislature \u0026ldquo;did the right thing\u0026rdquo; by (narrowly) ratifying the Amendment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut, I said, recent legislative actions, taken in that same imposing statehouse on the hill, tarnish Tennessee\u0026#8217;s legacy of doing the right thing that summer almost a century ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI saw some raised eyebrows.

You’ve got to understand, I’m operating in a little cocoon. A little microculture of someone who was coming from a well-to-do family, out in the suburbs and in the Catholic institutions where nuns would teach.

Well, I’d been meditating on Jesus my whole life … “If you’re poor, God bless you. You share more in the sufferings of Christ.

On the one hand, the president is deeply convinced that bilateral trade deficits are harmful and therefore aggressive “trade war” measures give him the upper hand. On the other hand, the president follows the stock market closely and keeps seeing that investors don’t share his assessment, which tends to pull him back from the brink. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"3kksv0\"\u003eThe impact on the real world, meanwhile, is less dramatic than the gyrations of the stock market, but it points clearly toward higher taxes on most Americans and an unsettling environment for business investment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"GdOVIa\"\u003eThe trade war so far\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"0H65Kr\"\u003eDating back to well before Trump took office, the United States had a longstanding list of complaints with Chinese economic policy. Some American businesses complain that they are forced into “unfair” competition with Chinese state-owned firms that benefit from government subsidies. Others complain that when they do business in China, Chinese companies steal their intellectual property or the Chinese government forces them into unfavorable joint ventures with Chinese-owned companies. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"GXk8j2\"\u003eThese complaints, when you think about it, are actually rather different from the standard manufacturing community concern that cheap Chinese labor is undercutting American production. US business wants China to change the rules to make it easier to do business there, and most of what the American government is asking for is along those lines. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"EavdUu\"\u003eWhat’s new under Trump is a spirit of confrontation where the president has imposed multiple rounds of taxes — tariffs — on Chinese imports. China has in turn retaliated with curbs on American imports. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"CvM4rO\"\u003eIn standard economic understanding, these tit-for-tat moves simply hurt both countries’ economies. But Trump has often articulated the view that tariffs are good per se, sometimes because China pays the tariffs (it doesn’t) but also sometimes because Trump views the US-China trade deficit as a case of America “losing money” to China (it isn’t). \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"pgxO1w\"\u003eConsequently, Trump’s view is that a total breakdown in US-China trade would hurt China but not America, and thus that threatening such a breakdown should force China to make concessions. His problem is the stock market doesn’t agree. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"Sa7lwo\"\u003eTrump keeps going back and forth\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"9UMmem\"\u003eThere’s no real way to resolve this tension, so instead of resolving it, Trump keeps going backward and forward.

So while it’s true that \u003cem\u003eChina\u003c/em\u003e is under pressure to make a deal, the pressure also pushed on Trump. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"2nSRAx\"\u003ePolitically, however, you can sort of see why Trump finds this approach appealing. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"alQNRD\"\u003eIf at any point the whole underlying dispute \u003cem\u003edoes\u003c/em\u003e get resolved and all the tariffs and counter-tariffs are removed, that will make people very happy. At that point, he can also just assert that whatever concessions he was able to wring out of the Chinese were amazing game changers. That probably won’t be true, but there will be a lot of people disinclined to rock the boat since the resolution of trade tensions as such is good news. But until that happens, he’s likely to keep swaying back and forth, pushed by his desire to ratchet up pressure on China and pulled by the pressure the stock market puts on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"PBDsFP\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv data-analytics-viewport=\"video\" data-analytics-action=\"volume:view:article:middle\" data-analytics-label=\"Trade wars, explained|38657\" data-volume-uuid=\"91104c564\" data-volume-id=\"38657\" data-analytics-placement=\"article:middle\" data-volume-placement=\"article\" data-volume-autoplay=\"false\" id=\"volume-placement-737\" class=\"volume-video\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003c/div\u003e","url":"https://www.vox.com/2019/8/26/20833210/trump-trade-war-table","published":"2019-08-26T15:30:00Z","guid":"https://www.vox.com/2019/8/26/20833210/trump-trade-war-table"},{"title":"How the Taylor Swift-Kanye West VMAs scandal became a perfect American morality tale","content":"\u003cimg alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/srFQJMxiXoR9OLLtY0-AAb8JcyU=/177x0:3000x2117/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/65111239/98165169.jpg.0.jpg\" /\u003e\n\n  \u003csmall\u003eKanye West promises he’ll let Taylor Swift finish at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards. | Getty Images\u003c/small\u003e\n\n  \u003cp\u003eThe fraught legacy of the 2009 VMAs, explained.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp id=\"1MY5cb\"\u003eTen years ago this fall, there came a VMAs moment that will live forever in infamy. It was the moment in which Kanye West stormed the VMAs stage as Taylor Swift attempted to accept her award for Best Video by a Female Artist and told her, “I’mma let you finish, but Beyoncé had one of the best videos of all time! One of the best videos of all time!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"zCtcNA\"\u003eOn one level, the fact that the scandal would go on to have such legs seems absurd. It was such a petty nothing of a moment! A drunk celebrity with a history of being volatile acted out at an awards show: So what? Why was that such a big deal? Why is it so ingrained in our cultural consciousness now, 10 years later? \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"N7IOIp\"\u003eBut the resulting fallout was explosive. What happened at the 2009 VMAs helped define Twitter as the conversation driver it is today. The story foreshadowed Kanye West’s eventual transformation into a pop culture villain, which would be realized with \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/identities/2018/10/11/17961438/kanye-west-donald-trump-racism-white-house\"\u003eWest’s embrace of Donald Trump and Trumpism\u003c/a\u003e.

Kim turned up the heat on the idea that had started to simmer after 2010 and “Innocence” — that Taylor was being manipulative and the turn against Kanye was kind of racist — and brought it to a boil. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003caside id=\"aqh9YU\"\u003e\u003cdiv data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Kim Kardashian’s Taylor Swift-Kanye West Snapchat story, explained\",\"url\":\"https://www.vox.com/2016/7/18/12210858/kim-kardashian-taylor-swift-snapchat-kanye-west\"}]}'\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003cp id=\"lRCS6Z\"\u003eIn July 2016, \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/7/18/12210858/kim-kardashian-taylor-swift-snapchat-kanye-west\"\u003eKim posted a series of videos on Snapchat\u003c/a\u003e that showed Kanye calling Taylor up to ask for her permission to include a verse referencing her in “Famous.” In the video, Kanye clearly reads Taylor the line, “I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex,” and asks for her approval.

In 2009, what mattered in the public discourse was that Taylor had done nothing wrong and that Kanye was rude to her. Readings of the scandal that analyzed its racial politics, \u003ca href=\"https://www.essence.com/news/commentary-racial-politics-of-kanye-west-taylor-swift/\"\u003elike Yolanda Sangweni’s at Essence\u003c/a\u003e, were largely siloed to black media. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"hDHN2k\"\u003eBut in 2016, mainstream media began to talk about whether the whole 2009 VMAs scandal had stuck as hard as it did because it played so neatly into \u003ca href=\"https://nmaahc.si.edu/blog-post/popular-and-pervasive-stereotypes-african-americans\"\u003ethe old racist American nightmare\u003c/a\u003e of the aggressive black man menacing a virginal blonde white girl. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"tYN6jG\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/689zw5/taylor-swift-kanye-west-famous-phone-call\"\u003eVice looked back at Taylor’s 2009 VMA win\u003c/a\u003e as “black excellence thwarted by white mediocrity again” (though it’s worth noting again here that Beyoncé ended up winning the more prestigious award at the end of the night, so Taylor didn’t so much thwart Beyoncé’s undisputed excellence as take home a consolation prize). Vice also noted the iconography of the moment: “Taylor, the innocent white girl, and Kanye, the bullying black demon.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ANCDRh\"\u003eAnd as the racial politics of the 2009 incident came in for new analysis, so did its gender politics.

It’s all there, pressed and squeezed into those 60 breathless seconds, and every time we retell the story, we find new ways to tease out what the moment and its fallout say about us as a culture.

The brand was founded by Krishna Kaliannan, who originally developed its signature dark chocolate cereal as a keto-friendly breakfast food for himself. Kaliannan has been on the diet for about a decade, since shortly after he was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes and epilepsy. (Apart from being the \u003ca href=\"https://www.dietdoctor.com/1-diet-trend-on-google-2018\"\u003emost-Googled diet of 2018\u003c/a\u003e, keto has \u003ca href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25628734\"\u003ebeen shown to\u003c/a\u003e reduce seizures in epilepsy patients who don’t respond to medication.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"msbDaF\"\u003eWhile the brand’s target audience is much broader than the keto community, Kaliannan’s experience with the diet — and its lack of crackers, chips, toast, and pretzels — informed his top priority in creating the cereal: crunchiness. After poring over the science behind what makes foods crispy, he tweaked and re-tweaked the recipe, and, when it came time to pitch the business to investors, he brought along MRI scans of the cereal he’d had made at a cancer lab in New York City to demonstrate his technique.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"aJ1Jnz\"\u003eThis process also helps explain where the name “Catalina Crunch” came from. “After spending a year trying to figure out how to make it maximally crunchy, I’m not leaving crunchiness out of the name,” he says. So far, it’s working: The company has since added three more flavors — cinnamon toast, maple waffle, and honey graham — and now sells more than 2,000 pouches of the cereal a day. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"P4tynZ\"\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B03Rh48jCoK/\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

Each 24-pouch order of Fruity and Cinnamon Bun puffs arrives in a colorful box decked out with phrases like “Growing up is overrated” and the company’s slogan, “Old school cereal made the new way,” a philosophy that co-founder Dylan Kaplan explains as “a throwback to when we were kids and could enjoy cereal without concerns about, ‘Is this healthy? Is this unhealthy?’” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"F6d0Od\"\u003eHe and his partner Helen Guo are lifelong cereal lovers who founded the brand after discovering how few options they had in the grocery store when they tried to cut sugar out of their diets. Looking to differentiate themselves, they talked to friends and potential customers about what they wanted out of their cereal, and found that portability and portion control were near the top of the list. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"UMy96T\"\u003e“When we thought about how we could do things differently, we wanted to think beyond just the cereal itself, but also the packaging,” says Kaplan. “Why does it have to be in a cereal box? It’s been that way for decades, but does it really need to keep being that way? Those were some of the questions we asked ourselves when we were getting started.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"gNh505\"\u003eSelling direct-to-consumer opens up an opportunity that hasn’t historically existed for cereal brands in grocery stores, says Allen Adamson, co-founder of the consulting firm \u003ca href=\"https://www.metaforce.co/\"\u003eMetaforce\u003c/a\u003e and co-author of \u003ca href=\"https://www.shiftaheadbook.com/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eShift Ahead: How the Best Companies Stay Relevant in a Fast-Changing World\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-float-right\"\u003e\u003caside id=\"IWnDc0\"\u003e\u003cq\u003e“In a sea of 500 boxes screaming at you, everyone has to scream louder”\u003c/q\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"pOLo26\"\u003e“If you’re on that shelf today, the reason most of the branding is the same is because they tested, and in a sea of 500 boxes screaming at you, everyone has to scream louder,” he says. “So if you don’t have the big bowl of cereal with the strawberry on top with the milk splashing over it and big letters and big red colors and bumper-sticker-type graphics, you can’t break through.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"aI8CkL\"\u003eOnline, brands can reach potential customers through different channels and speak to how they’re actually eating cereal, which increasingly isn’t just in a bowl for breakfast. A \u003ca href=\"https://www.mintel.com/press-centre/food-and-drink/43-of-us-cereal-consumers-eat-cereal-as-a-snack-at-home\"\u003e2017 Mintel survey\u003c/a\u003e found that 56 percent of millennials eat cereal as a snack at home, while more than one in five 18- to 22-year-olds eats it on the go. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"OnVNG3\"\u003eKaliannan came up with similar findings when his marketing team surveyed more than 250 Catalina Crunch customers. Only about 45 percent said they usually ate the cereal in the morning with milk, a bowl, and a spoon. Others treated it as an afternoon snack, a crunchy topping for bowls or \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BznWAdmFa1a/\"\u003esmoothies\u003c/a\u003e, or even a quick dinner. On Instagram, the brand has also reposted recipes from food bloggers who have used it as an ingredient in \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BzIk99cjH9a/\"\u003ecereal bars\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bya2PLxjtvg/\"\u003eOreo cups\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"f2TG38\"\u003eWhile Catalina Crunch won’t be online-only for long — it’s launching in more than 1,000 stores in January, Kaliannan says — selling direct for the first year has allowed it to establish a customer base without compromising on packaging. The brand uses 9-ounce resealable pouches (sold four at a time) rather than bags-in-boxes because its ingredients demand it, he says, but also because, in conversations with friends, a common complaint was “how damn hard it is to close the damn box after you’ve opened the bag.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"hBvTOC\"\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B0ls6vSFrH2/\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

The founders are still considering pouches and single-serve bags but say they also want to be mindful about packaging waste. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Vk6pfH\"\u003e(For what it’s worth, the boxes I ordered are good for about seven months after delivery, according to their “best before” dates. Because the cereal isn’t stripped of fats like processed grocery store brands, though, it does tend to leave oily stains on the box if — or, rather, when — it spills out of the inside bag.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"bqpxDN\"\u003eBeyond millennials’ eating habits, there’s another reason this new wave of cereals can’t market themselves the same way Kellogg’s might: Their products are way more expensive than a box of Frosted Flakes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"d4BvDp\"\u003eMagic Spoon sells four boxes for $39 (or $1.39 per bowl), Catalina Crunch is $49 for four pouches (or $2.45 per bowl), and the Cereal School’s 24-bag bundles are $49.99 (or $2.08 each). While all offer discounts of between 5 percent and 20 percent for customers who sign up for monthly subscriptions, they’re not in the same ballpark as the $3.64 family-size boxes many Americans buy at their local grocery stores or Walmarts today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-float-left\"\u003e\u003caside id=\"mKzyrc\"\u003e\u003cq\u003eMagic Spoon sells four boxes for $39 (or $1.39 per bowl) and Catalina Crunch is $49 for four pouches (or $2.45 per bowl)\u003c/q\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"p1Krvo\"\u003eThis price discrepancy was unavoidable in order to hold on to product quality, says Kaliannan, whose cereal includes ingredients like organic pea protein, chicory fiber, and turmeric. “I knew this product was going to be more expensive than all the other cereals, just by virtue of how much the ingredients cost.” The brands are all striving to position their cereals as premium products and alternatives to popular millennial breakfast foods like smoothies and granola. On its website, the Cereal School touts the comparison in bold letters: “For the price of a protein bar, we’ve reinvented the sweet and crunchy cereal you love without the sugar and carbs!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"5C5aXA\"\u003eIf the companies are successful in convincing customers to pay a premium for nutrition — whether for themselves, their kids, or both — they’re likely well-positioned for the long run, since people tend to be creatures of habit when it comes to the first meal of the day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ZhAbKn\"\u003e”Cereal, once you get a heavy user ... they have it seven days a week,” says Adamson. “For a food company, everyone looks at lifetime customer value.

Trump argued that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act legally justifies such an order, but the act only allows a president to regulate commerce during a national emergency. It does not allow a president to order companies to close their factories in foreign countries. Trump’s original “order” came shortly after China announced that it planned to react to US tariffs on Chinese goods by imposing new tariffs of 5 to 10 percent on $75 billion worth of US goods. China’s new action and Trump’s “order” triggered a strong reaction in the stock market: The Dow dropped more than 600 points on Friday before Trump’s announcement of his latest tariffs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli id=\"ceAKb0\"\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhom this could hurt: \u003c/strong\u003eAfter Trump’s tweets, the stock of \u003ca href=\"https://recode.cmail20.com/t/d-l-xbtjjt-zyhltlrdy-k/\"\u003eApple\u003c/a\u003e, which is \u003ca href=\"https://recode.cmail20.com/t/d-l-xbtjjt-zyhltlrdy-u/\"\u003edeeply invested in China\u003c/a\u003e, went down by more than 4 percent.

The law extends the statute of limitations for child sexual abuse, giving survivors until age 55 to file civil suits relating to their abuse (previously, New York law gave survivors only until age 23, one of the strictest limits in the country).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"AGLdtG\"\u003e“That extension of the statute of limitations is really fortuitous for Epstein victims, and for any victims in New York,” Bloom said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"0fGDbs\"\u003eSoon after Araoz filed, two women represented by Bloom also filed suit against Epstein’s estate. Their suit “alleges that the victims worked at a New York City restaurant in 2004 when a young adult woman came to them, offering them hundreds of dollars and future economic opportunities if they would simply go to Mr. Epstein’s home and give him a massage,” Bloom said in a statement to media. “Once at Mr. Epstein’s New York home, they were assaulted.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"NgrEQF\"\u003eThe women were 18 and 20 at the time, they say.

Her office is currently vetting their allegations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"NYfLQD\"\u003eAnd this week, three more women filed suit against Epstein’s estate, \u003ca href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/jeffrey-epstein-new-lawsuits-against-estate-say-financier-forcibly-used-sex-toys-on-victims-took-passports?via=newsletter\u0026amp;source=DDAfternoon\"\u003eaccording to the Daily Beast\u003c/a\u003e. One, identified in court papers as “Katlyn Doe,” says that Epstein coerced her into marrying “a non-United States citizen and recruiter of females for Jeffrey Epstein” so that the recruiter could stay in the country.

No one else has yet been charged in connection with allegations of sexual abuse and trafficking by Epstein — but, former federal prosecutor Daniel C.

Winter is the president of the \u003ca href=\"http://w2.parentstv.org\"\u003eParents Television Council\u003c/a\u003e, a nonpartisan advocacy group that lobbies the entertainment industry against marketing graphic violence to children. He spent several years overseeing MGM’s former video game publishing division, MGM Interactive, and moved into advocacy when he became a parent. Growing up, his children played all kinds of video games, except for those he considered too graphic or violent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"cESolK\"\u003eIn a phone interview, Winter told me his view aligns with the research supporting links between games and aggression. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"bOKNB0\"\u003e“Anyone who uses the term ‘moral panic’ in my view is trying to diminish a bona fide conversation that needs to take place,” Winter said. “It’s a simple PR move to refute something that might actually have some value in the broader conversation.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"LTQPqM\"\u003eDuring our conversation, he compared the connection between violent media and harmful real-world effects to that between cigarettes and lung cancer. If you consume in moderation, he argues, you’ll probably be fine; but, over time, exposure to violent media can have “a cumulative negative effect.” (In fact, \u003ca href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2865193/\"\u003estudies of infrequent smokers\u003c/a\u003e have shown that their risk of coronary disease is roughly equal to that of frequent smokers, and their risk of cancer is still significantly higher than that of nonsmokers.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"pK0z1g\"\u003e“What I believe to be true is that the media we consume has a very powerful impact on shaping our belief structure, our cognitive development, our values, and our opinions,” he said. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Ac4i59\"\u003eHe added that it would be foolish to point to any one act of violence and say it was caused by any one video game — that, he argued, “would be like saying lung cancer was caused by that one specific cigarette I smoked.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"IGZiAd\"\u003e“But if you are likely to smoke packs a day over the course of many years, it has a cumulative negative effect on your health,” he continued. “I believe based on the research on both sides that that’s the prevailing truth.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"C4OONI\"\u003eThe debate endures because gun control isn’t being addressed — and games are an easy target\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"rpEmfF\"\u003eLike many people I spoke with for this story, Winter believes that the debate about gun violence has remained largely at a standstill since Columbine, while the number of mass shootings nationwide has continued to increase. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"TXmrVx\"\u003e“If you look at the broader issue of gun violence in America, you have a number of organizations and constituencies pointing at different causes,” he said. “When you look back at what those arguments are, it’s the same arguments that have been made going back to Columbine. Whether it’s gun control, whether it’s mental illness, whether it’s violence in media culture — whatever the debate is about those three root causes, very little progress has been made on any of them.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"I2hlqA\"\u003eThe glorification of violence is so culturally embedded in American media through TV, film, games, books, and practically every other available medium that there seems to be very little impetus to change anything about America’s gun culture.

Yet the spree shooting phenomenon seems to be seriously and uniquely a US issue right now. It’s also worth noting that the ratings systems across these countries vary, and in the case of Europe, are often more liberal in many regards than the US system,” Garriss said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"BjzZ6l\"\u003eHe also pointed out that this conversation frequently overshadows the important, innovative work that many games are engaged in. “Games like \u003cem\u003eStardew Valley\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eMinecraft\u003c/em\u003e, or \u003cem\u003eJourney\u003c/em\u003e craft experiences that help people relax, detox after a day, bond with friends,” he said. “Games like \u003cem\u003ePapers, Please\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eThat Dragon Cancer\u003c/em\u003e, or \u003cem\u003eLife Is Strange\u003c/em\u003e interrogate the harder and the darker elements of the human experience like love, grief, loneliness, and death.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"fQeZPB\"\u003eIn other words, a conversation that focuses on games and guns alone dismisses the vital cultural role that video games play as art. “Play video games and you can jump on giant mushrooms, shoot a wizard on the moon, grow a farm, fall in love, experience nearly infinite worlds really,” Garriss told me. “If games have a unifying organizing principle, I’d say it’s to delight. The pursuit of fun.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"DCjD3J\"\u003eHe continued: “To me, the tragedy, if there is one, in the current discourse around video games and violence, lies in failing to see the magic happening in the play. As devs, it’s a magic we’re chasing with every game. And as players, I think it’s a magic that has not just the potential but the actual power to bring people together, to aid mental health, to make us think, to help us heal. And to experience delight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"YUVgfB\"\u003eBut for some members of the public, games’ recreational, relaxational, and artistic values might be another thing that make them suspect. “If they don’t play games or ‘aged out of it,’ they might see them as frivolous or a waste of time,” Cypheroftyr says. “It’s easy to go, ‘Oh, you’re still playing video games? Why are you wasting your life?’” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"HUzGct\"\u003eThat idea — that video games are a waste of time — is another longstanding element of cultural assumptions around games of all kinds, Clark, the game developer, told me. “Games have been an easy target in every era because there’s something inherently unproductive or even anti-productive about them, and so there’s also a long history of game designers trying to rehabilitate games and make them ‘do work’ or provide instruction.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"NRugKF\"\u003eAll of this makes it incredibly easy to fixate on video games instead of addressing difficult but more relevant targets, like NRA funding and easy access to guns. And that, in turn, makes it a complicated proposition to extricate video games from conversations about gun violence, let alone limit the conversation around violent games to people who might actually be in a position to create change, like the people who make the games in the first place. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Eyo5PU\"\u003eYet what’s striking when you drill down into the community around gaming is how many gamers agree with many of the arguments politicians are making. As a fan of shooter games, Cypheroftyr told me she routinely plays violent games like \u003cem\u003eCall of Duty \u003c/em\u003eand the military action role-playing game (RPG) \u003cem\u003eThe Division\u003c/em\u003e. “I’m not out here trying to murder people,” she stressed. But like the Parents Television Council’s Winter, Cypheroftyr and many of the other people I spoke with agree that the gaming industry needs to do a lot more to examine the at times shocking imagery it perpetuates. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"coZAnn\"\u003eMany members of the gaming community are already discussing game violence\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"joe0ao\"\u003eMultiple people I spoke with expressed frustration that the conversation about video games’ role in mass shootings is obscuring another, very important conversation to be had within the gaming community about violent games.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"3QUKYF\"\u003eClark told me that the public’s lack of nuance and an insistence on a binary reading of the issue is part of the problem. “Most people are capable of understanding that causes are complex,” she said, “that you can’t just point to one thing and say, ‘This is mostly or entirely to blame!’” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"X9ndGw\"\u003eBut she also cautioned that the gaming community’s reactionary defensiveness to this lack of nuance also prevents many video game fans from acknowledging that games do play a role within a violent culture. “That complexity cuts both ways,” she told me. “Even though it’s silly to say that ‘games cause violence,’ it’s also just as silly to say that games have nothing to do with a culture that has a violence problem.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-float-right\"\u003e\u003caside id=\"wdITvs\"\u003e\u003cq\u003e“Even though it’s silly to say that ‘games cause violence,’ it’s also just as silly to say that games have nothing to do with a culture that has a violence problem” —game developer Naomi Clark\u003c/q\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Ynyzyk\"\u003eThat culture is endemic to the gaming industry, added Justin Carter, a freelance journalist whose work focuses on video games and culture. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Vlk3GM\"\u003e“The industry does have a fetishization of guns and violence,” Carter said. “You look at games like \u003cem\u003eBorderlands\u003c/em\u003e or \u003cem\u003eDestiny\u003c/em\u003e and one of the selling points is how many guns there are.”  The upcoming first-person shooter game \u003cem\u003eBorderlands 3\u003c/em\u003e, he pointed out, \u003ca href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/borderlands-3/billion-guns\"\u003eboasts “over a billion” different guns\u003c/a\u003e from its 12 fictional \u003ca href=\"https://borderlands.fandom.com/wiki/Manufacturer\"\u003eweapons manufacturers\u003c/a\u003e, all of which tout special perks to get players to try their guns.

This waste is causing most of the problems we have—of biodiversity, climate change, and depletion of resources.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEcologists say that it’s our lifestyles that are destroying the planet. I believe the completely inefficient systems we still use are more to blame. We’re very proud to have the latest smartphone, but everything else we use is built off infrastructure that was invented in 1880 at the beginning of the oil era. It’s a shame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo today the goal is not just to go into the future. The goal is to bring the world out of the past and into the present.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=\"pull-quote\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"quote-line\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eLet’s stop speaking about the problems.

Flying around the world was simply a way to demonstrate that you can do the so-called impossible with renewable energies and clean technologies.

You should be inspired by all the solutions that can solve the problem. So let’s stop speaking about the problems. What are the solutions?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I successfully landed the Solar Impulse in Abu Dhabi after circumnavigating the world, everyone said, “Okay, it’s the end of the adventure. The story is finished.” But the story starts where the adventure ends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause at this moment, the goal is no longer success. The success is just the step that allows you to go higher, to go further, to have more credibility, to have more visibility, to be able to inspire people, and to be able to change the world a little bit more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo what did we do after this phase? We moved it into a very practical one. \u003ca href=\"https://solarimpulse.com/\"\u003eThe Solar Impulse Foundation\u003c/a\u003e was launched, with the challenge to identify 1,000 solutions that can protect the environment in a profitable way. They could be technology products and devices, infrastructures, or systems. You have projects that save water and energy, devices that produce electricity with waste, and new industrial processes that use 99% less water. You have concepts for more natural agriculture, smart grids, and energy-efficiency hardware. It’s absolutely incredible what exists today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=\"pull-quote\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"quote-line\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWhat we’re lacking today is not the technology: It is the ambition of the decision-makers to make it happen.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"quote-line\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003eNearly 2,000 companies have joined up and are starting to pitch solutions. These solutions then get reviewed by different experts who assess their technical feasibility, because there is also some bullshit. We will only take what works—what works \u003cem\u003etoday\u003c/em\u003e. We then assess the solutions under the angle of how they protect the environment over their entire life cycle, and then we work out if they can be profitable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s very important to speak the language of the people you want to convince. That’s the only way to influence the key decision makers. Because if you just talk about protecting the environment, a lot of people will tell you it’s expensive: “We don’t know how to do it, and we have huge investments to depreciate, so we cannot change anything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo is it possible for the company who produces that solution to make money? Is it possible for the consumer to also have a financial interest in the solution? For example, if you recover the hot water from a shower that is lost, to heat the hot water coming to the shower, you save half a dollar for each shower. If this system cost $300, it would quickly be profitable for a family or two or three people in just a few months.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe now have just passed 200 solutions that we’ve proven to be profitable. Our goal is to go to all the heads of states and leaders of big corporations, and show them what exists today. Because the big problem is that the legal framework is based on old assumptions. If we show what’s possible today, we can motivate the industry makers to enormously change the legal framework, and go in that direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo when you hear about huge problems we face today with environment, know that a lot of solutions exist. What we’re lacking today is not the technology: It is the ambition of the decision-makers to make it happen. We have people leading the world who are exactly the opposite of explorers: People who are lazy, who are selfish, and who have a short-term view. They have no idea of all the potential and the resources that mankind can find.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe goal is to change the world. And explorers can do it. We’re not exploring the South Pole or the North Pole, and we’re not exploring the Moon. We’re exploring solutions. We’re exploring the ingenuity, the smartness, the innovation, and the creativity of human kind.

PMDD manifests in the days or even weeks leading up to patients’ menstrual cycle, but is distinct from PMS in that the symptoms are so severe that it impairs patients’ ability to function. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e PMDD, which affects less than 8 percent of women, doesn’t feel like the “slowness and sadness of depression,” said Chloe Caldwell, a 33-year-old writer who is working on a memoir about PMDD called \u003ci\u003e The Red Zone: A Love Story.\u003c/i\u003e For her, she said, “It's more like a physical sensation...an altered reality; not seeing things clearly.”\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e Vivien K. Burt, a psychiatrist at UCLA, said there is one, relatively new treatment for the condition doctors agree is most effective: fluoxetine, colloquially known as the antidepressant Prozac, which is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). \u003ca href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2013/10/22/223805027/should-disabling-premenstrual-symptoms-be-a-mental-disorder\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFluoxetine was approved by the FDA to treat PMDD in 2000, \u003c/a\u003ebut PMDD wasn’t included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) until 2013. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e Even now, not all patients with PMDD are aware of the condition or this means of treating it, nor are all the doctors that treat them. That’s in part because prescribing an SSRI for PMS falls under a relatively new and lesser-known field called reproductive psychiatry, focused on psychiatric conditions associated with hormonal challenges and reproductive events. But like other women’s health fields, and mental health issues, reproductive psychiatry has struggled to gain acceptance and integrate in mainstream medicine.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e Burt founded the \u003ca href=\"https://www.semel.ucla.edu/mood/service/general/womens-life-center\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWomen’s Life Center at UCLA\u003c/a\u003e back in 1993.The reproductive psychiatry center, staffed by a small group of medical providers, treat conditions like PMS and PMDD as well as postpartum depression and perimenopause. At Burt’s center, providers use a “symptoms rating chart” to diagnose PMDD versus PMS versus other conditions, like major depression, that are simply exacerbated during the menstrual cycle. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e “We ask patients to complete charts on a daily basis, which record all of those symptoms,” she said. “We try to do that for at least a couple of months.” The team can then use the charts to see how the symptoms are linked to a patient’s menstrual cycle.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e Even filling out those charts is extraordinarily helpful for patients. Once patients themselves begin to see that there may or may not be a regularity to their emotional complaints, they “then can decide that they're not going to pay bills on the pre menstrual days, or not get into a major discussion with a partner,” said Burt. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"article__pull-quote\"\u003eOnly 59% of residency programs require any level of training in reproductive psychiatry.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e Since Caldwell was diagnosed with PMDD, her doctor has recommended many ways to treat it, including, for example, attempting to balance her hormones by sticking to a \u003ca href=\"https://www.shape.com/healthy-eating/diet-tips/whole-30-diet-benefits\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e“Whole 30” \u003c/a\u003e style diet from when she begins menstruating up until her period. Since she began taking Prozac, she said, the symptoms have “shrunk.” “So it'll be like half a day. Whereas before, I could have it for like six days.” Still, she does a variety of exercises to deal with it, like yoga and breathing exercises with her therapist, as well as planning around her PMDD when it comes to important discussions. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e The American Psychiatric Association and the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology—the body that certifies psychiatrists and neurologists as qualified to practice—have yet to recognize reproductive psychiatry as an official sub-specialty. In 2015, the National Task Force on Women’s Reproductive Mental Health, founded in 2013,\u003ca href=\"https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1176/appi.ajp.2015.15060837\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e surveyed psychiatric residency directors\u003c/a\u003e and found “that only 59% of residency programs require any level of training in reproductive psychiatry and that only 36% believe all residents need to be competent in the field.” \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e “This is part of a general lag in addressing the needs (medical and psychiatric) for women,” said Burt. “Only since the end of the 1990's has the dearth of research into gender-specific medical and mental health issues been given the attention that it needs.” But, she said, the medical community is now starting to better understand that medical needs can be “influenced by gender”—possibly because \u003ca href=\"https://news.aamc.org/press-releases/article/applicant-enrollment-2017/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"article__embed article__embed--vice\" data-related-article=\"true\"\u003e\u003ciframe src=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/embed/article/wjeeam/living-with-pms-that-makes-you-want-to-die?utm_source=stylizedembed_vice.com\u0026utm_campaign=ywavzm\u0026site=vice\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:0px none;margin:0px;\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://news.aamc.org/press-releases/article/applicant-enrollment-2017/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emore and more women are becoming doctors. \u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e Burt and other psychiatrists are working to give reproductive psychiatry the official recognition they believe the field deserves. Their efforts are working. The National Taskforce on Women’s Reproductive Mental Health is currently working to create a national, web-based curriculum that will increase access to education on reproductive psychiatry. Burt hopes that eventually these efforts will lead to an official reproductive psychiatry subspecialty. Once this happens, every psychiatry student in the country will be required “to recognize disorders associated with reproductive issues in women and...be able to treat them,” Burt said. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e Caldwell, whose memoir talks about this treatment, hopes for the sake of others with PMDD that this happens soon. She said she was only able to figure out that she had PMDD and that Prozac was a possible solution because her therapist had PMDD herself and told her to ask her doctor for her prescription. “Otherwise, I think I would have been really screwed,” she said. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e But now that Caldwell understands her condition and is receiving treatment, her outlook has changed. The upside, she said, is that she should do a lot of these things anyway. “What's good about it, like kind of a gift in a way, is it really does teach you to take care of yourself,” she said. Proper treatment for PMDD has allowed Caldwell to see her condition as a blessing, not a curse—and as the field of reproductive psychiatry grows, perhaps others PMDD sufferers can make this transition, too. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/page/sign-up-for-the-vice-newsletter\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e Sign up for our newsletter\u003c/a\u003e to get the best of VICE delivered to your inbox daily. \u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","url":"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ywavzm/prozac-might-be-the-key-to-relieving-pmdd","published":"2019-08-26T15:04:32Z","guid":"ywavzm"},{"title":"20,000 AT\u0026T Employees Are Striking","content":"\u003cp\u003e More than 20,000 AT\u0026T employees are striking, the Communication Workers of America union (CWA) announced over the weekend.

But zooming in before you take the shot is not the solution. Digital zoom shots are simply cropped and resized images, unlike the optical zoom functionality you might find on a full-blown camera. Digital zoom will not only yield a grainy image, it will reduce the resolution of the overall photo and exacerbate any vibrations from your hands, leaving you with an inferior representation of that adorable canine. \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eThat includes shots taken on phones with multiple camera lenses, like the iPhone XS or Samsung Galaxy Note 10+. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eIn general, avoid digital zoom as often as possible \u0026mdash; but knock yourself out with the telephoto lens on your smartphone, if it has one. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cb\u003eLook for light before making your own\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eThe flash of an LED light from a smartphone doesn\u0026rsquo;t flatter anyone, no matter what pose you\u0026rsquo;re striking.

I was there to offer some historical background about their city\u0026#8217;s star turn in the drama of the 19th Amendment, while reminding them that the suffrage victory had been woefully incomplete: following ratification, black women (and men) in Jim Crow states like Tennessee were prevented from voting for decades.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut as I prepared to deliver my remarks, I realized that this history lesson was not sufficient.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this centennial year, I told the Rotarians, Nashville and Tennessee will be in the spotlight of the national celebration of the 19th Amendment\u0026mdash;a celebration of women\u0026#8217;s rights and voting rights. Back in 1920, even under enormous pressure from opponents of woman suffrage, the Tennessee legislature \u0026ldquo;did the right thing\u0026rdquo; by (narrowly) ratifying the Amendment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut, I said, recent legislative actions, taken in that same imposing statehouse on the hill, tarnish Tennessee\u0026#8217;s legacy of doing the right thing that summer almost a century ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI saw some raised eyebrows.

We have our staff, our regional directors that help identify students.

Any parent or grandparent or aunt or uncle or student who may be listening to the podcast, if they go to join.isi.org, they can sign up and get an intellectual starter kit, which includes a book from Russell Kirk and some other material, as well as Modern Age, which is an intellectual journal we\u0026#8217;ve got, and some regular updates on conservative thought, both from economics, policy, philosophy, and politics.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVirginia Allen: That\u0026#8217;s great. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWell, you\u0026#8217;ve now served as ISI\u0026#8217;s president since 2016, after a career in politics and business.

We were founded in 1953, and our first president was William F. Buckley Jr. We\u0026#8217;ve got some big shoes to fill over those many, many years. He started ISI, or became the first president, after writing his book \u0026#8220;God and Man at Yale,\u0026#8221; in which Bill Buckley pointed out, and, again, this is 1953, that the campus culture was being increasingly dominated by a progressive, secular, left-leaning faculty elite. So he started this, and we\u0026#8217;ve been working away at it ever since.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eFlash forward to today, where, as I mentioned, we\u0026#8217;ve got almost 3,000 faculty associates that we work with, we\u0026#8217;ve got 100 societies on campus, we run almost 200 lectures and debates every year. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhat we\u0026#8217;re looking for is, again, that really bright, deep-thinking, intellectually curious conservative or libertarian thinker who\u0026#8217;s going to go on when they graduate and be a leader somewhere. They\u0026#8217;re going to be a leader in their community, a leader in their state, a leader in the country, and maybe that\u0026#8217;s in business or maybe it\u0026#8217;s in politics, maybe it\u0026#8217;s in the law.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eThe founders of The Federalist Society that have done such a great job identifying and promoting conservative justices were all ISI alumni. Two members of the Supreme Court, Sam Alito and Neil Gorsuch, both participated in ISI programming when they were on college campus. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI could go on and on with the number of folks that you and I would would all know out there that went through ISI programming.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eWe want to identify those kids because we firmly believe that one person with courage and intellect makes a majority \u0026#8230; We know they have the courage and we know that they\u0026#8217;re bright, and we want to make sure they understand where these root and foundational principles come from and why they are still appropriate to today\u0026#8217;s culture, to today\u0026#8217;s society, to today\u0026#8217;s world—as a matter of fact, they\u0026#8217;re more important today than ever—and why these are the tickets that will continue to make Americans, and frankly, the rest of the world, prosper and grow.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBluey: Charlie, thanks so much for sharing that impact that you\u0026#8217;re having. One of the things that I think is fascinating is the involvement you have on such a deep level on so many college campuses across this country. As you talk to students, or maybe some faculty in certain cases, what issues do you hear coming up over and over again today that our listeners should be aware of?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCopeland:\u003c/strong\u003e There are a handful of issues, and they revolve around, as you might imagine, things like free speech. They revolve around intellectual diversity. They revolve around feeling that you are able to espouse and debate the ideas that you believe are correct. Maybe you find out that they\u0026#8217;re not, but they\u0026#8217;re afraid to necessarily even raise those points. It\u0026#8217;s gone beyond just sort of this, \u0026#8221; \u0026#8230; I don\u0026#8217;t want to look like I\u0026#8217;m the only one in the class,\u0026#8221; to, in many cases, a fear of property and physical safety.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eWe, last year, identified what we thought were five of the most compelling activities of suppression of free speech, and that suppression of free speech came not only from fellow students, which were probably the least frequent suppressive activities, but from the faculty or the administrations themselves. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026#8217;s what I think is much newer today, over the last 20 years, than you might\u0026#8217;ve seen previously on college campus, is the administration and the faculty themselves really driving a dogma and a perception down to students that, if you don\u0026#8217;t parrot back to us what we\u0026#8217;ve said to you, we will affect your grades, we\u0026#8217;ll affect what courses you can get into, we\u0026#8217;ll affect what housing you might even get into, because the administrations and the faculty have significant leverage over students. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is a power structure, and our students are the ones that are on the receiving end of that.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eThen sometimes you wind up with the Antifas of the world and groups like that that are physically assaulting students, but it really is the universities themselves that have created bureaucracies that are trying to stamp out conservative or libertarian or free thought.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAllen: One of the key debates among young people and across America right now is gun control. When you speak with students on this issue, what are some of their concerns?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCopeland:\u003c/strong\u003e The average student that we work with is not all that worried about gun control writ large, other than they believe in the Second Amendment and the right to bear arms. Obviously, they\u0026#8217;re as affected as the rest of us are by these instances of mass shootings that get so much publicity. \u0026#8230;\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eAgain, our students are really bright, insightful young people, and they know it is not a soundbite issue. Whenever anybody says, \u0026#8220;Oh, well, I\u0026#8217;m just for commonsense gun reform,\u0026#8221; well, what does that even mean? It\u0026#8217;s when they start saying, \u0026#8220;Well, we should do this or that,\u0026#8221; that all of a sudden common sense disappears, and our students recognize that.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eWe\u0026#8217;ve had students, even over the summer, write in some of our student journals editorials that are research-based across the board talking about, is this a mental health issue or is this a broader denigration of our culture issue? Should we have red laws? Should we not? What is the impact of these shootings versus the impact of just being on a college campus? \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eEvery year on every college campus, there are acts of violence that do not get the coverage that a single grotesque act does, like Dayton or El Paso. And both Dayton and El Paso, as we all know, were conducted by individuals that had very different worldviews, although they both believed in the green agenda. But that\u0026#8217;s not what was driving them. It was an anger, as far as I can tell, about American culture.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eOur students, I think, very much understand that, to a certain extent, because they are in an area of culture on the college campus that is not the \u0026#8220;preferred culture\u0026#8221; by the administration and the faculty. They understand the harshness that now occurs and how social media creates a pile-on mentality. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI think that they\u0026#8217;re very thoughtful and they\u0026#8217;re very upset, but they don\u0026#8217;t believe that you\u0026#8217;re just going to solve this by snapping your fingers and saying, \u0026#8220;Well, if we had \u0026#8216;red flag laws\u0026#8217; and identified folks with mental health issues \u0026#8230; \u0026#8221; because much gun violence is not committed by people with mental health issues, but they are people that are disconnected from society. Our students see that connection as directly as anybody else because they\u0026#8217;re outnumbered on campus so significantly.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBluey: Charlie, it\u0026#8217;s so refreshing to hear you talk about the students having a principled point of view, and value for the founding principles of this country, and also the critical thinking skills to hopefully decipher what they hear about and read about.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eWe\u0026#8217;re already here at the beginning of the the academic year and hearing stories about the political correctness on college campuses. We just had on The Daily Signal Podcast Penny Nance talking about her and her own son\u0026#8217;s experience at Virginia Tech, for instance. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat advice do you have for parents who might be looking to ISI or to you personally for advice on some of the things that they\u0026#8217;re hearing about on their children\u0026#8217;s college campuses and how maybe the values that are reflected from those administrators stand in such stark contrast with those of their own family? What do you have to say to them?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCopeland:\u003c/strong\u003e First, I would say to them, have their son or daughter go to join.isi.org, and make sure that that they\u0026#8217;re tied into an intellectual community of bright, deep-thinking kids that are national in scope, and also involved in that community are our faculty associates across the country. And thirdly, involved in that community is our alumni base, which goes back decades. We\u0026#8217;ve got alumni in almost every community around the country. That would be No. 1, join.isi.org.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eThe next thing I would certainly do is reach out to every campus \u0026#8230; Our faculty associates are on 37% of college campuses, and most of those are on the elite schools, the large state schools, as well as some of the smaller liberal arts colleges. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo, there are conservative faculty members that are there, and reach out to us and get the name of who that faculty member is and go talk to them.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eIn addition to that, one of the questions I would ask that faculty member is, \u0026#8220;Who are the other faculty members that may not be conservative on this campus, but who value viewpoint diversity and are good teachers?\u0026#8221; Because there are good teachers on the left who recognize that no ideology or no set of beliefs has all the answers to all the questions that face society. If we had those answers, we would have solved them by now. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo, who are the good professors that will challenge you and make you think, even if those professors come from the left? Because there\u0026#8217;s value in hearing and debating that type of viewpoint.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eThe last piece is identify other students who are not \u0026#8230; There\u0026#8217;s these radical, dogmatic, left-leaning students who aren\u0026#8217;t really there to learn, but they\u0026#8217;re there to threaten and cajole. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can do well on almost every college campus across this country, but when you are a conservative or a libertarian and you want to try to investigate those intellectual backgrounds, you have to do more work, and you have to be very focused on what you do and avoid the useless courses that really junk up most college curriculum at this point in time.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eThe other thing is you need to have a sense of humor. It is so easy to be outraged at some of the, really, just childish things that other students and faculty and, honestly, the administration will do. If you let it eat you up and let it get you angry, you\u0026#8217;re playing their game.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eRoger Scruton is going to be speaking at our annual dinner. Well, he\u0026#8217;s leaving a video message for us. He\u0026#8217;s ill. But he talks about finding beauty in the world. I think that is something that conservatives do much better than liberals, is look and identify true beauty, not just this passing fad. I think that if we\u0026#8217;re happy warriors who identify the right professors and the right students, you will be successful.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAllen: I love that expression, happy warriors. Thank you for sharing that.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eYou mentioned social media and how ISI is adapting to the way students get information today. What are some ways conservatives can more effectively communicate with Gen Z and with other young people?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCopeland:\u003c/strong\u003e I think that everybody hangs out in Twitter, and Twitter is a little bit of an outrage factory. It\u0026#8217;s designed to be that way. You can\u0026#8217;t have deep intellectual discourse in 280 characters or less. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#8217;s fun to participate there and be there and that kind of stuff, but if you really want true discussion and discourse, social media is not the place to do that. \u0026#8230; \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou look at some of these folks who founded social media companies, and they clearly are not very good at interpersonal relationships, which is probably why they created computer programs to handle their interpersonal relationships for them.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eIf you really want to have discourse, you\u0026#8217;ve got to go do that in person. You\u0026#8217;ve got to go to an election. You\u0026#8217;ve got to go to a debate. You have to have a discussion group or a reading group. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI would use social media largely to try to create those events and those opportunities to sit down with one, two, five, 20 other people and talk about the deep ideas and how to apply them to today\u0026#8217;s community and culture.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBluey: Charlie, I\u0026#8217;m so glad to hear you say that.

Wildfires are a naturally occurring phenomenon that scientists say are growing more common and more devastating as global temperatures increase. But the Amazon\u0026#8217;s fires are not an act of nature gone awry. Instead, the blaze was caused by intentional efforts to clear the land for ranching and farming \u0026#8212; efforts that have spiraled out of hand.

It has become the standard development practice irrespective of the size of the business and across a range of industry verticals. The healthcare industry which historically has been a laggard when it comes to adopting new technologies is quickly catching pace and has started to see the advantages of hosting healthcare data in the cloud using DevOps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eManaging compliance in healthcare software\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere has been a huge surge in the amount of healthcare data being generated in recent times. Apart from the EMRs and EHRs, there has been a tremendous increase in the amount of healthcare-related data produced by the health monitoring devices and other health applications as well.\u003cbr /\u003e\nCompliance with the regulations is a must when storing health data. The sensitive patient data is subject to several laws and regulations like HIPAA, HITECH, GDPR and so on. With new and stringent compliance norms being rolled out and increasingly aware consumers who are alert about their privacy and data safety, adherence to the data compliance norms decidedly takes the main stage when dealing with healthcare software development.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat is HIPAA?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHIPAA or the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act is a legislation by the government of the United States that provides provisions for data privacy and security of sensitive patient data and safeguarding medical information.\u003cbr /\u003e\nThe act aims at modernizing the flow of healthcare information and protecting any personally identifiable information maintained by healthcare providers, insurers or any associated organization.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWhy take the DevOps approach for ensuring HIPAA compliance?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe benefits of DevOps for organizations are multifold. By correctly applying the DevOps principles, you ensure that your organization starts off on the right foot for ensuring compliance. Instead of worrying about compliance after the application development phase is completed, following the DevOps practices necessitates the incorporation of compliance into the pipeline right from the beginning of the development process.\u003cbr /\u003e\nSince DevOps breaks down the silos that exist between the development and operations teams, it brings everyone together to think of compliance to norms. Unlike traditional processes where the only people worrying about HIPAA compliance are the members of the security team and possibly the lawyers, DevOps offers the opportunity to every team member from developers to testers to the IT ops guys, to work collaboratively and become stakeholders for ensuring compliance to the HIPAA norms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAutomating the process to ensure HIPAA compliance has the potential to improve the speed, security and reliability to the norms stated. Moving data and workflows to the cloud gives you accessibility to data and promotes interoperability but the security of cloud-hosted data remains a challenge. Ensuring that the data stored on cloud stays HIPAA compliant is a challenge that DevOps can make manageable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eHow to automate HIPAA compliant hosting using DevOps\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAutomating a secure cloud-based healthcare organization has much more to it than simply choosing a HIPAA compliant cloud service provider. In addition to covering the prerequisites for HIPAA compliant hosting, you also need to ensure that the security of the sensitive patient data is given due importance. Taking the DevOps approach in software development can facilitate compliance by design.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eDesign the process for incorporating security\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the traditional development practices, the security team’s role came into the picture at the end of the development cycle which lasted for months or even years. The healthcare applications that work on the DevOps principles have a much higher development velocity than the traditional development cycles. The security review at the end of the development cycle no longer suffices. It has to be baked into the process itself.\u003cbr /\u003e\nInfusing an aspect of security into the DevOps process, popularly termed as DevSecOps, requires a shift in the mindset when developing healthcare applications. Security needs to become a shared responsibility with an end to end integration approach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecurity needs to be considered right from the beginning when designing the application infrastructure. Automation of the security gateways is another important component for ensuring that the DevOps workflows do not slow down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSecure coding\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\nDevelopers have access to tools such as open-source code vulnerability scanners and static code analyzers which are capable of testing the code for security lapses as soon as the changes are manifested. With secure coding in place, the errors are caught earlier and rectified sooner resulting in greater compliance and a more secure database.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVersion control\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\nApplication development with version control requires the developers to periodically check in the changes they made to a common repository. This ensures that every member of the team has access to the latest version of the application. It also helps with automated deployments and DevOps results in a more secure development process. This also brings transparency into the process by ensuring that the changes made to the application are clearly reflected in the system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eContinuous Integration\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\nOnce version control is established, continuous integration results in an automated build as the code changes get checked in. Unit tests and early feedback ensures that the code and its related resources are integrated regularly and the teams can detect problems, if any, at an earlier stage. In case any particular build fails, the teams can fix the errors and re-test it allowing a stable build to be always available.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRelease management\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\nThe deployment and release of the artifacts need to be done against a staging database.

And it turns out that there is this really good technology for that. It\u0026#8217;s called Kubernetes. So being able to bring a Kubernetes control plane to Vsphere is creating a new set of experiences for traditional VMware customers that is moving much closer to a kind of cloud-like agile infrastructure type of experience. At the same time, Vsphere is bringing a whole bunch of capabilities to Kubernetes that\u0026#8217;s creating more efficient isolation capabilities,\u0026#8221; he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen you think about the cloud native vision, it has always been about enabling companies to manage resources wherever they live through a single lens, and this is what this set of capabilities that VMware has brought together under Tanzu, is intended to do. \u0026#8220;Kubernetes is a way of bringing a control metaphor to modern IT processes.

Sprave claims YouTube folded to this pressure by changing its rules around monetization. For its part, YouTube doesn’t seem to disagree: there’s content that’s deemed acceptable on the site but not acceptable for advertisers to run ads against.

But the specific ways its content is compartmentalized might be divisive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"U0O5pk\"\u003eThe density difference makes sense: in 2018, Netflix had approximately 1,570 TV shows and 4,000 movies available for streaming. At launch, Disney+ will have approximately 500 movies and 7,000 individual TV episodes. But whereas Netflix can feel like disorganized chaos, every section of Disney+ is broken down into its own pocket, like Apple TV. Sitting down for a hands-on Disney+ preview at D23, Disney’s biennial convention in Anaheim, California — just across the street from Disneyland — the difference between Netflix and Disney+ couldn’t have been clearer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"HNmr3k\"\u003eIn part, that’s because Disney’s upcoming service has different goals. “From a technical level or UI level, I haven’t really compared it to Netflix,” Michael Paull, Disney’s streaming services president, told \u003cem\u003eThe Verge.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"1VIGXt\"\u003e“As a principle, we wanted a simple, elegant experience,” Paull said. “We want to make this easy. We don’t want the product to get in the way of the content.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-float-right\"\u003e\u003caside id=\"eSpPfP\"\u003e\u003cq\u003e“We don’t want the product to get in the way of the content.”\u003c/q\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"1HwTs3\"\u003e“Simple” may be the best word to describe Disney+. Its interface divides content into rows that people can scroll through based on personalized recommendations, new releases, and curated selections. The top row of the app has a carousel with a few priority titles to scroll through, including new theatrical releases Disney wants to highlight (\u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/5/18251874/captain-marvel-review-marvel-mcu-brie-larson-samuel-l-jackson\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eCaptain Marvel\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e \u003c/em\u003eshowed up on my demo) and Disney+ originals. There’s also a row for featured shows and movies that will be curated in-house, according to Paull. Right now, it’s mostly comprised of big theatrical releases and Disney classics, but that could change, Paull said. In the same way Netflix has started to use its featured section to primarily highlight its original content, there’s a good chance that Disney+ originals will take up a majority of that row.  \u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZEPqcoqS5mydcoxCDWPOBJOeivE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19101059/Screen_Shot_2019_08_23_at_8.00.09_PM.png\"\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"P6Kw5D\"\u003eThe most obvious and interesting part of the Disney+ homepage is a selection of Disney subsections: \u003cem\u003eStar Wars\u003c/em\u003e, Disney, Pixar, Marvel, and National Geographic. It’s clear this is how the company wants people to use the app, to hone in on their favorite brands or franchises. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"L85MKA\"\u003ePeople “generally know what they’re interested in” when they open the app, Michael Cerda, vice president of product on Disney+, told \u003cem\u003eThe Verge\u003c/em\u003e. If you’re looking for \u003cem\u003eStar Wars\u003c/em\u003e content like \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/23/20829747/mandalorian-trailer-star-wars-disney-d23-jon-favreau-boba-fett-disney-plus-original-series\"\u003ethe new \u003cem\u003eMandalorian\u003c/em\u003e spinoff series\u003c/a\u003e, or \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/23/20830391/d23-disney-plus-streaming-service-marvel-mcu-exclusives-spider-man-sony-dispute-star-wars\"\u003ethe few Marvel movies Disney+ will launch with\u003c/a\u003e, people want them in the same space, he continued. Think of these subdivisions as almost entirely separate apps. They host collections of titles from every franchise and brand that Disney wants to highlight. \u003cem\u003eThe Simpsons\u003c/em\u003e, for example, has a huge section. People can go into that area, then scroll through each individual season to find an episode to watch. It’s similar to how shows on Hulu operate. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-float-right\"\u003e\u003caside id=\"PkQq87\"\u003e\u003cq\u003eDisney wants subscribers to use Disney+ to hone in on their favorite brands or franchises\u003c/q\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"DFBvEp\"\u003eIt’s within these collection-specific areas that Disney+’s designers really earn their due. Every movie or TV show has a beautiful back page to greet viewers. Take \u003cem\u003eCaptain Marvel\u003c/em\u003e: clicking on the movie will open a separate page with a couple of options, including the ability to read details about the movie (casting and so forth) or scroll through other recommended titles. Users can also click on an icon at the top of the page to add a title to their queue. Users on mobile devices will also be able to download movies for offline viewing directly from the page.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"mnSgNp\"\u003eBut what if people aren’t interested in just exploring what Marvel, \u003cem\u003eStar Wars\u003c/em\u003e, or even National Geographic offer? Disney+ also features a sidebar that people can use to navigate between TV series, movies, and the Disney+ Originals category, which will host movies like Disney’s exclusively streaming \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/23/20829675/lady-and-the-tramp-trailer-disney-plus-streaming-live-action-d23\"\u003elive-action remake of \u003cem\u003eLady and the Tramp\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, or series like Marvel’s upcoming spinoff series \u003cem\u003eLoki\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"NJR9u2\"\u003eThe name has already led to some confusion online, though. Take \u003cem\u003eLady and the Tramp\u003c/em\u003e, which Disney refers to as an “Original Film” on its official poster. People on Twitter wondered whether that designation meant the original animated movie, or the new live-action adaptation. The terminology question has come up with the Disney+ team, too, Paull says, but he couldn't comment on it further. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Xlc8IN\"\u003eFortunately, that’s the only openly confusing part of Disney+. Scrolling through separate compartments by collection might seem tedious, but it isn’t. Having different sections means it’s easier to browse without finding the content as overwhelming as the collections on Netflix and Hulu — though again, that’s partly because there’s less of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"m8tVGk\"\u003eDisney is also investing in personalized recommendations, which get their own row on the homepage. Recommendations are necessary for streaming platforms, especially as they continue to grow. Netflix runs approximately 400 A/B tests on its service every year just dedicated to its recommendation algorithm. It’s also led to frustration among subscribers and creators alike, who have accused Netflix’s recommendation algorithm of not surfacing specific shows or movies. That’s not an issue for Paull and his team right now, but it’s something they’re thinking about.  \u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_-yy10lNW8EDVLXIRXprS2yVyOo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19101054/Screen_Shot_2019_08_23_at_7.55.35_PM.png\"\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"rlBTDK\"\u003e“We actually have been fortunate in that we have a pretty strong team focused on personalization and recommendations,” he said. “Our job is hard, but it’s not \u003cem\u003eas\u003c/em\u003e hard, because our content strategy is about quality, not quantity. Our content’s about curation.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"rfEQ4F\"\u003eThe focus on curation is a big reason why the company decided to launch a separate kids’ app section inside its platform. Deciding to build a kids’ section on an app where nothing will be rated higher than PG-13 might seem unnecessary, but Paull said there are a couple of reasons the team thought it was important. Unlike Disney+’s main homepage, which is largely driven by text on top of images, the kids’ version is driven primarily by photos of characters from movies and TV shows. This is because kids, especially those under age seven, don’t really read. They associate with characters, Paull said. So the design is extremely different: the section is brighter and bubblier than the homepage, and it’s full of Disney characters. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"2mgHiK\"\u003eThe other reason is something people might not think about when it comes to Disney content: even within the PG-13 rating, Disney has some violent films that kids might not be ready for. \u003cem\u003eAvengers: Endgame\u003c/em\u003e, for example, has a scene where Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) uses a katana to slice a man’s throat before killing him.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qNdlkUDkR_uDP8V0-Nx5sECgp_M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19101063/Screen_Shot_2019_08_23_at_8.03.51_PM.png\"\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"5N5RgJ\"\u003eThat’s where individual profiles come in. Disney+ has a profile-creation process where users navigate a selection of avatars from its movies and TV shows: heroes from Marvel movies, \u003cem\u003eStar Wars\u003c/em\u003e characters, and Pixar favorites. Accounts can have up to seven profiles, either designated for kids or as standard accounts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"xxd414\"\u003eThe biggest takeaway from going hands-on with Disney+ is that it feels familiar. Between Netflix and Hulu (not to mention the myriad niche services), streaming users have grown accustomed to a fairly standardized interface and set of features on streaming platforms. As the streaming wars heat up — as WarnerMedia’s HBO Max, NBCUniversal, and even Apple prepare to launch their own streaming services — it feels like apart from price and content, the user experience will be one of the biggest factors in determining who comes out on top. Paull doesn’t disagree — entirely. The “user interface is very important,” according to Paull, who says “being able to create a design that fits the brand, and that allows people to find the programming they want that doesn’t get in the way is incredibly important.” The only thing he disagrees on? The “streaming wars” label for the coming conflict between online content services. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"dk3kdY\"\u003e“I don’t see this as a war,” Paull said, laughing. “I see this as nothing but a big win for the consumer.”\u003c/p\u003e","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/26/20830219/disney-plus-hands-on-first-look-demo-design-d23-wars-pixar-marvel","published":"2019-08-26T16:37:12Z","guid":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/26/20830219/disney-plus-hands-on-first-look-demo-design-d23-wars-pixar-marvel"},{"title":"Waymo’s robot taxi service is improving, but riders still have complaints","content":"\u003cimg alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WbC91O8Mv0Uz7IEoCHaxM8mMiE8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/65111595/waymo_chrysler_pacifica_detroit_auto_show_2017_0547.0.jpg\" /\u003e\n\n  \u003csmall\u003ePhoto by Sean O’Kane / The Verge\u003c/small\u003e\n\n  \u003cp id=\"8OGfvp\"\u003eWaymo is operating its \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/5/18126103/waymo-one-self-driving-taxi-service-ride-safety-alphabet-cost-app\"\u003eself-driving ride-hailing service\u003c/a\u003e in two cities: Phoenix, with some paying customers and some riding for free, and San Francisco and the surrounding towns, with just employees as passengers.

A majority of trips take place with human safety drivers behind the wheel who typically keep their hands in their laps as the vehicle drives itself.

The Titan doesn’t have the Passport’s sleek lines, but it doesn’t make a secret of its inspiration either. The 4.6-inch 1430 x 1438 screen is roughly the same size and resolution, and the three-line keyboard uses an identical layout — albeit with a pointed, slightly Bold-influenced curve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"45dDnx\"\u003eThis is a chunky phone. It fits into my jeans pocket, but I don’t ever forget it’s there. The Titan is 16.65mm thick; it has IP67 water, dust, and shock protection; and it weighs a comical 303g (which is about 50 percent more than a typical large phone, like a Galaxy Note 10 Plus or the iPhone XS Max). That is at least partially accounted for by the inclusion of a gigantic 6,000mAh battery. You also get USB-C, wireless charging, and a headphone jack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"bAdssA\"\u003eHonestly, I really enjoy holding the Titan in my hands. It is so unavoidably, intentionally mammoth that you can’t help but feel ready to Get Things Done. Part of that is due to the sheer width of the thing. Even more so than today’s large flagship phones, you simply cannot use the Titan one-handed. You need to hold it in both hands and use the keyboard with both of your thumbs for it to make any sense at all. It’s not a casual device.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S5dL07KQAjEN3w8BPlYterX5wEU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19083245/DSCF7044.jpg\"\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"OU5Oad\"\u003eI’m not someone who mourned the loss of physical phone keyboards, and I am much slower typing on the Titan than I would be on almost any other smartphone.

The backlighting is also very uneven, with a cheap-looking falloff in brightness for the more central keys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"SlxDPs\"\u003eThe screen, on the other hand, looks great. Viewing angles aren’t its strong point, but the colors are punchy and the resolution is incredibly sharp at 440 non-\u003ca href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/PenTile_matrix_family\"\u003ePenTile\u003c/a\u003e ppi. More importantly, the huge lateral width means that a lot of content fits really well. Anything with more than a couple of paragraphs of text, like an article on the web or a Kindle book, feels much more comfortable to read on the Titan than on a regular phone. It also works great with Slack, which feels like an important use case for a phone like this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"WlmMIJ\"\u003eThat said, the experience of using the Titan does fall down in some obvious ways. Android’s greatest strength is its versatility, but app makers could be forgiven for not targeting massive square screens, and that’s something you’ll run into pretty often when using the Titan. Anything based around vertical scrolling, like Twitter, shows barely any content at once; video apps invariably require you to turn the phone sideways for full-screen content that doesn’t get any bigger; and \u003cem\u003ePokémon Go\u003c/em\u003e adopts a weird ultrawide-angle view that makes pokémon look like they’re miles away. Nothing that I regularly use is completely broken on the Titan, but a good amount of it feels impractical. \u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q2b-yjyuo0pkiH4s8KMIzKF2Vvs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19083241/DSCF7043.jpg\"\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"fFz8pp\"\u003eIn many of the regards in which we would be concerned when reviewing any other phone, the Unihertz Titan is a bad phone. The camera is garbage. Performance from the Helio P60 chip isn’t great. It can’t even display Instagram Stories without cropping off the top and bottom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"BhpwI5\"\u003eBut if you know you want it, you know you want it. The BlackBerry Passport was an ultra-niche device, and it came out more than five years ago. Current BlackBerry license holder TCL seems to be more interested in producing comparatively sleek phones like the Key2, so it falls to the likes of Unihertz to produce bizarre — yet oddly compelling — devices like the Titan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"nIUkum\"\u003eIt costs \u003ca href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jellyphone/titan-unihertz-rugged-qwerty-smartphone\"\u003e$259 on Kickstarter\u003c/a\u003e right now (Unihertz says the Titan will be $359 when it exits crowdfunding), so I feel like the price has to be right for someone. Unihertz says the Titan is aimed at “working professionals, outdoor enthusiasts, and QWERTY lovers.” I’m not quite sure its appeal is that broad, given the serious caveats mentioned above.

In \u003cem\u003eControl\u003c/em\u003e, the latest game from \u003cem\u003eAlan Wake\u003c/em\u003e and\u003cem\u003e Quantum Break\u003c/em\u003e studio Remedy Entertainment, those bodies are absolutely everywhere. You walk into a room, and there they are, lifeless forms clad in drab office attire or bright orange hard hats and safety vests. They’re disturbing at first, but the more you explore the game’s paranormal world, the less unsettling they become. They’re just a fixture of the landscape, like stairs or cubicles or coffee makers. But while I became accustomed to seeing them, I never quite got comfortable with hearing them: a steady drone of nonsense words that gets louder as more bodies cling to the air. After hours of playing that, chanting still made me uneasy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Gysrxm\"\u003eThat’s far from the only strange and unsettling occurrence in the game. \u003cem\u003eControl\u003c/em\u003e is an experience built on those moments. It’s what would happen if you mixed the \u003cem\u003eX-Files\u003c/em\u003e with a Jeff VanderMeer novel and then structured the whole thing as an open-world video game like \u003cem\u003eBreath of the Wild\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Z2y2E0\"\u003eFor the most part, this blend works well. \u003cem\u003eControl\u003c/em\u003e’s disturbing and atmospheric setting is incredible. It’s full of mysteries that only get weirder and more interesting the further you delve in. This also makes for some thrilling action; you’ll fight all kinds of strange creatures while utilizing an array of supernatural skills. It’s very satisfying floating through the air while using psychic powers to toss fire extinguishers at bad guys. There are times when the action becomes too much, though, and in these moments, \u003cem\u003eControl\u003c/em\u003e devolves into a mostly generic third-person shooter where you’re hiding behind cover. It can make an otherwise excellent experience drag. But it’s worth pushing through to see the uniquely uncomfortable world Remedy has created.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-wide-block\"\u003e  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\"Control\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QnLMugU6glaajh-DTCfxr8JOEPs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19104560/Control_Screenshot_12.png\"\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"BVlmR5\"\u003eIn \u003cem\u003eControl,\u003c/em\u003e you play as Jesse Faden who, at the outset of the game, shows up at the Federal Bureau of Control — a government entity that studies and documents the paranormal — for a job interview as the assistant janitor. But almost immediately, she becomes director of the entire bureau; the previous boss died, and only a select few can wield the fantastical “service weapon” that serves as the director’s version of Excalibur. Around this time, a hostile paranormal force known as the Hiss has started to take over the Oldest House, the creepy name for the FBC’s New York City headquarters. Employees have been transformed into zombie-like monsters, and areas of the building have become overrun with unexplainable phenomena. Even for an organization that explores the unknown, the whole thing is pretty weird.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-float-right c-float-hang\"\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"N9XtOf\"\u003e\u003cdiv data-anthem-component=\"aside:8812592\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"xCmalT\"\u003eThe entirety of the game takes place within the Oldest House, a massive brutalist structure that seamlessly transitions between the banal and the bizarre. There are rows of cubicles, sprawling conference rooms, and observation areas for studying seemingly normal objects that possess supernatural powers. The closer you look, though, the weirder things get. You’ll notice cheerfully mundane posters that warn how excessive hours caused by temporal shifts won’t result in overtime and old VHS training videos that explain what a “threshold” is. The signs pointing you in the direction of specific departments look almost forgettably normal — until you see fields of research like parapsychology and astral exhibition. Eventually, you’ll discover a vast subterranean quarry filled with floating rocks and a light switch that can transport you to a seemingly random motel. Even before you factor in the newfound appearance of the Hiss, the Oldest House is a very odd place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"86XeDm\"\u003eBut it also feels surprisingly real, thanks to all of those small details. If there was a wing of the American government dedicated to the study and containment of paranormal activity, I imagine it’d look a lot like this. There’s a tremendous amount of world-building that has gone into the creation of \u003cem\u003eControl\u003c/em\u003e. It’s one of just a few games where I set aside time to read all of the (heavily redacted) files I collected along the way and listen to the many audio logs. It’s worth it to read memos from field agents about expense reports being lost due to temporal shifts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-wide-block\"\u003e  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\"Control\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-mXYpUYdyB32mIjWbG0jlFGVCVE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19104568/Control_Screenshot_03.png\"\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"BKvbXg\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eControl\u003c/em\u003e is also a very open experience. Its design is something of a mashup of \u003cem\u003eMetroid\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eBreath of the Wild\u003c/em\u003e; you have a lot of freedom to explore, but some areas are closed off until you unlock the right ability or hit the next major story beat. It can be frustrating coming up against doors that are locked because you’re not at the right security level yet, but it at least makes some sense within the game’s fiction. That said, this isn’t the kind of experience that pushes you in any one particular direction. There are no big glowing arrows showing you where to go and the mini-map is pretty hard to use. I found myself getting lost a lot, particularly early on, as I stumbled through the confusingly maze-like structure of the Oldest House. But it also felt appropriate. At the beginning, Jesse is a newcomer to this world, one who knows very little about the Hiss, or “objects of power,” or the constantly shifting layout of the building. You learn alongside her, and it’s very rewarding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"X8UjOE\"\u003eWhile the spaces that you explore vary quite a bit — one minute you’re surrounded by glowing, alien-like vegetation, the next you’re climbing up a mountain of discarded clocks — what you’re doing remains fairly consistent, and mostly, that means a lot of combat. \u003cem\u003eControl\u003c/em\u003e plays like a fairly standard cover-based third-person shooter. The service weapon can be upgraded with different abilities, but all of them will feel familiar if you’ve played an action game in the last decade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-float-right c-float-hang\"\u003e\u003caside id=\"mJbJU5\"\u003e\u003cq\u003eBy the end of the game, Jesse is something of a superhero\u003c/q\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Li8afY\"\u003eWhat makes \u003cem\u003eControl\u003c/em\u003e somewhat different is the powers you’ll slowly unlock. By the end of the game, Jesse is something of a superhero. She can fly, pick up objects with her mind, and control weakened enemies. You’ll have to chain these skills with weapon attacks to defeat waves of enemies. The sheer range of powers means that you can constantly explore new play styles and improvise on the fly. There’s a simple RPG-style structure so you can customize Jess’ powers to better suit how you want to play, and some of the abilities are hidden in side missions, so you’ll need to head off the main path to get everything. It helps that the various powers are just a lot of fun to play with. No matter how many times I did it, it always felt amazing grabbing a rocket out of midair and throwing it back at a glowing red Hiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"zLTQnm\"\u003eThe problem is that the game relies too much on combat. Often, enemies would respawn seemingly at random, and I’d be forced to replay simple but tedious combat scenarios multiple times. This discouraged exploration. You can get around the battles somewhat with \u003cem\u003eControl\u003c/em\u003e’s fast-travel feature, though, of course, that isn’t really exploring at all. Worse still are some of the boss-like battles, which seem downright unfair, throwing wave after wave of bad guys at you. It’s a frustrating way to slow your progress, and there were times — particularly one egregiously long battle toward the end of the game — where I almost gave up on \u003cem\u003eControl\u003c/em\u003e because I didn’t want to replay the same fight for the dozenth time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"LQwae3\"\u003eEven some of the weirder side missions, like one where you chase a flying TV set, ultimately end in a big battle. Outside of combat, there are some excellent environmental puzzles, where you navigate architecturally impossible mazes and analyze strange symbols to operate complex machines. Unfortunately, these moments are relatively rare. It’s disappointing that some of the best parts of the game are overshadowed by the copious shootouts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"c-end-para\" id=\"O87VQ8\"\u003eUltimately, I’m glad I pushed through those frustrating moments.

Se fizermos algo, seria questionável. Mesmo se descobríssemos quem fez, não sei o que poderíamos fazer com a informação, por não ser nada ilegal em princípio. Parece-me que o adequado a nós é simplesmente esclarecer que não é nosso ou do nosso conhecimento a quem questionar. Creio que o Estadão já perguntou até. Fique à vontade aí para buscar a informação. Acredito que há atribuição correcional se houver notícia pública de que fomos nós, e parece que há. Se houver a apuração, seria importante tornar público o resultado, porque desmentiria a falsa acusação lançada por blogs.

O referido procurador informou ainda que encaminhou ofício a V. Exa., nesta data, solicitando audiência para reportar voluntariamente o fato a essa Corregedoria. Temos conhecimento ainda de que o referido procurador vem se submetendo a tratamento psiquiátrico desde dezembro de 2018 e, nesta data, afastou-se dos trabalhos por determinação médica. O procurador Diogo Castor de Mattos, também, pediu formalmente o afastamento definitivo dos trabalhos da Lava Jato, fundamentando seu afastamento em quadro de estafa de caráter físico, emocional e intelectual (ofício 2706/2019-PRPR/FT \u0026#8211; PRPR00023953/2019). Nesta mesma data, foi solicitado seu afastamento à Exma. Procuradora-Geral da República. Estamos reportando essa situação a V.

The Kimball and Midgett are the seventh and eighth legend-class national security cutters in the Coast Guard’s fleet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e“These national security cutters will continue our 150 years of partnership and commitment to the Pacific region \u0026#8211; since September 1849, when Revenue Cutter Lawrence sailed into Honolulu Harbor escorted by Native Hawaiians in outrigger canoes,” said Schultz. “In today’s complex geostrategic environment with rising great power competition, the importance and demand for a strong Coast Guard presence in the Pacific has never been greater.”\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Kimball and Midgett, along with the three fast response cutters also homeported in Honolulu, will further advance the Coast Guard’s longstanding commitment to safeguard the nation’s maritime safety, security, and economic interests through critical deployments across the Indo-Pacific region.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdvanced command-and-control capabilities and an unmatched combination of range, speed and ability to operate in extreme weather enable these ships to confront national security threats, strengthen maritime governance, support economic prosperity, and promote individual sovereignty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the Bering Sea and the Arctic to patrolling known drug trafficking zones off Central and South America to working to strengthen the capabilities of our partners across the Indo-Pacific, national security cutters deploy globally to conduct essential Coast Guard missions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKnown as the Legend-class, national security cutters are capable of executing the most challenging national security missions, including support to U.S. combatant commanders. They are 418 feet in length, 54 feet in beam and 4,600 long tons in displacement. They have a top speed of more than 28 knots, a range of 12,000 nautical miles, an endurance of up to 90 days and can hold a crew of up to 150. These new cutters are replacing the high endurance Hamilton-class cutters (378 feet) that have been in service since the 1960s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Midgett\u0026#8217;s transit to Hawaii was punctuated by two interdictions of suspected low-profile go-fast vessels in the Eastern Pacific Ocean, the first July 25 and a second July 31. The boardings resulted in a combined seizure of over 6,700 pounds of cocaine, estimated to be worth over $89 million.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNational security cutters are responsible for 40 percent of the 460,000 pounds of cocaine interdicted by the Coast Guard in the fiscal year 2018. National security cutter crews have interdicted more than 92,000 pounds of cocaine to date in the fiscal year 2019.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMidgett is named to honor all members of the Midgett family who served in the Coast Guard and its predecessor services. At least ten members of the family earned high honors for their heroic life-saving efforts. Among them, the Coast Guard awarded various family members seven gold lifesaving medals, the service\u0026#8217;s highest award for saving a life, and three silver lifesaving medals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Kimball is the third ship to bear that name, in honor of Sumner Kimball, who served as superintendent of the Revenue Marine and as general superintendent of the Life-Saving Service from 1878 until the two organizations merged in 1915 to become the modern-day U.S. Coast Guard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e“As you take to the seas, you will write the next chapters of the Kimball and Midgett legacies,” said Schultz, addressing the commands and crews of the two cutters. “I charge you with carrying out the operations of these ships in such a manner as to be worthy of the traditions of self-sacrifice, inspirational leadership, and unwavering dedication to duty – traits exemplified by these cutters’ distinguished and storied namesakes.”\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_44851\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-44851\" style=\"width: 1326px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\u003e\u003cimg

Navy newest expeditionary fast transport ship completed acceptance trials","content":"\u003cp\u003eAustal shipyard has announced that the U.S. Navy newest Expeditionary Fast Transport (EPF ) ship, the future USNS Puerto Rico (EPF11), has successfully completed acceptance trials.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shipyard reported that acceptance trials, conducted in the Gulf of Mexico, were unique in that they integrated formal Builder’s Trials with Acceptance Trials for the first time on an EPF vessel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u0026#8220;By combining the two at-sea trials into one event, there are great efficiencies gained, enabling reduced costs and a shorter completion schedule,\u0026#8221; according to Austal.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAustal CEO David Singleton congratulated Austal USA for achieving this critical program milestone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e“The future USNS Puerto Rico successfully completed and passed all tests – a clean sweep – and returned from sea earlier than scheduled, a testament to the effort and expertise of Austal USA’s professional shipbuilding team and the U.S. Navy’s Board of Inspection and Survey (INSURV),” he said.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“These trials involved the execution of intense, comprehensive testing by the Austal-led industry team while underway, which demonstrated to the U.S. Navy the successful operation of the ship’s major systems and equipment. Sea trials are the last milestone before delivery of the ship. The future USNS Puerto Rico is scheduled for delivery to the U.S. Navy before the end of the year and is the eleventh Spearhead Class ship in Austal’s 14-ship EPF portfolio.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The flexibility and versatility of the EPF is becoming increasingly evident. From serving as a mother ship to test unmanned aerial and undersea systems in the Atlantic to performing as command ships in Pacific Partnership 2019 (an exercise that includes more than 500 military and civilian personnel from more than 10 nations), the EPF fleet is proving to be a great asset to the future 355-ship US Navy,” Mr Singleton said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAustal’s EPF program is mature with ten ships delivered and three more under construction in Mobile, Alabama, in addition to the future USS Puerto Rico. The Spearhead-class EPF is currently providing high-speed, high-payload transport capability to fleet and combatant commanders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe EPF’s large, open mission deck and large habitability spaces provide the opportunity to conduct a wide range of missions from engagement and humanitarian assistance or disaster relief missions, to the possibility of supporting a range of future missions including special operations support, command and control, and medical support operations. With its ability to access austere and degraded ports with minimal external assistance, the EPF provides unique options to fleet and combatant commanders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to the Navy, the ships are capable of operating in shallow-draft ports and waterways, interfacing with roll-on/roll-off discharge facilities and on/off-loading a combat-loaded Abrams Main Battle Tank (M1A2). The EPF includes a flight deck for helicopter operations and an off-load ramp that allow vehicles to quickly drive off the ship. The ramp is suitable for the types of austere piers and quay walls common in developing countries. The ship\u0026#8217;s shallow draft (under 15 feet) will further enhance littoral operations and port access. This makes the EPF an extremely flexible asset for support of a wide range of operations including maneuver and sustainment, relief operations in small or damaged ports, flexible logistics support or as the key enabler for rapid transport.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition to the EPF program, Austal has also received contracts for 19 Independence-variant Littoral Combat Ships (LCS) for the U.S. Navy.

Nonetheless, thus far in 2019, IBAMA has issued only \u003ca href=\"https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ambiente/2019/08/queimadas-disparam-mas-multas-do-ibama-despencam-sob-bolsonaro.shtml\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003eone third of the fines\u003c/a\u003e it did over the same period last year, according to Folha de S\u0026atilde;o Paulo, one of Brazil\u0026rsquo;s largest newspapers. The drop is likely a result of both a lack of funding and political will. Earlier this year, Bolsonaro had \u003ca href=\"https://www.climatechangenews.com/2019/03/29/brazil-official-fined-bolsonaro-illegal-fishing-2012-fired/\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003eIBAMA fire an agent\u003c/a\u003e, who happened to have fined Bolsonaro years ago for illegal fishing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a similar vein, after the Brazilian space agency, called INPE, released new satellite data showing a \u003ca href=\"https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/internacional/en/scienceandhealth/2019/08/amazon-deforestation-in-july-increased-278-over-same-period-in-2018.shtml\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003e278% increase\u003c/a\u003e in deforestation in July compared to the same period last year, Bolsonaro fired the agency\u0026rsquo;s head, suggesting that the data were trumped up in order to\u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/02/world/americas/bolsonaro-amazon-deforestation-galvao.html?login=email\u0026amp;auth=login-email\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003e tarnish the country\u0026rsquo;s image\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr /\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=\"pullquote\"\u003e\u0026#8220;No country in the world has the moral right to talk about the Amazon. You destroyed your own ecosystems.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/span\u003eBrazil\u0026rsquo;s strong agriculture sector has ratcheted up pressure on forests. Agriculture has been the strongest performing sector of Brazil\u0026rsquo;s economy in recent years, and the US-China trade war has positioned Brazil well to replace the US as the global leader in soybean exports. The demand for soybeans has created pressure to rapidly clear forests and plant. Jair Bolsonaro\u0026rsquo;s oldest son, Fl\u0026aacute;vio Bolsonaro, a senator, has introduced a bill that would eliminate a requirement that rural properties in the Amazon maintain 80% of their native vegetation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, the president has regularly challenged criticism about his government\u0026rsquo;s environmental policies in a way some see as condoning deforestation. \u0026ldquo;The Amazon is ours,\u0026rdquo; Bolsonaro told journalists in mid-July. \u0026ldquo;We preserve more [rainforest] than anyone. No country in the world has the moral right to talk about the Amazon. You destroyed your own ecosystems.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFabiano Lopez da Silva, head of Funda\u0026ccedil;\u0026atilde;o Vitoria Amazonica, an environmental non-governmental organization based in Mana\u0026uacute;s, says such rhetoric stimulates illegal deforestation. \u0026ldquo;[Farmers and illegal loggers] can go forward with illegal fires. There won\u0026rsquo;t be any sort of [fiscal enforcement] or monitoring or fines for this kind of activity,\u0026rdquo; says Lopez da Silva.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are indications that these latest fires may have at least in part been the result of political acts. According to the \u003ca href=\"http://www.folhadoprogresso.com.br/dia-do-fogo-produtores-planejam-data-para-queimada-na-regiao/\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003eFolha do Progresso\u003c/a\u003e, a publication from the southern part of the Amazonian state of Par\u0026aacute;, farmers and ranchers in the region organized what they called \u0026ldquo;a day of fire\u0026rdquo; for Aug. 10, where they would set forests aflame to clear land for pasture and planting. Their goal, according to the outlet, was to show Bolsonaro they wanted to work, and burning down trees was the way to do that. In the following 48 hours, forest fires spread rapidly in the region. \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/23/world/americas/amazon-fire-brazil-bolsonaro.html?searchResultPosition=2\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe New York \u003cem\u003eTimes\u003c/em\u003e reports\u003c/a\u003e that farmers set the bulk of these fires, but that they targeted land already cleared for agriculture, not old-growth forest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimilarly, the environment secretary for the state of Amazonas, Eduardo Taveira, told TIME that in the southern part of the state, the agency has seen an unusually large number of fires in areas where man-made forest fires are an annual issue. Taveira and Lopez da Silva both noted that forest fires in the Amazon are almost never the result of natural causes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, by reorganizing the government and cutting budgets, the Bolsonaro administration has undercut environmental policing power. For the last few years, during the dry season (which runs from June to December) IBAMA has maintained an enforcement base in Novo Progresso, a city in the state of Par\u0026aacute; at the epicenter of the current forest fires. When IBAMA agents patrol the countryside looking for illegal logging and other violations, military police generally accompany them to ensure their safety, since Brazil ranks as \u003ca href=\"https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/environmental-activists/defenders-earth/\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003eone of the most dangerous\u003c/a\u003e countries in the world for environmental activists.

In the same speech, however, he reaffirmed the need to provide economic opportunity to the Amazon region\u0026rsquo;s population, and there\u0026rsquo;s little indication that Bolsonaro will pull back his support for expanding mining operations and large-scale farming in the region.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026rsquo;s just more bad news for the Amazon\u0026rsquo;s indigenous people, whose lands are some of the best preserved in the region. One of Bolsonaro\u0026rsquo;s first official acts as president in early 2019 was to transfer the agency charged with supporting indigenous people, FUNAI, under the Ministry of Agriculture. Analysts say this weakens the agency\u0026rsquo;s ability to protect indigenous territories. Along with suggesting that indigenous territory could be opened up for mining, Bolsonaro has also threatened to halt the certification of any new indigenous settlements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObviously, this is devastating for indigenous people. But it\u0026rsquo;s also potentially catastrophic for the environment. According to a recent \u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@UNDP/indigenous-rights-the-pathway-to-a-livable-planet-66e0d7f77c3e\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003eUnited Nations report,\u003c/a\u003e strong land rights for indigenous communities help form a bulwark against climate change. In Brazil, for example, indigenous territories are constitutionally protected. This helps maintain the forest by discouraging encroachment by farmers, miners and loggers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut, according to \u003ca href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/10/joenia-wapichana-brazil-native-woman-voted-congress-181012203934564.html\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003eJoenia Wapichana\u003c/a\u003e, a member of the Sustainability Network (a political party established by former Minister of the Environment Marina Silva) and the first indigenous woman elected to Brazil\u0026rsquo;s senate, the Bolsonaro government has \u0026ldquo;persecuted\u0026rdquo; indigenous people by attempting to halt the processes that define the boundaries of indigenous territories. The \u003ca href=\"http://www.funai.gov.br/index.php/indios-no-brasil/terras-indigenas\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003eFUNAI website\u003c/a\u003e lists 440 fully recognized indigenous territories in Brazil.

Traditional communities are generally the descendants of European settlers who practice small-scale agriculture as well as producing goods from materials that can be harvested sustainably from the forest. For example, in Montanha e Mangabal, a government-certified \u0026ldquo;traditional community\u0026rdquo; with approximately 250 residents in Par\u0026aacute;, many of the community\u0026rsquo;s residents support themselves by producing oils from native plants, fishing, and raising yucca roots to make flour. The community\u0026rsquo;s presence deters deforestation, says its president, Ageu Lobo Perreira. \u0026ldquo;[Traditional] communities are always there watching,\u0026rdquo; he says. \u0026ldquo;You can\u0026rsquo;t come here and attack the environment, take lumber.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, these communities are at risk thanks, Lobo Perreira says, to federal defunding of environmental protection, public education, and public healthcare. \u0026ldquo;Families are leaving because they want their children to have a secondary-school education,\u0026rdquo; Lobo Perreira says. Community members must travel more than 140 miles to the city of Itaituba for any serious health issues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=\"pullquote\"\u003e\u0026#8220;These are places where the state\u0026rsquo;s power, judicial power doesn\u0026rsquo;t reach.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/span\u003eFurther, these places on the frontlines of deforestation have become flash points of violence.

Last year, for example, after Lobo Perreira publicly challenged miners prospecting illegally on the community\u0026rsquo;s land, he received death threats that forced him to leave Montanha e Mangabal for a few months.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;When you enter these more remote areas,\u0026rdquo; says Andr\u0026eacute; Cutrim, a professor of environmental resource management at the Federal University of Par\u0026aacute;, \u0026ldquo;these are places where the state\u0026rsquo;s power, judicial power doesn\u0026rsquo;t reach.\u0026rdquo; The result, he says, is that it\u0026rsquo;s easier to cut down trees or to start fires illegally\u0026mdash;and harder for an already hamstrung environmental agency to operate in the face of violence and lawlessness. This enables land grabbers to deforest and farm regardless of what the law permits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCutrim says the Bolsonaro government is stoking passions with its rhetoric. \u0026ldquo;The message of the current government isn\u0026rsquo;t conciliatory.

according to media outlet Newsreader, which revealed the leak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe died en route to Moscow after being seen by doctors in a hospital in nearby Arkhangelsk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is alleged that Russia\u0026#8217;s military did not disclose the man had been injured in a nuclear leak, putting medics and other patients, including pregnant women, in danger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIndependent outlet Meduza revealed that radiation monitors came to the hospital while surgery linked to the incident was still being carried out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;The dosimetrists showed up and started measuring beta radiation levels,\u0026#8221; said a source at the

radioactive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eHISTORY OF COVER UPS\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe incident is not the first nuclear explosion the Russian government has sought to play down or cover up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1986, the \u003ca href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/6130017/chernobyl-nuclear-disaster-radiation-dead-sky-atlantic-series/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eworst nuclear disaster in history\u003c/a\u003e occurred at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine, then part of the Soviet Union.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe accident saw the plant\u0026#8217;s nuclear reactor go into meltdown as a result partly of human error and partly of design flaws.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwenty eight people died in the days and months after the incident, but 4,000-16,000 people are thought to have \u003ca href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/9293076/chernobyl-power-station-safe-visit-tourists/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003edied across Europe since\u003c/a\u003e as a result of radioactive exposure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Soviets initially denied any incident had taken place, conceding that a minor incident had occurred only when radiations levels set off alarms in Sweden, more than 600 miles away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scale of the situation only became clear to the international community once the government began evacuating more than 100,00 people from the area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eSITE CLOSED AND GUARDED\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImages and video have also emerged showing a platform or pontoon badly damaged in the explosion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe footage shows a radiation reading being taken several hundreds metres from the visibly damaged platform, which sits just off shore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe detector gives a reading of 5-6 micro-roentgen per hour, within normal limits, but on expert has said the structure itself may still be highly contaminated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe site remains guarded and closed off to locals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFootage has also emerged of a military figure telling residents that those killed were by the explosion itself, not be exposure to radiation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaptain Vladimir Bosy, commander of military unit 09703, which had been deployed at the naval testing station, was secretly filmed telling locals: \u0026#8220;On 8 August people went out to the pontoon and it exploded from underneath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;They were killed because the pontoon was lifted up into the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;And those on the pontoon got dreadful injuries.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Works had been carried out in order to test one of the engines for a missile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This missile engine is fed by radioactive isotopes…. they are its power source.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“An extraordinary situation took place and as a result of it, there was an explosion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But it was not a nuclear explosion, it was an explosion of an explosive substance.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe added that \u0026#8220;horrors would follow\u0026#8221; if people were to visit the site.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c!--googleoff:

staying near the hotel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They were known at the hotel from previous times they’d stayed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was the dead man’s 43rd birthday and the two families had arranged for two helicopters to pick them up, one for one family and one for the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The other family ended up going by road because one of the helicopters had capacity for five and the other could only carry three including the pilot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My understanding was that it was a last-minute decision the man whose birthday it was should take the bigger helicopter with his family and the other family should catch them up in a car, probably because it was his birthday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHorrified witnesses described the moment of impact as similar to a roll of thunder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToni Carbonell told local paper Diario de Mallorca: “The noise of the impact was horrible.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tragedy is the second in recent years to have hit the Inselkammer family, whose business interests include private brewery Ayinger, which is now run by August’s brother Franz Inselkammer III.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAugust’s cousin Jannik, co-owner of another brewery in Munich, was killed aged just 45 in an avalanche during a skiing holiday in Canada in March 2014.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYesterday’s crash, which happened in the muncipality of Inca in the centre of the island, is being probed by the Civil Guard and Spanish air accident

angry revellers.\u003cbr /\u003e\nThe violent scenes, described by one witness as a “pitched battle”, occurred in a protected woodland area near the beautiful beach of Cala Conta in the west of the island.\u003cbr /\u003e\nThe number of arrests was initially said to be around 40, for crimes including resisting arrest, disobedience, assaulting police officers and wounding, but later went up to 73.\u003cbr /\u003e\nCivil Guard chief Enrique Gomez, who put the number of party-goers still at the rave when police went in at around 200, said: “When officers arrived to tell them they had to leave and stop the music because it was an illegal party in a protected area, they refused to do so, provoking police and even assaulting them and injuring several.”\u003cbr /\u003e\nThe injuries of the local police officers and Civil Guards who were hurt have been described as “non-serious” and they were dealt with by medical responders at the scene.\u003cbr /\u003e\nAround 40 officers \u0026#8211; local police employed by the town hall of San Jose which is the municipality covering Cala Conta and Civil Guard \u0026#8211; are understood to have been involved in the operation to halt the rave.\u003cbr /\u003e\nA Spanish woman aged 27 and an Italian man aged around 30 who were among the revellers, were taken to hospital for injuries including a broken bone.\u003cbr /\u003e\nLocal reports said several caravans with foreign number-plates had been parked at the scene, although there has not yet been any official word on the nationalities of the detainees.\u003cbr /\u003e\nSeveral “dangerous dogs” were seized by officers who acted to halt the rave, which town hall sources said they thought may have gone on for several days if police had not stepped in.\u003cbr /\u003e\nEarlier in the night, an estimated 1,000 revellers are said to have been at the rave before numbers dwindled and the police operation swung into action.\u003cbr /\u003e\nThe woodland where the incidents

\u003csmall\u003ePresident Donald Trump at the beginning of bilateral talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel at the G7 summit in Biarritz, France, on August 26, 2019. | Michael Kappeler/picture alliance via Getty Images\u003c/small\u003e\n\n  \u003cp\u003eExpect more seesaws to come.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp id=\"dPMukM\"\u003ePresident Trump sent financial markets on a roller coaster over the weekend, raising tariffs and making dramatic threats to force American companies to stop locating production in China, only to calm things down with some conciliatory statements Monday morning that suggested the US and China are poised to head back to the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"BTCkWK\"\u003eThe back-and-forth reflects the fundamental tension of Trump-era trade policy. On the one hand, the president is deeply convinced that bilateral trade deficits are harmful and therefore aggressive “trade war” measures give him the upper hand. On the other hand, the president follows the stock market closely and keeps seeing that investors don’t share his assessment, which tends to pull him back from the brink. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"3kksv0\"\u003eThe impact on the real world, meanwhile, is less dramatic than the gyrations of the stock market, but it points clearly toward higher taxes on most Americans and an unsettling environment for business investment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"GdOVIa\"\u003eThe trade war so far\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"0H65Kr\"\u003eDating back to well before Trump took office, the United States had a longstanding list of complaints with Chinese economic policy. Some American businesses complain that they are forced into “unfair” competition with Chinese state-owned firms that benefit from government subsidies. Others complain that when they do business in China, Chinese companies steal their intellectual property or the Chinese government forces them into unfavorable joint ventures with Chinese-owned companies. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"GXk8j2\"\u003eThese complaints, when you think about it, are actually rather different from the standard manufacturing community concern that cheap Chinese labor is undercutting American production. US business wants China to change the rules to make it easier to do business there, and most of what the American government is asking for is along those lines. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"EavdUu\"\u003eWhat’s new under Trump is a spirit of confrontation where the president has imposed multiple rounds of taxes — tariffs — on Chinese imports. China has in turn retaliated with curbs on American imports. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"CvM4rO\"\u003eIn standard economic understanding, these tit-for-tat moves simply hurt both countries’ economies. But Trump has often articulated the view that tariffs are good per se, sometimes because China pays the tariffs (it doesn’t) but also sometimes because Trump views the US-China trade deficit as a case of America “losing money” to China (it isn’t). \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"pgxO1w\"\u003eConsequently, Trump’s view is that a total breakdown in US-China trade would hurt China but not America, and thus that threatening such a breakdown should force China to make concessions. His problem is the stock market doesn’t agree. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"Sa7lwo\"\u003eTrump keeps going back and forth\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"9UMmem\"\u003eThere’s no real way to resolve this tension, so instead of resolving it, Trump keeps going backward and forward. Back on August 13, \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/8/13/20803856/trump-china-tariff-delay\"\u003ehe pleased financial markets by delaying previously scheduled tariff increases until after Christmas\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"E2NSig\"\u003eBut then Trump got ornery and \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/8/23/20830346/trump-china-tariffs-trade-war\"\u003eannounced tariff rate increases on August 23\u003c/a\u003e, though without canceling the delay. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"oYeexk\"\u003eThen there were reports over the weekend that Trump was having second thoughts about the tariff hikes, and then contrary reports that the only regret he had was that the rates weren’t higher. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"tRn7ih\"\u003eHe also \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/8/24/20830954/trade-war-donald-trump-china-hereby-order-us-companies-tariffs-economic-powers-act-1977\"\u003etweeted an “order” to US companies\u003c/a\u003e saying they would have to leave China, which mostly generated mockery, but he followed up with a specific citation of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which does indeed give the president some very vaguely worded authority over international trade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"fT0VGI\"\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"\u003e\n\u003cp lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003eFor all of the Fake News Reporters that don’t have a clue as to what the law is relative to Presidential powers, China, etc., try looking at the Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977.

It’s far from clear that invoking it in the way Trump threatened would really work, but it’s also possible that it would.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"qSD4OR\"\u003eThat left investors really nervous, but then Monday morning Trump told reporters, “China called last night our top trade people and said ‘let’s get back to the table’ so we will be getting back to the table and I think they want to do something.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"AjfiKQ\"\u003eThere’s very little content to that statement, but the stock market seemed to like it, and shares went up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"i1hDwz\"\u003eLose-lose economics, win-win politics\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"jYT7No\"\u003eThe basic problem with Trump’s approach of trying to hurt the Chinese economy in order to force concessions is that any steps he takes to do this also hurt the American economy. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"6olCx6\"\u003eThe fact that trade tensions send stock market shares down is not, as such, particularly bad news for the economy. But the \u003cem\u003ereason\u003c/em\u003e trade tensions send shares down is that investors believe — almost certainly correctly — that the tensions are just bad for global growth. They raise consumer prices and deter investment. So while it’s true that \u003cem\u003eChina\u003c/em\u003e is under pressure to make a deal, the pressure also pushed on Trump. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"2nSRAx\"\u003ePolitically, however, you can sort of see why Trump finds this approach appealing. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"alQNRD\"\u003eIf at any point the whole underlying dispute \u003cem\u003edoes\u003c/em\u003e get resolved and all the tariffs and counter-tariffs are removed, that will make people very happy. At that point, he can also just assert that whatever concessions he was able to wring out of the Chinese were amazing game changers. That probably won’t be true, but there will be a lot of people disinclined to rock the boat since the resolution of trade tensions as such is good news. But until that happens, he’s likely to keep swaying back and forth, pushed by his desire to ratchet up pressure on China and pulled by the pressure the stock market puts on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"PBDsFP\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv data-analytics-viewport=\"video\" data-analytics-action=\"volume:view:article:middle\" data-analytics-label=\"Trade wars, explained|38657\" data-volume-uuid=\"91104c564\" data-volume-id=\"38657\" data-analytics-placement=\"article:middle\" data-volume-placement=\"article\" data-volume-autoplay=\"false\" id=\"volume-placement-737\" class=\"volume-video\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003c/div\u003e","url":"https://www.vox.com/2019/8/26/20833210/trump-trade-war-table","published":"2019-08-26T15:30:00Z","guid":"https://www.vox.com/2019/8/26/20833210/trump-trade-war-table"},{"title":"9 questions about the Hong Kong protests you were too embarrassed to ask","content":"\u003cimg alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a0uHSmIWJ8MJ6zcLz0nsogdLNKQ=/356x0:4773x3313/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/65088400/GettyImages_1152068560.0.jpg\" /\u003e\n\n  \u003csmall\u003eA protestor outside the British Consulate General during a demonstration in Hong Kong, on June 26, 2019. | LightRocket via Getty Images\u003c/small\u003e\n\n\n  \u003cp\u003eWhy is Hong Kong protesting?
