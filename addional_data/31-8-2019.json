Bowen is also a trustee for the Foundation for Economic Education (FEE).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBowen describes being top down and thematic, which allows him to take a very long term perspective. The Pension Fund Board of the City of Tampa has a 20 year timeline for the pension fund. The fund looks at Trade, Monetary, Tax, Fiscal, and Foreign policies, and what these government actions might mean to financial assets, including stocks and bonds, and inflation. When he took over the fund from his father, he said all of the bloody fights had been done, and all he had to do was keep running the same sorts of analyses that the firm had always done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBowen notes that there has not been a 20-year rolling period that has not included: a bull market, a bear market, a speculative bubble and a war in the past century.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe believes the consulting industry has a stranglehold on pension funds and municipalities\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBowen reads lots of history, biographies, and class American novels; some of his favorite books \u003ca href=\"https://ritholtz.com/2019/08/mib-jay-bowen/#more-231310\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eare here\u003c/a\u003e; A transcript of our conversation will be \u003ca href=\"https://ritholtz.com/2019/09/transcript-jay-bowen/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eavailable here\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can stream/download the full conversation, including the podcast extras on \u003ca href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/jay-bowen-discusses-pension-fund-management/id730188152?i=1000448043749\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eApple iTunes\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://overcast.fm/+JVs4R9qe0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eOvercast\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/1cTshjEp7vW74DzkrvZ5hd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eSpotify\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://podcasts.google.com/?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5ibG9vbWJlcmcuZm0vQkxNODg2NDQwMzI4OA%3D%3D\u0026amp;episode=YjkwZDgzYzQtYzlkYy0xMWU5LWE3MjItM2ZhMGRjM2UzYjAy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eGoogle Podcasts\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2019-08-28/jay-bowen-discusses-pension-fund-management-podcast\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eBloomberg\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/masters-in-business/e/63534441?autoplay=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eStitcher\u003c/a\u003e.

The Bordeaux and Bordeaux Supérieur Association—the body overseeing wineries in these appellations—announced it was permitting the use of seven new grape varieties in these wines, a move it hopes will be a saving grace for the region.

They identified four red varieties—Arinarnoa, Touriga Nacional, Castets, and Marselan—and three white grapes—Liliorila, Petit Manseng, and Alvarinho—as contenders for new plantings. The grapes’ various characteristics seem resilient in the face of viticultural challenges, explains Florian Reyne, general manager of Planète Bordeaux vineyards. Petit Manseng, for example, is resistant to gray rot, and Touriga Nacional is a late-ripening variety that won’t be harmed by spring frosts, a major problem in the area. “In 2017, we lost almost 80% of our production [to frost],” says Reyne.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AOC-2.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2688221\" srcset=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AOC-2.jpg 4928w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AOC-2.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AOC-2.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AOC-2.jpg?resize=768,511 768w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AOC-2.jpg?resize=1024,682 1024w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AOC-2.jpg?resize=281,187 281w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AOC-2.jpg?resize=756,503 756w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AOC-2.jpg?resize=100,67 100w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AOC-2.jpg?resize=60,40 60w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AOC-2.jpg?resize=154,103 154w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AOC-2.jpg?resize=592,394 592w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AOC-2.jpg?resize=392,261 392w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AOC-2.jpg?resize=252,168 252w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AOC-2.jpg?resize=697,465 697w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AOC-2.jpg?resize=234,156 234w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AOC-2.jpg?resize=500,333 500w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AOC-2.jpg?resize=578,385 578w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AOC-2.jpg?resize=600,399 600w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AOC-2.jpg?resize=90,60 90w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AOC-2.jpg?resize=185,123 185w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AOC-2.jpg?resize=115,77 115w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AOC-2.jpg?resize=739,492 739w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AOC-2.jpg?resize=778,518 778w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 4928px) 100vw, 4928px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eGrape varieties are monitored and tested for resilience in adverse weather conditions.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"image-credit\"\u003eBordeaux Wine Council\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe initiative still needs to pass through France’s National Institute of Origin and Quality (INAO). But once approved, plantings will begin in the 2020–2021harvest season. There are stipulations: Only 5% of a vineyard is allowed to be planted with these new grapes, and a blend can consist of only 10% maximum of these varieties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the past, winemakers who experimented with varieties not approved under the AOC system could not label their wines as AOC wines, which devalued their product. By allowing these new grapes into the quality tier, winemakers in Bordeaux and Bordeaux Supérieur AOC are making a statement about how they believe the region will change in the coming years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe nearly 50/50 split of new red and white varieties may redefine Bordeaux in other ways. Currently, “only 9% to 10% of the Bordeaux area is producing white wine,” Reyne says, but this ratio may change with the availability of new white options. This future-thinking protocol may also bring Bordeaux back to its roots: Castets, one of the approved red varieties, is a resurrected grape that was nearly extinct after the phylloxera crisis in the mid-1800s. But most important, “we want to plant varieties that are resistant to disease because we want to decrease the amount of chemical products we use,” Reyne adds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Vendemmia-2012-ph-FabioCattabiani-8.jpg?w=684\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2688225\" srcset=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Vendemmia-2012-ph-FabioCattabiani-8.jpg 801w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Vendemmia-2012-ph-FabioCattabiani-8.jpg?resize=100,150 100w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Vendemmia-2012-ph-FabioCattabiani-8.jpg?resize=200,300 200w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Vendemmia-2012-ph-FabioCattabiani-8.jpg?resize=768,1151 768w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Vendemmia-2012-ph-FabioCattabiani-8.jpg?resize=684,1024 684w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Vendemmia-2012-ph-FabioCattabiani-8.jpg?resize=142,212 142w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Vendemmia-2012-ph-FabioCattabiani-8.jpg?resize=336,503 336w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Vendemmia-2012-ph-FabioCattabiani-8.jpg?resize=67,100 67w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Vendemmia-2012-ph-FabioCattabiani-8.jpg?resize=40,60 40w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Vendemmia-2012-ph-FabioCattabiani-8.jpg?resize=103,154 103w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Vendemmia-2012-ph-FabioCattabiani-8.jpg?resize=721,1080 721w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Vendemmia-2012-ph-FabioCattabiani-8.jpg?resize=263,394 263w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Vendemmia-2012-ph-FabioCattabiani-8.jpg?resize=392,588 392w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Vendemmia-2012-ph-FabioCattabiani-8.jpg?resize=112,168 112w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Vendemmia-2012-ph-FabioCattabiani-8.jpg?resize=310,465 310w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Vendemmia-2012-ph-FabioCattabiani-8.jpg?resize=104,156 104w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Vendemmia-2012-ph-FabioCattabiani-8.jpg?resize=222,333 222w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Vendemmia-2012-ph-FabioCattabiani-8.jpg?resize=257,385 257w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Vendemmia-2012-ph-FabioCattabiani-8.jpg?resize=534,800 534w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Vendemmia-2012-ph-FabioCattabiani-8.jpg?resize=80,120 80w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Vendemmia-2012-ph-FabioCattabiani-8.jpg?resize=82,123 82w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Vendemmia-2012-ph-FabioCattabiani-8.jpg?resize=115,172 115w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Vendemmia-2012-ph-FabioCattabiani-8.jpg?resize=328,492 328w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Vendemmia-2012-ph-FabioCattabiani-8.jpg?resize=346,518 346w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 801px) 100vw, 801px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eBaskets filled during the 2012 harvest in the wine region of Franciacorta, Italy.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"image-credit\"\u003eFabio Cattabiani\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eSparkling Future\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Bordeaux’s new missive is one of Europe’s largest—and most notable—to date, Franciacorta, a fairly young wine region in Italy, passed a smaller initiative two years ago as a way to fight global warming.

A misunderstanding between how the auctioneer announced bids and how the bids were displayed on-screen caused the discrepancy. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe 1994 McLaren, on the other hand, sold for a record $19,805,000.

The iconic 1965 James Bond Aston Martin DB5, complete with all the bells and whistles an MI6 agent would need, just like in the movie, sold for $6,385,000. A rare 2006 Ferrari FXX sold at a final $3,525,000, which set a new world record for the model at auction. Regarding what some consider the auction’s better half, the lineup of 18 driving watches, resulted in 15 sold for a total of $350,000. The James Bond Submariner 6358 did not meet its reserve price, which means anyone looking to play Agent 007 is still in luck should the item become available at a future date.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eMoney Isn’t Everything (But Having a Serious Wrist Game Might Be)\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“To me, the money is ugly,” Altieri says about the real appeal of luxury watches. Despite having one of the most extensive private watch collections in the world, parting with any of his rare timepieces is always a bittersweet moment for Altieri. The search for a specific watch can take years, and there’s an emotional investment in every piece that can’t be measured in money. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, the resulting sales have the CEO in great spirits.  “All items sold at or above their auction estimates, except for a couple of items that didn’t meet the minimum reserve,” Altieri adds.

You May Want to Get Used to That","content":"\n\u003cp\u003eInvestors who feel like they\u0026#8217;ve been riding a rollercoaster this past month in the U.S. stock market may not want to unbuckle their seat belts just yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFollowing several relatively tranquil months when the S\u0026amp;P 500, recovering from a \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2018/12/21/dow-worst-week-10-years-santa-claus-rally/\"\u003ebrutal selloff\u003c/a\u003e in late 2018, quietly notched higher and higher levels, August brought back a sense of uncertainty to the stock market—and with it, the \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/28/understanding-recent-stock-market-volatility/\"\u003evolatile price swings\u003c/a\u003e that come when investors grow more jittery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd jittery they are. Stock volatility is often measured by the Chicago Board of Exchange\u0026#8217;s \u003ca href=\"http://www.cboe.com/vix\"\u003eVolatility Index\u003c/a\u003e, or VIX. The VIX rose as high as 24.59 in early August and has hovered just below the 20 level since then. That\u0026#8217;s not as high as the 36 level the VIX reached last December, but it reflects a higher volatility than U.S. stocks have seen so far in 2019. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTypically, the last weeks of summer vacation before Labor Day weekend is a sleepy period for stocks as traders and investors go on vacation, pulling down trading levels. But trading volume on shares in the S\u0026amp;P 500 has been higher during the past month, averaging 3.69 billion shares a day. During the first seven months of 2018, trading volume averaged 3.65 billion per day. That suggests that recent stock volatility is being driven by more than summer vacations. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;Volatility can be exacerbated by low trading volumes, but overall volume for the month was above average for August,\u0026#8221; says Matt Thompson, managing partner at Thompson Capital Management. \u0026#8220;I think the main culprit was the trade war escalation,\u0026#8221; which, he says, \u0026#8220;carries potentially substantial longer-term implications.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;We\u0026#8217;re not in a particularly high volatility regime by historical standards,\u0026#8221; adds Craig Lazzara, managing director of index investing strategy at S\u0026amp;P Dow Jones Indices. \u0026#8220;That being said, there are obvious fundamental uncertainties in the markets\u0026#8230;that are potential sources of volatility.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn other words, a few dark clouds that are hovering over the summer stock market may have prompted some traders to get off their beach towels and back into the market.

Analysts expect a substantial fall of 3.1% for the Q3. If that forecast is correct, the earnings-per-share for the S\u0026amp;P 500 will slide by around 1 percentage point through the first three quarters of this year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the FactSet data eliminates special charges in calculating EPS, S\u0026amp;P records both operating and GAAP net income. Its data shows that GAAP earnings are still growing, though at a crawl compared with the headlong sprint over the last few years. The curve started to flatten in Q1, and over the first three quarters of this year, profits have expanded at just 4%, down from the 25% romp from from the January to September period in 2018 versus 2017. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo get a reasonable take on how profits are faring, we\u0026#8217;ll average the two readings for the first three quarters: the FactSet decline of 1%, and the S\u0026amp;P\u0026#8217;s 4% positive figure. That formula suggests growth in the range of just 1.5%, about equal to inflation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTaken together, the S\u0026amp;P and FactSet data suggest we\u0026#8217;re entering a new era of flat or low-single digit growth in EPS, following three-and-half years of double-digit increases through last year\u0026#8217;s September quarter. That\u0026#8217;s potentially bad news for stocks, a danger signal for the U.S. economy and a sign that the trade war is already begun exacting a toll that can only be expected to grow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe slowdown is particularly worrisome because the S\u0026amp;P stalwarts have only succeeded in keeping EPS flat or rising slightly by repurchasing shares at record rates. According to research by Yardeni Research, the 500 are now spending the equivalent of 63% of their operating earnings on buybacks, net of newly issued shares. By my reckoning, that equates to roughly 55% of their GAAP net profits. Hence, America\u0026#8217;s largest companies are marshaling that cash to shrink their share count by around 2.5% a year. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAll told, America\u0026#8217;s largest companies are paying out a sums equal to something like 95% of their net profits in repurchases and dividends. But it\u0026#8217;s well known that they\u0026#8217;re borrowing a big chunk of the buyback cash on the pretext that their stocks is a great buy at current prices, a questionable view since the S\u0026amp;P is selling at an expensive price-to-earnings multiple of 21.7. It\u0026#8217;s likely that the 500 are using borrowed money for around one-third of the repurchases, and funding the rest with 25% of net profits. They\u0026#8217;re also retaining around one-third of GAAP earnings, and plowing that money back into expansion via new plants and R\u0026amp;D facilities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eGiven that backdrop, the flagging earnings picture points to three big problems:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe S\u0026amp;P is only able to keep EPS flat or rising a touch by buying back shares at rates never before witnessed. That means total profits aren\u0026#8217;t increasing at all; a flat or declining total are being split among fewer shares outstanding.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eTo keep EPS from declining, companies are borrowing heavily to repurchase shares. They\u0026#8217;re not able to fund the extra buybacks with rising profits because profits aren\u0026#8217;t rising much if at all. Instead, they\u0026#8217;re taking on more debt, and using a bigger share of their earnings, to pay for repurchases. The leveraging is especially severe because they\u0026#8217;re also issuing around $150 billion in shares each year, including shares arising from newly-vested options from awards granted to the corporate brass. As a result, they\u0026#8217;re spending $700 billion a year to reduce their share counts by the equivalent of $550 billion, since the other $150 billion goes to offsetting dilution. Adding all that debt makes companies riskier by sapping the cash available to cushion a downturn. It also exacts a burden in higher interest payments––curbing the cash flow that services their increasing debt.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eIt\u0026#8217;s important to note that the 500 are still retaining something like one-third of their net profits, money they\u0026#8217;re re-investing to expand their businesses. But they\u0026#8217;re earning minuscule returns on those dollars of retained earnings. That represents a fundamental shift in the profit picture. Over the past several years, the main driver was huge gains, often 20% or more, on profits plowed back into the business. Now, it appears that the 500 are getting no help from reinvested earnings, meaning returns on newly-added equity are trending towards zero. Instead, it\u0026#8217;s the buyback splurge that accounts for all the entire, sluggish advance in earnings-per-share.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf those rates of returns stay low, and the shift is already underway, profits won\u0026#8217;t grow. Wall Street will lose its rationale for ever-rising share prices. Flat or falling profits won\u0026#8217;t support today\u0026#8217;s rich valuations, raising the chances of a severe downdraft. That profit trend has two main causes. The first is cyclical. For years, U.S. enterprises produced a lot more goods and services with fewer people, and at the same time, skimped on wages, so that more and more gains went to shareholders rather than workers. In today\u0026#8217;s tight labor market, wages are rising briskly, and companies, stretched to the limit in an expanding economy, have rapidly padded their workforces. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe second reason is the trade war that\u0026#8217;s imposed tariffs of 10% to 25% on tens of billions of the Chinese imports. That\u0026#8217;s raising prices, and lowering sales, for the Chinese shoes and smart phones that our companies sell in the U.S., and inflating prices of the components essential to the products they offer here and around the world. The levies China has imposed in retaliation are hammering our exports of everything from soybeans to steel. If the move towards erecting tariff walls, not just on China, but other trading partners as well, becomes entrenched, U.S. companies face perilous, uncharted territory of lower returns on capital, and intense pressure on profits, for years to come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTaken together, it\u0026#8217;s hard to see how the heady times we\u0026#8217;ve enjoyed in the stock market continue much longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eMore must-read stories from \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—\u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/21/thirdlove-tech-diversity-women/\"\u003eA rare tech company where women dominate\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e—Why \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/20/wework-ipo-s-and-p-500/\"\u003eWeWork won’t be in the S\u0026amp;P 500\u003c/a\u003e after its IPO\u003cbr\u003e—Is it “only human” to feel anxious about money? \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/02/sofia-the-robot-finance-investing-interview/\"\u003eTalking finance with Sophia the Robot\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e—\u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/16/europes-cyber-watchdog-for-banks-has-a-little-problem-it-keeps-getting-hacked/\"\u003eEurope’s cyber watchdog for banks has a problem\u003c/a\u003e—it keeps getting hacked\u003cbr\u003e—Listen to our audio briefing, \u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/radio/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e 500 Daily\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://flipboard.com/@fortune\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eFollow Fortune on Flipboard\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e to stay up-to-date on the latest news and analysis.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://fortune.com/2019/08/31/stock-market-corporate-earnings-flat-bad-news/","published":"2019-08-31T12:00:19Z","guid":"https://fortune.com/?p=2690687"},{"title":"Winemakers in New York’s Finger Lakes Region Are Moving Beyond Riesling","content":"\n\u003cp\u003eJust as \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2018/10/27/california-wine-country-napa-valley/\"\u003eNapa Valley\u003c/a\u003e is indelibly associated with Cabernet Sauvignon, New York’s Finger Lakes are deeply connected to \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/07/21/german-dry-wine-producers/\"\u003eRiesling\u003c/a\u003e. Among vinifera—the species of grape that includes all the well-known, traditional, winemaking varieties—Riesling leads by a country mile, so the Finger Lakes looks like a definitive white wine area. In fact, two of the top four vinifera varieties grown there are red. Recently more and more of these red wines are getting their time in the sun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“There were already some around, and some were already very good, but I started to notice more after the excellent 2010 vintage,” says Paul Brady of the New York Wine \u0026amp; Grape Foundation. “I think most winemakers would tell you what we’re experiencing right now comes from the combination of much-improved winemaking and viticultural practices post-2010.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMaster sommelier Christopher Bates began producing red wines—Pinot Noir, Cabernet Franc, and Syrah, in particular—at Element Winery in the Finger Lakes almost 10 years ago. “I grew up being told that the region couldn’t make great wine,” Bates says. “That the climate wasn’t right for making serious wines.” After working vintages in \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/longform/germany-pinot-noir/\"\u003eGermany\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/longform/sparkling-wine-prosecco-bubbly-italy/\"\u003eItaly\u003c/a\u003e, he realized there was a misconception. It was long thought that the region was just too cold for the vinifera species, especially for red grapes. Bates says the growing season is warm enough; the problem is that vinifera varieties, white and red, struggle to survive the winter. “Winters are expensive,” Bates says. The vines need protection; often that means burying the roots, which is labor-intensive, or investing in wind machines that keep cold air from settling around the vines. “It also means making sure our vines are healthy going into winter, making sure we aren’t overcropping in the summer.” More crops mean more wine to sell, so opting to keep yields low costs money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Riesling-Vines-Yellow-Leaves.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Heart \u0026amp; Hands Riesling Vines Finger Lakes Region\" class=\"wp-image-2690122\" srcset=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Riesling-Vines-Yellow-Leaves.jpg 2880w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Riesling-Vines-Yellow-Leaves.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Riesling-Vines-Yellow-Leaves.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Riesling-Vines-Yellow-Leaves.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Riesling-Vines-Yellow-Leaves.jpg?resize=1024,683 1024w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Riesling-Vines-Yellow-Leaves.jpg?resize=281,187 281w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Riesling-Vines-Yellow-Leaves.jpg?resize=755,503 755w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Riesling-Vines-Yellow-Leaves.jpg?resize=100,67 100w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Riesling-Vines-Yellow-Leaves.jpg?resize=60,40 60w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Riesling-Vines-Yellow-Leaves.jpg?resize=154,103 154w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Riesling-Vines-Yellow-Leaves.jpg?resize=591,394 591w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Riesling-Vines-Yellow-Leaves.jpg?resize=392,261 392w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Riesling-Vines-Yellow-Leaves.jpg?resize=252,168 252w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Riesling-Vines-Yellow-Leaves.jpg?resize=697,465 697w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Riesling-Vines-Yellow-Leaves.jpg?resize=234,156 234w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Riesling-Vines-Yellow-Leaves.jpg?resize=500,333 500w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Riesling-Vines-Yellow-Leaves.jpg?resize=578,385 578w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Riesling-Vines-Yellow-Leaves.jpg?resize=600,400 600w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Riesling-Vines-Yellow-Leaves.jpg?resize=90,60 90w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Riesling-Vines-Yellow-Leaves.jpg?resize=185,123 185w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Riesling-Vines-Yellow-Leaves.jpg?resize=115,77 115w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Riesling-Vines-Yellow-Leaves.jpg?resize=738,492 738w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Riesling-Vines-Yellow-Leaves.jpg?resize=777,518 777w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2880px) 100vw, 2880px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eRiesling vines at Heart \u0026#038; Hands winery.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"image-credit\"\u003eCourtesy of Heart \u0026#038; Hands\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBates is part of a new wave of winemakers with business models focused on premium wines unsupported by the cash flow of a cheaper tier of easy-drinking, often sweet wines. Tom and Susan Higgins do much the same at Heart \u0026amp; Hands winery, which they founded in 2006. Focusing on Pinot Noir and Riesling in their tasting room, they don’t offer any of the cheap crowd-pleasers that were the mainstay of the region’s wine tourism for years. But banks balked at supporting such a nonconventional business model for the area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, a new wave of wine tourism was imminent. “In the past people were coming to the area, and wine was a secondary thought. They were coming to spend time on the water and might spend a day wine tasting,” Susan Higgins says. “Now we see people coming specifically for the wine.” At its tasting room, Heart \u0026amp; Hands appeals to these more serious wine drinkers by offering the chance to taste and contrast Pinot Noir from specific vineyards, or wines made from different clones of the variety. These more technical tastings assume a level of connoisseurship. Some newer producers skip the tasting-room model entirely, which means their wines have to compete on the shelf against wines from all over the world, without the help of a beautiful view.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Picking-Pinot-1.jpg?w=819\" alt=\"Heart \u0026amp; Hands Susan Higgins Picking Pinot Noir grapes\" class=\"wp-image-2690125\" srcset=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Picking-Pinot-1.jpg 1920w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Picking-Pinot-1.jpg?resize=120,150 120w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Picking-Pinot-1.jpg?resize=240,300 240w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Picking-Pinot-1.jpg?resize=768,960 768w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Picking-Pinot-1.jpg?resize=819,1024 819w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Picking-Pinot-1.jpg?resize=170,212 170w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Picking-Pinot-1.jpg?resize=402,503 402w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Picking-Pinot-1.jpg?resize=80,100 80w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Picking-Pinot-1.jpg?resize=48,60 48w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Picking-Pinot-1.jpg?resize=123,154 123w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Picking-Pinot-1.jpg?resize=864,1080 864w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Picking-Pinot-1.jpg?resize=315,394 315w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Picking-Pinot-1.jpg?resize=392,490 392w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Picking-Pinot-1.jpg?resize=134,168 134w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Picking-Pinot-1.jpg?resize=372,465 372w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Picking-Pinot-1.jpg?resize=125,156 125w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Picking-Pinot-1.jpg?resize=266,333 266w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Picking-Pinot-1.jpg?resize=308,385 308w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Picking-Pinot-1.jpg?resize=600,750 600w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Picking-Pinot-1.jpg?resize=90,113 90w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Picking-Pinot-1.jpg?resize=98,123 98w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Picking-Pinot-1.jpg?resize=115,144 115w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Picking-Pinot-1.jpg?resize=394,492 394w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Picking-Pinot-1.jpg?resize=414,518 414w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eHeart \u0026#038; Hands co-owner Susan Higgins picks Pinot Noir grapes.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"image-credit\"\u003eCourtesy of Heart \u0026#038; Hands\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePinot Noir prefers cooler growing conditions, so it makes sense that producers in the Finger Lakes are exploring it. Still, there are only 179 acres planted. Higgins says it lives up to its reputation as a difficult variety, and farmers are less interested because it yields fewer grapes—an important factor if you’re being paid by the ton. But the quality and character is clear. “They don’t have the power of California Pinots, with the heftiness and alcohol,” Higgins says. “We allow Pinot to still be in a balanced state. Most of the Pinots I see are between 12.5% and 13.5% alcohol. They usually have a beautiful edge of acid, and they have this beauty and grace.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePinot Noir is not the most-planted red vinifera grape in the Finger Lakes. “The Pinots I’ve tasted recently have been much more impressive, but there’s been fewer of them,” says Christy Frank, owner of Copake Wine Works, a retail wine shop in the Hudson Valley. “The focus definitely seems to be more on Cabernet Franc, which from what I’ve tasted is a good thing.” Today there are 221 acres of Cabernet Franc in the Finger Lakes, more than other vinifera red variety. “Cabernet Franc is the darling red grape of the whole state,” Brady says. “New York is \u003cem\u003ethe\u003c/em\u003e place to find excellent expressions of Cabernet Franc second to none other than the Loire Valley,” where the grape originated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sorting-grapes.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Sorting grapes at Heart \u0026amp; Hands\" class=\"wp-image-2690134\" srcset=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sorting-grapes.jpg 4928w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sorting-grapes.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sorting-grapes.jpg?resize=300,199 300w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sorting-grapes.jpg?resize=768,509 768w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sorting-grapes.jpg?resize=1024,678 1024w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sorting-grapes.jpg?resize=281,186 281w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sorting-grapes.jpg?resize=759,503 759w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sorting-grapes.jpg?resize=100,66 100w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sorting-grapes.jpg?resize=60,40 60w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sorting-grapes.jpg?resize=154,102 154w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sorting-grapes.jpg?resize=595,394 595w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sorting-grapes.jpg?resize=392,260 392w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sorting-grapes.jpg?resize=252,168 252w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sorting-grapes.jpg?resize=697,462 697w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sorting-grapes.jpg?resize=234,156 234w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sorting-grapes.jpg?resize=500,331 500w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sorting-grapes.jpg?resize=578,383 578w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sorting-grapes.jpg?resize=600,397 600w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sorting-grapes.jpg?resize=90,60 90w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sorting-grapes.jpg?resize=91,60 91w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sorting-grapes.jpg?resize=186,123 186w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sorting-grapes.jpg?resize=115,76 115w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sorting-grapes.jpg?resize=743,492 743w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sorting-grapes.jpg?resize=782,518 782w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 4928px) 100vw, 4928px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eSorting grapes used in Heart \u0026#038; Hands’ Pinot Noir. \u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"image-credit\"\u003eCourtesy of Heart \u0026#038; Hands\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are other contenders. “I have a store where I have the luxury of selling the quirky stuff,” says Frank. “I think they should all be making Lemberger,” a German red variety which has found a home in some Finger Lakes vineyards. Frank says the grape, also known by its Austrian name, Blaufränkisch, makes an enjoyable dry, maybe less serious, wine. “It’s got good fruit,” she says. “It’s got nice spice, and it’s got a nice little touch of earthiness. It’s just a really happy grape that people like to drink once they get it in their mouth and don’t have to worry about pronouncing it.” It also handles cold winters quite well. Elsewhere, wineries like Red Tail Ridge are making exciting wines from similarly Alpine varieties like Teroldego and Lagrein, both of which originally hail from northern Italy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf things have changed on the ground in the Finger Lakes, U.S. wine drinkers have also changed to meet them. “Certain styles of wine that the critics were promoting back in the [1990s] and early 2000s, those are not the wines that we make,” Bates says. “High-alcohol, high-extraction wines: That is just not the Finger Lakes.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eToday, those critics are less influential, and wine drinkers are finding a renewed appreciation for more restrained styles. “A lot of wines from warmer climates just come right to you—they’re generous in sharing who they are,” says Yannick Benjamin, sommelier for the University Club in Manhattan. “For the Finger Lakes reds, you really have to put your nose in there and really search for these things. I don’t mean that in a bad way; they’re just more cerebral, with really delicate aromas, earthier components, tobacco notes, cedar.

(It’s slated for release sometime in the next three years, Hofmann says.) And in June 2020, Westland will release a whiskey distilled from a barley varietal named Alba, one not commonly used in whiskey distillation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAlba is not alone. Out of as many as 45,000 varietals of barley in the world, the whiskey industry uses just a handful. Most single-malt whiskey makers—including the \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/longform/oysters-scotch-whisky-whiskey/\"\u003evast majority of those in Scotland\u003c/a\u003e—purchase their malt from just a few big malting operations, which in turn source a specific grain with very particular characteristics (high yield and low cost among them) from farmers. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFarmers, therefore, grow this very specific barley they know they can sell to the malthouses, and the result is essentially a monoculture in which every major distillery is forced by the economics of the industry to use one of a few similar base ingredients. To differentiate their whiskeys they rely on distillation processes and aging techniques rather than raw ingredients. Barley, many distillers agree, doesn’t have a significant impact on flavor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Westland_Distillery_Skagit_Valley_Barley_3.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2683937\" srcset=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Westland_Distillery_Skagit_Valley_Barley_3.jpg 1920w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Westland_Distillery_Skagit_Valley_Barley_3.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Westland_Distillery_Skagit_Valley_Barley_3.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Westland_Distillery_Skagit_Valley_Barley_3.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Westland_Distillery_Skagit_Valley_Barley_3.jpg?resize=1024,683 1024w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Westland_Distillery_Skagit_Valley_Barley_3.jpg?resize=281,187 281w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Westland_Distillery_Skagit_Valley_Barley_3.jpg?resize=755,503 755w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Westland_Distillery_Skagit_Valley_Barley_3.jpg?resize=100,67 100w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Westland_Distillery_Skagit_Valley_Barley_3.jpg?resize=60,40 60w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Westland_Distillery_Skagit_Valley_Barley_3.jpg?resize=154,103 154w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Westland_Distillery_Skagit_Valley_Barley_3.jpg?resize=591,394 591w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Westland_Distillery_Skagit_Valley_Barley_3.jpg?resize=392,261 392w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Westland_Distillery_Skagit_Valley_Barley_3.jpg?resize=252,168 252w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Westland_Distillery_Skagit_Valley_Barley_3.jpg?resize=697,465 697w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Westland_Distillery_Skagit_Valley_Barley_3.jpg?resize=234,156 234w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Westland_Distillery_Skagit_Valley_Barley_3.jpg?resize=500,333 500w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Westland_Distillery_Skagit_Valley_Barley_3.jpg?resize=578,385 578w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Westland_Distillery_Skagit_Valley_Barley_3.jpg?resize=600,400 600w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Westland_Distillery_Skagit_Valley_Barley_3.jpg?resize=90,60 90w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Westland_Distillery_Skagit_Valley_Barley_3.jpg?resize=185,123 185w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Westland_Distillery_Skagit_Valley_Barley_3.jpg?resize=115,77 115w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Westland_Distillery_Skagit_Valley_Barley_3.jpg?resize=738,492 738w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Westland_Distillery_Skagit_Valley_Barley_3.jpg?resize=777,518 777w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eBarley fields in the Skagit Valley, Washington State.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"image-credit\"\u003eWestland Distillery\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis is the point Hawley finds preposterous and Hofmann seeks to challenge.

Lamb eventually left, and Rémy Cointreau came aboard in 2016. But Hofmann’s most important partnerships have arguably been the ones he’s established in the Skagit Valley, where a group of farmers, maltsters, and geneticists have coalesced around his vision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“We believe flavors can come through,” says Steve Jones, director of Washington State University’s Bread Lab, a hybrid science lab and test kitchen devoted to the research and application of new wheat, barley, and other small grain varietals. “We know they do in breads and other things, but are they coming through in whiskey?

And it’s spurred the Federal Reserve into laying the groundwork for a new, tech-enabled infrastructure that promises a drastically quicker, more efficient path for commerce.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe world of real-time payments is no longer a pipe dream of the near-future. In many respects, it’s already here—and the financial system is now braced for an unprecedented wave of innovation that will change the way both consumers and businesses transact with one another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ve built a business over 50 years in credit cards, and making something complex really simple,” Michael Miebach, Mastercard’s chief product and innovation officer, tells \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e. “But if we want to be a relevant partner to our customers, we cannot just say that cards are the answer to everything. It comes down to solving the needs of an individual customer; if they want speed in payments, we need instant payments.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is this strategy that has guided a slew of acquisitions by Mastercard in the payments space in recent years—from its 2016 purchase of U.K.-based Vocalink to its deals this year for New York-based fintech firms Transactis and Transfast. Those acquisitions are designed to help Mastercard capitalize on advancements made in the real-time payments space, which took a big step forward with the 2017 launch of The Clearing House’s RTP platform.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eVocalink helped develop the RTP’s infrastructure, which now facilitates real-time transactions between The Clearing House’s consortium of member banks, as well as payment platforms like Zelle and Venmo that are plugged into the RTP system.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSteve Ledford, The Clearing House’s senior vice president of product and strategy, said the RTP’s development was informed by advancements made in real-time payments in places like the United Kingdom, which launched its own Faster Payments Service (FPS) in 2008. By most accounts, Europe has been ahead of the U.S. in adopting real-time payments technology—something that stakeholders are looking to change in the coming years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“What we wanted to do was create a payment system that was very fast and efficient, and took advantage of mobile [banking] access,” Ledford says. “The money is in the recipient’s account immediately; if you send a payment, within seconds you’ll get confirmation that the money not only made it to the financial institution, but is in the account of the recipient.” That’s enabled the RTP to make life easier for both businesses and consumers when it comes to everything from bill payments to payroll services.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the space is primed to take yet another leap with the Federal Reserve’s announcement that it is developing a real-time payments system of its own. FedNow, which is expected to launch by 2024, would be similar to the RTP platform; yet while The Clearing House’s real-time payments infrastructure claims a 51% share among U.S. checking accounts, FedNow is expected to target a more universal reach across the nation’s banking system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWith that in mind, Mastercard shelled out for Nets with the goal of bolstering its payments infrastructure and garnering “more firepower to offer solutions to our customers,” Miebach says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“The real reason we bought [Nets] is the technology they’ve built, which we think is built for purpose around the rest of the world,” he notes. “You want state-of-the-art, real-time, 24/7 kinds of systems that can get the money to a given point at any time of the day.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe business-to-business realm, in particular, is one area where Mastercard has seen the need for newer, more efficient solutions. Miebach says the company took a deep-dive examination into global “payment flows” between businesses several years ago and found that “the majority of B2B payments are happening not on cards, but from one bank account to another—and, to a large degree, with checks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat means there’s significant room for improvement in the means by which businesses transact with one another, as well as with their customers. And with mobile, electronic methods of payment only expected to become more prevalent in recent years, there’s a significant opportunity for payment providers to get ahead of the cashless, cardless world of the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“In the end, consumer demand is what shifts behaviors in the market,” according to Miebach. “With the Fed coming in [via FedNow], I think that just proves that real-time payments are a real thing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eMore must-read stories from \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—\u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/21/thirdlove-tech-diversity-women/\"\u003eA rare tech company where women dominate\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e—Why \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/20/wework-ipo-s-and-p-500/\"\u003eWeWork won’t be in the S\u0026amp;P 500\u003c/a\u003e after its IPO\u003cbr\u003e—Is it “only human” to feel anxious about money? \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/02/sofia-the-robot-finance-investing-interview/\"\u003eTalking finance with Sophia the Robot\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e—\u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/16/europes-cyber-watchdog-for-banks-has-a-little-problem-it-keeps-getting-hacked/\"\u003eEurope’s cyber watchdog for banks has a problem\u003c/a\u003e—it keeps getting hacked\u003cbr\u003e—Listen to our audio briefing, \u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/radio/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e 500 Daily\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://flipboard.com/@fortune\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eFollow Fortune on Flipboard\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e to stay up-to-date on the latest news and analysis.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://fortune.com/2019/08/31/real-time-payments-mastercard/","published":"2019-08-31T10:30:25Z","guid":"https://fortune.com/?p=2690854"},{"title":"How China’s Casino Enclave of Macau Could Become a Bargaining Chip in the U.S. Trade War","content":"\n\u003cp\u003eLast week, in a violent Twitter storm, President Donald Trump “ordered” U.S. companies to leave China and return home as tensions in the U.S.-China trade war ratcheted up, with both sides warning of new rounds of tariffs ahead.

But after the Portuguese colony was returned to Chinese sovereignty in 1999, one of the first actions by the new administration was to end Ho\u0026#8217;s reign, during which time Macau had descended into a den of vice where gangs operated as loansharks and debt collectors.

Bowen is also a trustee for the Foundation for Economic Education (FEE).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBowen describes being top down and thematic, which allows him to take a very long term perspective. The Pension Fund Board of the City of Tampa has a 20 year timeline for the pension fund. The fund looks at Trade, Monetary, Tax, Fiscal, and Foreign policies, and what these government actions might mean to financial assets, including stocks and bonds, and inflation. When he took over the fund from his father, he said all of the bloody fights had been done, and all he had to do was keep running the same sorts of analyses that the firm had always done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBowen notes that there has not been a 20-year rolling period that has not included: a bull market, a bear market, a speculative bubble and a war in the past century.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe believes the consulting industry has a stranglehold on pension funds and municipalities\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBowen reads lots of history, biographies, and class American novels; some of his favorite books \u003ca href=\"https://ritholtz.com/2019/08/mib-jay-bowen/#more-231310\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eare here\u003c/a\u003e; A transcript of our conversation will be \u003ca href=\"https://ritholtz.com/2019/09/transcript-jay-bowen/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eavailable here\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can stream/download the full conversation, including the podcast extras on \u003ca href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/jay-bowen-discusses-pension-fund-management/id730188152?i=1000448043749\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eApple iTunes\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://overcast.fm/+JVs4R9qe0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eOvercast\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/1cTshjEp7vW74DzkrvZ5hd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eSpotify\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://podcasts.google.com/?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5ibG9vbWJlcmcuZm0vQkxNODg2NDQwMzI4OA%3D%3D\u0026amp;episode=YjkwZDgzYzQtYzlkYy0xMWU5LWE3MjItM2ZhMGRjM2UzYjAy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eGoogle Podcasts\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2019-08-28/jay-bowen-discusses-pension-fund-management-podcast\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eBloomberg\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/masters-in-business/e/63534441?autoplay=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eStitcher\u003c/a\u003e.

I think they are geniuses, but the mobile platform hasn\u0026#8217;t been super kind to poor Simogo. Constant software and hardware changes have made keeping their existing games up and running a headache, and the nature of pricing on the App Store means that even their most critically acclaimed titles aren\u0026#8217;t exactly ensuring they have a secure future in game development. So in December of 2017 Simogo more or less \u003ca href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2017/12/11/simogo-is-the-latest-developer-to-pull-out-of-mobile/\"\u003ebowed out of the mobile arena\u003c/a\u003e, with their new game tentatively titled \u003cem\u003eProject Night Road\u003c/em\u003e being developed exclusively for consoles and PC.

And \u003cem\u003eSayonara Wild Hearts\u003c/em\u003e, to no surprise, is also shaping up to be another genre-defying piece of art from Simogo. It\u0026#8217;s been described as a \u0026#8220;pop album video game\" and as you can see in our lengthy demo from PAX West 2019 this weekend, that seems like an apt description. The gameplay is constantly changing, the soundtrack is weaved seamlessly into the action, and the visuals feel delightfully drug-induced. It\u0026#8217;s a total trip. Look for this one to launch alongside Apple Arcade at a date that will most likely be unveiled during Apple\u0026#8217;s upcoming iPhone event happening September 10th.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"clear:both;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"video-responsive\"\u003e\n\t\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rVZV3TrXvX4\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://toucharcade.com/2019/08/31/pax-west-2019-sayonara-wild-hearts/","published":"2019-08-31T19:00:37Z","guid":"https://toucharcade.com/?p=257673"},{"title":"PAX West 2019: ‘Nibblity’ is an Augmented Reality Virtual Pet Real World Scavenger Hunt Mashup","content":"\u003cp\u003eAugmented reality is a tech that seems like it\u0026#8217;s still trying to find its place in gaming.

In fact a \u003cem\u003eDead Cells\u003c/em\u003e mobile port had been rumored and even partially leaked at various points since that initial launch, with many folks exclaiming that there\u0026#8217;s no possible way such a demanding game could ever work on the touchscreen. Well this week \u003cem\u003eDead Cells\u003c/em\u003e finally did arrive on iOS, so were those concerns warranted?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/626x0w-25.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"462\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-257666\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/626x0w-25.jpg 1000w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/626x0w-25-300x139.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/626x0w-25-768x355.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026#8217;s a tough question to answer. One thing I can say for sure is that I think everyone would agree that \u003cem\u003eDead Cells\u003c/em\u003e plays WAY better on the touchscreen than anyone ever imagined that it could. The talented folks at Playdigious, who have a fantastic track record of bringing games to mobile that people never thought could work on the platform, were tasked with making \u003cem\u003eDead Cells\u003c/em\u003e enjoyable to play with virtual controls. \u003ca href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2019/05/07/dead-cells-mobile-blog-post/\"\u003eAnd they put a lot of thought into it\u003c/a\u003e. The end result is a game that 90% of the time plays just fine on the touchscreen, and paired with a physical controller, plays just as well as on other platforms. It\u0026#8217;s really a remarkable achievement in my opinion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat other 10% of the time will be subjective. You\u0026#8217;ll very likely encounter moments where you take damage or even outright die because you fumbled with the virtual controls. The nature of \u003cem\u003eDead Cells\u003c/em\u003e makes this not such a big deal, as it\u0026#8217;s a game designed for you to die over and over and over again as you slowly unlock new items and gain new abilities and make it JUST a bit further each time you play. Yeah, if you have a killer run going and are loaded up with all sorts of awesome weapons and abilities, and then that run comes to an abrupt end because the controls failed you, that can be frustrating. But those moments seem surprisingly few and far between. More often I find myself dying because I\u0026#8217;m an idiot and made a poor decision, not because the touchscreen controls failed me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"clear:both;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"video-responsive\"\u003e\n\t\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/c9DlDsGH8tY\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026#8217;s also plenty of options to tailor those controls to your specific tastes. Change the size and position of any virtual button to your liking, or choose a floating or fixed virtual analog stick. There\u0026#8217;s also an option to have your character automatically perform melee attacks when up close to an enemy, and an option to map dodge rolls to a swipe gesture rather than a separate virtual button. I feel like even the pickiest players will be able to find some combination of control options that will suit their needs just fine. I feel a little silly spending so much time talking about controls when \u003cem\u003eDead Cells\u003c/em\u003e itself is one of the best video games I\u0026#8217;ve played in my entire life. It\u0026#8217;s a masterpiece.

them both as the same app, which no doubt aligns Blizzard\u0026#8217;s plan in that because they do not want proof that their old game is more popular than their new.  You don\u0026#8217;t want an

at all.  I went through and changed a good chunk of them as I passed through the quiz once again, but never by more than one notch either direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBasically, my mood at the moment could alter many of my answers at least somewhat, to the point that I am pretty sure if you wiped all my answers and had me take the survey again in a week, the results would change some.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut for an afternoon in August, that was how I was feeling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd at the end of the survey the site offers up some games that might appeal to you based on what other people taking it who scored similarly to you ranked as their favorite games.  My top game was \u003cem\u003eNo Man\u0026#8217;s Sky\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeems appropriate.  I actually own it, having picked it up in a Steam sale.  Couldn\u0026#8217;t get past the forever loading screens though.  Maybe that has gotten better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe game recommendations come in three levels.  To get an MMO result I had to select \u0026#8220;niche\u0026#8221; as a parameter, because MMOs remain a niche genre.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, if you want to take the survey as well, you can \u003ca href=\"https://apps.quanticfoundry.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003efind

He's been on the straight and narrow for several years now, but Jack still gives Ashley a cell phone so she can call him if she needs him—like when her dad forgets to pick her up from the movies after dark. One day Jack gets a panicked phone call from Ashley, and rushes to his brother's house, only to find Garrett has shot his wife and daughter, and then himself, apparently in the midst of a manic episode.

them both as the same app, which no doubt aligns Blizzard\u0026#8217;s plan in that because they do not want proof that their old game is more popular than their new.  You don\u0026#8217;t want an

that has gotten better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe game recommendations come in three levels.  To get an MMO result I had to select \u0026#8220;niche\u0026#8221; as a parameter, because MMOs

Kid-size beds have since been mostly consigned to kids—minus one notable exception: college dorms. Of course, the college-dorm mattress is no standard twin, but what's known as the twin extra-long (XL), five inches longer than its traditional counterpart. The twin XL has a twin-size width—helpful given dorm rooms' limited space—and its king-size length, presumably, is a bone thrown to the comfort of students whose bodies are, after all, adult-size.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTwin XLs are so specific to colleges that some families begin the college-preparation process having never heard of the size.

The San Francisco designer, played by Christina Milian, begins the film with a clear routine in place: virtual-reality-assisted stationary cycling, strict yoga sessions, grueling hours at a firm run by unappreciative blockheads, and carb-free dinner dates with her similarly vacuous beau, Dean (Jeffrey Bowyer-Chapman). But the familiar demands of this hustle wear on Gabriela, and soon she’s forced into a dramatic shift: Her company suddenly loses all its investors, and she breaks up with Dean after realizing he’ll never commit to her.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe dream of \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/07/why-women-still-cant-have-it-all/309020/?utm_source=feed\"\u003ehaving it all\u003c/a\u003e wrested from her within a single week, Gabriela consoles herself with a Nancy Meyers–level volume of wine and enters an email competition offering entrants the chance to win a historic New Zealand inn. Bleary-eyed the next morning, she discovers she’s the improbable awardee. So begins her journey to entrepreneurship, love, and some much-needed Zen, all against the picturesque backdrop of Beechwood Downs. There are few surprises here, but plenty of revelations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nRepeatedly, the film emphasizes the healing (and romantic) potential of its protagonist’s turn away from the constant rat race of professional life in San Francisco. It shares DNA with another recent Netflix original, the Ali Wong–led rom-com \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/alisonwillmore/always-be-my-maybe-ali-wong-randall-park-long-shot-seth\"\u003eAlways Be My Maybe\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e. In that film, the actor and comedian plays Sasha Tran, a celebrity chef whose failed engagement to another industry power player allows her to rediscover surprising feelings for an estranged childhood friend (an HVAC technician played by Randall Park). Neither movie explicitly pits its protagonist’s professional aspirations against her ability to find romance, but both gently nudge their characters away from the pitfalls of constant toiling. Work isn’t the problem; the culture of obsession that surrounds it is.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIn \u003cem\u003eFalling Inn Love\u003c/em\u003e, Gabriela ultimately finds herself smitten by Jake (Adam Demos), the handsome contractor who helps her rehabilitate the inn. Jake teases her about her apparent refusal to consider that life in New Zealand could be more than just a break from the frenetic stateside pace she’s accustomed to. This isn’t a groundbreaking admonishment, nor is it a new tension to emerge in a rom-com pairing. \u003cem\u003eSomething New\u003c/em\u003e (2006), for example, saw the accountant Kenyan (Sanaa Lathan) shocked to find herself falling for her landscaper, Brian (Simon Baker).

They are young, capable, hyper-focused, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/annehelenpetersen/millennials-burnout-generation-debt-work\"\u003eseriously burned out\u003c/a\u003e Millennials. The films critique the Bay Area workaholism most explicitly through the women’s romantic partners. \u003cem\u003eAlways Be My Maybe\u003c/em\u003e’s Marcus, Sasha’s onetime friend and future lover, takes aim at the corporate artifice he sees her participating in. “Does it get tiring doing that?” he asks Sasha early in the film; while adjusting a vent in her massive home, he has overheard her on a business call. “It’s just funny because I know it’s not you, that voice.”\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nIn Gabriela’s case, Jake expresses an even broader skepticism based on cultural differences in addition to temperamental ones. When Gabriela’s old boss calls her to offer her a job that would require her to move back to the Bay Area—“Finish up your Habitat for Hobbits and get on a plane” is how he puts it—Jake is shocked that his love interest (who’s also become his business partner) would consider such a regression. “Why would you want to work for a jerk like that?” he asks, before continuing the line of inquiry: “So that’s it? Back to America, back to the hamster wheel, working for some soulless corporation.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe conversation leads to an icy split between the two. When Dean arrives following a sneaky scheme from a rival innkeeper, he offers to help sell Gabriela and Jake’s rehabbed inn to a foreign investor while simultaneously mocking the pair for their HGTV-esque efforts: “So you’re like a regular Chip and Joanna Gaines, huh?” he observes. Spurred partly by her irritation with Dean’s tech fixation, Gabriela decides to stay in New Zealand. (Again, this film has few surprises.) In her new life, there are handwritten love letters, hill-covered vistas, and even a \u003ca href=\"https://ew.com/movies/2019/08/29/christina-milian-falling-inn-love/\"\u003e“super chill” stray goat\u003c/a\u003e; she certainly doesn’t miss Silicon Valley.

Selzer’s surveys screen voters based on a single question: whether they will attend the caucuses. If they answer “definitely” or “probably,” she counts them in her poll as likely voters and takes their candidate preferences into account. If they don’t, she doesn’t. Selzer doesn’t consider prior voting history or make any other predictions about turnout. Rather, she operates under the premise that the past is not always prologue. “I don’t assume anything,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Iowa caucuses this year, with all of their unknowns, could perhaps be the ultimate test of her method. The virtual caucuses were the Democratic Party’s response to years of voter complaints that visiting precinct sites in person is too difficult—especially for those with inflexible work or personal schedules—and takes too long. Even before news of the DNC’s worries first broke yesterday morning, party officials didn’t know what to expect from the virtual event, and voters, according to Selzer’s \u003ca href=\"https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/iowa-poll/caucus/2019/06/09/iowa-poll-virtual-caucus-plans-remain-mystery-likely-caucusgoers-iowa-caucus-president-primary/1360891001/\"\u003eJune poll\u003c/a\u003e, didn’t know what to think about it either.

Ann Selzer:\u003c/strong\u003e “Polling forward” is not just with caucuses, but with any polling that we do when it comes to trying to take a look at a future event. We do not create a likely-voter model. And we don’t weight our data according to past election information.

Our data showed us that on caucus night, on the Democratic side, more than half [of Iowans polled] were going to be attending their first caucus. There is no likely-voter model in the world that would ever predict that. And so there was a ruckus, sort of started by the Clinton campaign putting out a memo saying, “Look, [Selzer has] made an outrageous assumption about who likely caucus-goers are. It’s ridiculous; she’ll be fired, blah blah blah.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of Clinton’s state chairs called me up on New Year’s Day and said, “I’ve always trusted your polls until now. I’ve knocked on 99 doors, and I don’t find this lurking Obama support.” I said, “Well, tell me about the doors.” He said, “Well, previous caucus-goers and registered Democrats.” I said, “That’s why you’re not finding that lurking Obama support.” The Obama campaign figured if they relied on people who had caucused before to turn out, they would lose. They had to go create new caucus-goers, and the Clinton campaign was blinded because they were focused only on what had happened in the past.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy work was within one or two percentage points of accurately predicting that about 60 percent were at the caucus for the first time. I had to explain to [PBS News host] Judy Woodruff, [who asked], “How did you assume this?” I assumed nothing. That’s a moment that solidified to [me that] I was right not to assume anything. Why wouldn’t I continue to do that? You don’t want to be blinded by looking backward to what’s coming down the road.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou’ve seen other shifts. The Obama coalition was bringing out younger people, more minorities. And then in 2016, I remember getting a phone call from somebody who said, “Your poll is saying the African American vote is going to drop by double digits. Nobody thinks that!” And, you know, nobody thinks that who’s looking backward. My response was, “What is it about 2016 that reminds you in any way of 2012 and 2008?” And, in fact, there was quite a drop-off in the African American vote.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGodfrey:\u003c/strong\u003e Would the party scrapping the virtual caucus disrupt your data-gathering?

We [asked] that question for both people who are going to attend in person and who say they will participate virtually.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTypically, at this time in the cycle, we have a majority of people on the \u003cem\u003eprobable\u003c/em\u003e side. But in our June poll, we had 62 percent of in-person attendees saying they would \u003cem\u003edefinitely\u003c/em\u003e participate.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo that is a signal to me of probably stronger interest, more activation. You add that to having a couple dozen candidates in the state by the time the caucus comes around, all of them working to get caucus-goers out on caucus night—I think turnout will be strong.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGodfrey: \u003c/strong\u003eWith cellphones becoming ubiquitous, is it getting harder to get people on the phone—and convince them to stay on the phone and answer questions?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSelzer: \u003c/strong\u003eThere isn’t any phone bank that hasn’t noticed that.

The Assam Movement, a years-long campaign forged by a student organization, was at its apex, railing against “illegal immigrants” on the electoral rolls. In Nellie and towns nearby, that meant Bengali Muslims. Tensions had simmered for weeks, and a local election was under way. The student group announced a boycott and warned citizens to not vote.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003ePeople who had fled a nearby village came here that morning, February 18, 1983. They told Mohammad Nobi Hussain and others of houses burning, shots fired, and many dead. As the mob reached Nellie, Hussain told me, town residents gathered in a paddy field: men, women, children. They were surrounded—and the carnage began. “People were falling,” Hussain recalled. “Those who fell were cut. Those running were shot.” “Cut,” he said several times, scything the air with his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe scene was repeated in 13 other towns the same day.

Elizabeth Warren is positioning herself \u0026mdash; through an impressive political machine with few peers \u0026mdash; to possibly win both Iowa and New Hampshire. Bernie Sanders knows the history, too; he and Warren both hail from states that border New Hampshire, and voters there have never passed on a chance to back a New Englander. In South Carolina, where six-in-10 Democratic primary voters are expected to be black, contenders like Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Juli\u0026aacute;n Castro see potential. And then there\u0026#8217;s Pete Buttigieg, whose fundraising shows little sign of limitations; 300 people on payroll, including 70 in Iowa and 50 in New Hampshire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn other words, the Labor Day campaign launch of the frenzied fall push comes at a moment of tremendous peril for Biden, potential for his rivals and promise for Democrats who, above all else, want to beat Trump. First, though, they have to settle among themselves who will get the chance to do so. And, at the moment, it is possible to see paths for most of the mainstream hopefuls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBiden remains the most plausible candidate, having built up chits over decades in politics dating back to his first election in 1970. But the last week has left some aides more worried than ever. First, during the same New Hampshire day when he bungled war stories, he also told the familiar story about how he entered politics: explaining that the turmoil of 1968, which saw the assassinations of Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr., sparked his civic interest. He then asked his audience at Dartmouth College to imagine the raw emotion had it been Barack Obama who was assassinated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBiden\u0026rsquo;s critics and even some allies cringed. It\u0026rsquo;s never a good look to summon a theory about the assassination of the nation\u0026rsquo;s first black President, especially if Biden was the constitutional successor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBiden aides sprang to action, in a way not before seen during this campaign, to call out anyone who was being critical or snarky \u0026mdash; and to shame journalists who had tweeted the quote without context. It was the first real show of a coordinated rapid response from Biden\u0026rsquo;s Philadelphia headquarters, and it quieted some jitters among Biden allies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen came a poll that showed Biden\u0026rsquo;s numbers tanking. Monmouth University\u0026rsquo;s survey \u0026mdash; since described by its pollster as an outlier \u0026mdash; showed Sanders and Warren each at 20% and Biden at 19%. Biden aides nervously dismissed it as a statistical aberration, which apparently it was. Still, though, it caused some nervous ticks among Biden donors and activists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe top ranks of the Biden campaign, though, insist the campaign will move ahead as planned. Biden plans stops on Labor Day at Iowa union picnics and two days later will return to Stephen Colbert\u0026rsquo;s \u003cem\u003eThe Late Show\u003c/em\u003e stage, where he gave a remarkably frank \u003ca href=\"https://time.com/4042706/joe-biden-white-house-run/\" \u003einterview\u003c/a\u003e two years ago about his emotional status.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"article-video\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"time-embed time-embed__youtube video-wrapper\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opVaEC_WxWs\" \u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"embed-youtube\"\u003e\u003ciframe title=\"Vice President Joe Biden Interview, Part 1\" width=\"930\" height=\"523\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/opVaEC_WxWs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, Biden rivals are churning through events and cash. They may lack that national name ID and fundraising Rolodex, but they have optimism in bounds. They\u0026rsquo;re not without reason. At this point in 2007, Hillary Clinton was at 37% in Real Clear Politics\u0026rsquo; average polls, while Barack Obama was at 21%. Obama, of course, prevailed. Still, it was a much smaller field.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of this speaks to Biden\u0026rsquo;s advantages. Unless \u0026mdash; or until \u0026mdash; his rivals coalesce in an anti-Biden bloc, he may be impossible to stop. Only candidates who win 15% support are eligible to win delegates to the nominating convention in Milwaukee. A brokered convention is entirely possible, which is why Buttigieg delegate chief George Hornedo has been aggressively working the phone with super delegates, who, in a twist of irony, may end having more power than in 2016 to actually decide the nomination. The rules changes passed after 2016 strip super delegates, the party insiders who can back anyone at the convention, of their votes on the first ballot. But if a brokered solution cannot be found, they may end up being called upon to sway the results. The fallout may be nothing short of chaos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is why Biden\u0026rsquo;s backers are trying to win the nomination outright, on that first ballot. Still, the last week shows just how fragile Biden\u0026rsquo;s advantages are at this moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fall campaign will certainly test those advantages further still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/time/topstories/~4/AUmJTmVaWwc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/AUmJTmVaWwc/","published":"2019-08-31T20:51:05Z","guid":"http://time.com/?p=5665836"},{"title":"Hurricanes Have Hit Florida on Labor Day Weekend Before.

This is clear from the moment we meet him: he\u0026rsquo;s tense, nervous and he can\u0026rsquo;t ever relax. The movie is set in a Gotham City that\u0026rsquo;s a lazy approximation of gritty 1970s-era New York, complete with garbage strikes and \u0026ldquo;super-rats\u0026rdquo; overrunning the city. On the job in clown costume, Arthur gets beaten up by a mob of nasty punks \u0026mdash; and then almost gets fired because they stole and broke the \u0026ldquo;going out of business sign\u0026rdquo; he was twirling for a client.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore bad stuff happens, day in, day out.

(He carries around a little laminated card that he holds out helpfully whenever he laughs inappropriately, which is pretty much all the time. It reads, \u0026ldquo;Forgive my laughter, I have a brain injury.\u0026rdquo;) The one bright spot of his day, or night, is watching a Johnny Carson-style talk-show host, Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro), on television. He dreams of being a stand-up comic and someday being on the show.

(Beetz also appears in another movie here at the festival, Benedict Andrews\u0026rsquo;s \u003cem\u003eSeberg\u003c/em\u003e, where she\u0026rsquo;s given much more to do.) Arthur has a crush on her, and though he does her no harm, there\u0026rsquo;s still something creepily entitled about his attentiveness to her. He could easily be adopted as the patron saint of incels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArthur is a mess, but we\u0026rsquo;re also supposed to think he\u0026rsquo;s kind of great \u0026mdash; a misunderstood savant. Dressed up for his big TV moment in a turquoise paisley shirt, marigold vest and dapper cranberry suit (admittedly a marvelous feat of costume design), Arthur struts down an outdoor stairway like a rock\u0026rsquo;n\u0026rsquo;roll hero. It\u0026rsquo;s the most energizing moment in the movie, but what is it winding us up for? Arthur inspires chaos and anarchy, but the movie makes it look like he\u0026rsquo;s starting a revolution, where the rich are taken down, the poor get everything they need and deserve, and the sad guys who can\u0026rsquo;t get a date become killer heroes. There\u0026rsquo;s a sick joke in there somewhere.

In the past, superdelegates didn’t have to follow any rules and could back whichever candidate they desire and make up their minds at any point in the process. When most of them endorsed Hillary Clinton in 2016, it gave her a built-in delegate advantage over Bernie Sanders, though she still won enough votes independent of the superdelegates to secure the nomination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"mggTmT\"\u003eIn a series of reforms, the DNC has stripped superdelegates of a vote on the first ballot.

Ted Cruz and veteran anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist\u003c/a\u003e calling on the administration to index capital gains to inflation. Currently, they explain, if you bought a share of stock in 1998 for $30 and sold it this year for $40, that would count as $10 in long-term capital gains for federal tax purposes. But adjusted for inflation, $30 in 1998 is about $46.79 now, so you’d be paying taxes on an investment that, adjusted for inflation, lost money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"wrgjI0\"\u003eThat’s the basics of the case in favor of the change: taxing inflation is, proponents of the shift argue, unfair, and hurts the economy by discouraging investment. The case against indexing to inflation is much simpler: This is a change that would overwhelmingly benefit the richest Americans, who own an overwhelming share of the stocks, real estate, and other capital whose sales would be affected. One estimate finds that \u003ca href=\"https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2018/3/23/indexing-capital-gains-to-inflation\"\u003e86.1 percent of the benefit\u003c/a\u003e would go to the richest 1 percent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"0kBVx7\"\u003eMore concerning still, some legal scholars believe that executing this change through the executive branch is illegal, and that congressional action would be necessary to do this — action that, with Democrats in control of the House, will probably never come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"b0OoO2\"\u003eWhat indexing capital gains for inflation would do\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"N6CMj1\"\u003eLong-term capital gains (that is, gains on property or investments that’s sold after being held for at least a year) is taxed at a \u003ca href=\"https://taxfoundation.org/2019-tax-brackets/\"\u003elower rate than wage income\u003c/a\u003e. The top rate on capital gains income is a mere 20 percent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"FGDwEO\"\u003eBy contrast, the top rate on wage income is 37 percent, meaning capital gains income from wealthy people gets taxed at as little as half the rate of their wage income.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"9Ys6EK\"\u003eThere are a few rationales for indexing these gains for inflation, but one of them is the fact that long-run capital gains have their value eroded somewhat by inflation. If you buy a stock for $40 and sell it for $60 five years later, some of the gain in value is just that prices have risen across the economy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"lHT6lA\"\u003eAs UChicago’s Daniel Hemel and NYU’s David Kamin explain in a recent paper on indexing, the current structure “affords a lower statutory rate for capital gains as a sort of ‘rough justice’ that partially accounts for inflation.” This tradeoff — no indexing but lower rates —makes particular sense now, as inflation has been low (around or below 2 percent) and stable for decades. It’s a normal cost that businesses can plan around, and that the tax code can offset, rather than an unpredictable danger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"9f42Fq\"\u003eSome tax experts, including Hemel and Kamin and the \u003ca href=\"https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/should-treasury-index-capital-gains\"\u003eTax Policy Center’s Len Burman\u003c/a\u003e, argue that this combination of lower rates with no indexing could be preferable to higher rates plus indexing (weighed by some tax reformers) for administrative reasons. What if, say, the capital gain comes from a house that you renovated? You would have to keep track of not just when you bought the house and the underlying land, but when you purchased new sinks, when you hired contractors to install them, when you had people in to add insulation, and so on and so forth. It quickly becomes a very tough bookkeeping problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ICopxk\"\u003eBut for people whose primary goal is to reduce taxation on capital, like Cruz, Norquist, and some Trump administration officials, the relevant alternative is not a higher rate on capital gains joined with indexing, but indexing with the rate unchanged. Generally, this branch of the Republican Party tries to minimize taxes on capital for \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/1/21/7863239/taxes-investment-yagan\"\u003efear that they discourage investment\u003c/a\u003e, and eliminating taxes on gains tied to inflation is one step in that direction. In 2016, Cruz ran for president on a platform that included \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/2/16/11019986/ted-cruz-tax-policy-center\"\u003etotally junking the corporate income tax and cutting the tax rate on capital gains to 10 percent\u003c/a\u003e; it’s fair to interpret indexing as a step closer to that goal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"0FTJZP\"\u003eThe problem with doing this through the executive branch, Kamin and Hemel argue, is twofold. For one thing, it could be illegal. In 1992, the Office of Legal Counsel for the first Bush administration concluded that when the Revenue Act of 1918 says that capital gains should be computed based on the initial “cost of such property,” that “cost” means the actual price paid — not the price adjusted for inflation. Its conclusion was that the president and the Treasury lack the ability to inflation-adjust without Congress. Kamin and Hemel argue that this conclusion has only been strengthened by subsequent court rulings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"e3HbA8\"\u003eThe second problem is that the executive action doesn’t force expenses — like interest paid, or depreciation of investments — to be adjusted for inflation in turn. Kamin and Hemel explain that this could be gamed by businesses to create large-scale fake losses to offset their taxes:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp id=\"ptDFMr\"\u003eImagine that a taxpayer buys an asset for $100 that is fully financed by a loan. Assume that the real interest rate is zero, that the inflation rate is 10%, and that the nominal interest rate on the loan is 10% as well. One year later, assuming no change in the real value of the asset, the asset will be worth $110 on account of inflation. If basis is indexed for inflation, the taxpayer can sell the asset for $110 and recognize no taxable gain. Assuming that the interest is properly allocable to a trade or business, the taxpayer can claim an interest deduction of $10 with no offsetting gain, despite the fact that the taxpayer is in the same pre-tax position as previously\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"swA6AK\"\u003eThis has led even some libertarian-leaning economists skeptical of taxes on capital, like the \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/kpomerleau/status/1167424413630943232\"\u003eTax Foundation’s Kyle Pomerleau\u003c/a\u003e, to express concern with making this change unilaterally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"yHXA43\"\u003eBeyond the gaming concerns and the legal problem, the change would also be plainly regressive. The \u003ca href=\"https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2018/3/23/indexing-capital-gains-to-inflation\"\u003ePenn Wharton Budget Model\u003c/a\u003e, a respected tax and budget model at the University of Pennsylvania, estimates that indexing to inflation would cost $102 billion over 10 years, and 86.1 percent of the benefit would go to the richest 1 percent of Americans. Nearly two-thirds would go to the richest 0.1 percent.

Thede and her writing staff have a great eye for situations that start out in a normal place and slowly curl in on themselves until they’re weirder and weirder and weirder, like with a series of sketches that recur throughout the season and feature the four series regulars riffing on friendship among black women — in what seems to be the only house standing after the end of the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"f2E0ll\"\u003eBelieve it or not, that’s one of the more normal sketches in the show.

For one thing, that would mire the show in 2019, instead of making it feel a little like it exists outside of time; after all, televangelists and families of powerful preachers, with jets and mansions and bling, are hardly a new phenomenon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Kl0suC\"\u003eAnd more importantly, I think the show’s interest in exploring the celebrity culture of big churches where the pastors are major celebrities and treated as such — and the way leaders benefit from and try to sustain their congregations’ adoration — is, in an oblique way, a much better satirical note to strike in 2019. I’m convinced that for many (though not all) white evangelicals, their support for Trump has a lot to do with being primed to admire big, brash celebrity pastors, to follow charisma and to be swept up by emotion. If you’re devoted to a pastor like John Goodman’s Eli Gemstone, whose spiritual acumen is proven by his ostentatiously flashy empire, then it’s a natural step to admire a figure like Donald Trump \u003cem\u003ebecause\u003c/em\u003e of his wealth and fame rather than in spite of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003caside id=\"0xxTbk\"\u003e\u003cdiv data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"What HBO’s The Righteous Gemstones gets right about evangelicals\",\"url\":\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/8/19/20807632/righteous-gemstones-recap-evangelicals-pilot-episode-1\"}]}'\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003cp id=\"qKIXPr\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWatch \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Righteous Gemstones\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e if you like: \u003c/strong\u003eMcBride’s prior shows, \u003cem\u003eSuccession\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eOzark\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"lwRCDm\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere to watch: \u003c/strong\u003eNew episodes of \u003cem\u003eThe Righteous Gemstones\u003c/em\u003e air Sundays \u003ca href=\"https://www.hbo.com/the-righteous-gemstones\"\u003eon HBO\u003c/a\u003e at 10 pm Eastern.

It had critical acclaim back then for a reason.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"IbdTE6\"\u003eSeason one of \u003cem\u003e13 Reasons Why\u003c/em\u003e told the story of doomed Hannah Baker (\u003ca href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm7692698/\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKatherine Langford\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e), a 16-year-old girl who has died by suicide, leaving behind a set of 13 cassette tapes for the 13 classmates she blamed for her death. While at times the show could feel self-congratulatory in its grimness, it was addictive and thriller-like in its pacing. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"BIl6At\"\u003eIt was easy to care for Hannah, easy to get wrapped up in the casually brutal teenage games her classmates played with her, and easy to want to know what led to her death. And the end of the season, in which the last tape is finally played and Hannah’s rapist is arrested, is clearly the natural ending point for the series. That’s where the Jay Asher book the first season is based on ended as well. There is nowhere else to go from there. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"FzBwfS\"\u003eNevertheless, \u003cem\u003e13 Reasons Why\u003c/em\u003e did keep going.

It was starting a conversation. It was teaching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"hqIUhD\"\u003eThen, earlier this year, the show backtracked long enough to \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/7/16/20696094/13-reasons-why-netflix-suicide-scene-removed\"\u003eremove that graphic suicide scene from season one\u003c/a\u003e, and to promise that \u003ca href=\"https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/ustv/a28724141/13-reasons-why-season-3-star-less-controversy/\"\u003eseason three would be much less controversial\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Evi7dJ\"\u003eSeason three of \u003cem\u003e13 Reasons Why\u003c/em\u003e probably is less controversial than season one, in that it is probably not going to be linked to the deaths of any children. But it continues the approach that made season one so dangerous: This show insists on exploring very serious real-life problems in as much didactic detail as possible, but it does not show any evidence of having done the research to get the exploration right. It makes clumsy, lazy, unforced errors in exactly the moments that it’s striving for honesty, and if this time those errors might not lead to deaths, well, that’s a pretty low bar to aim for. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"L8UA4p\"\u003eAdditionally, season three of \u003cem\u003e13 Reasons Why\u003c/em\u003e is a bad season of television. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-float-right\"\u003e\u003caside id=\"0smrxt\"\u003e\u003cdiv data-anthem-component=\"ratingcard\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"rating\":1,\"title\":\"13 Reasons Why season 3\"}'\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"7Jw5dI\"\u003eSeason 3 is boring and also ridiculous\u003c/h3\u003e\n  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\"A photo of Bryce (Justin Prentice) next to a coffin and flower arrangement\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iOhlu2uB2nSuIyJMVrqALZt0B30=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19154436/13RW_306_Unit_02665_2.jpg\"\u003e\n      \u003ccite\u003eDavid Moir/Netflix\u003c/cite\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003eHe dead.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"7TWAxm\"\u003eSeason three of \u003cem\u003e13 Reasons Why\u003c/em\u003e is a murder mystery. Hannah’s rapist, the charming rich sociopath Bryce Walker (\u003ca href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3624428/?ref_=tt_cl_t5\"\u003eJustin Prentice\u003c/a\u003e), is dead. Bryce was a serial rapist who casually ruined lives, so most of the main cast had a reason to want him dead — including our hero, Clay (\u003ca href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1910255/?ref_=tt_cl_t1\"\u003eDylan Minnette\u003c/a\u003e), who nursed a crush on Hannah back when she was alive. Now, Clay is a suspect for Bryce’s death, and to prove his own innocence, he has to find the real killer. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"E3IoaX\"\u003eThe whole thing is narrated by new student Ani (\u003ca href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm8458057/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t31\"\u003eGrace Saif\u003c/a\u003e), who is inexplicably best friends with the whole cast now but was also close with Bryce, because her mom is his grandfather’s live-in nurse, so Ani and Bryce also lived together. “I see things,” she tells us portentously in voiceover, before proceeding to lead us through the whole season to find out who murdered Bryce. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"AScPjX\"\u003eTheoretically, you can see how this story would be interesting. Everyone in the main cast does have good reason to hate Bryce and want him to be dead. It’s a murder mystery where maybe you could root for the murderer, \u003cem\u003eMurder on the Orient Express\u003c/em\u003e-style. That could be fun!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"V9UDmp\"\u003eBut god does this season drag. It’s just endless, endless gray-toned scenes of sad teenagers whispering exposition tensely at each other before curling up to weep over their heroin addiction/steroid problem/deported parents/lost college scholarship/insert-extremely-topical-teen-problem here. And those problems really are treated more or less interchangeably: as secrets each character hides until their showcase episode arrives, only to reveal the truth in a tear-streaked monologue that leaves Clay staring, mouth agape, at how little he understands the pain of his friends. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"UNXnQQ\"\u003eAni, meanwhile, is less a character than she is an exposition machine. There is no real reason for her to care about Clay’s group of friends and no reason for them to care about her, let alone confide in her as much as they do. Her narration — ostensibly her statement to the police — is riddled with one-liners that are supposed to come off as wise epigrams but are really just obvious bullshit. Did you know that everyone has secrets? Because Ani will tell you. She’ll tell you real good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"QIF4fM\"\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e13 Reasons Why\u003c/em\u003e season 3 is also thematically bankrupt\u003c/h3\u003e\n  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\"Jessica (Alisha Boe) faces off against Casey (Bex Taylor-Klaus)\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N65PaYUXQTrzH2Z7oP_3d8dPAU8=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19154441/13RW_305_Unit_01750R.jpg\"\u003e\n      \u003ccite\u003eDavid Moir/Netflix\u003c/cite\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003eHave you considered that perhaps #MeToo has gone too far?\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"z0EYRO\"\u003eThe thesis of season three is more or less as follows: The system is broken (sure). No adult can be trusted to protect children from the violence of other children (I mean … not exactly, but okay). But all children can be redeemed (okay, yeah, why not). Therefore, the only reasonable course of action is for children to take responsibility for each other and, when faced with violent sociopaths, personally take those sociopaths under their wing and offer them unlicensed therapy (what?!).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"2u9wAV\"\u003eIn order to illustrate that thesis, the season is built around the question of whether or not serial rapist Bryce Walker and attempted school shooter and voyeur Tyler Down (\u003ca href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4917921/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t8\"\u003eDevin Druid\u003c/a\u003e) can be redeemed via the power of friendship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"NDxctB\"\u003eIn flashbacks, Ani befriends Bryce, who last season was convicted of rape and sentenced to probation. Under her guidance, he attempts to become a better person. He starts therapy and tries to apologize to some of the people he has hurt. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"pxSfJF\"\u003eMeanwhile, Clay and his friend group take responsibility for Tyler, who at the end of season two was raped by another boy at their school and responded by showing up to the school dance with a bag full of guns. Clay and his friends get rid of Tyler’s guns and cover for him with the cops. They create a schedule so that they can plan to always have someone with Tyler, to protect him from school bullies and from his own self-hatred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"pgnF5q\"\u003eThe big thematic question of the season is: Have these strategies worked? Are Bryce and Tyler redeemed? Can people who have done terrible things ever do better?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"EjFfCm\"\u003eThat question is interesting and complex. It’s true that our legal system is bad at dealing with rapists, especially privileged white rapists like Bryce, and many of them end up seeing minimal jail time if any. It’s also true that our prison system is not good at turning serial rapists into people who do not rape, or turning gunmen into people who do not shoot up schools. If we’re interested in changing that, it is theoretically important to think about alternative ways of dealing with people who have done or almost done terrible things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"bHlQju\"\u003eAnd I should note that \u003cem\u003e13 Reasons Why\u003c/em\u003e goes out of its way to make clear that Bryce is not owed forgiveness or anything else from his victims, and that when he feels bad about being isolated in his new school because of his reputation as a rapist, that’s not their responsibility. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"pWNQgk\"\u003eHowever, this season privileges Bryce’s point of view in a way that it does not privilege that of his victims. We’re told that Bryce raped “seven or eight” girls besides Hannah, but we only know one of them: Jessica, the only girl besides Ani who is left in \u003cem\u003e13 Reasons Why\u003c/em\u003e’s main cast. Her recovery and journey to take control over her own body after Bryce’s attack gets one episode of exploration. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"rCazGa\"\u003eThe only female sexual assault victim besides Jessica who gets multiple lines of dialogue is Casey, a character who is reduced to a walking symbol for the idea that perhaps #MeToo has gone too far when she mounts a #MeToo Bryce’s funeral over Jessica’s objections. Casey is the one who shouts that the world should care more about the pain of the victims than the perpetrators, but her speech is framed as shrill and aggressive. We don’t know what happened to her, and we aren’t really asked to care — just to judge her for doing activism in the wrong way. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Q05uqZ\"\u003eBryce’s pain, meanwhile, is the season’s primary focus. Every episode contains flashbacks to a lonely and isolated Bryce, and every episode shows us Bryce working to be a better person. There’s even a baffling moment in which Ani, who is theoretically close friends with Jessica, decides to sleep with her friend’s rapist, which is supposed to demonstrate to the audience that she sees something inside of him that is worth saving. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"YJ83DR\"\u003eHere is the problem with that balance: Our justice system is already set up to privilege Bryce’s point of view. That’s why many people like Bryce don’t get sent to jail, \u003ca href=\"https://www.syracuse.com/crime/2019/07/nj-judge-teen-who-boasted-of-rape-deserves-break-for-good-grades-good-family.html\"\u003eso that their bright futures aren’t destroyed by all the serial rape\u003c/a\u003e. Did \u003cem\u003e13 Reasons Why\u003c/em\u003e really need to spend so much time focusing on Bryce’s pain? Did it really need to demonize his victims whenever they asked that the world consider their pain too? \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"0OaYqA\"\u003eThose choices only make it all the more glaring how many of the female characters in the show’s original cast have been sidelined or written out altogether: Hannah appears only in a flashback to her rape, and other characters like Courtney are there only for the briefest of cameos. For such a dude-heavy show to spend so much of its time thinking about sexual assault without also writing in a few more fleshed-out female characters, leaving the whole storyline to rest on Jessica and her single showcase episode, is a mystifying choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"m3EKYb\"\u003eTyler’s storyline is another instance of this show trying to tell some bleak truths about the world while failing to do its research, because the research would tell it that kids like Tyler do not actually exist. We are supposed to gather that Tyler tried to shoot up the school not because he’s a sadist, but because he’s a bullied kid who was raped and pushed to his limit and wanted to hurt the world that hurt him — our idea of the school shooter, popularized in the wake of Columbine, is of an outcast. \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2014/11/3/7132879/school-shooting-facts\"\u003eBut statistically, that profile is often a myth\u003c/a\u003e. The Columbine shooters had an active circle of friends. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"wEPRQy\"\u003eIn real life, there is no sure way to profile a school shooter. They’re often depressed, but that’s just about the only characteristic many share. Some school shooters are loners who feel persecuted or bullied, but many are kids who were already violent — they’re not bullied kids who were hurt until they snapped, they’re bullies who hurt other kids and then keep escalating their violence until they reach for a gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"1D7Drv\"\u003eThat’s why the show’s choice to repeatedly laud as “heroic” Clay’s season 2 decision to step in front of Tyler’s gun and appeal to the power of friendship isn’t just foolish. It’s irresponsible. That’s not the way to stop school shooters, because school shooters are mostly not kids like Tyler.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"xDvfqh\"\u003eIt’s okay for TV shows to not reflect real life in completely accurate ways, because TV shows are fiction and they are written to entertain. But \u003cem\u003e13 Reasons Why\u003c/em\u003e has consistently positioned itself as a didactic show that exists to start a conversation about the real issues that real kids are facing. If it’s going to do that well, it has a responsibility to portray those issues honestly, not by falling back on lazy and inaccurate myths. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"uwJIcO\"\u003eThere are moments where \u003cem\u003e13 Reasons Why\u003c/em\u003e’s approach works!

A technology startup led by a bright, young Stanford dropout that, unlike so many essentially frivolous apps, was actually going to solve the urgent problem of making health care cheaper and easier to access. The problem, as revealed by the \u003ca href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901#pq=Jd8MoW\"\u003eWall Street Journal’s John Carreyrou in an October 2015 expos\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/expos%C3%A9e#French\"\u003eé\u003c/a\u003e, was that the whole thing was a sham. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"JDzxYc\"\u003eTheranos’s key technology, called Edison machines, didn’t really work, and Theranos wasn’t actually using them to perform its blood tests, relying instead on older Samsung equipment.

The storm could hit late there this weekend through Monday, and bring with it 10-to-15 feet of storm surge, and 10-to-20 inches of rain: an extremely dangerous, life-threatening situation.

In fact, Gauff’s considered to be one of the speediest and agile players on the tour, even at her young age. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"8YIR7Z\"\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"\u003e\u003ciframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/s8dugcpcv84?rel=0\" style=\"border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"encrypted-media; accelerometer; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"oh69Nz\"\u003e“I don’t think I have to win the point as many times against anyone as against her,” Timea Babos, whom Gauff defeated in the second round at the US Open, \u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/coco-gauff-and-taylor-townsend-illustrate-the-gap-between-15-and-23-in-tennis-years/2019/08/30/e128f51a-cb0c-11e9-a4f3-c081a126de70_story.html\"\u003esaid in her post-match interview\u003c/a\u003e.

Her three-set wins at the US Open are evidence of that. But that tenacity has been a trademark of her young professional and her illustrious junior career. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"O2PAUr\"\u003e“What impressed me is that she took care of the biggest points with understanding of the importance of that point,” Pam Shriver, a former top tennis player and analyst for ESPN, said about Gauff for \u003ca href=\"https://www.espn.com/tennis/story/_/id/27401227/2019-us-open-one-win-how-far-coco-gauff-go-our-experts-weigh-in\"\u003eESPN’s US Open preview\u003c/a\u003e. “You can’t really say that most of the time about the young, powerful, athletic players through decades.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"WWs3XQ\"\u003eGauff doesn’t give up, and gets to balls that other players don’t get to. But she also doesn’t play a sit-back-and-watch-your-opponent-miss brand of \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUoIG4wPUhY\u0026amp;t=4s\"\u003etennis\u003c/a\u003e — she takes risks, dictates the point with her power, and has electric shot-making ability. The result is a game that’s a joy to watch on television and in the stands. And the tantalizing thing is that she has the potential to get even better. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"kAeDoe\"\u003eTennis has a habit of turning teenage dreams into something a little more tragic\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Jtv9CC\"\u003eWithout Googling, could you name the other 14 women (besides Gauff and Serena Williams) who reached the final round of 16 at Wimbledon? How about the French Open? The Australian Open?  If you can, you’re probably in an elite sect of tennis fans. But my point is that there are a lot of players that get to the round of 16 in Grand Slams, and none of them have had the hype that Gauff has gotten in recent months. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"iHvN9u\"\u003eGauff’s talent aside, the attention she’s grabbing fits a pattern that we often see in tennis: We’re looking for the sport’s next transcendent, dominating figure, someone to stand among the Williams sisters, or Steffi Graf, or Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert — a player who will dominate and win multiple Grand Slams. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"cSKwmY\"\u003eBut for every once-in-a-lifetime player, there are also plenty of tennis phenoms that burn bright, burn fast, and burn out — sometimes due to factors outside of their control. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"eWP7rf\"\u003eConsider \u003ca href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/jun/29/wimbledon.tennis\"\u003eAndrea Jaeger, who\u003c/a\u003e in 1980 became the youngest Wimbledon quarterfinalist ever, at age 15. She retired just five years later, due to injury. Jennifer Capriati was the youngest player to achieve a top-10 ranking at 14 years old in 1991, and then burned out; she was eventually \u003ca href=\"https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-1994-05-22-1994142020-story.html\"\u003earrested for marijuana possession\u003c/a\u003e at 18. \u003ca href=\"https://www.tennisworldusa.org/tennis/news/Tennis_Stories/70479/coming-back-at-37-years-old/\"\u003eMirjana Lucic\u003c/a\u003e looked like the next great player in the 1990s, outhitting everyone at the age of 15, but then had to deal with a slew of personal problems, including an \u003ca href=\"https://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4\u0026amp;objectid=11789208\"\u003eabusive father\u003c/a\u003e, that would take her away from tennis. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"vTTiKe\"\u003eGranted, some of these players  eventually came back to succeed on court, like Capriati and Lucic. But these stories of burnout and tragedy prompted the Women’s Tennis Association to institute a “\u003ca href=\"https://www.wtatennis.com/player-development\"\u003eplayer development\u003c/a\u003e” rule in 1995 that limited the number of tournaments teenagers could legally compete in. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"COIxPI\"\u003eEven then, as tennis correspondent Christopher Clarey wrote for \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/02/sports/tennis/cori-gauff.html\"\u003ethe New York Times\u003c/a\u003e earlier this summer, the limitation rules didn’t protect phenoms like \u003ca href=\"https://www.wtatennis.com/news/%E2%80%98i-thought-i-was-going-be-done%E2%80%99-%E2%80%93-bellis-opens-excruciating-injury-battle\"\u003eCici Bellis\u003c/a\u003e, who reached the third-round of the US Open in 2016, from sustaining injuries. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"qGxL8Q\"\u003eBut Gauff has yet to meet any adversity of similar scale. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"MLyxBe\"\u003eShe’s not only good, but she seems to be an exception to these stories of rising and falling. Of course, two of the greatest exceptions to the tragic teenage tennis phenom example are Venus and Serena Williams (their father \u003ca href=\"https://www.si.com/vault/1999/05/31/8107824/whos-your-daddy-call-richard-williams-what-you-wantbizarre-deceitful-or-perhaps-madbut-be-sure-of-one-thing-he-has-brilliantly-guided-the-careers-and-lives-of-his-daughters-venus-and-serena-the-hottest-players-in-tennis\"\u003eRichard famously limited\u003c/a\u003e the number of tournaments the sisters played each year).  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Asz2V0\"\u003eFor all the reasons tennis fans are honing in on Gauff, though, none stand taller than the woman we see in her: Serena. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"7Br437\"\u003eWith Grand Slam tournaments becoming tougher for Williams to win after her tough recovery from her \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/identities/2018/1/11/16879984/serena-williams-childbirth-scare-black-women\"\u003e2017 pregnancy\u003c/a\u003e , American tennis fans are desperate to identify her heir apparent. A young, black, American-born-and-bred player that \u003ca href=\"https://theundefeated.com/features/the-greatness-of-the-williams-sisters-inspires-those-who-might-take-their-crowns/\"\u003eSerena and her sister Venus inspired\u003c/a\u003e to eventually carry on their legacy is also a hell of a fairytale ending.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"E9VJup\"\u003eEvery time Gauff takes the court, all of these outside questions and all of these future-gazing fantasies arise. Coco’s successes on court are the result of her own hard work and talent, but they also reflect our own desires (a happy ending, perhaps, or wish fulfillment). \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"1c6zBR\"\u003eFor most of us regular humans, we will never be able to do what Coco, or any other professional tennis player, does.

you probably have a reasonably good idea of why. It might have been the call of the historic capital, Tbilisi, all ramshackle red roofs and fairytale castles, or on the strength of a rumor about \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/08/travel/08georgia.html\"\u003ethe greatest wine scene you\u0026#8217;d never heard of\u003c/a\u003e.

Perhaps it was little more than a cheap flight and \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B1g2TkZDNoV/\"\u003ea well-timed Instagram post\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut while those things probably didn\u0026#8217;t hurt, the real reason Georgian tourism is booming has a lot more to do with geopolitics than it does grapes. The country\u0026#8217;s logarithmic growth in visitors, from having fewer than 100,000 tourists annually to 6.5 million in about 20 years, isn\u0026#8217;t just the product of it being a very nice place to go. (There are plenty of other \u003ca href=\"https://www.wanderlustingk.com/travel-blog/beautiful-albania-photos\"\u003every\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B1i3D_5AYIg/\"\u003enice\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://theculturetrip.com/south-america/bolivia/articles/the-10-most-beautiful-towns-in-bolivia/\"\u003eplaces\u003c/a\u003e that haven\u0026#8217;t experienced anywhere near as much growth.) Instead, it\u0026#8217;s the result of huge political change, coupled with a structured, sustained campaign by the country\u0026#8217;s government to open Georgia to the world, and take it from a pretty, but mostly unknown, Eastern European backwater to a global tourist hotspot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"atlas-chart\" data-id=\"cc9znXN9k\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"449\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/qz-production-atlas-assets/charts/atlas_cc9znXN9k.png\" style=\"max-width: 100%; min-width:100%;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the country\u0026#8217;s policymakers, tourism makes perfect sense as a sector to invest in. In a country with an \u003ca href=\"https://investingeorgia.org/en/georgia/labor\"\u003eaverage salary\u003c/a\u003e of about $5,000, holiday-makers\u0026#8217; dollars are extremely welcome. In the past two decades, the country\u0026#8217;s economy has grown steadily by around 4.5% a year, even amid the turbulence of the global financial crisis, tensions with Russia in 2008, and a tumble in commodity prices. At the same time, poverty has halved from 32.5% in 2006 to 16.3% in 2017. Tourism is a big part of that story, accounting for 7.5% of the country\u0026#8217;s GDP growth in 2018.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Georgia has much higher aspirations. By 2025, according to \u003ca href=\"http://www.economy.ge/uploads/ecopolitic/turizmi-/sakartvelos%20turizmis%20strategia%202025.pdf\"\u003egovernment documents\u003c/a\u003e (pdf), it hopes to attract more tourists from the EU, North America, the Middle East, and Asia; triple tourism revenue to $6.6 billion; and increase the average tourist spend from $328 over five days to $600 over a week.

However, until recently, some things—like our voices—have been distinctive and difficult to mimic. Not so in our brave new world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA new kind of cybercrime that uses artificial intelligence and voice technology is one of the unfortunate developments of postmodernity.

The CEO made the requested transfer to a Hungarian supplier and was contacted again with assurances that the transfer was being reimbursed immediately. That too seemed believable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, when the reimbursement funds had yet to appear in accounts and a third call came from Austria, with the caller again alleging to be the parent company\u0026#8217;s chief executive requesting another urgent transfer, the CEO became suspicious. Despite recognizing what seemed to be his boss\u0026#8217;s voice, the CEO declined to make the transfer, realizing something was amiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough the CEO recognized the familiar accent and intonations of the chief executive, it turns out that the boss wasn\u0026#8217;t making the call. The funds he transferred to Hungary were subsequently moved to Mexico and other locations and authorities have yet to pinpoint any suspects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRüdiger Kirsch, a fraud expert at insurer Euler Hermes, which covered the victim company’s claim, tells the Journal that the insurance company has never previously dealt with claims stemming from losses due to AI-related crimes. He says the police investigation into the affair is over and indicates that hackers used commercial voice-generating software to carry out the attack, noting that he tested one such product and found the reproduced version of his voice sounded real to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCertainly, law enforcement authorities and AI experts are aware of voice technology\u0026#8217;s burgeoning capabilities, and the high likelihood that AI is poised to be the new frontier for fraud. Last year, \u003ca href=\"https://www.pindrop.com/\"\u003ePindrop\u003c/a\u003e, a company that creates security software and protocols for call centers, \u003ca href=\"https://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/89432-voice-fraud-climbs-350\"\u003ereported a 350% rise\u003c/a\u003e in voice fraud between 2013 and 2017, primarily to credit unions, banks, insurers, brokerages, and card issuers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy pretending to be someone else on the phone, a voice fraudster can access private information that wouldn\u0026#8217;t otherwise be available and can be used for nefarious purposes. The ability to feign another’s identity with voice is easier than ever with new audio tools and increased reliance on call centers that offer services (as opposed to going to the bank and talking to a teller face-to-face, say). As the tools to create fakes improve, the chances of criminals using AI-based voice tech to mimic our voices and use them against us are heightened.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://qz.com/1699819/a-new-kind-of-cybercrime-uses-ai-and-your-voice-against-you/","published":"2019-08-31T16:33:13Z","guid":"https://qz.com/1699819/auto-draft/"},{"title":"Nearly 2 million people in India have just been rendered stateless by a bureaucratic act","content":"\u003cimg width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/nrc.assam_.jpeg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;w=1024\" class=\"attachment-medium_10 size-medium_10 wp-post-image\" alt=\"Ayub Salm holds the draft list of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) of his family in Dhubri district.\" srcset=\"https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/nrc.assam_.jpeg 5562w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/nrc.assam_.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/nrc.assam_.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/nrc.assam_.jpeg?resize=160,90 160w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/nrc.assam_.jpeg?resize=320,180 320w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/nrc.assam_.jpeg?resize=640,360 640w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/nrc.assam_.jpeg?resize=940,529 940w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/nrc.assam_.jpeg?resize=1600,900 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /\u003e\u003cp\u003eToday in the northeastern state of Assam, in India, authorities \u003ca href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/08/nrc-list-19-million-excluded-india-citizens-list-190831044040215.html\"\u003epublished the latest version\u003c/a\u003e of the National Register of Citizens (NRC). The list is pretty much what it sounds like—a compilation of names of local residents who are considered Indian. Almost 2 million people, including decorated war veterans and \u003ca href=\"https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/india-news-aiudf-legislator-ananta-kumar-malo-son-among-19-million-people-left-out-of-nrc/337554\"\u003eeven a state legislator\u003c/a\u003e, were not listed and will now have to quickly prove their citizenship or risk detention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eResidents could learn their status, whether included on the NRC or excluded, by checking \u003ca href=\"http://www.nrcassam.nic.in\"\u003ethe register\u0026#8217;s website\u003c/a\u003e or at local help centers. However, the NRC \u003ca href=\"https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/assam-nrc-final-list-website-crashes-people-line-up-at-seva-kendras-2093397\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003ewebsite crashed\u003c/a\u003e soon after the list was published, though it appears to be back online now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo demonstrate they belonged on the register, residents had to show that they or their forebears were in India before 1971. The controversial list is unique to the state of Assam, which neighbors Bangladesh (though there\u0026#8217;s been some talk of \u003ca href=\"https://qz.com/india/1591557/bjp-threat-to-restrict-indian-citizenship-targets-muslims/\"\u003eimplementing it nationwide\u003c/a\u003e). It\u0026#8217;s been in existence since 1951 and, some say, is not just aimed at migration, as stated by authorities, but is also intended to target the Muslim minority, which makes up a third of the local population.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhatever the real reason for the NRC, there is no doubt that its publication has in the past caused chaos and is doing so again today. A draft version of the list, published in July, left off 4 million local residents. The latest version includes 31.1 million and leaves more than 1.9 million people in Assam with no state and very little time to show authorities they should not be detained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose excluded from the NRC have 120 days to prove their citizenship at so-called \u0026#8220;foreigner\u0026#8217;s tribunals,\u0026#8221; which \u003ca href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/08/final-nrc-list-india-assam-190829133456422.html\"\u003eAl Jazeera describes\u003c/a\u003e as \u0026#8220;regional quasi-judicial bodies.\u0026#8221; There are currently 100 such tribunals in existence and authorities plan to rapidly add 200 more to deal with the expected flood of citizenship review requests. These courts for foreigners then have six months to make a final determination as to individuals\u0026#8217; citizenship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAssam residents who are ultimately unable to prove that they meet the register\u0026#8217;s requirements may be held in detention centers or face deportation, in addition to losing the right to vote locally and being deprived of other civil liberties, human rights activists say. However, Indian television outlet \u003ca href=\"https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/assam-citizens-list-nrc-19-06-lakh-excluded-3-11-crore-in-final-list-2093349\"\u003eNDTV reports\u003c/a\u003e that local authorities are promising that everyone will have a fair hearing and that no one will be officially declared a foreigner until all legal options are exhausted. \u0026#8220;Any person who is not satisfied with the outcome of the claims and objections can file an appeal before the foreigners\u0026#8217; tribunals,\u0026#8221; NRC coordinator Prateek Hajela said in a statement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is surely a small consolation to the many who now must try to show they belong in Assam specifically and in India generally.

Second, they haven’t been properly trained in grant writing, an essential skill for accessing competitive funding for their research. Third, they lack mentors or supervisors. And finally, postdoctoral positions tend to be poorly paid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=\"pull-quote\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"quote-line\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePostdoctoral training is a critical element of building Africa’s population of researchers.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"quote-line\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003ePostdoctoral training is a critical element of building Africa’s population of researchers. The continent needs to develop its capacity for globally competitive postdoctoral training, as this is essential to promoting scientific and research excellence and leadership. These globally competitive scientists are key to transforming universities into research hubs equipped with skilled staff to mentor the next generation of well-trained scientists to feed ongoing knowledge-based African economies. This level of talent can only be recruited and retained with sustained funding and infrastructure. For this to happen, African governments must commit to investing more in research and development.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eResearch infrastructure\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLack of access to resources is a big problem for postdoctoral researchers. Quality science happens in an environment where researchers have state-of-the-art infrastructure and receive good administrative support. This allows them to focus on their research. So it’s imperative for postdocs to be located in accomplished scientists’ laboratories in established and well-resourced universities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut African universities \u003ca href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/24486132?seq=1\"\u003etend to lack\u003c/a\u003e good research infrastructure. This means that PhD graduates can’t get the sort of postdoctoral training they need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, they often get sucked into teaching or administrative work. \u003ca href=\"http://ahero.uwc.ac.za/index.php?module=cshe\u0026amp;action=downloadfile\u0026amp;fileid=18409092513202791624126\"\u003eData\u003c/a\u003e shows that the average ratio of lecturers to students is as high as 1:47.

Academics become overwhelmed by their teaching loads and the associated paperwork. They are left with little or no time for research. Not all PhD graduates choose to stay in Africa and go the teaching route. Many seek internationally competitive postdoctoral training abroad or are increasingly moving to South Africa because of its strong research infrastructure and postdoctoral \u003ca href=\"https://www.usaf.ac.za/dedicated-funding-for-post-doctoral-fellowships-may-resolve-the-challenge-of-early-career-researchers-for-south-africa/\"\u003eprograms\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany of these well-trained scientists then remain in their host country for their productive careers.

Those who came from South Africa or were at South African institutions received support ahead of their applications, which helped them to prepare budgets and ultimately to be more competitive in their applications. Unfortunately, this is not the case for the rest of the continent. For the most part research support offices don’t exist, and applications are largely driven by an individual’s intellect, grit and determination to succeed, with little institutional support.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfrican universities face a \u003ca href=\"https://www.britishcouncil.org/sites/default/files/h233_07_synthesis_report_final_web.pdf\"\u003edire shortage\u003c/a\u003e of PhD level staff.

This forces PhD graduates either to delay taking up postdoc opportunities, or look elsewhere for opportunities. The challenge is also reflected in the quality of postdoc applications. This has knock-on effects. To become research focused, universities are expected to attract world class researchers who will need the support of well-trained postdocs to help them achieve their personal and institutional objectives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003ePoor remuneration\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUniversities need to provide attractive employment conditions if they want to attract postdoctoral fellows. An important part of this is being able to offer facilities and financial support. Postdocs need to be well funded to make the training attractive for early career researchers who are also often taking care of families while embarking on their research careers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur experience at The African Academy of Sciences suggests this can be done. We have a program management platform, the \u003ca href=\"https://aasciences.ac.ke/aesa\"\u003eAlliance for Accelerating Excellence in Science in Africa\u003c/a\u003e, that focuses on building well-funded postdoctoral programmes to create a critical mass of African researchers.

Elizabeth Warren is positioning herself \u0026mdash; through an impressive political machine with few peers \u0026mdash; to possibly win both Iowa and New Hampshire. Bernie Sanders knows the history, too; he and Warren both hail from states that border New Hampshire, and voters there have never passed on a chance to back a New Englander. In South Carolina, where six-in-10 Democratic primary voters are expected to be black, contenders like Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Juli\u0026aacute;n Castro see potential. And then there\u0026#8217;s Pete Buttigieg, whose fundraising shows little sign of limitations; 300 people on payroll, including 70 in Iowa and 50 in New Hampshire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn other words, the Labor Day campaign launch of the frenzied fall push comes at a moment of tremendous peril for Biden, potential for his rivals and promise for Democrats who, above all else, want to beat Trump. First, though, they have to settle among themselves who will get the chance to do so. And, at the moment, it is possible to see paths for most of the mainstream hopefuls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBiden remains the most plausible candidate, having built up chits over decades in politics dating back to his first election in 1970. But the last week has left some aides more worried than ever. First, during the same New Hampshire day when he bungled war stories, he also told the familiar story about how he entered politics: explaining that the turmoil of 1968, which saw the assassinations of Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr., sparked his civic interest. He then asked his audience at Dartmouth College to imagine the raw emotion had it been Barack Obama who was assassinated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBiden\u0026rsquo;s critics and even some allies cringed. It\u0026rsquo;s never a good look to summon a theory about the assassination of the nation\u0026rsquo;s first black President, especially if Biden was the constitutional successor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBiden aides sprang to action, in a way not before seen during this campaign, to call out anyone who was being critical or snarky \u0026mdash; and to shame journalists who had tweeted the quote without context. It was the first real show of a coordinated rapid response from Biden\u0026rsquo;s Philadelphia headquarters, and it quieted some jitters among Biden allies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen came a poll that showed Biden\u0026rsquo;s numbers tanking. Monmouth University\u0026rsquo;s survey \u0026mdash; since described by its pollster as an outlier \u0026mdash; showed Sanders and Warren each at 20% and Biden at 19%.

Only candidates who win 15% support are eligible to win delegates to the nominating convention in Milwaukee. A brokered convention is entirely possible, which is why Buttigieg delegate chief George Hornedo has been aggressively working the phone with super delegates, who, in a twist of irony, may end having more power than in 2016 to actually decide the nomination. The rules changes passed after 2016 strip super delegates, the party insiders who can back anyone at the convention, of their votes on the first ballot. But if a brokered solution cannot be found, they may end up being called upon to sway the results. The fallout may be nothing short of chaos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is why Biden\u0026rsquo;s backers are trying to win the nomination outright, on that first ballot.

Phillips may want us to think he\u0026rsquo;s giving us a movie all about the emptiness of our culture, but really, he\u0026rsquo;s just offering a prime example of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eJoker\u003c/em\u003e is a stand-alone origin story that dovetails with, but does not strictly follow, DC Universe Batman lore. Phoenix\u0026rsquo;s Arthur Fleck \u0026mdash; he\u0026rsquo;ll later become one of Batman\u0026rsquo;s nemeses, the Joker, in case you didn\u0026rsquo;t already know that \u0026mdash; is an odd, lonely guy who lives at home with the mother (played by a wan Frances Conroy) he love-hates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArthur works for a sad rent-a-clown joint, and nothing ever goes right. This is clear from the moment we meet him: he\u0026rsquo;s tense, nervous and he can\u0026rsquo;t ever relax. The movie is set in a Gotham City that\u0026rsquo;s a lazy approximation of gritty 1970s-era New York, complete with garbage strikes and \u0026ldquo;super-rats\u0026rdquo; overrunning the city. On the job in clown costume, Arthur gets beaten up by a mob of nasty punks \u0026mdash; and then almost gets fired because they stole and broke the \u0026ldquo;going out of business sign\u0026rdquo; he was twirling for a client.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore bad stuff happens, day in, day out. He gets angrier and more isolated by the minute. No one is ever kind to Arthur; he\u0026rsquo;s the world\u0026rsquo;s saddest punching bag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the city\u0026rsquo;s social services close down, he can no longer receive counseling there, or get his meds. (He carries around a little laminated card that he holds out helpfully whenever he laughs inappropriately, which is pretty much all the time. It reads, \u0026ldquo;Forgive my laughter, I have a brain injury.\u0026rdquo;) The one bright spot of his day, or night, is watching a Johnny Carson-style talk-show host, Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro), on television. He dreams of being a stand-up comic and someday being on the show. His wish will come true, but life will have beaten the poor lad down interminably before then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRead more:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://time.com/5343015/upcoming-joker-movies/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eHere Are All the Upcoming Joker Movies\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs you can probably guess, all of Arthur\u0026#8217;s travails are leading up to a series of \u0026ldquo;See what you made me do?\u0026rdquo; brutalities, most of which happen while he\u0026#8217;s dressed up in his clown suit. Violence makes him feel more in control, less pathetic. Killing \u0026mdash; usually with a gun, but scissors or a good old-fashioned suffocation will do just fine \u0026mdash; empowers him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it\u0026rsquo;s not as if we don\u0026rsquo;t know how this pathology works: In America, there\u0026rsquo;s a mass shooting or attempted act of violence by a guy like Arthur practically every other week.

When Arthur gets fired from his clown job, he struts by the time-clock, deadpans, \u0026ldquo;Oh no, I forgot to punch out\u0026rdquo; and then, wait for it, socks it so hard it dangles from the wall. Make a note of the moment, because you\u0026rsquo;ll be seeing it a lot in your Twitter and Facebook feeds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe movie\u0026rsquo;s cracks \u0026mdash; and it\u0026rsquo;s practically \u003cem\u003eall\u003c/em\u003e cracks \u0026mdash; are stuffed with phony philosophy. \u003cem\u003eJoker\u003c/em\u003e is dark only in a stupidly adolescent way, but it wants us to think it\u0026rsquo;s imparting subtle political or cultural wisdom. Just before one of his more violent tirades, Arthur muses, \u0026ldquo;Everybody just screams at each other. Nobody\u0026rsquo;s civil anymore.\u0026rdquo; Who doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel that way in our terrible modern times? But Arthur\u0026rsquo;s observation is one of those truisms that\u0026rsquo;s so true it just slides off the wall, a message that both the left and the right can get behind and use for their own aims. It means nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, the movie lionizes and glamorizes Arthur even as it shakes its head, faux-sorrowfully, over his violent behavior. There\u0026rsquo;s an aimless subplot involving a neighbor in Arthur\u0026rsquo;s apartment building, played by Zazie Beetz, in an underdeveloped role. (Beetz also appears in another movie here at the festival, Benedict Andrews\u0026rsquo;s \u003cem\u003eSeberg\u003c/em\u003e, where she\u0026rsquo;s given much more to do.) Arthur has a crush on her, and though he does her no harm, there\u0026rsquo;s still something creepily entitled about his attentiveness to her. He could easily be adopted as the patron saint of incels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArthur is a mess, but we\u0026rsquo;re also supposed to think he\u0026rsquo;s kind of great \u0026mdash; a misunderstood savant. Dressed up for his big TV moment in a turquoise paisley shirt, marigold vest and dapper cranberry suit (admittedly a marvelous feat of costume design), Arthur struts down an outdoor stairway like a rock\u0026rsquo;n\u0026rsquo;roll hero. It\u0026rsquo;s the most energizing moment in the movie, but what is it winding us up for? Arthur inspires chaos and anarchy, but the movie makes it look like he\u0026rsquo;s starting a revolution, where the rich are taken down, the poor get everything they need and deserve, and the sad guys who can\u0026rsquo;t get a date become killer heroes. There\u0026rsquo;s a sick joke in there somewhere.

He's been on the straight and narrow for several years now, but Jack still gives Ashley a cell phone so she can call him if she needs him—like when her dad forgets to pick her up from the movies after dark. One day Jack gets a panicked phone call from Ashley, and rushes to his brother's house, only to find Garrett has shot his wife and daughter, and then himself, apparently in the midst of a manic episode. It's ruled a murder/suicide, but something about the case feels wrong to Jack and he starts poking around, to the annoyance of his boss, Howard (Alfred Molina, \u003cem\u003eSpecies, Da Vince Code\u003c/em\u003e).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1560437#p3\"\u003eRead 4 remaining paragraphs\u003c/a\u003e | \u003ca href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1560437\u0026comments=1\"\u003eComments\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"feedflare\"\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=TwzbTZCzoaE:rwMFk9PfE0g:V_sGLiPBpWU\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=TwzbTZCzoaE:rwMFk9PfE0g:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=TwzbTZCzoaE:rwMFk9PfE0g:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=TwzbTZCzoaE:rwMFk9PfE0g:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=TwzbTZCzoaE:rwMFk9PfE0g:qj6IDK7rITs\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=TwzbTZCzoaE:rwMFk9PfE0g:yIl2AUoC8zA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","url":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1560437","published":"2019-08-31T20:45:40Z","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1560437"},{"title":"Unlicensed signal boosters get a boost from Amazon","content":"\u003cdiv id=\"rss-wrap\"\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"intro-image intro-left\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-489611106-800x533.jpg\" alt='You really can find anything in a stock image library: \"Antennas of mobile cellular systems with Wi-Fi hot spot repeater and blue sky.\"'\u003e\u003cp class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-489611106.jpg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"2848\" data-width=\"4272\"\u003eEnlarge\u003c/a\u003e \u003cspan class=\"sep\"\u003e/\u003c/span\u003e You really can find anything in a stock image library: \"Antennas of mobile cellular systems with Wi-Fi hot spot repeater and blue sky.\" (credit: Just_One_Pic / Getty Images)\u003c/p\u003e  \u003c/figure\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ca name=\"page-1\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCell phone signal boosters are powerful devices.

But they\u0026#8217;re often overshadowed by the likes of Argo AI, Cruise, Uber and Waymo — bigger companies that are all pursuing robotaxis designed for cities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlli, meanwhile, is designed for campuses, low-speed environments that include hospitals, military bases and universities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=\"s1\"\u003e\u0026#8220;The public isn’t going to see New York City with autonomous vehicles running around all the time (any time soon),\u0026#8221; Rogers said.

These are places where mobility is needed and people are able to get up close and personal with \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"s1\"\u003ea “friendly robot” like Olli, Rogers said. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eOlli 2.0\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlli and Olli 2.0 are clearly siblings. The low-speed vehicle has the same general shape, and a top speed of 25 miles per hour. And both have been \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/8/18255176/local-motors-olli-3d-printed-self-driving-shuttle-crash-test-footage\"\u003ecrash tested\u003c/a\u003e by Local Motors and come with Level 4 autonomous capability, a designation by the SAE that means the vehicle can handle all aspects of driving in certain conditions without human intervention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlli 2.0 has a lot more range — up to 100 miles on a single charge, according to its spec sheet. The manufacturing process has been improved, and Olli 2.0 is now 80% 3D-printed and has hub motors versus the axle wheel motors in its predecessor. In addition, there are two more seats in Olli 2.0 and new programmable lighting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut where Olli 2.0 really stands out is in the improved user interface and more choices for customers looking to customize the shuttle to suit specific needs. As Rogers recently put it, \u0026#8220;We can pretty much make anything they ask for with the right partners.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Ollieyes1-1.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg class=\"breakout alignnone wp-image-1876001 size-full\" title=\"Local-Motors-Olli -2.0\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Ollieyes1-1.jpg\" alt=\"Local-Motors-Olli -2.0\" width=\"5459\" height=\"3645\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Ollieyes1-1.jpg 5459w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Ollieyes1-1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Ollieyes1-1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Ollieyes1-1.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Ollieyes1-1.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Ollieyes1-1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 5459px) 100vw, 5459px\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe outside of Olli 2.0 is outfitted with a PA system and screens on the front and back to address pedestrians. The screen in the front can be shown as eyes, making Olli 2.0 more approachable and anthropomorphic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside the shuttle, riders will find better speakers and microphones and touchscreens. Local Motors has an open API, which allows for an endless number of UI interfaces. For instance, LG is customizing media content for Olli based on the \u0026#8220;5G future,\u0026#8221; according to Rogers, who said he couldn\u0026#8217;t provide more details just yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAR and VR can also be added, if a customer desires. The interior can be changed to suit different needs as well. For instance, a hospital might want fewer seats and more room to transport patients on beds. It\u0026#8217;s this kind of customization that Rogers believes will give Local Motors an edge over autonomous shuttle competitors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Olli_2.0_Interior.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg class=\"breakout alignnone wp-image-1876043 size-full\" title=\"Local-Motors-Olli-2.0-Interior\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Olli_2.0_Interior.jpg\" alt=\"Local-Motors-Olli-2.0-Interior\" width=\"5472\" height=\"3648\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Olli_2.0_Interior.jpg 5472w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Olli_2.0_Interior.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Olli_2.0_Interior.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Olli_2.0_Interior.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Olli_2.0_Interior.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Olli_2.0_Interior.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 5472px) 100vw, 5472px\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven the way Olli 2.0 communicates has been improved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlli 1.0 used IBM Watson, the AI platform from IBM, for its natural language and speech to text functions. Olli 2.0 has more options. Natural language voice can use Amazon\u0026#8217;s deep learning chatbot service Lex and IBM Watson. Customers can choose one or even combine them.

Or that these micro factories lack the tool and die and stamping equipment found in a traditional automaker\u0026#8217;s factory. Or even that Olli is 3D-printed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA striking and perhaps less obvious difference is how Olli and other creations from Local Motors, and its parent company Local Motors Industries, come to life. LMI has a co-creation and low-volume local production business model. The parent company\u0026#8217;s \u003ca href=\"https://launchforth.io/\"\u003eLaunch Forth\u003c/a\u003e unit manages a digital design community of tens of thousands of engineers and designers that co-creates products for customers.

But even that doesn\u0026#8217;t quite capture the scope of the co-creation. Local Motors partners with dozens of companies and research organizations. Its 3D-printing technology comes from \u003ca href=\"https://www.oakridger.com/news/20171114/microfactory-for-local-motors-only-short-distance-from-oak-ridge\"\u003eOak Ridge National Laboratory\u003c/a\u003e, and Olli itself involves a who\u0026#8217;s who in the sensor, AV and supplier communities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStartup Affectiva provides Olli\u0026#8217;s cognition system, such as facial and mood tracking of its passengers and dynamic route optimization, while Velodyne, Delphi, Robotic Research and Axis Communications handle the perception stack of the self-driving shuttle, according to Local Motors. Nvidia and Sierra Wireless provide much of the Human Machine Interface. Other companies that supply the bits and pieces to Olli include Bosch, Goodyear, Protean and Eastman, to name just a few.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhere in the world is Olli?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday, Olli 1.0 is deployed on nine campuses, the most recent ones at the \u003ca href=\"https://localmotors.com/greater-washington-challenge/\"\u003eJoint Base Myer – Henderson Hall\u003c/a\u003e, a joint base of the U.S. military located around Arlington, Va., which is made up of Fort Myer, Fort McNair and Henderson Hall. Olli was also introduced recently in Rancho Cordova, near Sacramento, Calif.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProduction of Olli 2.0 began in July and deliveries will begin in the fourth quarter of this year.

The filing was packed with interesting tidbits, including that the company, which manufacturers internet-connected stationary bikes and sells an affiliated subscription to its growing library of on-demand fitness content, is raking in more than $900 million in annual revenue. Sure, it\u0026#8217;s not profitable, and it\u0026#8217;s losing an increasing amount of money to sales and marketing efforts, but for a company that many people wrote off from the very beginning, it\u0026#8217;s an impressive feat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite being a hardware, media, interactive software, product design, social connection, apparel and logistics company, according to its S-1, the future of Peloton relies on its talent.

A group of vandals had \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/30/20841288/jack-dorsey-ceo-twitter-account-hacked-chuckle-gang-shane-dawson-james-charles\"\u003egained access to the account\u003c/a\u003e, and used that access to blast out a stream of offensive messages and plugs for their group’s discord channel. Within 15 minutes, the account was back under control and the group was banned from Discord, but the incident was a reminder of the serious vulnerabilities in even the highest-profile accounts, and just how insecure phone-based authentication has become.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"UGu7y3\"\u003eThe hackers got in through Twitter’s text-to-tweet service, operated by the acquired service Cloudhopper. Using Cloudhopper, Twitter users can post tweets by \u003ca href=\"https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-sms\"\u003etexting messages to a shortcode number, usually 40404.\u003c/a\u003e It’s a useful trick for \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/5/3/17304466/minimalist-light-phone-nokia-3310-unihertz-jelly-punky-mp01\"\u003eSimplePhones\u003c/a\u003e or if you just don’t have access to the Twitter app. The system only requires linking your phone number to your Twitter account, which most users already do for separate security reasons. As a result, control of your phone number is usually enough to post tweets to your account, and most users have no idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-float-right\"\u003e\u003caside id=\"2VXFJM\"\u003e\u003cq\u003eA “security oversight” by the provider let the hackers gain control\u003c/q\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"t9tOr9\"\u003eAs it turns out, getting control of Dorsey’s phone number wasn’t as hard as you might think. According to \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/TwitterComms/status/1167591003143847936\"\u003ea Twitter statement\u003c/a\u003e, a “security oversight” by the provider let the hackers gain control. In general terms, this kind of attack is called SIM hacking — essentially convincing a carrier to assigning Dorsey’s number to a new phone that they controlled. It’s not a new technique, although it’s more often used to \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/a/anatomy-of-a-hack\"\u003esteal Bitcoin\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/vbqax3/hackers-sim-swapping-steal-phone-numbers-instagram-bitcoin\"\u003ehigh-value Instagram handles\u003c/a\u003e. Often, it’s as simple as plugging in a leaked password. You can protect yourself by \u003ca href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/zm8a9y/how-to-protect-yourself-from-sim-swapping-hacks\"\u003eadding a PIN code\u003c/a\u003e to your carrier account or registering web accounts like Twitter \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/19/18691401/virtual-id-random-security-protection-email-phone-credit-cards-how-to-generate\"\u003ethrough dummy phone numbers,\u003c/a\u003e but those techniques can be too much to ask for the average user. As a result, SIM swapping has become one of online troublemakers’ favorite techniques — and as we found out today, it works more often than you’d think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"iDDj9E\"\u003eChuckling Squad, the crew that took over Dorsey’s account, has been playing this trick for years. Their most prominent attacks up to this point have been a string of online influencers with \u003ca href=\"https://www.treyexgaming.com/index.php/2019/08/26/how-the-same-hacker-has-hacked-over-10-content-creators/\"\u003eas many as ten different figures\u003c/a\u003e were targeted before Dorsey. They seem to have a particular trick with AT\u0026amp;T, which is also Dorsey’s carrier, although it’s unclear exactly how they gained control. (AT\u0026amp;T did not respond to a request for comment.) \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ba2MyF\"\u003eThe history of this kind of hack is much older than Chuckling Squad or even SIM Swapping. Any system that makes it easier for a user to tweet will also make it easier for a hacker to take control of the account. \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/9/12134754/ceo-jack-dorseys-twitter-account-hack\"\u003eIn 2016\u003c/a\u003e, Dorsey was targeted by a similar attack that took advantage of authorized third party plugins, which have often been abandoned but still retain the permission to send tweets to the account. That technique has grown less prominent as SIM swapping techniques have become more broadly understood, but the basic goals of drive-by vandalism have remained largely unchanged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"HhF0fK\"\u003eStill, the incident is embarrassing for Twitter, and not simply because of the immediate scramble to regain control of the CEO’s account. The security world has known about SIM swapping attacks for years, and Dorsey’s account had been vandalized before. The simple failure to secure control of the CEO’s account is a significant failure for the company, with implications far beyond a few minutes of chaos.

Some border agents have \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/30/14438280/trump-border-agents-search-social-media-instagram\"\u003eaggressively pushed visitors\u003c/a\u003e to disclose their account handles, even when the practice was optional.

Even so, it can have a chilling effect on speech, making people afraid to express their political views online — or say anything at all, since social media posts can be easily misinterpreted. “There are lots of free speech and freedom of association issues with looking at someone’s social media, even to vet them to come to the US,” says Sophia Cope, senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"OzQxxg\"\u003eWhile people have been \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/12/14583124/nasa-sidd-bikkannavar-detained-cbp-phone-search-trump-travel-ban\"\u003edetained\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/01/14/complaints-describes-border-agents-interrogating-muslim-americans-asking-for-social-media-accounts/\"\u003ephysically assaulted\u003c/a\u003e for refusing to unlock electronic devices, there have been relatively few major incidents involving social media specifically.

But the FBI said those \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/16/10293306/san-bernardino-shooter-social-media-fbi\"\u003ereports weren’t true\u003c/a\u003e. A 2019 \u003ca href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/publication/social-media-monitoring\"\u003eBrennan Center for Justice report\u003c/a\u003e noted that DHS pilot programs involving social media surveillance were “notably unsuccessful” at finding national security threats. Instead, co-author Faiza Patel \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/FaizaPatelBCJ/status/1166423723152498689\"\u003eargued on Twitter\u003c/a\u003e, it’s most useful for “targeting political and religious views — or even assumptions about them based on what your friends say.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-float-right\"\u003e\u003caside id=\"DxiZNa\"\u003e\u003cq\u003e‘We need to know what structure is in place to ensure that travelers don’t face abuse.’\u003c/q\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"glYXpn\"\u003eSo is CBP really judging visa applicants on their Twitter feed or Facebook friend list? Cases like Ajjawi’s — where someone was apparently punished for things they didn’t even say — certainly seem to be rare. But we’re also relying on very incomplete data, and more vulnerable visitors could be far more hesitant to tell their stories. “I think there’s something very unique about this set of circumstances,” says Center for Democracy and Technology policy counsel Mana Azarmi, because the incident involves a student at a prestigious university with a prominent university paper that could pick up the story. “That kind of high visibility — we shouldn’t expect that of every interaction with CBP.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"e0HZSi\"\u003eA CBP spokesperson emphasized to \u003cem\u003eThe Verge\u003c/em\u003e that device searches affect “less than one-hundredth of one percent of travelers arriving to the United States.” But Azarmi points out that we don’t really know how these travelers are chosen — including whether they’re singled out for unfair reasons, and whether they’re regularly asked about troubling details like their friends’ opinions. “Are CBP personnel instructed to do that? Is that something that they’re looking out for?” she says. “We need to know what structure is in place to ensure that travelers don’t face abuse. And we don’t have that kind of information.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"cdpgxx\"\u003eCivil liberties advocates aren’t even sure how border agents might have found Ajjawi’s friends’ posts. Per \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/13/15967466/airport-border-search-cloud-data-unlock-phone-customs\"\u003ea rule from 2017\u003c/a\u003e, officers are supposed to avoid accessing any data that’s stored outside the device, which includes full social media feeds on a phone or laptop. In this case, an officer could have seen cached posts, they could have looked his friends up on a separate computer, or they could have simply broken the rules — but there’s little outside oversight that would help us figure out which of those scenarios is most likely. \u003cem\u003eThe Verge\u003c/em\u003e asked CBP to confirm that it would have put devices in airplane mode before searching them; a spokesperson referred us to an information sheet that doesn’t mention the policy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"yR0E9r\"\u003eUnlike texts or emails, it’s hard to make social media truly private without defeating some of its purpose. And other many other law enforcement agencies use publicly available data for surveillance; police, for example, have \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/12/13257080/police-surveillance-facebook-twitter-instagram-geofeedia\"\u003escraped Facebook and Twitter data\u003c/a\u003e to monitor protests. There’s still no consensus on how deeply the government can mine this kind of data. But when there’s so much of it easily accessible, it can be used in deeply troubling ways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"KOa2cX\"\u003eRight now, the best way to protect social media data at the border is simply to \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/15/14629022/border-search-customs-data-privacy-encryption\"\u003euninstall apps\u003c/a\u003e and close browser tabs — but that doesn’t settle the question of when the government should be able to look up your friends online. “We should only expect that stories like this will become more common,” says Azarmi of this week’s events. “Because this collection has become more routine.”\u003c/p\u003e","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/31/20837448/social-media-dhs-cbp-surveillance-us-border-ismail-ajjawi-harvard","published":"2019-08-31T13:53:56Z","guid":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/31/20837448/social-media-dhs-cbp-surveillance-us-border-ismail-ajjawi-harvard"}]},{"url":"https://www.wired.com/feed","items":[{"title":"Space

City management officials could learn much from leaders like Cisco, Amazon and Google. These companies have made it their business to not just collect data, but  utilize it to improve livelihoods and communities.  As we look to their successes, it becomes increasingly evident that the answer to creating smarter cities lies largely in surveillance technology that captures \u003ca href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/01/24/how-iot-and-big-data-applications-will-revolutionize-our-smart-cities/\"\u003edata analytics\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the rise in surveillance technology and predictive analytics, we can make smart cities smarter and effectively, increase their efficiency. The reality is, however, that connectivity is never a guarantee. Therefore, necessary data must be present, regardless of connectedness, to ensure real-time decisions can be made. Satisfactory amounts of local storage must exist to position the most perceptive data nearest to the point of compute.

In many ways, cities are already doing this – from intelligent street lights optimizing routes based on traffic patterns to reduce emergency response time by 20 to 30 percent, to advanced surveillance cameras with analytics deployed to enhance security operations, leading to a reduction in crime by \u003ca href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/capital-projects-and-infrastructure/our-insights/smart-cities-digital-solutions-for-a-more-livable-future\"\u003e30 to 40 percent\u003c/a\u003e.

So, how can a city implement surveillance technology to better secure a city and enable smarter analyses? The first step is identifying video storage solutions positioned at the center of a smart city’s surveillance application. These solutions enable recordings, data retention, predictive analytics and real-time alerts. The next step is to position data at the edge and provide ample time for cities to make sense of patterns. More than ever before, cities will need to come together to integrate their technologies and ultimately make their networks smarter. This is a challenge that will require broad cooperation across its systems. Surveillance storage technology is the foundation to this strategy, ensuring timely data access and availability from edge to cloud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe post \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/08/31/surveillance-at-the-heart-of-smart-cities/\"\u003eSurveillance at the Heart of Smart Cities\u003c/a\u003e appeared first on \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\"\u003eReadWrite\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"feedflare\"\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=NQNo6B8twTE:EdJQzSsYWKM:qj6IDK7rITs\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=NQNo6B8twTE:EdJQzSsYWKM:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?i=NQNo6B8twTE:EdJQzSsYWKM:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=NQNo6B8twTE:EdJQzSsYWKM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=NQNo6B8twTE:EdJQzSsYWKM:Ij26kaj3iuU\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=Ij26kaj3iuU\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=NQNo6B8twTE:EdJQzSsYWKM:C2pbw5bZMiI\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=C2pbw5bZMiI\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=NQNo6B8twTE:EdJQzSsYWKM:HaYztYP2wyo\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=HaYztYP2wyo\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=NQNo6B8twTE:EdJQzSsYWKM:fvyXWMd9xfE\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=fvyXWMd9xfE\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=NQNo6B8twTE:EdJQzSsYWKM:OqabYuBsmOY\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=OqabYuBsmOY\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/readwriteweb/~4/NQNo6B8twTE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/readwriteweb/~3/NQNo6B8twTE/","published":"2019-08-31T15:00:54Z","guid":"https://readwrite.com/?p=156535"}]},{"url":"https://feeds.feedburner.com/blogspot/MKuf?format=xml","items":[]},{"url":"https://readwrite.com/feed/","items":[{"title":"Surveillance at the Heart of Smart Cities","content":"\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cimg width=\"300\" height=\"185\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Surveillance-at-the-Heart-of-Smart-Cities-300x185.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"surveillance and smart cities\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Surveillance-at-the-Heart-of-Smart-Cities-300x185.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Surveillance-at-the-Heart-of-Smart-Cities-260x160.jpg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Surveillance-at-the-Heart-of-Smart-Cities.jpg 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eToday’s cities are living entities.

But \u003ca href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/06/04/the-potential-holy-shit-threats-surrounding-ai-and-ml/\"\u003esurveillance will be at the heart of smart cities\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese technologies will help with a myriad of everyday city demands, in addition to more intricate challenges pertaining to security, healthcare, mobility, energy and economic development.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe need accurate insights into cities like never before.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith more than half of the world’s population residing in cities, this need for smarter and more accurate insights into their everyday workings is monumental. City management officials could learn much from leaders like Cisco, Amazon and Google. These companies have made it their business to not just collect data, but  utilize it to improve livelihoods and communities.  As we look to their successes, it becomes increasingly evident that the answer to creating smarter cities lies largely in surveillance technology that captures \u003ca href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/01/24/how-iot-and-big-data-applications-will-revolutionize-our-smart-cities/\"\u003edata analytics\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the rise in surveillance technology and predictive analytics, we can make smart cities smarter and effectively, increase their efficiency. The reality is, however, that connectivity is never a guarantee. Therefore, necessary data must be present, regardless of connectedness, to ensure real-time decisions can be made. Satisfactory amounts of local storage must exist to position the most perceptive data nearest to the point of compute. This speaks to the increasing importance of the edge, as well as embedded storage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGrowth in real-time data is causing a shift in digital storage needs.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe growth of real-time data though edge analytics is causing a shift in the type of digital storage cities need. Fast, uncompromised access to data is becoming ever more critical. With a recent study, \u003ca href=\"https://www.seagate.com/our-story/data-age-2025/\"\u003eData Age 2025: The Digitization of the World from Edge to Core\u003c/a\u003e, estimating that 175 zettabytes of data will be generated by 2025, there has never been a greater volume of insights at our fingertips and cities must step up to develop ways to use this data for good. In many ways, cities are already doing this – from intelligent street lights optimizing routes based on traffic patterns to reduce emergency response time by 20 to 30 percent, to advanced surveillance cameras with analytics deployed to enhance security operations, leading to a reduction in crime by \u003ca href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/capital-projects-and-infrastructure/our-insights/smart-cities-digital-solutions-for-a-more-livable-future\"\u003e30 to 40 percent\u003c/a\u003e. However, we can do so much more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo be a true smart city today, cities will need an \u0026#8220;\u003ca href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/05/19/what-to-expect-from-a-modern-iot-platform-in-2019/\"\u003eedge tier\u003c/a\u003e” approach to store, filter and manage data closer to the sensors. To gain deeper insights, the data is then stored and analyzed for longer periods of time in the edge domain as well as in the \u003ca href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/04/11/3-surprising-benefits-of-the-cloud-in-iot/\"\u003ecloud\u003c/a\u003e or backend. Edge analytics that capture and collect data on network video recorders (NVRs) make it possible to act in real-time. With this technology, cities can find missing persons, notify residents of nearby emergencies and send out traffic congestion warnings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eData insights will provide many wide-ranging benefits to cities.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe opportunities data analysis and data-driven urban improvement present are both hugely exciting and impossible to ignore. Behavioral analytics, thermal cameras and \u003ca href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/07/10/businesses-can-safely-and-efficiently-adopt-artificial-intelligence/\"\u003eAI engines\u003c/a\u003e in edge devices like NVRs are just a sampling of the technologies that have given us the ability to remain constantly connected on a vast network. By horizontally interrelating individual systems, we can now develop insights into various mechanisms. This includes patterns in electricity, water, sanitation, transportation, environmental monitoring and weather intelligence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWest Hollywood\u0026#8217;s Innovation Division is an excellent example to look to.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTake for instance, West Hollywood’s Innovation Division, which recently received the American Planning Association (APA) Technology Division’s Smart Cities Award for the “WeHo Smart City” Strategic Plan. Its three-part plan consisted of strategies including:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eData-driven decision-making rolling out to departments citywide\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCollaboration and experimentation designed to enable City Hall staff to work better together.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAutomation of processes to improve public safety and manage the built environment through smart city sensors and smart building programs.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith data collected from predictive analytics based on Deep Learning activities in the back-end, in some cases for over a year, we can pre-identify trends to manage incidents in one sector that directly impact another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAccess to real-time data and surveillance tech is key.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCities need data in the moment and on the go. This places  a larger demand on the edge to produce the predictive and reliable information required, often in real-time. In fact, reports (Seagate) predict that due to the infusion of data into our city workflows and personal streams of life, nearly 30 percent of the “Global Datasphere” \u0026#8212; meaning the amount of data created, captured or replicated across the globe – will be in real-time by 2025.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s a lot of real-time data. So, how can a city implement surveillance technology to better secure a city and enable smarter analyses? The first step is identifying video storage solutions positioned at the center of a smart city’s surveillance application. These solutions enable recordings, data retention, predictive analytics and real-time alerts. The next step is to position data at the edge and provide ample time for cities to make sense of patterns. More than ever before, cities will need to come together to integrate their technologies and ultimately make their networks smarter. This is a challenge that will require broad cooperation across its systems. Surveillance storage technology is the foundation to this strategy, ensuring timely data access and availability from edge to cloud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe post \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/08/31/surveillance-at-the-heart-of-smart-cities/\"\u003eSurveillance at the Heart of Smart Cities\u003c/a\u003e appeared first on \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\"\u003eReadWrite\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://readwrite.com/2019/08/31/surveillance-at-the-heart-of-smart-cities/","published":"2019-08-31T15:00:54Z","guid":"https://readwrite.com/?p=156535"}]},{"url":"https://rss.dw.com/rdf/rss-en-all","items":[{"title":"Hezbollah chief threatens Israel with retaliation","content":"","url":"https://www.dw.com/en/hezbollah-chief-threatens-israel-with-retaliation/a-50243449?maca=en-rss-en-all-1573-rdf","published":"2019-08-31T20:47:00Z","guid":"https://www.dw.com/en/hezbollah-chief-threatens-israel-with-retaliation/a-50243449?maca=en-rss-en-all-1573-rdf"},{"title":"Opinion: Spineless Borussia Dortmund show same old problems never went away","content":"","url":"https://www.dw.com/en/opinion-spineless-borussia-dortmund-show-same-old-problems-never-went-away/a-50243356?maca=en-rss-en-all-1573-rdf","published":"2019-08-31T19:40:00Z","guid":"https://www.dw.com/en/opinion-spineless-borussia-dortmund-show-same-old-problems-never-went-away/a-50243356?maca=en-rss-en-all-1573-rdf"},{"title":"Poland, Germany and the shadow of World War II","content":"","url":"https://www.dw.com/en/poland-germany-and-the-shadow-of-world-war-ii/a-50221515?maca=en-rss-en-all-1573-rdf","published":"2019-08-31T18:44:00Z","guid":"https://www.dw.com/en/poland-germany-and-the-shadow-of-world-war-ii/a-50221515?maca=en-rss-en-all-1573-rdf"},{"title":"Opinion: 80 years after World War II, we must fight for an open Europe","content":"","url":"https://www.dw.com/en/opinion-80-years-after-world-war-ii-we-must-fight-for-an-open-europe/a-50233826?maca=en-rss-en-all-1573-rdf","published":"2019-08-31T18:36:00Z","guid":"https://www.dw.com/en/opinion-80-years-after-world-war-ii-we-must-fight-for-an-open-europe/a-50233826?maca=en-rss-en-all-1573-rdf"},{"title":"Afghan forces repel Taliban's Kunduz offensive","content":"","url":"https://www.dw.com/en/afghan-forces-repel-taliban-s-kunduz-offensive/a-50238301?maca=en-rss-en-all-1573-rdf","published":"2019-08-31T18:32:00Z","guid":"https://www.dw.com/en/afghan-forces-repel-taliban-s-kunduz-offensive/a-50238301?maca=en-rss-en-all-1573-rdf"},{"title":"Greens expect big gains in Saxony, Brandenburg state elections","content":"","url":"https://www.dw.com/en/greens-expect-big-gains-in-saxony-brandenburg-state-elections/a-50242883?maca=en-rss-en-all-1573-rdf","published":"2019-08-31T18:24:00Z","guid":"https://www.dw.com/en/greens-expect-big-gains-in-saxony-brandenburg-state-elections/a-50242883?maca=en-rss-en-all-1573-rdf"},{"title":"F2 driver Anthoine Hubert killed in huge crash at Spa Francorchamps","content":"","url":"https://www.dw.com/en/f2-driver-anthoine-hubert-killed-in-huge-crash-at-spa-francorchamps/a-50241854?maca=en-rss-en-all-1573-rdf","published":"2019-08-31T17:13:00Z","guid":"https://www.dw.com/en/f2-driver-anthoine-hubert-killed-in-huge-crash-at-spa-francorchamps/a-50241854?maca=en-rss-en-all-1573-rdf"},{"title":"Bundesliga: Timo Werner the thorn in Rose's side as Nagelsmann stays perfect","content":"","url":"https://www.dw.com/en/bundesliga-timo-werner-the-thorn-in-rose-s-side-as-nagelsmann-stays-perfect/a-50233780?maca=en-rss-en-all-1573-rdf","published":"2019-08-31T16:24:00Z","guid":"https://www.dw.com/en/bundesliga-timo-werner-the-thorn-in-rose-s-side-as-nagelsmann-stays-perfect/a-50233780?maca=en-rss-en-all-1573-rdf"},{"title":"Robert F.

It’s startlingly accurate, and because of that, it’s equally inspiring, demoralizing, hopeful, and enraging. Please go see it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s been forgotten now, but the Iraq War and its abominable consequences — the hundreds of thousands of deaths, the rise of the Islamic State group, the nightmare oozing into Syria, arguably the presidency of Donald Trump — almost didn’t happen. In the weeks before the U.S.-led invasion on March 19, 2003, the American and British case for war was collapsing. It looked like a badly made jalopy, its engine smoking and various parts falling off as it trundled erratically down the road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor this brief moment, the George W. Bush administration appeared to have overreached. It would be extremely tough for the U.S. to invade without the U.K., its faithful Mini-Me, at its side. But in the U.K., the idea of war without approval from the United Nations Security Council was \u003ca href=\"https://www.ipsos.com/ipsos-mori/en-uk/iraq-last-pre-war-polls\"\u003edeeply unpopular\u003c/a\u003e. Moreover, we now know that Peter Goldsmith, the British attorney general, had \u003ca href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/jamesball/here-is-how-the-uks-attorney-general-changed-his-mind-on-the\"\u003etold Prime Minister Tony Blair\u003c/a\u003e that an Iraq resolution passed by the Security Council in November 2002 “does not authorise the use of military force without a further determination by the Security Council.” (The top lawyer at the Foreign Office, the British equivalent of the U.S. State Department, put it even more strongly: “To use force without Security Council authority would amount to the crime of aggression.\u0026#8221;) So Blair was desperate to get a thumbs-up from the U.N. Yet to everyone’s surprise, the 15-country Security Council remained recalcitrant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn March 1, the U.K. Observer threw a grenade into this extraordinarily fraught situation: a \u003ca href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/mar/02/usa.iraq\"\u003eleaked January 31 email\u003c/a\u003e from a National Security Agency manager. The NSA manager was demanding a full court espionage press on the members of the Security Council — “minus US and GBR of course,” the manager jocularly said — as well as non-Security Council countries who might be producing useful chatter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat this demonstrated was that Bush and Blair, who had both said they wanted the Security Council to hold an up or down vote on a resolution giving a legal stamp of approval for war, were bluffing. They knew they were losing. It showed that while they claimed they \u003cem\u003ehad \u003c/em\u003eto invade Iraq because they cared so much about upholding the effectiveness of the U.N., they were happy to pressure fellow U.N. members, up to and including the collection of blackmail material. It proved the NSA plan was unusual enough that, somewhere in the labyrinthine intelligence world, someone was upset enough that he or she was willing to risk going to prison for a long time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat person was Katharine Gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlayed craftily in “Official Secrets” by Keira Knightley, Gun was a translator at the General Communications Headquarters, the British equivalent of the NSA. On one level, “Official Secrets” is a straightforward, suspenseful drama about her. You learn how she got the email, why she leaked it, how she did it, why she soon confessed, the horrendous consequences she faced, and the unique legal strategy that forced the British government to drop all charges against her. At the time, Daniel Ellsberg said her actions were “more timely and potentially more important than the Pentagon Papers … truth-telling like this can stop a war.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn a subtler level, the film asks this question: Why didn’t the leak make a true difference? Yes, it contributed to opposition to the U.S. and U.K. on the Security Council, which never voted on another Iraq resolution, because Bush and Blair knew they would lose. Yet Blair was able to shrug this off and obtain a vote by the British Parliament several weeks later endorsing his war.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is one main answer to this question, both in “Official Secrets” and reality: the U.S. corporate media. “Official Secrets” helps illustrate the ideological malfeasance by the American press, which eagerly jumped on this grenade to save its foxhole buddies in the Bush administration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s easy to imagine a different history than the one we’ve lived. British politicians, like American ones, are loath to criticize their intelligence agencies. But serious follow-up on the Observer story by the elite U.S. media would have generated attention from members of the U.S. Congress. This in turn would have opened up space for British members of Parliament opposed to an invasion to ask what on earth was going on. The rationale for war was disintegrating so quickly that even some modest delay could easily have become indefinite postponement. Bush and Blair both knew this, and it’s why they pushed ahead so relentlessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut in this world, the New York Times published literally nothing about the NSA leak between the date of its publication in the U.K. and the start of the war almost three weeks later. The Washington Post placed a single 500-word article on page A17. Its headline: “Spying Report No Shock to U.N.” The Los Angeles Times similarly ran one piece before the war, the headline of which explained, “Forgery or no, some say it\u0026#8217;s nothing to get worked up about.” This article gave space to the former counsel of the CIA to suggest that the email was not real.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the most fruitful line of attack on the Observer\u0026#8217;s story. As “Official Secrets” shows, American television was initially quite interested in putting one of the Observer reporters on air. These invitations quickly evaporated as the Drudge Report splashed claims that the email was obviously fake. Why? Because it used British spellings of words, such as \u0026#8220;favourable,\u0026#8221; and hence couldn\u0026#8217;t have been written by an American.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn reality, the original leak to the Observer used American spellings, but before publication the paper\u0026#8217;s support staff had accidentally changed them to British versions without the reporters noticing. And as usual when faced with an attack from the right-wing, television networks in the U.S. cowered in abject terror. By the time the spelling minutiae was straightened out, they’d sprinted a thousand miles away from the Observer’s scoop and had zero interest in revisiting it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe little attention the story got was largely thanks to the journalist and activist Norman Solomon, and the organization he founded, the Institute for Public Accuracy, or IPA. Solomon had traveled to Baghdad just months before and co-written the book “\u003ca href=\"http://www.coldtype.net/Assets.04/Essays.04/TARGET.IRAQ.pdf\"\u003eTarget Iraq: What the News Media Didn’t Tell You\u003c/a\u003e,” which came out in late January 2003.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday, Solomon remembers that “I felt instant kinship — and, actually, what I’d describe as love — for whoever had taken the enormous risk of revealing the NSA memo. Of course, at the time I was clueless about who’d done it.” He soon penned a syndicated column titled “American Media Dodging U.N. Surveillance Story.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy hadn’t the paper of record covered it, Solomon asked Alison Smale, then a deputy foreign editor at the New York Times. “It\u0026#8217;s not that we haven\u0026#8217;t been interested,\u0026#8221; Smale told him. The problem was that “we could get no confirmation or comment\u0026#8221; about the NSA email from U.S. officials. But “we are still definitely looking into it,” said Smale. “It\u0026#8217;s not that we\u0026#8217;re not.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Times never mentioned Gun until January 2004, 10 months later. Even then, it didn’t appear in the news section. Instead, thanks to urging from IPA, Times columnist Bob Herbert looked into the story, and, perplexed that the news editors had passed, \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/19/opinion/a-single-conscience-v-the-state.html\"\u003etook it on himself\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, at this point you may want to collapse from despair. But don’t.

Only recently has she revealed some of her key motivation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was already very suspicious about the arguments for war,” she says via email. So she went to a bookstore and headed to the politics section and looked for something about Iraq. She bought two books and read them cover to cover that weekend. Together they “basically convinced me that there was no real evidence for this war.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of these books was “\u003ca href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/233483/war-plan-iraq-by-milan-rai/9781859845011/\"\u003eWar Plan Iraq: Ten Reasons Against War on Iraq\u003c/a\u003e” by Milan Rai. The second was “Target Iraq,” the book co-authored by Solomon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Target Iraq” was published by Context Books, a tiny company that went bankrupt soon afterwards. It arrived in stores just weeks before Gun found it. Within days after she read it, the January 31 NSA email appeared in her inbox, and she quickly decided what she had to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was stunned to hear Katharine say that the ‘Target Iraq’ book had influenced her decision to reveal the NSA memo,” Solomon now says. “I didn’t know how to quite fathom [it].”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat does all this mean?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor journalists who care about journalism, it means that, while you may often feel that you’re shouting pointlessly into the wind, you can never predict who your work will reach and how it will affect them. The people inside giant, powerful institutions are not all supervillains in impermeable bubbles. Most are regular human beings who live in the same world as everyone else and, like everyone else, are struggling to do the right thing as they see it. Take seriously the chance that you are communicating with someone who might take action you’d never expect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[1](%7B%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"shortcode\" data-shortcode=\"newsletter\" data-campaign=\"\" data-cta=\"\" data-headline=\"\" data-layout=\"\" data-subhead=\"\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[1] --\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor nonjournalists and journalists alike, the lesson is also this: Be not downhearted. Both Solomon and Gun remain deeply distressed that they did everything they could imagine doing to stop the Iraq War, and it happened anyway. “I feel gratified that a book I co-wrote had such ripple effects,” says Solomon. “At the same time, I truly feel it hardly matters what I feel.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I think that Gun and Solomon\u0026#8217;s sense of failure is the wrong way of looking at what they did and what others can do. The people who tried to stop the Vietnam War only succeeded after millions had died, and many of those writers and activists saw themselves as failures too. But in the 1980s, when factions of the Reagan administration wanted to conduct full-scale invasions in Latin America, they couldn’t get it off the ground because of the base of organization and knowledge created years earlier. The bitter fact that the U.S. settled for its second choice — unleashing death squads that slaughtered tens of thousands across the region — doesn’t mean that Vietnam-style carpet bombing wouldn’t have been much worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLikewise, Gun, Solomon and the millions of people who fought the onrushing Iraq War failed, in some sense. But anyone who was paying attention then knew that Iraq was intended as just the first step in a U.S. conquest of the entire Middle East. They didn’t prevent the Iraq War. But they, at least so far, helped prevent the Iran War.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo check out “\u003ca href=\"https://www.ifcfilms.com/films/official-secrets\"\u003eOfficial Secrets\u003c/a\u003e” as soon as it appears in a theater near you.

Como Skocpol escreveu em 2013:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eA maré só pode virar na próxima década por meio da criação de uma política de mudança climática que envolva uma ampla mobilização popular de centro esquerda. É isso que será necessário para combater a associação entre a oposição da elite do livre mercado e a mobilização da direita contra soluções para o aquecimento global. (…) Enquanto isso, liberais e moderados precisam construir um movimento populista anti-aquecimento global do seu próprio lado do espectro político.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSanders, é claro, não é o único a adotar uma abordagem centrada em mobilização popular, extensão de seu longo apelo por uma “revolução política”. Essa mobilização também faz parte dos planos dos organizadores do Movimento Sunrise para vencer política climática. Uma das principais mensagens que Weber me disse a partir de seus estudos sobre a disputa em torno do \u003cem\u003ecap-and-trade\u003c/em\u003e “é que você realmente precisa de um movimento que vá pressionar durante e depois da campanha, é preciso cobrar os políticos. Não basta apenas vencer as eleições.” Como Weber disse, reformas estruturais como o fim do obstrucionismo e do Colégio Eleitoral — demandas que não aparecem nos planos de Sanders — provavelmente serão pontos-chave para conseguir aprovar essa legislação. Mas delinear uma política que visa à construção de um movimento é fundamental para tornar possível uma votação no plenário.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[4](%7B%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22right%22%7D) --\u003e\u003cblockquote class=\"stylized pull-right\" data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"right\"\u003e\u003c!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[4] --\u003e\u0026#8220;A maré só pode virar na próxima década por meio da criação de uma política de mudança climática que envolva uma ampla mobilização popular de centro esquerda,\u0026#8221; escreveu Skocpol em 2013.\u003c!-- END-CONTENT(pullquote)[4] --\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c!-- END-BLOCK(pullquote)[4] --\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSe um dos maiores erros da Waxman-Markey foi a inabilidade de seus apoiadores para mostrar como a lei climática tornaria a vida das pessoas mais fácil, o New Deal Verde opera constantemente entregando e divulgando ganhos tangíveis em qualidade de vida, usando vitórias prévias como uma oportunidade para obter mais apoio junto às muitas e muitas pessoas que serão necessárias para desafiar o poder colossal dos executivos de combustíveis fósseis, dispostos a ir à luta de um jeito ou de outro. O New Deal Verde de Sanders oferece à população uma visão de quão melhor o mundo seria sem eles; seus princípios e sua política não estão apartados.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eO plano de Sanders prevê uma série de investimentos tanto em trabalhadores como em comunidades já atingidas duramente pelo declínio no número de empregos em indústrias como a do carvão. As provisões para uma transição justa proporcionariam cinco anos de seguro desemprego, uma garantia salarial e um monte de outros benefícios para trabalhadores, assim como US$5,9 bilhões em financiamento a agências regionais de desenvolvimento econômico como a Comissão Regional Apalachiana. Reforçando quão sólida essa transição será, o New Deal Verde vai gastar seus primeiros dois anos “estabelecendo intensamente uma rede de segurança social para garantir que ninguém será deixado para trás”, expandido programas estatais de bem-estar social — como almoços gratuitos nas escolas e programa de suplemento alimentício — que em décadas recentes passaram a sofrer ataque tanto dos democratas como dos republicanos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHá também várias referências à implementação do [seguro de saúde] Medicare para Todos e a um aumento expressivo da filiação sindical no texto que a equipe de Sanders apresentou em outro plano na semana passada. Comunidades em todo o país também poderiam receber auxílio financeiro para assumir o controle de suas instalações elétricas particulares, e o plano corajosamente estabelece um esquema detalhado para “acabar com a ganância em nosso sistema de energia” e garantir que a “energia renovável gerada pelo New Deal Verde seja de propriedade pública” — uma condição que certamente vai desagradar os atuais proprietários das instalações, que \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/11/01/bp-washington-state-carbon-tax-initiative/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003egastaram milhões\u003c/a\u003e bloqueando medidas climáticas em \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/07/26/ohio-billion-dollar-nuclear-bailout-firstenergy/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ecada esfera do governo\u003c/a\u003e. Inicialmente, o Estado vai ficar com o lucro proveniente dos novos serviços de energia, mas, de acordo com o plano, essa energia renovável será “virtualmente gratuita” depois de 2035.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsando uma velha cartilha, republicanos vão associar ao socialismo qualquer plano voltado a refrear emissões — seja a taxação de carbono, seja um padrão de eficiência energética. O plano de Sanders não se esquiva do fato de que o governo realmente vai desempenhar um papel mais ativo na economia — ou que a vida da maioria das pessoas será melhor por isso.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEm vez de ser receptivo aos interesses dos combustíveis fósseis na mesa de negociações, Sanders os elege como inimigo número um. Há tanto razões práticas quanto políticas para não alistar as colegas da ExxonMobil na transição para uma economia de baixo carbono: o centro de seu modelo de negócios — desenterrar e queimar tanto carvão, óleo e gás quanto possível — não mudou, e é claramente incompatível com o processo de descarbonização no tempo que a ciência diz ser necessário para evitar uma catástrofe. Além de banir o fraturamento e a “decapitação” de montanhas para mineração de carvão, assim como a extração em áreas estatais, Sanders planeja “processar a indústria dos combustíveis fósseis pelos danos causados”, referindo-se especificamente a revelações feitas nos últimos anos mostrando que a Exxon financiou a desinformação em torno do clima, mesmo sabendo muito bem o dano que o aquecimento global representa. “Essas corporações e seus executivos não deveriam se safar depois de esconder a verdade do povo americano. Eles deveriam pagar pela destruição que sabidamente causaram”, afirma o plano. Nesse aspecto, a proposta de Sanders é mais combativa que a de Ocasio-Cortez e Markey, que não menciona combustíveis fósseis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiante de uma luta historicamente tímida quando se trata de dar nome aos bois — e que frequentemente apresenta o problema como sendo de ação coletiva —, o New Deal Verde encoraja uma estratégia de \u0026#8220;nós contra eles\u0026#8221; não muito diferente da adotada por sua homônima. “Acho que as pessoas em geral se sentem apavoradas em relação à crise climática. Mas elas também foram enganadas, em parte, pela indústria de combustíveis fósseis, para acreditar que é tudo nossa culpa”, diz Weber. “Essa obviamente não é a verdadeira história. A história real é que estamos nessa confusão graças a um punhado de bilionários, com seus lobistas e políticos. Se vamos realmente tentar superar essa crise, as pessoas precisam ouvir a verdade, precisam ficar furiosas em relação a isso e saber que, se tirarmos esses caras do caminho, poderemos ter um mundo melhor para todo mundo.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eTradução: Amarílis Lage\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe post \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\"

The fires may push toward the forests, but are mostly snuffed out at that border, Archibald said, unless trees are cut down making tropical forests more vulnerable. When a tropical forest is burned, the trees die and the carbon dioxide goes up and doesn\u0026#8217;t return to the system quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;The main message is: yes we have a lot of fire, but it\u0026#8217;s not bad and can be very good for the ecology,\u0026#8221; she said. \u0026#8220;We don\u0026#8217;t know how many deforestation fires we have but the best evidence is that our forests are not decreasing, they are in fact increasing.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost deforestation occurred in West Africa in the 19th century, Archibald said, adding that Cameroon and Gabon show increased forestation.

The depot lies near Balad base 64 kilometres from Baghdad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu implicitly claimed responsibility for the attacks on PMF bases. He also stressed the need for such attacks to continue. Netanyahu’s comments made Iraqi officials, especially PMF commanders, break the silence and release more information on the attacks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeputy PMF Commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis in a statement blamed the United States for the recent blasts at the PMF’s ammunition depots. He stressed that Washington seeks to violate Iraq’s sovereignty and attack PMF forces. He said he has precise and confirmed intelligence suggesting the Americans have brought four unmanned aerial vehicles into Iraq this year via the Azerbaijan Republic in order to work on the trend of conducting flights against Iraqi military bases. He also referred to other information, including maps and audio files, saying US drones have recently been gathering information on PMF bases rather than chasing ISIS terrorists, and have collected data on the PMF’s divisions as well as arms and ammunition depots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIraqi National Security Advisor and PMF chief Falih al-Fayyadh announced in a statement the following day that al-Muhandis’ comments did not reflect the PMF’s official stance, but he did not reject those comments, either. It seems the PMF’s official stance will be announced by Iraqi Prime Minister Adil Abdul Mahdi’s office after his probe is complete. It goes without saying that a delay in the announcement of the details of the attacks and making plans to adopt deterrent moves will only result in an increase in threats against the PMF. The Iraqi Army and people’s security is closely intertwined with that of their popular forces, and the continuation of attacks on PMF bases will be a serious threat against different areas across Iraq. Conducting assaults against the positions of popular mobilization forces, who are now legally part of Iraq’s Armed Forces, amounts to targeting Iraq’s territorial integrity, sovereignty and security.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the reasons that prompt Iraqi authorities to drag their feet on unveiling the hidden dimensions of raids on PMF bases is Baghdad’s weakness in dealing with parties involved in the attacks. This precaution and patience has its root in Iraq’s weakness in political and military domains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the one hand, this political weakness can be attributed to the enforcement, to the letter, of orders and the power of decisions by the prime minister. Despite the recent order by Abdul Mahdi to bring the country’s airspace under full control and cancel all permits of flight in the Iraqi skies, still we saw another attack against PMF positions, a similar attack from a single command centre inside Iraq.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other hand, a lack of state-of-the-art equipment and air defence systems have weakened the Iraqi military, so much so that it cannot monitor the violation of the country’s airspace by Israeli drones and US military movements on Iraqi soil. Under such circumstances, it is clear that the US, with its 15 bases, is well able to have control over Iraq’s day-to-day affairs and achieve its objectives one after the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf we regard a weak air defence system with a limited ability to spot and hit targets as one of the major military weaknesses of Iraq, we should not forget that the challenges Baghdad is facing with regards to purchasing these systems have added to the problem. Iraq is unable to buy Russian-made air defence systems because Moscow itself along with the United States as the Israeli regime’s allies is not willing to sell the systems to Baghdad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven if the Abdul Mahdi government wants to purchase systems such as S-300 and S-400 from another country, it will face pressure and threats by Washington. The US reaction may even be stronger than the sanctions Washington slapped on its NATO ally Turkey over the purchase of the air defence systems. Iraq is also unlikely to import air defence systems via Iran due to Tehran’s strategic considerations, the high risk of transfer, the threat of Washington’s confrontations and even opposition from inside Iraq.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn any case, PMF forces should reciprocate and show its deterrent power in order to stop threats against its bases. Now that the US and the Israeli regime’s joint strategy is to deal a blow to Iran’s proxy troops, more attacks should be expected in Lebanon, Syria and Yemen. Under such circumstances, only the “threat against threat” strategy will work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, the PMF’ future moves may be planned based on the decisions made within the organization independently from the Iraqi government’s official reactions. The reason is that the Iraqi government does not favour confrontation with American troops and fears the consequences of threatening the interests of the United States in Iraq. However, the PMF’s calculations are different and it is expected to go into action independently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDue to distance and the fact that PMF forces lack the necessary resources to launch similar air raids against the Israeli regime, they will focus on ground operations. If they adopt such an approach, they will be able to use the territories of the resistance front, especially the Syrian soil, to deal a direct blow. Israeli embassies in Iraq’s neighbouring countries can also be struck as indirect Israeli targets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for Iran’s backing or lack of backing for the PMF’s reciprocal measures, it should be noted that operations against PMF forces has been to harm Tehran’s interests and trigger objections over Iraq’s cooperation with Iran. It goes without saying that Iran will move to counter such conspiracies and call for support for the PMF. Nevertheless, one should wait and see how and at what level this support will be. Head of the Iraqi State of Law Alliance Nuri Maleki warned Israel that if Tel Aviv’s attacks continue, Iraq will turn into a battlefield where more than one country, including Iran, will be involved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis warning can be analyzed in two ways. On the one hand, the remarks can be evaluated as being aimed at preparing the Iraqi public opinion for possible cooperation between Tehran and Baghdad on Iraqi soil. On the other hand, since these attacks were the first Israeli threats against Iraq following Operation Opera in 1981where Iraq’s nuclear installations were targeted in a bid to threaten Iran’s interests, the remark by Maleki could be seen as a hint to bring responsibility upon Iran toward the situation in Iraq and suggesting that Iran is expected to get involved in the current crisis. Of course, a more logical decision would be to take the necessary reciprocal actions without Iran getting directly involved as Iran’s engagement may lead to a standoff between the government and part of Iraqi people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe post \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ifpnews.com/consequences-of-israeli-attacks-on-iran-backed-forces-in-iraq\"\u003eConsequences of Israeli Attacks on Iran-Backed Forces in Iraq\u003c/a\u003e appeared first on \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ifpnews.com\"\u003eIran Front Page\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://ifpnews.com/consequences-of-israeli-attacks-on-iran-backed-forces-in-iraq","published":"2019-08-31T10:51:51Z","guid":"https://ifpnews.com/?p=150273"},{"title":"Iran Marks National Day of Asiatic Cheetah","content":"\u003cp\u003eAs part of its efforts to save the highly-endangered species, the Asiatic Cheetah Research Centre in Iran is currently hosting two female cheetahs named “Delbar” and “Iran”, and a male one named “Koushki”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince 2014, experts are endeavouring to create a professional research site there to improve empirical knowledge about cheetahs, their behaviours in particular.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eResearchers also put emphasis on educational values, genetic conservation and disease diagnostic of the remaining Asiatic cheetahs kept in captivity all around the world.
