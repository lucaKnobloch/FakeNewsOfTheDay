I’m especially hooked on the WaPo and the “London Times,” because I don’t get these in print. And the paper is better in print. Oh, there’s less news, and it’s late, but you find stories you missed, that round out your view of the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd to be honest, I’m checking the news apps all day long, I’m addicted, in a good way. It’s not FOMO, it’s just that I dig it, now you can feel like a participant, you’re always up to date, ready to play. Of course this leaves you as the information source for your friends, you end up a lecture series, which is not satisfying, but every once in a while there’s a subject I’ve got to broach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike the Popeyes chicken sandwich.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve never eaten there. I guess I got turned off when Kentucky Fried Chicken went off the rails. When the skin came detached from the meat. You’ve got to know, once upon a time KFC was the new thing. My father would buy a bucket, along with that dynamite cole slaw, and take it to us at the beach after work. I can still taste it. KFC was a staple, there was always a bucket at the Labor Day picnic (along with ears of corn drenched in salt water and cooked over a charcoal grill).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow when I moved to L.A., there was Pioneer Chicken, all over the place, and it was really bad. Some people still testify about the failed chain, but there are people who reminisce about Swanson’s TV Dinners too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy local fast food chain of choice was the All American Burger. Ate tons of those. But then they went by the wayside and I got wary of all that fried food, fast food and…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I read an article about the Popeyes chicken sandwich.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow for a while there, Jack In The Box had a killer chicken sandwich. And then there was Carl’s Jr.’s (why “Jr.”?, I always wondered that) barbequed chicken sandwich, which was actually a piece of chicken, but the former was fried and I lost my taste for the latter, and yes, I’ve had Gus’s, but to tell you the truth, I want to live, I’m watching my heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now it’s taking everything in my power to not drive to Popeyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo if you’re a “New Yorker” person, a couple of years back they released a new app, “NYerToday,” that features specialized content each and every day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow the truth is the “New Yorker” has very little virality, it’s mostly an echo chamber. Oh, occasionally they break news, or deliver insight, a la the recent Al Franken article, that spreads, but that’s rare. I never hear anybody talking about the articles in NYerToday, and to tell you the truth, oftentimes they’re written from an intellectual spot high above the real world and are out of touch with the essence of life. But this article in NYerToday intrigued me, it was entitled:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://bit.ly/31QL6Al\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003e“Popeyes Chicken Sandwich Is Here To Save America”\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow like a lot of great writing, the article starts off in left field, you don’t know how this anecdote is gonna fit in. But that gets you hooked, in a world where online writing is all about the facts, and it’s believed that no one reads past the first paragraph, if that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I’m wondering just how a sandwich from a low rent fast food joint could have that much impact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then the writer, Helen Rosner, starts to explain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaquelle Smith, a NYC food writer, is quoted as saying “That Popeyes sandwich had me in my feelings. That’s probably the most emotion I’ve shown all year. The chicken is perfectly fried! The breading isn’t falling off. You get crunch in every bite. (The bun is) ‘a buttery cushion,’ (the sauce) takes it over the top. Is it healthy? NO! But dammit don’t it taste good. It’s truly a gift from the heavens.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Ms. Rosner herself testifies “The salt, the fat, the sharpness, the softness – together, they’re what flavor scientists might describe as ‘high amplitude,’ a combination so intense and so perfectly balanced, that they meld into one another to form a new, entirely coherent whole.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRemind you of anything?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJon Landau saying he’d seen the future of rock and roll, rocketing Bruce Springsteen into the public consciousness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYup, music criticism used to inspire. It made you buy records. It wasn’t snarky, it was enthusiastic. And it wasn’t dry analysis, the writer’s personality/enthusiasm came through, actually you got to know the writers themselves, they were not bland, replaceable personalities!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the article described a Twitter war, between Chick-fil-A and Popeyes. With the latter taking the high road and benefiting from it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd we all hate Chick-fil-A, at least the “New Yorker” readers do, but everyone who’s had one, which does not include me, TESTIFIES!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut supposedly Popeyes’ was better. Could that really be true? I mean how good could a fried chicken sandwich be?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePretty damn good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut if you wanted one, you had to line up, they sold out, there was mania.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh yeah, right. This is just a humorous “New Yorker” article.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I open the papers the following day and both the WSJ and NYT have articles, drier than the “New Yorker,”‘s but testifying to the same mania, and analyzing the business success and the social media impact and these articles would have had no sticking power if I hadn’t read the “New Yorker” article first, which was a story, with soul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I went from ignorant to a laughing outsider to becoming aware of the biggest fad in America right now overnight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast night I brought it up. I got blank stares in most cases, but then some who were in on it testified! The lines! Yet no one had actually eaten the sandwich.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo yes, there’s mania, yes, there’s virality, but at the heart of it seems to be a damn good sandwich.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKinda like music, where we specialize in hype and the product is substandard, to the point where you no longer even have to check it out. Hell, you don’t want to waste an hour listening to crap, you’ll wait until there’s a consensus that you must tune in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there’s little mainstream consensus in music today. No product, no song, no record, that cuts across all lines and attracts all our attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the more you read about the Popeyes chicken sandwich, it does not appear it’s just a publicity stunt. It was a new product with a little promotion that stuck. And grew because Popeyes’ competitors were anxious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd they say Twitter is irrelevant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow with food, it’s not one and done, it’s not a movie, but what a record should be. Something you revisit again and again when you get the hankering for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut once again, now that’s food and not music.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’re all on the outside until we’re suddenly made aware and brought to the inside. All the usual tricks no longer work. Billboards, TV ads, we’ve been trained to ignore them. But when something is news without promotion, when a story gains virality, all based on the underlying product, we cannot look away, it’s like a car wreck, we’re glued to the story.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmerica is glued to the Popeyes chicken sandwich.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cdiv

Though mostly being used in small test trials, full adoption could have a positive environmental impact.

SaltWater Brewery has been working with E6PR to make the first eco-friendly six-pack ring made from by-product waste and other compostable materials. It took about 18 months for the sustainable packaging to be fully adopted throughout all of SaltWater’s distribution network.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe rings developed by E6PR are now used by 35 brewers across the globe, including in Africa, Europe, and Australia. The ultimate goal is to ensure that the rings can break down in nature within a matter of months rather than the years it would take for plastic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut the technology also had to perform on par with, if not better than, plastic on shelves. If a customer were to drop a can from a plastic container, no harm, no foul. “But if it happens to our biodegradable packaging, they will grill us,” says Jorge Reynoso, CEO and cofounder of E6PR. “You need to do something better.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe industry has yet to settle on a single supplier or format that could fully replace plastic six-pack rings. Last year, Corona became the first major global beer brand to pilot E6PR’s technology, while rival Molson Coors commissioned manufacturer Footprint to make compostable, biodegradable rings for a small test run of the craft brand AC Golden in Colorado. Carlsberg is working with German supplier NMP Systems GmbH.

When Jobs introduced the first iPhone, in January of 2007, he had to convince a skeptical world to pay a then-outrageous sum of $600 for a phone made by a company that had never produced a handset before, with a slick back and no physical keyboard to peck out emails. It was a creative act on Jobs’s part, an ability to craft a vision of how the world would be and to convince people their lives would be better in that world if they bought his shiny new object.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat creative act poses a challenge for a raft of software startups trying to use artificial intelligence to reinvent sales. Companies including Vymo, InsideSales, SalesLoft, and Outreach have gotten hundreds of millions in financing in the last few years, in hopes that by mining historical data such as emails and customer call logs, they can figure out what the best salespeople do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSales observers say it’s possible the software programs could bring incremental benefits that will nevertheless prove valuable to companies, but they\u0026#8217;ll be unlikely to replicate the finer art of closing transactions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“The human element is not going away,” says Frank Cespedes, a senior lecturer at Harvard Business School and author of \u003cem\u003eAligning Strategy and Sales and Re-Thinking Sales: What’s Changing, What’s Not, and Why Knowing the Difference Matters\u003c/em\u003e. \u0026#8220;The opportunity is to make salespeople even better and more productive at what they do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eJonathan Atwell, assistant professor of organizational behavior at the Stanford University Graduate School of Business, agrees. “Count me skeptical that the creative act of people talking with each other to create shared visions of the future can be captured by the current approaches,” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSelling, Atwell notes, “is about people talking to people.” The finer points of the salesperson’s job generally come down to “social skills like creating trust and emotional and social resonance,” observes Atwell. “We can’t make an algorithm understand it yet, because a lot of that behavior looks like statistical noise.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut that hasn’t stopped entrepreneurs from trying. Having reinvented the “back-office” parts of industry, enterprise software makers are now focused squarely on the front office, mostly “SG\u0026amp;A,” selling, general and administrative costs, which now stand out as conspicuously high with the streamlining of the cost of goods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eVymo, a New York City startup founded by former McKinsey consultant Yamini Bhat, is focusing on ways to improve the one-to-one relationship of the sales person who has to visit lots of clients on a regular basis. Its customers include many salespeople in the “advisor” type of role, at places such as global bank Allianz and \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/fortune500/liberty-mutual-insurance-group-73/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLiberty Mutual\u003c/a\u003e Insurance. Vymo\u0026#8217;s software can automatically prompt a salesperson when it might be a good idea to check in on a customer, or follow up on an email exchange, among other things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePremised on the notion that by engaging people with an app, Vymo\u0026#8217;s software is able to observe statistics of behavior. “You have to make sure the activity is captured on a regular basis, so you have something to work with,” says Bhat. Vymo was initially developed by shadowing top salespeople for six months when the company was in its development phase. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eA slightly different approach is coming from InsideSales of Provo, Utah, which has received $317 million in funding in multiple rounds from \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/fortune500/microsoft-25/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMicrosoft\u003c/a\u003e and from \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/fortune500/salesforcecom-386/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSalesforce\u003c/a\u003e, among others, and which is selling to large clients such as \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/fortune500/american-express-85/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAmerican Express\u003c/a\u003e. Using statistical tools such as “random forests” and “decision trees,” the InsideSales cloud-based software “knows the patterns of when a client is likely to answer an email” based on historical patterns of thousands of interactions. The goal is to predict behavior. “Are there things that are suggesting buying intent way before they are ready to buy,” is the kind of question the software sets out to answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut instead of automating sales, the biggest opportunity for services like these may be improving the performance of people at the middle grade of performance. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“Incremental improvements to the abilities and focus of the average performers usually have, in the aggregate, much bigger impacts on sales productivity than efforts at either end of that spectrum of performance,” says Harvard’s Cespedes. Managers know what to do with their stars and their laggards, he says. “It’s the people in the middle that managers get paid to manage, and that’s also where the technology is likely to have its biggest impact.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnother low bar is the current software landscape. Every software startup notes that Salesforce’s software for customer relationships is ubiquitous but also almost unused. It’s a filing system, for call logging and such, but salespeople are loath to do the clerical work of logging data to the system. Tools like Vymo are a way to automate that, to remove some friction. “In a CRM world, people are not even using the tool, and a manager is asking every week, where is the deal, and it’s not working,” says Bhat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut ultimately, tools using A.I. are no better than the goals set for a sales program, at least that\u0026#8217;s what software startup Aible of Foster City, Calif. proposes. Operating on the premise that most companies need some hand-holding to figure out their goal, Aible\u0026#8217;s program, called “AutoML,” will pick a machine learning model only after helping the company articulate a likely return-on-investment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“Most A.I. is based on accuracy,” observes Aible founder Airiji Sangupta, a veteran of \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/fortune500/oracle-77/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eOracle\u003c/a\u003e and Microsoft. But accurate predictions can nevertheless be misleading. “Take a situation where you have a 10% win rate in sales,” Sangupta says. “The most accurate prediction of a machine learning model would be very conservative, to predict that most customers are not going to buy from you.” But that model would “destroy the business” by encouraging the pursuit of far fewer customers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eEven with better objectives, it will be hard to capture a complex dynamic that eludes simple quantification. “The most important thing about selling is the buyer,” says Harvard’s Cespedes, going back to the days of the ancient Agora in Greece. For a complex item such as capital goods, the bar is especially high. “Those buyers still want to deal with knowledgeable sales people who can work with them in navigating the process and justifying the decision to and with colleagues,” he adds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe gift of gab, knowing when to listen and when to speak, when to gently nudge or when to apply pressure—these remain the mysterious elements of the salesperson’s art that no amount of analyzing historical data can capture. At least not yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eMore must-read stories from \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—How \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/25/reliance-jio-india-mobile-wireless-service/\"\u003eReliance Jio\u003c/a\u003e became India’s wireless wonder\u003cbr\u003e—Google is cracking down on \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/23/google-workers-political-debates-internal-policy/\"\u003einternal political debates\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e—\u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/22/apple-credit-card-review/\"\u003eApple card review\u003c/a\u003e: A (mostly) rewarding way to pay\u003cbr\u003e—No humans needed: Chinese company uses \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/24/sogou-ai-newsreader-author-initiative/\"\u003eA.I. to read books and the news\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e—ProPublica: How \u003ca href=\"/fortune500/amazon-com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAmazon\u003c/a\u003e and Silicon Valley \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/22/amazon-bezos-silicon-valley-pentagon-defense/\"\u003eseduced the Pentagon\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003eCatch up with\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e \u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://cloud.newsletters.fortune.com/fortune/nloptin?nl=DATA_SHEET\u0026amp;source=LinkStack\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eData Sheet\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e, Fortune\u0026#8217;s daily digest on the business of tech.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://fortune.com/2019/09/02/artificial-intelligence-automate-sales/","published":"2019-09-02T11:00:53Z","guid":"https://fortune.com/?p=2689169"},{"title":"What’s Open (and Closed) on Labor Day 2019?","content":"\u003cp\u003eLabor Day might technically be a holiday for working people, but we sure do a lot of home repairs on that day off (well, before the barbecue, at least).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFortunately, most home improvement stores are open that day—and usually have some pretty good sales going on.

They are in bad shape, and probably should have\ngone out of business already.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eYet, they are being kept alive. And yes, they walk among us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“If a firm\ncannot meet its debt obligations without taking out even more debt or\nliquidating assets, it\u0026#8217;s a zombie,” says Trevor Noren, managing director of\nadvisory firm 13D Global Strategy \u0026amp; Research, who has long studied the\nphenomenon. “The longer interest rates stay low, the more the zombie population\nwill multiply.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact across 14 advanced economies, zombies now number 12% of all publicly-listed companies, according to a research paper by the Swiss-based Bank for International Settlements. Within the S\u0026amp;P 1500, 14% of companies could be classified as zombies, according to analysis by Bianco Research. “In the 1980s, the share was a mere 2%,” notes Claudio Borio, head of BIS’ Monetary and Economic Department.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo how have low interest rates helped create all these zombies? Well,\nthink of it from a bank’s perspective: If you have lent millions of dollars to\na troubled client, do you want to admit your mistake, watch that company go\nbust, and have to write off those loans? Or might you grant them even more\ncheap credit, in order to keep them going a little while longer?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eVoila: A culture of corporate zombies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn a booming economy with rock-bottom rates, it’s pretty understandable. Company fortunes do turn around sometimes, after all, and nobody likes to see any firm—with all those shareholders, and jobs, and pensions—go under.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut in an era of rising rates, or a recession that pummels everybody across the board, there can be rude awakenings for companies that previously \u0026#8220;looked\u0026#8221; okay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s not just the U.S. dealing with this problem, either. Since\nlow rates are a global phenomenon, there are plenty of the Walking Dead lurching\naround in Europe and China, as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOne result of a global zombie economy is that productivity\nsuffers. After all, propping up an army of half-dead companies is not really\nhow capitalism is supposed to work. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“That may weigh on productivity growth in the long run, as the number of zombie firms rises and absorbs resources that could be employed more productively elsewhere—including by competitors,” says Borio.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eActive investors should be able to sidestep prominent zombies,\nsays Noren. The state of bloodied companies like \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/fortune500/sears-holdings-111/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSears\u003c/a\u003e, Toys “R” Us and Barneys\nNew York, to name just a few troubled firms, was fairly obvious as they grunted\nand staggered around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut what about passive investors? If 14% of the S\u0026amp;P 1500 is now zombified, and you own an index fund, what exactly is your exposure going to be?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAfter all, individual investors are notoriously terrible at\nstaying calm and collected during market crises. That’s behavioral finance 101.\n“If a wave of zombie defaults comes, will investors simply sell the entire\nbasket?” asks Noren. “This is a systemic weakness that could rapidly deepen a\nmarket downturn, in the even of heightened and sustained economic turbulence.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor the moment, though, interest rates are falling: The Federal Reserve recently cut rates by a quarter-point, the first such dip in a decade. That will keep corporate zombies on life support, and maybe even create a few new ones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut if a full-blown recession hits, balance-sheet fundamentals\nwill become critically important, and only the strongest specimens will\nsurvive. That’s when you will realize precisely how many zombies have set up\nshop in your portfolio.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s just a question of whether it will happen gradually over time, or whether a catalyst—like a recession—will force a rapid reckoning,” says Noren. “Either way, it’s coming.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eMore must-read stories from \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—\u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/21/thirdlove-tech-diversity-women/\"\u003eA rare tech company where women dominate\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e—Why \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/20/wework-ipo-s-and-p-500/\"\u003eWeWork won’t be in the S\u0026amp;P 500\u003c/a\u003e after its IPO\u003cbr\u003e—Is it “only human” to feel anxious about money? \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/02/sofia-the-robot-finance-investing-interview/\"\u003eTalking finance with Sophia the Robot\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e—\u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/16/europes-cyber-watchdog-for-banks-has-a-little-problem-it-keeps-getting-hacked/\"\u003eEurope’s cyber watchdog for banks has a problem\u003c/a\u003e—it keeps getting hacked\u003cbr\u003e—Listen to our audio briefing, \u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/radio/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e 500 Daily\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://flipboard.com/@fortune\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eFollow Fortune on Flipboard\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e to stay up-to-date on the latest news and analysis.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://fortune.com/2019/09/02/why-zombie-companies-are-on-the-rise-and-could-pose-a-threat-to-the-u-s-economy/","published":"2019-09-02T11:00:47Z","guid":"https://fortune.com/?p=2690645"},{"title":"MSNBC Climate Change Forum Will Give Voice to Democrats Denied the Debate Stage and One Republican","content":"\n\u003cp\u003eHalf of the Democratic 2020 candidates set to participate in a two-day \u003ca rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://politics.georgetown.edu/climateforum2020/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eclimate change forum\u003c/a\u003e hosted by Georgetown University have failed to qualify for the third round of Democratic debates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe forum, moderated by MSNBC\u0026#8217;s Chris Hayes and Ali Velshi, is set to be streamed live on NBC News Now and Telemundo on September 19 and 20.

Who\u0026#8217;s scared of a little recession?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eLeslie Saul wasn\u0026#8217;t when she started her eponymous architecture and design firm in 1992. \u0026#8220;I think because it was a recession, people wanted to help me,\u0026#8221; she said. Through multiple later downturns nothing spooked her: Dips lasted only a few months. Then came 2008.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAfter previous experience, Saul stayed staffed up. \u0026#8220;I thought I was so smart to hold onto everyone,\u0026#8221; she said. Just one small problem: no follow-on projects. \u0026#8220;Big firms were talking about a 30% drop in income. For us, it was 90%. It was 15 months of misery.\u0026#8221; And, eventually, layoffs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePeople who lived through the Great Recession are understandably nervous about the \u0026#8220;r\u0026#8221; word. But there\u0026#8217;s good reason to believe that when the next recession hits (and it will) the pain won\u0026#8217;t be nearly as great as what people experienced in 2008.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003ePart of the business cycle\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eRecessions—a drop in GDP for at least two successive quarters—are part of the ebb and flow of finance. But they are difficult to further categorize. \u0026#8220;The nature of each recession is different and unpredictable,\u0026#8221; said Dr. Tenpao Lee, a professor of economics at Niagara University. \u0026#8220;Some recessions have minimal impact and some are significant and make everybody poorer.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe early 1990s recession that Saul coasted through hit others hard. Jeremy Ong, who operates multiple ecommerce sites and blogs like Hustlr, was a kid whose father ran a construction business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eCustomers didn\u0026#8217;t have the cash to pay and his father in turn couldn\u0026#8217;t pay supplies. \u0026#8220;It took about five years to pay off our creditors,\u0026#8221;  Ong said in a note to \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e. The family sold its home to move a smaller one, sold cars and laid off a family driver. \u0026#8220;We went from eating steak almost every day to having bread for about 2 years.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOn the whole, though, the 2008 recession was generally terrible. \u0026#8220;There was roughly 50% or 60% decline in the S\u0026amp;P,\u0026#8221; said Greg Ghodsi, managing director of the 360 Wealth Management Group at \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/fortune500/raymond-james-financial-482/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRaymond James\u003c/a\u003e. A typical recession, he notes, sees a drop closer to 30%. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eGDP also took a huge hit in 2008: 5.1 percentage points, according to Ted Rossman, an industry analyst at CreditCards.com. Compare that to the 2.7 points from 1981 to 1982, 1.4 points from 1990 to 1991, and 0.3 points in 2001. \u0026#8220;Almost nothing by comparison,\u0026#8221; Rossman said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eIt might have hit already\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePreparing for a recession can be difficult because you never know who will be hurt most. Some businesses thrive because they are counter-cyclical and find more customers, like bankruptcy lawyers and discount stores. Others suffer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTrying to time one is impossible. \u0026#8220;We do know that there is a recession coming,\u0026#8221; said Cindy Kuppens, the COO of O\u0026#8217;Brien Wealth Partners. \u0026#8220;Maybe next year, maybe 2021. We\u0026#8217;re coming to the end of a business cycle.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe could even be in a recession now without knowing. Economists have to wait for the data to measure GDP and new estimates come as additional information arrives. A previous quarter can slide in hindsight and a current period may be starting to slow.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eToo much worry about a recession can bring one on as businesses react by pulling back and people save money instead of spending it. That shrinks GDP. In other words, you can make yourself crazy trying to forecast the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;We\u0026#8217;ve had a 10-year bull market and people need to make sure they\u0026#8217;re appropriately invested for the future,\u0026#8221; said Julie Fox, managing director and market head mid-Atlantic private wealth manage at UBS Financial Services. Whether or not a recession is officially here or on the way, prudence suggests taking preventative steps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat to do now\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFirst step is consider where you are. Are you in the 46% of families that would have to sweat an \u003ca rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://fortune.com/2016/05/26/400-dollar-expense-study/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eunexpected $400 bill\u003c/a\u003e. Then, Ghodsi says, figure out your expenses and where you might cut. Also, now\u0026#8217;s the time to shop for a better-paying job. \u0026#8220;The labor market is still very strong and there are still plenty of jobs being advertised out there,\u0026#8221; he said. \u0026#8220;If you were going to make a move, this is the time to do it.\u0026#8221; Wait for a recession and it\u0026#8217;s likely too late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you can, take on extra work and use the money to build a cash buffer and reduce debt. If you\u0026#8217;ve got credit card debt, Rossman suggested looking for new cards with no-interest balance transfers so payments go right into principle and lower balances faster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you do have assets, aim for a cash reserve for six months at least and a year if possible and also reduce debt. Reconsider your current plan with your financial advisor. Don\u0026#8217;t try to time your investments, especially as you can\u0026#8217;t know when a recession starts or ends. Even in a deep recession like in 2008, investment values bounced back within two years. \u0026#8220;In smaller recessions they bounce back much more quickly,\u0026#8221; Kuppens said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile recessions may be a fact of life, it\u0026#8217;s important to remember: they too shall pass. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eMore must-read stories from \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—\u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/21/thirdlove-tech-diversity-women/\"\u003eA rare tech company where women dominate\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e—Why \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/20/wework-ipo-s-and-p-500/\"\u003eWeWork won’t be in the S\u0026amp;P 500\u003c/a\u003e after its IPO\u003cbr\u003e—Is it “only human” to feel anxious about money? \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/02/sofia-the-robot-finance-investing-interview/\"\u003eTalking finance with Sophia the Robot\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e—\u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/16/europes-cyber-watchdog-for-banks-has-a-little-problem-it-keeps-getting-hacked/\"\u003eEurope’s cyber watchdog for banks has a problem\u003c/a\u003e—it keeps getting hacked\u003cbr\u003e—Listen to our audio briefing, \u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/radio/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e 500 Daily\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://flipboard.com/@fortune\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eFollow Fortune on Flipboard\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e to stay up-to-date on the latest news and analysis.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://fortune.com/2019/09/02/next-recession-different-2008-great-recession/","published":"2019-09-02T12:00:55Z","guid":"https://fortune.com/?p=2690084"}]},{"url":"https://www.hotelbusiness.com/feed","items":[]},{"url":"https://rss.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Business.xml","items":[{"title":"How Tainted Gold May Have Ended Up in Your Phone","content":"","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/30/the-weekly/gold-apple-iphone-colombia.html?emc=rss\u0026partner=rss","published":"2019-09-02T00:49:57Z","guid":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/30/the-weekly/gold-apple-iphone-colombia.html"},{"title":"As Trump Escalates Trade War, U.S. and China Move Further Apart With No End in Sight","content":"","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/01/world/asia/trump-trade-war-china.html?emc=rss\u0026partner=rss","published":"2019-09-02T02:53:51Z","guid":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/01/world/asia/trump-trade-war-china.html"},{"title":"Cooking Eggs in the Morning and Shucking Oysters at Night, Thanks to an App","content":"","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/01/business/restaurant-jobs-apps.html?emc=rss\u0026partner=rss","published":"2019-09-02T03:02:49Z","guid":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/01/business/restaurant-jobs-apps.html"},{"title":"Will America Talk Itself Into a Recession?

Popeye’s Fried Chicken Sandwich","content":"\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"entry\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI discovered it in the “New Yorker.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery day I do my back exercises, takes about half an hour, and while I do them I struggle to read my iPhone, otherwise I’m bored, I don’t want to waste time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it’s at this time that I go through the round of my news apps. I’m especially hooked on the WaPo and the “London Times,” because I don’t get these in print. And the paper is better in print. Oh, there’s less news, and it’s late, but you find stories you missed, that round out your view of the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd to be honest, I’m checking the news apps all day long, I’m addicted, in a good way. It’s not FOMO, it’s just that I dig it, now you can feel like a participant, you’re always up to date, ready to play. Of course this leaves you as the information source for your friends, you end up a lecture series, which is not satisfying, but every once in a while there’s a subject I’ve got to broach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike the Popeyes chicken sandwich.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve never eaten there. I guess I got turned off when Kentucky Fried Chicken went off the rails. When the skin came detached from the meat. You’ve got to know, once upon a time KFC was the new thing. My father would buy a bucket, along with that dynamite cole slaw, and take it to us at the beach after work. I can still taste it. KFC was a staple, there was always a bucket at the Labor Day picnic (along with ears of corn drenched in salt water and cooked over a charcoal grill).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow when I moved to L.A., there was Pioneer Chicken, all over the place, and it was really bad. Some people still testify about the failed chain, but there are people who reminisce about Swanson’s TV Dinners too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy local fast food chain of choice was the All American Burger. Ate tons of those. But then they went by the wayside and I got wary of all that fried food, fast food and…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I read an article about the Popeyes chicken sandwich.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow for a while there, Jack In The Box had a killer chicken sandwich. And then there was Carl’s Jr.’s (why “Jr.”?, I always wondered that) barbequed chicken sandwich, which was actually a piece of chicken, but the former was fried and I lost my taste for the latter, and yes, I’ve had Gus’s, but to tell you the truth, I want to live, I’m watching my heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now it’s taking everything in my power to not drive to Popeyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo if you’re a “New Yorker” person, a couple of years back they released a new app, “NYerToday,” that features specialized content each and every day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow the truth is the “New Yorker” has very little virality, it’s mostly an echo chamber. Oh, occasionally they break news, or deliver insight, a la the recent Al Franken article, that spreads, but that’s rare. I never hear anybody talking about the articles in NYerToday, and to tell you the truth, oftentimes they’re written from an intellectual spot high above the real world and are out of touch with the essence of life. But this article in NYerToday intrigued me, it was entitled:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://bit.ly/31QL6Al\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003e“Popeyes Chicken Sandwich Is Here To Save America”\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow like a lot of great writing, the article starts off in left field, you don’t know how this anecdote is gonna fit in. But that gets you hooked, in a world where online writing is all about the facts, and it’s believed that no one reads past the first paragraph, if that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I’m wondering just how a sandwich from a low rent fast food joint could have that much impact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then the writer, Helen Rosner, starts to explain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaquelle Smith, a NYC food writer, is quoted as saying “That Popeyes sandwich had me in my feelings. That’s probably the most emotion I’ve shown all year. The chicken is perfectly fried! The breading isn’t falling off. You get crunch in every bite. (The bun is) ‘a buttery cushion,’ (the sauce) takes it over the top. Is it healthy? NO! But dammit don’t it taste good. It’s truly a gift from the heavens.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Ms. Rosner herself testifies “The salt, the fat, the sharpness, the softness – together, they’re what flavor scientists might describe as ‘high amplitude,’ a combination so intense and so perfectly balanced, that they meld into one another to form a new, entirely coherent whole.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRemind you of anything?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJon Landau saying he’d seen the future of rock and roll, rocketing Bruce Springsteen into the public consciousness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYup, music criticism used to inspire. It made you buy records. It wasn’t snarky, it was enthusiastic. And it wasn’t dry analysis, the writer’s personality/enthusiasm came through, actually you got to know the writers themselves, they were not bland, replaceable personalities!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the article described a Twitter war, between Chick-fil-A and Popeyes. With the latter taking the high road and benefiting from it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd we all hate Chick-fil-A, at least the “New Yorker” readers do, but everyone who’s had one, which does not include me, TESTIFIES!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut supposedly Popeyes’ was better. Could that really be true? I mean how good could a fried chicken sandwich be?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePretty damn good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut if you wanted one, you had to line up, they sold out, there was mania.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh yeah, right. This is just a humorous “New Yorker” article.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I open the papers the following day and both the WSJ and NYT have articles, drier than the “New Yorker,”‘s but testifying to the same mania, and analyzing the business success and the social media impact and these articles would have had no sticking power if I hadn’t read the “New Yorker” article first, which was a story, with soul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I went from ignorant to a laughing outsider to becoming aware of the biggest fad in America right now overnight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast night I brought it up. I got blank stares in most cases, but then some who were in on it testified! The lines! Yet no one had actually eaten the sandwich.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo yes, there’s mania, yes, there’s virality, but at the heart of it seems to be a damn good sandwich.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKinda like music, where we specialize in hype and the product is substandard, to the point where you no longer even have to check it out. Hell, you don’t want to waste an hour listening to crap, you’ll wait until there’s a consensus that you must tune in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there’s little mainstream consensus in music today. No product, no song, no record, that cuts across all lines and attracts all our attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the more you read about the Popeyes chicken sandwich, it does not appear it’s just a publicity stunt. It was a new product with a little promotion that stuck. And grew because Popeyes’ competitors were anxious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd they say Twitter is irrelevant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow with food, it’s not one and done, it’s not a movie, but what a record should be. Something you revisit again and again when you get the hankering for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut once again, now that’s food and not music.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’re all on the outside until we’re suddenly made aware and brought to the inside. All the usual tricks no longer work. Billboards, TV ads, we’ve been trained to ignore them. But when something is news without promotion, when a story gains virality, all based on the underlying product, we cannot look away, it’s like a car wreck, we’re glued to the story.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmerica is glued to the Popeyes chicken sandwich.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cdiv

Life truly is like a box of chocolates. Of course, you can keep an eye out for updates yourself using AppShopper or by participating in the TouchArcade forums. This weekly summary is just here to fill you in on the things you might have missed.

This latest update adds yet another new episode: IDA School Part 2. To get access to the new episode, you have to have finished Chapter 13 of the main story and, of course, IDA School Part 1. A new character named Claude comes with it, and Mighty (Another Style Hypnotist) is also available. Two encounters, Lone Encounter and 10 Allies Bundle, have been updated. The new episode also adds a new area, IDA City. Finally, there are the requisite bug fixes and other adjustments.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"float:left; padding-right:1em;\"\u003e\n\u003ccenter\u003e\n\t\u003ca href=\"http://toucharcade.com/link/http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id867266659?mt=8\" alt=\"Special Tactics\" title=\"Special Tactics\" width=\"65\" height=\"65\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28686\"\u003e\n\t\t\u003cimg style=\"border-radius:20px;\" src=\"https://toucharcade.com/wp-content/images/app/867266659/100x100bb.jpg\" /\u003e\n\t\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/center\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\t\u003ca href=\"http://toucharcade.com/link/http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id867266659?mt=8\" style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"\u003e\n\t\t\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eSpecial Tactics\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e, Free\n\t\u003c/a\u003e\n\t\u003cem\u003eSpecial Tactics\u003c/em\u003e is a pretty cool strategy game that deserves to be more popular than it seems to be. Well, that sort of thing happens. Anyway, there\u0026#8217;s a new update here that will definitely make some people happy. The game now works on iPhone X family devices, which is a pretty big deal. The silenced rifles and shields have been adjusted for balance purposes, and newer devices now have character shadow rendering for that extra-slick look. This update also adds the new Beast Mode AK-47.

And it looks like this new version is more or less matched up with the recently-released Switch port, which I hope bodes well for future updates. Online multiplayer is now a thing, allowing you to play with up to seven of your friends. The world sizes are now larger, and there are new bosses and enemies to battle. The endgame Celestial Invasion event and the Moon Lord final boss are finally in the game, and the Expert Mode has been implemented to give seasoned players a greater challenge. New items? How about over 800 of them? There\u0026#8217;s a ton of new stuff to check out here.

This update aims to fix performance issues and improve the lighting and audio to match the originals. Right now the audio is a bit off if you\u0026#8217;ve played the originals. New players will obviously not notice this. As of now, no timeframe has been given for this but it might take a little longer because they need to update the ports for iOS, Android, Xbox One, PS4, and Nintendo Switch. I wonder if they will bring \u003cem\u003eDOOM 3\u003c/em\u003e to iOS and Android.

Their most famous series is \u003cem\u003eTower of Fortune\u003c/em\u003e which combines slot machine gameplay with roguelike dungeon crawling, but they\u0026#8217;ve released a number of other quirky and inventive games in addition to that trilogy. Their latest is called \u003cem\u003eAdventure Pinball\u003c/em\u003e and, as you might have guessed, it blends pinball gameplay with adventuring and light RPG elements. It also uses Game Stew\u0026#8217;s familiar Game Boy-esque monochromatic visuals.

You\u0026#8217;ll face off against 7 different bosses along the way, as well as collect a number of different types of equipment to help you in your endeavors. I\u0026#8217;m a big fan of Game Stew\u0026#8217;s stuff and I\u0026#8217;m also a huge pinball fan, so I\u0026#8217;m really looking forward to \u003cem\u003eAdventure Pinball\u003c/em\u003e when it arrives later this week on Thursday, September 5th.

Small-Town Disputes That Fuel Germany’s Far Right","content":"\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eGÖRLITZ, Germany—Near the center of this picturesque city on Germany’s eastern border with Poland sits an idyllic park square called Wilhelmsplatz. A large field of lush grass is ringed on all sides by colorful, carefully manicured flowers; benches line the edges of the square, and a large memorial occupies one end. On a nice afternoon, families sit on blankets, their children laughing and playing together; nearby, people lounge on benches reading or listening to music.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eBut recently residents of the stately houses surrounding the park have complained that it’s become too loud and unruly at night. Young people drink and blast music past 10 p.m., they say; families let their children play late into the evening, and kids kick soccer balls through the perfectly maintained flowers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe kerfuffle over Wilhelmsplatz sounds like a typical local dispute—at least until you learn that some residents blamed the city’s small community of refugees and immigrants for the disruptions. As a result, Wilhelmsplatz, and Görlitz more broadly, have become a kind of symbol of the polarized debate about open societies, tolerance, and integration.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eOn a broader level, what is happening in Görlitz—which just \u003ca href=\"https://wahlen.sachsen.de/LW_19.php?wahlkreis=58\u0026amp;gemeinde=14626110\"\u003evoted 37.8 percent\u003c/a\u003e for the populist far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD)—is similar to the debate that is playing out in cities and towns across eastern Germany. Voters here in Saxony, as well as in neighboring Brandenburg, handed the AfD significant victories in state elections on Sunday: the party won \u003ca href=\"https://wahlen.sachsen.de/LW_19.php\"\u003e27.5 percent in Saxony\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://www.wahlergebnisse.brandenburg.de/wahlen/LT2019/tabelleLand.html\"\u003e22.2 percent in Brandenburg\u003c/a\u003e, making them the second-strongest force in both states. On October 27 in Thuringia, another of the five former East German states, the party is also expected to do well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWith Germany preparing to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, Görlitz in many ways exemplifies the enduring east-west differences in Germany, not just politically but also socially and economically, that have helped the AfD succeed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e“We know how it is in Dresden. We know how it is in the western German cities,” Sebastian Wippel, the local AfD leader who narrowly lost a race to become Görlitz’s mayor this summer, told me, referring to places with larger immigrant populations. “I don’t need to have that here to know that I don’t want it. I don’t need to experience it here, and we don’t want to experience it here.” (Indeed, he has made his views on the city’s immigrant population clear: At an event celebrating the end of Ramadan in Wilhelmsplatz last year, Wippel \u003ca href=\"https://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2019-06/goerlitz-oberbuergermeisterwahl-afd-sebastian-wippel-wahlkampf/komplettansicht\"\u003ehanded out postcards\u003c/a\u003e that said “Syria Misses You.”)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2019/08/greens-surge-stronghold-germanys-far-right/596911/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: Germany’s future is being decided on the left, not the far right.\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIs Wilhelmsplatz merely a municipal disagreement that’s taken on a life of its own, or does it showcase, as Wippel suggests, the unsettling, out-of-control effects of immigration? How Görlitzers answer this question is an immediate indication of their political persuasion, at a time when many here feel split into two camps that no longer understand or listen to each other.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe back-and-forth about Wilhelmsplatz “is very symptomatic for the lack of discourse in this society,” said Franziska Schubert, a local politician for the Greens who \u003ca href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/east-germanys-g%C3%B6rlitz-elects-cdu-mayor-over-afd-challenger-in-runoff-vote/a-49227992\"\u003ecame in third\u003c/a\u003e in the June mayoral race, won by Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats. Görlitz’s city center, Schubert said, is beautiful and calm, “like the backdrop for a movie,” but Görlitzers ultimately need to decide what kind of city they want to live in: “Do you want life, or do you want to be in a backdrop for a movie … where everything is dead and empty?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWalking through Görlitz’s historic old town indeed feels, as Schubert says, like stumbling onto the movie set of a picture-perfect German city—which, as a popular filming location for Hollywood movies, it quite often is. The candy-colored, perfectly preserved buildings in the old town span centuries: Napoleon stayed in an orange-and-white baroque building on one side of the Upper Market square, along what used to be the path of one of Europe’s longest trading roads; down the street is the now-empty department store that served as the hotel lobby in Wes Anderson’s 2014 film \u003cem\u003eThe Grand Budapest Hotel\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg alt='A sign for the AfD in Saxony reads \"For My Country.\"' height=\"448\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/09/AP_19232696335837/b2da557f7.jpg\" width=\"672\"\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"caption\"\u003e(Markus Schreiber / AP)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eBlocks away from the old town, crumbling, empty buildings in various states of disrepair tell a different story—and hint at the social and economic problems plaguing the city and others like it. After the Berlin Wall fell, many residents left to find better jobs and opportunities in the West; Görlitz’s population shrank significantly and still hasn’t recovered. While the state government focuses resources primarily on Saxony’s bigger cities, places like Görlitz suffer: It faces shortages of skilled workers, teachers, and caretakers for its elderly, and the local infrastructure is lacking.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWhat’s more, most of the region’s major industry also moved out or was shuttered after 1990, leaving many jobless or underemployed.

Wippel stresses the issue heavily and vowed during his mayoral campaign to install police officers on both of the city’s bridges to \u003ca href=\"https://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/goerlitz-sachsen-wahlen-1.4426637-0#seite-2\"\u003ereintroduce border checks\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eSo when the influx of refugees arrived in Germany in 2015 and 2016, the AfD had the final trigger it needed to capitalize on widespread disillusionment: How is it, many here thought, that these newcomers are given the kinds of resources and support we never got? Though Görlitz and Saxony more broadly have been governed by Merkel’s center-right CDU for the past three decades, residents became skeptical of the party’s ability to help them or willingness to listen.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e“The CDU suffered a massive loss of confidence here,” Uwe Walter, a journalist with the regional radio station Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk, told me. “Certain problems that are important to the people haven’t been addressed, or were addressed arrogantly… No one was listening to them.

During the \u003ca href=\"https://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/bundestagswahlen/2017/ergebnisse/bund-99/land-14/wahlkreis-157.html\"\u003e2017 federal elections\u003c/a\u003e, the AfD candidate Tino Chrupalla ousted the longtime CDU politician Michael Kretschmer (now Saxony’s premier) from his seat in the German Bundestag here in Görlitz; the party again came in first in this May’s European elections, \u003ca href=\"https://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/europawahlen/2019/ergebnisse/bund-99/land-14/kreis-14626.html\"\u003ewinning 32.4 percent\u003c/a\u003e of the vote here.

Then, in June’s mayoral election, Kast cast his first-ever vote for the AfD, which he described as a “more local, personal” decision than a political one, because he knows several local-level AfD politicians well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eKast says he still can’t imagine voting for the party at the state or national level because of its tolerance of far-right extremists. He said, however, that he’s frustrated by the speed with which people categorize or dismiss him when he acknowledges that the AfD may have a point on certain issues, including the problems that the large number of refugees have brought. “When you make certain points or say certain words,” he told me, “you’re put into a corner that you actually don’t belong in.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eI heard a similar refrain from others who voted for or sympathized with the AfD: that they’d lost friends or been decried as a Nazi for suggesting the party might have a point. “More than 40 percent of the people in this city voted for the AfD,” said Eleni Ioannidou, a Greek-Polish opera singer who runs a small cultural organization in Görlitz, and who also voted for the AfD in June. “Do people think they’re all monsters?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eDespite the salience of the immigration issue for many who voted for the AfD, including Kast and Ioannidou, Görlitz, like many other eastern German cities, has actually taken in relatively few refugees: \u003ca href=\"https://www.goerlitz.de/Fluechtlingssituation.html\"\u003eonly about 1,200\u003c/a\u003e as of late 2017.

Wilhelmsplatz is one of only a handful of places in the city where the presence of these newcomers is even remotely visible. According to Wippel and many of his party’s supporters, their presence in these public places contributes to both a feeling of insecurity among residents and a sense of resentment that they don’t want to fully integrate. Such places are also a symbol of lifelong Görlitzers’ desire to see their city remain unchanged.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e“I grew up here, and when I was a child, we could never walk on the grass in Wilhelmsplatz,” Christina Lachmann, a 73-year-old AfD supporter, told me after a party event in a local pub one evening.

Each night during the first week of August, Schultze and a few staffers and volunteers set up a table in Wilhelmsplatz from 9:30 to 10 p.m., welcoming anyone who wanted to discuss the issue to stop by. The night I joined them, Schultze stood in intense but friendly discussion with two local residents, among those who believed the park was too loud. But overall, Schultze said, though there were a few young people chatting or playing music earlier in the evening, Wilhelmsplatz was hardly the chaotic scene some have described.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eMany Görlitzers “vote for the AfD because they believe the AfD can solve problems that don’t actually exist, but exist in people’s minds,” he said. “The AfD has essentially said, ‘We want everything to stay the way it never actually was.’ They present a utopian picture of a perfect world that never existed.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/F3yrFiZGUMs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/F3yrFiZGUMs/","published":"2019-09-02T07:34:05Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-597256"},{"title":"Tearing Down the Myth of the Rural White Voter","content":"\u003cp\u003eLyz Lenz spent most of her youth immersed in the conservative subcultures of the South and the Midwest; as an adult, she carries a \u003cspan class=\"smallcaps\"\u003eFeminist as Fuck\u003c/span\u003e keychain and describes her politics as “two steps away from joining Greenpeace.” She grew up in Baptist churches in Texas and passed her 20s in buttoned-up evangelical congregations in Iowa; now she attends a progressive Lutheran church in Cedar Rapids. But while Lenz has rejected conservatism’s earlier hold on her life—she divorced her husband in part because he supported Donald Trump in the 2016 election, showing just how far apart their values were—she says she also refuses to retreat to a liberal bubble.

But she also doesn’t believe in giving up on people who are different from her. “This book is an attempt to sit in the brokenness of our nation and our lives and seek to find redemption,” Lenz writes.

On the other hand, the MAGA hat has become a symbol of so much more than one election or one vote.

Some of the protesters who first unfurled umbrellas in response to that announcement, to complain about Beijing’s heavy finger on the electoral scales, were arrested on Friday. Joshua Wong—who, as a 14-year-old, helped organize those protests—was among those detained. China’s promise, 30 years ago, of One Country, Two Systems gave millions the assurance that their rights and wealth would be guaranteed in the new Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. The events of the past few weeks, though, pose a question: Can the system that has seen the city-state prosper survive?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe dual regime that has paid off for everyone is under greater pressure than ever before. China’s troops wait on the mainland as the Hong Kong Police Force, once considered the best in Asia, tries to keep control without outside help. But the protests aren’t stopping. Fear for the future—fear that rights, once lost, will never come back—is persuading thousands that they must take action now to defend themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe people of Hong Kong need time, space, and security to work toward a political solution. And the simplest way to provide that—a solution that serves the interests of all concerned—is for Britain to right a historic wrong, and confirm eligible Hong Kongers as British citizens.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis isn’t the first time that the people of Hong Kong have feared for their future. Before the U.K. returned control of Hong Kong to China, in 1997, many worried that Hong Kongers wouldn’t trust the new regime. That’s why the British and Chinese governments agreed on the Sino-British Joint Declaration in 1984 and lodged it as a treaty with the UN. The agreement made clear what was planned, and pledged that the international accord would endure for 50 years. Five years later, the declaration would prove essential in calming Hong Kongers who learned of unrest across China and watched the violent repression in Tiananmen Square.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMany considered fleeing—but again, Britain steadied the ship. In 1981, Hong Kongers’ status changed from the same as all other British citizens—known as citizens of the U.K. and colonies—and they became citizens of British dependent territories, geographically split and without residency in the U.K. The Joint Declaration agreed that Hong Kongers would become British nationals (overseas) at the handover, but as emigration began to threaten the city’s stability, Britain partially reversed the decision by giving those considered most essential to the good governance of the city full British citizenship, as an inducement to stay. By guaranteeing their rights, Britain gave them the certainty that they could leave whenever they chose and so bought time. Hong Kongers could get used to their new rulers and become confident about their future.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow, as then, those on the street and in the government need time and faith if the political settlement necessary to end the protests is to have a chance. Once again, Britain can help. Today, returning rights that British nationals (overseas) lost almost 40 years ago would give those wondering what the future brings the confidence to wait, secure in the knowledge that they have options whatever the outcome of the current unrest. It could lower the stakes of the protests, and encourage the political dialogue that will be the only solution to the present unrest.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe decision to strip Hong Kongers of their rights as British citizens was wrong and counterproductive. Instead of defending the U.K. from mass migration, it cut Britain off from the Asian economic miracle, and removed rights from people who had grown up on the rule of law. We need to correct that mistake, and not just for ourselves.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMore important, British nationals, wherever they live, should have access to the certainty of the rule of law. They should also have the freedom to make decisions about their lives at an appropriate pace, without feeling the need to preempt events. The irony is that without the knowledge they can leave, many will lose the confidence to stay, triggering an early and, if wisdom returns, unnecessary migration to the U.K.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBritain’s role doesn’t end with recognizing the rights our own nationals should have enjoyed all along. The U.K. is intrinsically tied to Hong Kong through the rule of law, and it shares reputational risk with the judges on the island.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOverseas nonpermanent judges have sat for decades on the Court of Final Appeal, Hong Kong’s supreme court. They are drawn from other common-law jurisdictions—Britain, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand—and provide the guarantee that Hong Kong justice is up to international standards and not subject to the whims of the Communist dictatorship next door.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn the mainland, justice is not equal. Like the members of the old European aristocracies, members of the Communist Party can be tried only by their peers, not by the ordinary courts. Widespread accusations of corruption and poor governance mean few have confidence the Chinese judiciary is independent. That’s bad for individual rights, but also bad for business. Hong Kong is different. The rule of law underwrites the city’s prosperity and gives confidence to traders and investors around the world. It is no exaggeration to say that Hong Kong’s judicial system has ensured the island’s prosperity. That’s why the new extradition law matters so much.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCarrie Lam, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region’s chief executive, says the draft bill on extradition is intended to help prevent criminals from using the territory to hide. But extradition is about more than preventing crime; it is a recognition that another legal system is fair. In China, that’s just not true. China’s execution of hundreds of prisoners and its use of arbitrary detention and mass incarceration to control political activity across its empire stands in stark contrast to the actions of the still-bewigged judges in Hong Kong.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe city-state is not just an offshore Shanghai. It’s a haven of legal confidence in a region that struggles with corruption, and whose wealth is constrained by the grasp of oligarchs—including the so-called red princes in China.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eChina’s use of the law as a means of control, not justice, puts it in direct opposition to the principles of the common law. The extradition bill would extend the remit of that system to Hong Kong, making British judges complicit. The risk to the reputation of the British legal system, and other legal systems, is clear. This is not just about Hong Kong anymore; it’s about us.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut the implications are much wider. Many investors have seen their returns multiply as they used one of Asia’s pivotal nodes to generate Asian and global trade. Hong Kong judges created that confidence through the rule of law, acceptance of standards, and a respect for the international norms.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow China is trying to use that same justice system to underwrite its mercantilist expansion through its Belt and Road Initiative. Declaring Hong Kong justice unjust would directly threaten Beijing’s new imperial dream. It would also weaken investors’ confidence in the region’s markets, potentially undermining the prosperity of millions. That’s why returning their rights is not just good for Hong Kongers; it’s good for everyone.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMore than 20 years after the handover, Britain no longer exercises any direct sway over Hong Kong. The days of colonial rule are long past, and no one wants them back. But the ties between Britain and Hong Kong on the basis of our intertwined histories and economies remain strong, bolstered by our commitment to British nationals (overseas) and the role our judges play within the common-law system. Britain can have a role in helping Hong Kong prosper once more, by remembering that imperial pasts confer ongoing duties, and by guaranteeing the rights of those who grew up in the shadow of the Crown.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/BNoKN_0ozK4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/BNoKN_0ozK4/","published":"2019-09-02T10:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-597247"},{"title":"‘The Supreme Court Is Not Well.

The Court has granted review in a Second Amendment case entitled \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/new-york-state-rifle-pistol-association-inc-v-city-of-new-york-new-york/\"\u003eNew York State Rifle \u0026amp; Pistol Association Inc. v. City of New York, New York\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e, which (nominally) tests an obscure New York City ordinance governing how firearms owners could—note the past tense—travel with their weapons.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eUnder city law as it was when the case began, New Yorkers with a “premises” license had to keep their guns in their homes at all times, except when being taken to a licensed target-shooting facility for practice and training. But those facilities had to be in New York City itself. “Premises” licensees could not put their guns in their trunk and drive out of town for any reason—not to go to a gun range, not to compete in a shooting match, not to take the guns to a second home.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe plaintiff in this case is the New York branch of the National Rifle Association, and three of its members who said the restrictions on transport violated their Second Amendment rights. When the Court granted review, bells rang on both sides of the gun wars, because the justices had not agreed to hear a Second Amendment case in almost a decade. In 2008, the Court held, 5–4, that the Second Amendment protects a personal “right to bear arms”; two years later, it held, again 5–4, that this right applied against both federal and state governments. After that, the Court refused all pleas to consider gun cases, leaving the lower courts to test different local gun laws. By and large, local and state gun laws—licensing, background checks, assault-weapon and large-capacity-magazine bans—survived those challenges.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eBut then Justice Brett Kavanaugh replaced Justice Anthony Kennedy. In an opinion while on the D.C. Circuit, Kavanaugh had proposed a radical approach that might shred most local gun laws.

There’s no rule that permits the filing of random “Yo bros” letters with the Court. The letter also lacks the candor of the Whitehouse brief. Look at this: “Judicial independence is under assault.

Roosevelt had proposed his “Court packing” plan—and then accused Republicans of seeking to make changes in the sacred number of justices. The Court is already packed; the packing began in February 2016, with Scalia’s death, and continued with the Gorsuch nomination and Kavanaugh’s tantrum before the Judiciary Committee.

Needless to say, suggestions from me about changes she can make fall on deaf ears, and I’ve learned pretty much to keep my mouth shut and listen. However, this does not result in a great relationship, because I dread spending time with her.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRecently, I lost my temper after a three-hour car ride of complaints and told her I thought she should do something to help herself and stop blaming everyone else. This was met with a torrent of tears and protestations. I can see that she does not have a lot of self-confidence, and blaming her situation in life on others is easier than doing something about it. Is there any way I can help her and also maintain a good relationship with her?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnonymous\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDear Anonymous,\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf course, we all go through tough periods in our lives, and many people find it helpful to talk with friends or family about their struggles. But it sounds like your sister has become what therapists call a “help-rejecting complainer.” For help-rejecting complainers, complaining is a way of being. They find comfort in going on ad nauseam about their plight, while giving excuse after excuse about why any suggested course of action won’t make matters any better. They don’t want help; they want your sympathy, and validation for their perception that they’re being treated unfairly and that there’s nothing they can do to improve their situation. And since they aren’t interested in solutions or talking about something else, help-rejecting complainers tend to sap the energy of people who care about them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhy do some people do this? Many people who relate in this way suffer from an underlying depression, and depression distorts their thinking and makes them feel helpless. People who are depressed also tend to feel lonely, unheard, or unseen, particularly in their pain. They want to connect with others, but if they are also help-rejecting complainers, that can create a vicious cycle. They push people away, then they don’t feel heard, so they complain even more, which pushes people farther away. But for the complainer, this is actually a reward: She’s just gotten something else to complain about.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo break this cycle, there are a few things you can do. First, pointing out that her negativity might be pushing people away won’t help. Help-rejecting complainers don’t see themselves as negative people; they see everything \u003cem\u003eout there\u003c/em\u003e as negative, and they’re simply reacting to it. (That’s why if you suggest therapy, which can be very effective for help-rejecting complainers, she’ll reject that suggestion, too.) What your sister wants most is to feel heard, so when she complains about her children or friends or boss, the best thing you can do is validate what she’s saying, but in a particular way. Instead of just saying, “Oh, that’s too bad that your children don’t call enough,” your job is to over-validate her position.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor instance, you can say: “Your children are so ungrateful. I can’t even imagine what it’s like to have such utterly selfish children.” Or: “Your friends are horrible for not wanting to see you more often. And they sound like absolute narcissists, talking about themselves instead of asking after you. I’m so sorry you have such inconsiderate friends.” Or: “It’s unconscionable that your friends won’t set you up on dates. They have absolutely no regard for how lonely you are. If the situation were reversed, I know you’d be setting them up on dozens of dates with eligible men you know.” Or: “Your boss should be fired. I can’t believe that HR doesn’t have a file of complaints. It’s terrible that there’s absolutely nothing you can do to make things better at work. I feel so bad for you that you have to spend the rest of your life in a miserable job.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow, the key here is to say this with not a trace of sarcasm—try to sympathize by remembering that your sister truly feels this way. And if you can do that, she will hear her complaints reflected back to her, which will make her feel understood. And once she feels understood, there’s not a lot more to say, and she won’t feel the need to go on and on to get you to hear how miserable her life is. Even better, by over-validating, you’re helping her to hear her complaints differently, and as a result, she may argue with you like this:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Well, my kids should definitely call more, but they’re not \u003cem\u003ealways \u003c/em\u003eselfish. In fact, for my birthday they did this nice thing where …” Or: “Yes, my friends can talk too much about themselves, but I don’t think they’re actually narcissists.” Or: “It’s frustrating that my friends don’t set me up on dates, but now that I think about it, I guess if the situation were reversed, I’m not sure I’d know many single men to introduce them to.” Or: “My boss is awful, but I don’t know if I’ll be there for the rest of my life. I mean, maybe one day I’ll leave, but it probably won’t be for another 10 years.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYes, she’s still complaining, but once you stop challenging her belief system, she’ll stop trying to up the ante to get you to see how miserable she is. Moreover, once she hears a heightened version of her complaints, she’ll likely feel the need to correct you—in essence saying, “Yes, all of these people and circumstances are very bad, but they’re not as bad as you described them.” And if she does, remember not to switch to the positive. Don’t say, “Oh, good, I’m glad it’s not that bad.” Instead, continue to be the sympathetic complainer by saying: “Okay, well, it still sounds pretty bad to me.” And then move on to other topics.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you over-validate her every time she complains, eventually she’ll stop trying to seduce you with her misery, and you’ll stop wasting time trying to give suggestions to someone who’s not interested in changing. And then, sometimes, something magical can happen: Eventually (and this could take a long time), she might realize she’s not as trapped as you are saying she is, or as she feels.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow, it’s also possible that even with your over-validation, your sister will continue to incessantly complain. In that case, you can set a compassionate boundary. It might go like this: “You’re my sister and I love you very much. I know you’re suffering, and it breaks my heart to see you in so much pain. I wish I could help you, but I think I make things worse by offering suggestions that you don’t find helpful. If I can help you with something specific, please feel free to ask. But I don’t think that me listening to what’s bothering you is helping, because nothing changes after I listen. So I think we should talk about other things from now on.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd then whenever she complains, remind her of your limit and redirect the conversation. She’ll either spend less time around you or find someone else to complain to—but in either case, you’ll have created a healthier relationship between you two and also helped her, even if she can’t yet see it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eDear Therapist is for informational purposes only, does not constitute medical advice, and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

She raises it high above herself and then, slowly, lowers it into her ear. Her face contorts in pain as the chopstick continues its descent. A trickle of blood escapes one nostril, and the woman collapses, dead.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is the first and perhaps most viscerally frightening scene of \u003cem\u003eThe Terror: Infamy\u003c/em\u003e, the second installment of AMC’s historical horror-anthology series. Set during World War II, \u003cem\u003eInfamy\u003c/em\u003e follows a group of Japanese Americans who are subjected to the cruelties of internment, all the while being stalked by a malicious supernatural entity. The opening sequence works hard to establish a mood of dread: There’s the pallid gloom of the room; the eerie symbolism of two vertical chopsticks that evoke the ceremonial rice bowl used at Buddhist funerals; the woman’s silence broken only by the hideous percussion of her bones; the gory climax when she impales herself through the ear.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs the season moves on, though, it fails to sustain the intense and wordless fear so neatly captured in these first moments.

Part of the problem may lie in the writing and plotting. But the show—by its very nature as a grim series about the United States turning on its citizens and their families—also seems to offer different things to different viewers, depending on their own proximity to such real-life experiences.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" height=\"448\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/08/TERROR_200_EA_0205_0086_RT/793631db3.jpg\" width=\"672\"\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"caption\"\u003eThe opening sequence of \u003cem\u003eThe Terror: Infamy \u003c/em\u003eis the most straightforward horror scene in the show. (Ed Araquel / AMC)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe supernatural horror of \u003cem\u003eInfamy \u003c/em\u003ecomes mostly from an otherworldly antagonist named Yuko (played by Kiki Sukezane), who is introduced in the first episode. She’s an unsettling yet frustratingly vague menace. Is she a ghost? A demon? Is she a culturally specific villain that requires a basic familiarity with Japanese folklore, or is she more of a typical, vengeful spirit? Even the Japanese words that the older characters use to describe her shift, utterance by utterance—\u003cem\u003eobake, yuurei, youkai, bake mono\u003c/em\u003e—as they try to figure out what she is.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBeyond issues of taxonomy, Yuko’s powers are inconsistent. In some scenes, she appears only as a creepy interruption, while at other times, glimpses of her cause characters to go insane or hurt themselves. This isn’t to say that \u003cem\u003eInfamy \u003c/em\u003emust define its villain early on in the season, or even at all. (Season 1 of \u003cem\u003eThe Terror\u003c/em\u003e similarly featured a mystifying monster but had a better grasp of its main narrative.) And yet it is hard to take Yuko seriously when it’s unclear how she fits into the story or how she can affect the characters. Even when the series develops her further, Yuko primarily inspires speculation and confusion—an effect that dampens, rather than amplifies, the show’s horror.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn sharp contrast to its treatment of Yuko, \u003cem\u003eInfamy \u003c/em\u003erenders the internment in painstaking detail, as if to suggest that \u003cem\u003ethis \u003c/em\u003eis what should really scare audiences. The forced relocation and detention of 120,000 Japanese Americans during World War II was shameful, and \u003cem\u003eInfamy \u003c/em\u003edepicts the many indignities an entire community suffered. The stakes are high from the first episode, which builds to the events of December 7, 1941. When news about the Imperial Japanese Army bombing Pearl Harbor breaks, two of the main characters—a young man named Chester Nakayama and his father Henry (played by Derek Mio and Shingo Usami, respectively)—happen to be at a U.S. naval base to answer questions about a Yuko-related death. The room erupts into chaos around the father and son, who have no idea what has happened; only viewers know what history has in store for them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe co-creators Alexander Woo and Max Borenstein retain this close focus as Chester, his mother, and their neighbors are herded from their homes on California’s Terminal Island. They’re sent first to a tenement-like building in Los Angeles, then to a race track to stay in the stables while awaiting processing, and then finally to the desolate camps. With each move, their worldly possessions dwindle. Meanwhile, Henry and his friend Nobuo Yamato (played by George Takei) are separated from their families and held in an unknown location for interrogation. In one harrowing scene, Chester tries to evade the internment with his Mexican American girlfriend, Luz (Cristina Rodlo), only to be captured by the FBI due to a tip. The camera lingers on the face of the informant: a garishly made-up, elderly white woman, her face defiant. It’s obvious who the monster here is supposed to be. \u003cem\u003eInfamy\u003c/em\u003e emphasizes the banality of the internment’s evil and the fact that many everyday Americans—caught up in self-righteousness, misguided patriotism, suspicion, and xenophobia—were complicit in what happened to their fellow countrymen.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" height=\"448\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/08/TERROR_202_EA_0121_0118_RT/c5c450ec6.jpg\" width=\"672\"\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"caption\"\u003eDerek Mio, who plays Chester Nakayama, acted in a scene that echoed his grandfather’s experience of seeing his own father be taken away for questioning by American officials during World War II.

The audience is drawn in, via trailers and other promo materials, with the promise of a ghost story that visually recalls popular J-horror works such as \u003cem\u003eRingu \u003c/em\u003eand \u003cem\u003eJu-on\u003c/em\u003e. But for much of the season, Yuko is a muddy and ineffective villain, and it’s precisely this inefficiency that makes the internment itself stand out so obviously as the show’s central evil. Still, the \u003cem\u003eInfamy\u003c/em\u003e’s portrayal of the internment raises the question of which audiences will be most terrified by a stark look at this chapter of American history.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor his part, Woo has spoken extensively about \u003cem\u003eInfamy\u003c/em\u003e as an exercise in building a sort of horror-induced empathy.

The show attests powerfully to the fact that the U.S. has a long tradition of \u003ca href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/thanksgiving-annual-genocide-whitewash-171120073022544.html\"\u003eenacting policies\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/14/magazine/1619-america-slavery.html\"\u003eand holding up institutions\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/10/ava-duvernay-13th-netflix/503075/?utm_source=feed\"\u003ethat target communities of color\u003c/a\u003e.

As \u003ca href=\"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2019-08-09/japanese-internment-the-terror-infamy-amc\"\u003eTakei, who was interned as a child, told the \u003cem\u003eL.A. Times\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, “There were no charges, no trial. We were rounded up.” Even the show’s set was familiar to him: “The texture of the strips of wood that held the tar paper intact, the crawl space underneath the barrack ... all those memories came back. The acting wasn’t acting.” Before filming a scene at the Hastings Park racetrack, which was once used to intern Japanese Canadians, the assistant director Jason Furukawa told the crew that \u003ca href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/08/the-terror-infamy-alexander-woo-interview-japanese-internment\"\u003ehis own grandparents had been kept in stables seven and eight\u003c/a\u003e. And Mio, who plays Chester, recalled a scene where his character tries to take the place of his father, who is detained for questioning. “Hearing [the] firsthand accounts of when they first came in the middle of the night and hauled my great-grandfather away,” Mio says, “my grandfather was pleading with them and crying, ‘No, take me instead’ ... We shot that, and it was very emotional.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBeyond the educational sort of horror offered by \u003cem\u003eInfamy\u003c/em\u003e’s faithful rendering of history, there is another, more subtle kind of danger that the show reflects on: the danger of forgetting. Various storylines interrogate both personal and communal notions of home, legacy, and memory.

Among more than 2,200 such patients who underwent any form of weight-loss surgery, heart-related events dropped by 39% over eight years of follow up and deaths from any cause declined by 41% compared to a group of more than 11,000 matched controls who did not receive any weight loss surgery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;As a cardiologist, I cannot remember any study, not studies involving statins, or studies involving blood pressure medication, having this large of a treatment effect,\u0026rdquo; says Dr. Steven Nissen, chairman of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic and senior author of the paper. \u0026ldquo;What this tells me is that the heart-related morbidity and mortality associated with diabetes and obesity is reversible with the right procedure.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe magnitude of the reduction in heart events and deaths suggests that the benefits of the surgery may extend beyond those attributable to weight loss alone. \u0026ldquo;There are neurohormonal changes we see after these procedures that could have significant metabolic effects and benefits for patients,\u0026rdquo; says Arminian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe majority of the study participants who had weight-loss surgery underwent gastric bypass, an operation in which surgeons shrink the size of the stomach by creating a small pouch from its tissues and shunting food more directly from that pouch to the upper intestine. The researchers found that, after patients had their digestive tracts re-routed, there were changes in the pattern of hormones their bodies produced. Insulin, produced by beta cells in the pancreas, is responsible for breaking down glucose, and those with diabetes have lower insulin responses to food. But gastric bypass surgery seemed to restore some of the normal insulin response in the study\u0026mdash;Arminian found that many patients no longer needed insulin by the end of the study period. In addition, the share of patients relying on non-insulin diabetic medications also dropped, by half, from 80% to nearly 40%.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeight-loss surgery, and in particular gastric bypass, may also change the composition of healthy bacteria living in the gut. Previous studies have shown that people with diabetes have\u003ca href=\"https://time.com/5597688/microbiome-diabetes-premature-birth-prediction/\" \u003e different species of bacteria\u003c/a\u003e in their digestive tract compared to people without diabetes, which may influence how their bodies respond to sugars. In other research in his lab, Arminian has taken fecal samples from patients pre- and post-surgery and transferred them to mice, which acted as simulated human guts. Animals receiving samples from patients before surgery tended to become obese and develop diabetes and fatty liver syndrome, while those receiving samples from patients three months after weight-loss surgery did not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese findings, taken together, strongly suggest that addressing obesity among diabetics may reverse some of their risk of disease and early death, but that weight loss alone, especially through lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise, may not be enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s not just one factor. Weight loss is important, the gut hormones are important, and the microbiome is important,\u0026rdquo; says Arminian. \u0026ldquo;They all work together like an orchestra to improve the metabolic condition of the patient.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe and Nissen agree that weight loss surgery may not be an option for every overweight or obese diabetic patient, but the data suggest that it might be considered for more people in coming years. Because the study did not randomly assign diabetic patients to surgery or the control group, but relied on a matched set of controls for comparison, the next step in confirming the results would be to conduct a randomized control trial. If those findings support these, then a stronger case might be made for considering weight loss surgery for more people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/time/topstories/~4/eg08AaTKPS4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/eg08AaTKPS4/","published":"2019-09-02T11:00:56Z","guid":"http://time.com/?p=5664640"},{"title":"Cory Booker: A Waitress I Knew Made $2.13 an Hour.

They\u0026rsquo;re meant to ensure competition for the benefit of both consumers and workers, but at some point over the last three decades, the agencies responsible for enforcing those laws have completely forgotten about the part of their mandate that applies to labor. In an analysis of several decades of cases, my office was unable to identify a single instance in which the Justice Department or the Federal Trade Commission has challenged a proposed merger or acquisition due to labor market concerns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlong these same lines, we need to restrict anti-competitive practices like non-compete agreements and no poach clauses that limit worker mobility and keep wages down. No poach agreements are often forged between large corporate franchisors, like IHOP, and their franchisees, usually unbeknown to the worker. Such covenants prohibit the franchisees from recruiting and hiring away one another\u0026rsquo;s workers. This means, for example, that none of the thousands of IHOP franchises may hire an individual who is currently employed \u0026mdash; or was recently employed \u0026mdash; by any other IHOP franchisee. So, if Natasha wanted to get a raise by becoming a shift manager at the IHOP further south in Elizabeth, it would be impossible. The Elizabeth IHOP would have been prohibited from hiring her. IHOP thankfully ended this collusive practice last year amid public outcry, but dozens of other companies still have such anticompetitive and exploitative agreements on the books.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor workers like Natasha, these agreements mean that an already limited range of options narrows further. These clauses \u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/03/01/booker-warren-take-aim-at-businesses-that-promise-not-to-poach-each-others-workers/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eshould be banned\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLastly, we need mitigate the dangerous culture of \u0026ldquo;short-termism\u0026rdquo; that pervades corporate boardrooms and C-suites, as companies prioritize short-run returns to wealthy investors and executives over long-term investments in workers, like higher wages and expanded training. Indicative of this trend is the massive wave of stock buybacks, in which companies purchase their own stock shares in order to reduce supply in the market and drive up their price. According to the economist William Lazonick, between 2007 and 2016, companies on the S\u0026amp;P 500 dedicated \u003ca href=\"https://prospect.org/article/curse-stock-buybacks-0\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e96% of their earnings to stock buybacks\u003c/a\u003e and corporate dividends. That left just 4% for investments in the workforce, like raises for workers. We need to crack down on the proliferation of these buybacks, or, at the very least, ensure that if a corporation buys back stock to increase shareholder value, it must also pay out a commensurate sum to all of its employees who help drive the profits \u0026mdash; \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/3/6/17083398/booker-buyback-populist\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethe \u0026ldquo;workers dividend\u003c/a\u003e.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is no reason that a country as rich and as powerful as ours should have to choose between great wealth for the few, like corporate CEOs, and great opportunity for all of its citizens, like Natasha. We must work to be a country in which any American who wants to work can get a job; where if you work hard, you are paid what you are worth; and where a free market means freedom for workers to move across the labor market to translate their value and increasing productivity into higher wages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike Franklin Delano Roosevelt\u0026rsquo;s New Deal and Lyndon B. Johnson\u0026rsquo;s Great Society, we must reimagine what we can and should expect out of our government. We didn\u0026rsquo;t achieve this vision while Natasha was alive. But I\u0026rsquo;m hopeful that her children, and her children\u0026rsquo;s children, will live to see the day where workers like their mom and grandma truly get a fair shake in this economy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/time/topstories/~4/d8fZ7vX_Al8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/d8fZ7vX_Al8/","published":"2019-09-02T11:00:19Z","guid":"http://time.com/?p=5665619"},{"title":"At Least 1 Million People in These Counties Are Under Evacuation Orders As Hurricane Dorian Approaches","content":"\u003caside class=\"right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad\" id=\"right-rail__ad-5666941\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module\" data-src=\"https://time.com/5666941/hurrican-dorian-evacuation-orders-counties/\" data-widget-id=\"SB_2\" data-ob-template=\"timemag\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least 1 million people have been ordered to evacuate in three U.S. states beginning Monday ahead of \u003ca href=\"https://time.com/5661353/hurricane-dorian-track-forecast/\" \u003eHurricane Dorian,\u003c/a\u003e a slow-moving Category 5 storm currently raging over the \u003ca href=\"https://time.com/5661353/hurricane-dorian-track-forecast/\" \u003eBahamas\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHurricane Dorian is the most powerful such storm to hit the Bahamas since records began, with maximum sustained winds of over 185 miles per hour since it made landfall Sunday afternoon. \u003cspan style=\"font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\"\u003eIt is moving westwards and is projected to hit or skirt areas along the U.S. east coast, the \u003c/span\u003eNational Hurricane Center (NHC) \u003cspan style=\"font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\"\u003e said Monday. \u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\"\u003eThe NHC has issued a hurricane watch for Florida\u0026#8217;s east coast from Deerfield Beach north to the Volusia and Brevard county line.

The writers’ room is full of crack comedy writers, headed up by no less a brilliant comedy mind than \u003ca href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1104036/\"\u003eJesse Armstrong\u003c/a\u003e, a protégé of \u003cem\u003eVeep \u003c/em\u003ecreator Armando Iannucci (who also co-created the terrific Britcom \u003cem\u003ePeep Show\u003c/em\u003e). The show’s dark sense of humor has become such a defining element that Vulture’s Kathryn VanArendonk recently wondered if its nomination for Outstanding Drama Series at the Emmys nomination should \u003ca href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2019/08/is-succession-a-comedy.html\"\u003eactually be a nomination for Outstanding Comedy Series\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"w0cACP\"\u003eBut allow me (Vox critic at large Emily VanDerWerff) to argue that I think what makes \u003ca href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7660850/?ref_=tt_ov_inf\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eSuccession\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e work as well as it does is everything that \u003cem\u003eisn’t\u003c/em\u003e funny about it, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10100382/?ref_=ttep_ep_cur\"\u003e“Safe Room”\u003c/a\u003e is a great example of why. The characters on this show are fundamentally hollow and uninterested in much beyond the propagation of their own wealth. They want for nothing except fulfillment, and that makes them both horrible people and horribly sad people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"5Jg0Q1\"\u003eI am well aware that, for lots of viewers, the fun of watching \u003cem\u003eSuccession\u003c/em\u003e will never lie in empathizing with the Roys. But goodness me, when Kendall went up to the roof of the Waystar-Royco building, seemingly to throw himself off of it, and then found that glass barriers had been erected to prevent him from doing so, it hit me deep in the gut. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"OU02Vx\"\u003eEveryone on \u003cem\u003eSuccession\u003c/em\u003e (and especially Kendall) can see the method of their destruction so clearly, but they’re still protected from it by an almost invisible barrier of wealth, class, and privilege. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"7v6L3L\"\u003eAll of which is to say that “Safe Room” is my favorite installment of the second season so far, and I’m looking forward to whatever’s next. But in the meantime, here are six winners and seven losers from the episode compiled by myself and The Goods deputy editor Meredith Haggerty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"rRx6k6\"\u003eLoser: Tom \u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"GzAJTy\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEmily: \u003c/strong\u003eIf “Safe Room” is my favorite episode of the season so far, then it must also contain my favorite scene of the season so far, and oh boy, does it! When Greg innocently suggests that he and Tom might have an open business relationship, Tom \u003cem\u003eloses it\u003c/em\u003e. He begins haranguing Greg, in a way that makes clear what Tom is really mad about: not Greg, per se, but some other person in his life, perhaps someone he sleeps with most nights (but not every night), perhaps someone with amazing hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"l23x7G\"\u003eThe directors of this episode, \u003ca href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0700301/?ref_=nv_sr_1?ref_=nv_sr_1\"\u003eRobert Pulcini\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0075849/?ref_=nm_ov_bio_lk4\"\u003eShari Springer Berman\u003c/a\u003e (whose work on the 2003 movie \u003cem\u003eAmerican Splendor\u003c/em\u003e remains some of my favorite directing of this threadbare millennium), hang back from the confrontation with a documentary-like detachment, which only makes the scene funnier and more desperate. I watched with my hands raised in the air, shrieking, “Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.” Reader, I felt that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"6Y4qMe\"\u003eBut Tom’s struggles don’t begin or end with that scene. He and Greg have the confrontation because they’re in the shitty safe room to begin with, while Shiv and everybody else are in much more luxurious one. (They’ve been sent to these safe rooms due to a scare involving a possible active shooter; more on that in a bit.) And the longer Tom has to sit in his terrible storage room of a safe room, with a security guy who keeps saying that no, maybe it’s not safe to leave yet, the more he slowly crumples into a little ball of wounded male privilege.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"prDOfg\"\u003eTom has been down for so long that I have to assume he’ll start rising back up at some point. Yet at the same time, I have my doubts. Meredith, how can Tom save the day ... and maybe, just maybe, himself?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"kcOVlZ\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMeredith: \u003c/strong\u003eIf the water bottle flip-out was the best scene of the season — and it might be, it was glorious — it still wasn’t my favorite Tom and Greg scene of this episode. Mine was the one that gave everyone just a little hope (I realize I am soft on \u003cem\u003eSuccession\u003c/em\u003e, and this is a problem).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"doevyx\"\u003eAfter their aborted breakup (“We’re good!” Greg tries to tell Tom. “We’re \u003cem\u003egood\u003c/em\u003e??” Tom asks, channeling the end of every relationship), Greg’s labored entrée into blackmail is a big moment for Tom. Sure, he’s being put over a barrel by his favorite whipping boy, but he’s also a very effective mentor! “You’re a fucking slimeball!” Tom says with glee, a complex reaction that still manages to be the episode’s less complicated invocation of “slime.” He’s proud of his son. Teach your children well, etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"z2Y1Hc\"\u003eBut no one who yells “I will not let go of what is mine!” and then immediately and forcibly does so can be said to have had an A-plus week. That everyone around Tom refuses to commit to him — Greg, Shiv, probably human table Jonah — is a huge blow to his ego, as are the dawning realizations that the shooter was not after him, that network CEO Cyd looks brave and he looks weak, that he’s not even in the actual safe room for important people. Greg wasn’t even impressed with his man footstool. He’ll have to hope he can ride his blackmailing little pal’s coattails to the top. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"K8l9Qz\"\u003eLoser: Kendall \u003c/h3\u003e\n  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\"Kendall has an important realization.

For one thing, he brought in PGM CEO Rhea Jarrell (\u003ca href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000456/?ref_=nv_sr_1?ref_=nv_sr_1\"\u003eHolly Hunter\u003c/a\u003e!), earning congrats from his dad. For another, during the shooting incident, Logan was extremely worried about his boy in a way that seemed ... sweet? Paranoid? More accurately about the fact that Kendall is holding onto Logan’s pills?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"H6cQen\"\u003eBut Kendall isn’t up, he’s just maintaining a slightly better facade. His business dealings are just about holding onto dignity and usefulness and forward momentum. As he tells Shiv in a teary hug, “It ain’t gonna be” him running the company instead of her, not anytime soon. He’s treading water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"pQkPcO\"\u003eIt turns out that his battery-stealing at the end of episode two wasn’t a one-off. As Gerri tells Shiv, her brother is (still) grabbing stuff he can easily afford, including candy and vape fluid (“He could buy the \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/7/26/8906261/vape-store-aesthetics-juul-e-juice-design-gritty\"\u003eindustry\u003c/a\u003e,” Shiv observes). Pilfered vape fluid is not actually the thing that’s causing Kendall to sneak around, but it’s still something that PR head Karolina and bodyman Colin have been tasked with covering up. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"siETIC\"\u003eAnd those petty thefts aren’t his worst cries for help: that designation belongs to his fascination with the Waystar-Royco building’s roof deck, where he’s taken to leaning over the edge with a cigarette in hand. Is it at all possible that the real reason Logan is so worried about Kendall is that he’s afraid the lockdown-inducing employee suicide was his own son’s? Unlikely, maybe. But not impossible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"7lTvb9\"\u003eAnd as you noted above, Emily, he’s now lost access to the sad and horrible vice of flirting with death, as by episode’s end a large wall of protective glass has been installed between Kendall and the ledge, giving him a literal looking glass to see himself through. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"eHAszh\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEmily: \u003c/strong\u003eSomething that people like to criticize about \u003cem\u003eSuccession\u003c/em\u003e is that the show makes being rich seem a little \u003cem\u003etoo\u003c/em\u003e fun. And to be sure, the boardroom machinations of “Safe Room” are wild and entertaining, but in Kendall, we see the cost of this sort of thing. He’s a hollow man, marching forward in an attempt to get back into his father’s good graces that is probably doomed to fail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"27rbY8\"\u003eWhich is to say that even when he’s winning, he’s losing, because he’s lost all sight of who he might be or what he might want. In season one, he seemed to care about something (the direction of the company, namely), and that might have been a dark and horrible goal — Waystar-Royco is terrible — but at least it was something to pursue. Now, he’s basically a puppet, with sins hanging over his head that he hasn’t accounted for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"bICt0F\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eSuccession\u003c/em\u003e is never going to be a polemic about how the rich are evil, but I’m not convinced it should either need or want to be. There’s something so potent about that final image of Kendall, stranded on the building’s deck, longing for death but sealed off from it by a glass wall. Wealth insulates you even from yourself, and to be cut off from your own soul is its own kind of horror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"B8PLp6\"\u003eWinner: Roman \u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"4lneDr\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMeredith: \u003c/strong\u003eAfter last week’s low point, Roman is in a semi-voluntary personal hell: the management training Gerri suggested to get him back into Logan’s good graces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"bpc1oH\"\u003eThere is a host of horrors: group activities, a Waystar-Royco promo video that fails to give him his due, time spent inside a presumably sweaty mascot uniform, contact with real Americans. He’s sulky and panicky, freaking out at the prospect of having to have ideas, calling a business school 101 prompt to pitch a theme park ride “a death march through minefield.” He spends much of his time hiding — under a baseball cap, behind a turned-up collar, forcibly in a giant turkey costume — even telling his fellow management trainee Brian (\u003cem\u003eYou\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eCrashing \u003c/em\u003estar \u003ca href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm7100086/?ref_=nv_sr_1?ref_=nv_sr_1\"\u003eZach Cherry\u003c/a\u003e) that his name is Ron Rockstone, which Brian totally buys. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"zc5a16\"\u003eBut Roman almost, kind of, barely gets into it, telling Gerri he’s “stripping back to basics” (“this is my White Album”) and actually coming up with a halfway decent ride idea based on fear (“no one’s ever gone bust overestimating the public’s interest in violence,” Brian confirms), winning the big scary competition, and calling both of his favorite women in triumph. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"JD4GST\"\u003eAnd this is where things get real: while he fails to “do phone sex with [his] girlfriend like a normo” with Tabitha (“I want to fuck you in the pussy,” he says flatly, after chiding her for using a breathy voice), he calls up Gerri and, as she dresses him down as a “pathetic” “slime puppy,” he uh, achieves real intimacy?

After all, if there’s one thing that we know about Connor — or, rather, if there’s one thing that he wants Logan’s biographer to know — it’s that Connor Roy was interested in politics at a very young age.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"le1wRf\"\u003eAnd purely from the viewpoint of political self-interest, Connor kinda nails it. His speech at the funeral is awful and empty (more on that in a second), but it’s just vacuous enough to pass as solid political pabulum. He’s not saying anything anybody will disagree with. Everybody dies! Death is sad! That’s a political platform everybody can get behind, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"k4jTk2\"\u003eConnor also proves most adept at avoiding the biographer’s wiles, and even if Willa steps in it by calling Lester “Moe,” well, it’s probably a bigger threat to his campaign that she’s a call girl who’s probably never going to make it on Broadway. (Connor seems briefly thrown by Willa’s faux pas, muttering, “Why can’t I be the one trapped in a lockdown with a maniac!”) Speaking of Willa...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"s364jD\"\u003eLoser: Willa’s writing ability \u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Sg6wEQ\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEmily: \u003c/strong\u003eSince we first met Willa, we’ve known one thing about her: She wants to be a playwright. And when Connor is fretting about what he can say at the funeral, she hastily scrawls some ingenious thoughts down on paper, which he then takes up to the church’s pulpit and delivers apparently verbatim. And it’s one of the greatest long-lead jokes in TV history.

Also Lester was an employee of the Waystar company for 40 years. And when a man dies, it is sad. All of us will die someday. In this case, it is Lester who has done so. Lester was alive for 78 years, but no more. Now he is dead. Lester’s wife is Maria. They were married for 15 years.

I’ve always been slightly leery that \u003cem\u003eSuccession\u003c/em\u003e invites us to dismiss Willa because she’s a call girl — sex workers unduly get a hard time of it on TV — but this sequence reveals that, no, you should be dismissing her because she’s a fatuous, pompous fool who’s more interested in looking good than doing anything real.

Her suggestion (via Tom) that Nazi-at-minimum-\u003cem\u003esympathizer\u003c/em\u003e Mark Ravenwood should be fired is ignored.

Wouldn’t it “more interesting for both of them,” Greg asks, if he played the corporate field? He “wants to explore!” He offers, of course, the worst possible thing for Tom at the current moment, and his suggestion is not met with enthusiasm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ANFX2B\"\u003eBut it is with this same spirit of gentleness and care that Greg does a blackmail, telling Tom that he doesn’t want to pull up those supposedly destroyed cruise molestation files but, y’know, he kept them and he will if he can’t get away from ATN. He does his blackmail so good (“Where are those files?” “Oh I’ll never tell!”) that Tom’s actually proud. He gets a salary and title bump.

As rising star Greg describes the network: “Human furniture, verbal assaults, physical humiliation, Nazi stuff, shooters” — he doesn’t love it! And it was, indeed, in-house bullying that reportedly lead to the on-site employee suicide. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"1SkgKP\"\u003ePlus, things at the building are scary.

At least that’s Tom’s fear when he sees Cyd on their own station “breakdancing through gunfire” following the shooting scare. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"BF22cf\"\u003eCyd is the very model of conservative toughness as she narrates her experience of the shooting from the control room. Cyd wants ATN to stay ATN, Nazi stuff and all, and she has a lot of power behind her coming out of this episode. She hasn’t lost on Ravenwood (yet), she’s shown up that coward Tom, and she sees the narrative she suggested at the beginning of the episode —  “ATN under siege” — literalized.

When the depression hit and unions lacked the funds to keep paying out benefits, “State governments came to their rescue by subsidizing them. It was an easy fix to the problem of unemployment rather than enacting wholesale government insurance.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"JEuK8v\"\u003eThe result was that many countries were left with totally voluntary unemployment systems. In the US, unemployment insurance is funded through taxes on employers jointly administered by the federal government and states. Participation is mandatory. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"5Vn9kY\"\u003eIn other countries, you were required to actively walk into a union office and sign up in order to receive benefits if you lost your job.

It’s quite rare for people to sign up for unemployment benefits but \u003cem\u003enot\u003c/em\u003e join the union administering them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"MlNKO1\"\u003eOver time, a number of countries, like Norway and France, junked this system in favor of mandatory unemployment insurance. But countries that kept it, like Denmark and Finland, have seen extremely high union membership as a result. Their unions have also been able to do sectoral bargaining with less reliance on government; Nordic governments don’t “extend” contracts as happens in France, as unions can just cut deals themselves using their huge membership as leverage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"NFhqwS\"\u003eAnd the Ghent system really seems to be what made the difference.

Inspectors from the government are often short-staffed and underfunded, and many undocumented immigrants in low-wage jobs are understandably skeptical of cooperating with government authorities of any kind. So Fine has proposed that state and local governments — even the federal government if it wants — contract out to unions and other worker organizations to keep an eye on employers and report abuses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"6PnUzP\"\u003e“There are so many examples of business and the state working together,” Fine \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/4/17/15290674/union-labor-movement-europe-bargaining-fight-15-ghent\"\u003etold me\u003c/a\u003e. “Professional associations set standards all the time. What makes this idea so shocking to people is not that it’s never been done.

Outsourcing the job to unions helps solve that problem. “That employer collective action poaching problem is well-known,” Cordero-Guzmán notes. “When I saw a tweet about \u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/ivanka-trump-plans-to-attend-economic-summit-in-germany/2017/03/26/6663b708-128f-11e7-833c-503e1f6394c9_story.html?utm_term=.f6a854752496\"\u003eIvanka Trump meeting with Germans about job training\u003c/a\u003e, I thought, did they tell her how the training is run through unions? They work with employers to learn what the training needs are.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"B010sw\"\u003eIn a sense, labor law experts and activists are proposing throwing everything at the wall to see what sticks. The prevailing impression from talking to them is that the total demise of private sector unions in the US is too close at hand to do anything other than try absolutely everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"lMUPSN\"\u003e“It’s so frustrating to hear all these single-bullet theories,” Rolf says. “Someone says we need card check, someone says striking needs to be a civil right.

What if we’re wrong?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ZTjv0p\"\u003eStill, it’s remarkable how many different people have all converged on something like a European approach to unionism.

The Qing \u003ca href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/01/29/xis-china-is-steamrolling-its-own-history/\"\u003esignificantly expanded the territory\u003c/a\u003e under their control to also include modern day Xinjiang, Tibet, and Mongolia, both the part of it that is today a Chinese province, and the independent Republic of Mongolia bordering China.

Being working-class and white has become so synonymous in the public imagination that we often only imagine those who work in our country to be toiling in the coal mines of Virginia, assembling in the manufacturing plants of Wisconsin, or building in the factories of Ohio.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe caricature is a blue-jeans wearing, Harley Davidson riding, white man who has a job his dad and granddad once had. This “working man,” as he’s often portrayed in the media coverage he gets, feels left behind, misunderstood, and angry because he can’t go anywhere without hearing a language other than English and can’t turn on the TV without Black and Latinx faces overwhelming his options. On this Labor Day, a year before the most important election of my lifetime, we need to understand the consequences of \u003ca href=\"http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/08/democrats-should-stay-authentic-with-the-white-working-class.html\"\u003etethering these identities\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWorking-class vs. low-wage worker\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen our media paints the working-class as different from the low-wage worker, we fail to see the ways in which both have been failed by political and business leaders. These leaders have made choices like \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/8/16/20807610/raise-the-wage-act-15-minimum-wage-bill\"\u003enot raising the federal minimum wage\u003c/a\u003e in 10 years, and hamstringing the right to organize by passing \u003ca href=\"https://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/unions-fear-states-approve-right-to-work-laws-article-1.2977016\"\u003eright-to-work laws\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we imagine fast food, home care, and agricultural workers as distinct from those workers in factories or mines, we miss the opportunity to create true worker solidarity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe current framing arguably does allow for calls of allyship across two distinct groups—the white working-class in industrial sectors and the rest of the working class. But what we really need is solidarity among the majority of working people in our country. People who work and still don’t have $1,000 for an unexpected expense need to be in solidarity. People who work and can’t afford to live where they work, or who enter their 60s and 70s with hopes of retiring, only to find that it is a nearly impossible feat, need solidarity, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAway from the spotlight on sectors typically associated with the white working-class, there is a brutal system of low wages and appalling working conditions, where the workers are rendered invisible while their employers financially benefit. These companies are capitalizing on a belief that not all workers are entitled to the same dignity—with the distinction usually falling along racial or ethnic lines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhen certain labor, and laborers, are considered less-than\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlack, Latinx, and immigrant people pay a collateral consequence when their labor is understood as less valuable or less productive than that of their white counterparts. When they fight for fair pay and decent working conditions, they risk the backlash of police action or employer cruelty. The most recent example includes the \u003ca href=\"http://www.grubstreet.com/article/ice-raid-mississippi-poultry-plants.html\"\u003etargeting and deportation of 680 poultry workers\u003c/a\u003e in Mississippi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese raids were significant because of the size, but also because of the scope. Many of the targets worked for Koch Foods, the $3 billion food processing and distribution corporation. One year earlier, these workers \u003ca href=\"https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/newsroom/release/8-1-18b.cfm\"\u003ewon a settlement\u003c/a\u003e after the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission charged the company with sexual harassment, discrimination, and retaliation against Latinx workers at a chicken-processing plant in Morton, Mississippi. The same week of the raids, a damning report was published detailing how the same Koch Foods was discriminating against black farmers and ruining their livelihoods in service of gaining a larger foothold in the poultry market.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen corporations are unchecked and unaccountable to anyone, workers of color and immigrant workers often suffer most. When the media talks about the white working-class without scrutiny or context, we as a society are left to believe that the \u003ca href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2019/08/working-class-men-have-lost-nearly-20000-over-the-past-40-years/\"\u003eonly workers who matter are white\u003c/a\u003e, that the only workers who suffer at the hands of failed economic policy or labor conditions are white, and that the only workers whose representation and influence is lacking in our political systems are white.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is the deal the media has made in tethering the identities of white people and the working-class. Not only is it an incomplete story of the working people of our country, but it also makes solidarity in these times impossible.

As we again take the time to celebrate work and the people working for a living, we should remember and honor the accomplishments of our labor movement forebears. These working women and men of extraordinary determination and courage waged the battles that secured rights and working conditions we often take for granted today, such as an eight-hour workday, dramatic improvements in workplace safety, an end to child labor, retirement and other employment benefits, and, of course, weekends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore recently, however, participation in labor organizations and the labor movement has been on the decline. The upshot? Researchers at \u003ca href=\"https://www.hamiltonproject.org/assets/files/UnionsEA_Web_8.19.pdf\"\u003eThe Hamilton Project\u003c/a\u003e, a policy group at The Brookings Institution, conclude that the dramatic drop in US private-sector union density, which fell from 24.2% in 1973 to 6.4% today, reduced American workers’ bargaining power and contributed to growing economic inequality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor most US workers, working hard and playing by the rules has yielded limited and declining returns over the past several decades. According to \u003ca href=\"https://opportunityinsights.org/paper/the-fading-american-dream/\"\u003eresearch by Raj Chetty\u003c/a\u003e, the chances of a child earning more than their parents dropped from 90% in the post-World War II era to only 50% by the 1980s. And this troublesome trend of economic immobility continues. Millennials, despite being better educated than previous generations, \u003ca href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2018080pap.pdf\"\u003ehave lower earnings and less wealth\u003c/a\u003e than their predecessors did at the same age.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe US unemployment rate is remarkably low, but today, roughly \u003ca href=\"https://www.aspeninstitute.org/blog-posts/increase-access-availability-good-jobs/\"\u003eone in four working adults\u003c/a\u003e earns a wage that, even with full-time, year-round work, won’t lift a small family out of poverty. There is too much month and not enough paycheck for millions of households. Working people struggle with basic costs—housing, healthcare, child care, transportation–leaving little to cover the ever-escalating cost of higher education for oneself or one’s children.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLimited opportunity and systemic bias continue to disproportionately burden women and people of color. The gender pay gap has slightly narrowed. But women still earn only \u003ca href=\"https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2019/05/college-degree-widens-gender-earnings-gap.html\"\u003e80% of what men\u003c/a\u003e earn, and the pay gap widens at higher education levels.

Work, after all, is a human endeavor, shaped by laws people choose to enact, business decisions people make, individual actions people choose to take, and values society shares.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo change our current trajectory, however, we need a range of ideas and actors to work together toward a common goal of good jobs. And there has been good news on this front recently. The \u003ca href=\"https://www.businessroundtable.org/business-roundtable-redefines-the-purpose-of-a-corporation-to-promote-an-economy-that-serves-all-americans\"\u003eBusiness Roundtable released an updated statement\u003c/a\u003e on the purpose of the corporation. Central to the group’s new commitment is the recognition that businesses have multiple stakeholders to serve, including employees. Meanwhile, the CEO of insurance giant Allstate, writing recently in \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/20/opinion/business-roundtable.html\"\u003eThe New York Times\u003c/a\u003e, called on fellow corporate leaders to focus on creating good-paying jobs. This shift in business perspective is critical, as good jobs are hard to come by when companies don’t recognize their employees as important and worthy stakeholders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut we can’t rely on business alone. Policymakers at all levels should consider ways in which they could reduce the cost of living for working people, as well as how they could support working people with updated labor market regulations that protect workers’ interests. The cost and quality of essential services such as healthcare, transportation, child care, housing, and education are greatly influenced by the decisions of policymakers. These are all major and often challenging expense items for working individuals and their families. Child care, for example, constitutes 19.8% of expenditures for a family in the calculation of a living wage in the model used in the graphic above. Reducing this cost or other expenses for working people lessens the need for businesses to rapidly raise wages, something that can be especially challenging for smaller businesses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEducation institutions and civic organizations also play a critical role in helping people prepare for and connect to work. Worker advocacy and labor organizations can play a vital role both through collective bargaining and by providing a communication channel for workers to receive and share information with company leadership. Such a channel can provide workers the opportunity to offer insight into how to improve work processes and productivity and gain meaningful recognition for their contributions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe future of work is today’s hot topic.

This especially affects the Cavendish, the banana variety that we consume most widely worldwide, and the type that most people in the west typically buy in grocery stores.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur love for this particular variety has driven the establishment of massive monoculture plantations in banana-growing countries, which has caused the fruit’s downfall: without genetic variety on these farms, they’re left exposed to the ravages of disease, which can rapidly decimate vast tracts of cropland in one go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlready, crops in Asia and Africa have been affected by one of the most voracious of these threats, Fusarium Wilt. Recently, the disease even reached Latin America, which is home to Ecuador, the world’s largest exporter of Cavendish bananas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe smartphone app is based on a computer model that uses algorithmic deep learning to make its predictions. To produce this, the researchers gathered 18,000 photos of banana plants from farms around the world, many exhibiting various signs of poor health. Then they used the gallery to train several computer models to identify the hallmarks of particular pests or disease in these images.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe major benefit of the app is its flexibility, according to the researchers. It can identify signs of disease on any part of the plant, and can accurately identify disease even in low-quality photos, or in images where there’s lots of background noise—such as leaf litter coating the ground. In some cases, the detection rate for disease was as high as 100%.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApart from protecting the world’s favorite fruit, the app is aimed particularly at protecting the livelihoods of smallholders. These farmers typically rely on small plots of land to support themselves and their families—places where an outbreak of disease could destroy an entire livelihood. The app is explicitly designed to avert that disaster, by equipping farmers with a DIY, hand-held tool to regularly check crops and rapidly identify disease-risk. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe app could also provide support for at-risk farmers: if a detection is shared through a live network, it could be used to alert agricultural extension workers—people who work between research institutions and farmers—who could come to the farmers’ aid to nip the disease in the bud. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is exactly what the researchers have in mind for the next stage of development. Now they’re hoping to use the app to develop an interconnected, global system, fuelled by farmers who share information about their crops. This would enable experts to pinpoint where disease outbreaks begin, and figure out how to contain them before they spread out of control. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe researchers decided to call the app ‘Tumaini’, which means ‘hope’ in Swahili. They think that’s what the tool offers to the planet’s most vulnerable banana farmers. “This is not just an app, but a tool that contributes to an early warning system that supports farmers directly,” they say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eSource: Selvaraj, et. al. \u003ca href=\"https://plantmethods.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13007-019-0475-z\"\u003e“AI-powered banana diseases and pest detection.”\u003c/a\u003e Plant Methods. 2019.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis piece was originally published on \u003ca href=\"http://www.anthropocenemagazine.org/2019/08/a-new-ai-powered-app-scans-bananas-for-early-signs-of-disease/\"\u003eAnthropocene Magazine\u003c/a\u003e, a publication of Future Earth dedicated to creating a Human Age we actually want to live in.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://qz.com/1700388/a-new-ai-powered-app-scans-banana-crops-for-early-signs-of-disease/","published":"2019-09-02T15:03:44Z","guid":"https://qz.com/1700388/auto-draft/"},{"title":"Why do male tennis players at the US Open reject balls more often than the women do?","content":"\u003cimg width=\"1024\" height=\"575\" src=\"https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AP_19243048059066-e1567440145541.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;w=1024\" class=\"attachment-medium_10 size-medium_10 wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AP_19243048059066-e1567440145541.jpg 2723w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AP_19243048059066-e1567440145541.jpg?resize=768,431 768w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AP_19243048059066-e1567440145541.jpg?resize=50,28 50w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AP_19243048059066-e1567440145541.jpg?resize=160,90 160w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AP_19243048059066-e1567440145541.jpg?resize=320,180 320w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AP_19243048059066-e1567440145541.jpg?resize=640,360 640w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AP_19243048059066-e1567440145541.jpg?resize=940,529 940w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AP_19243048059066-e1567440145541.jpg?resize=1600,900 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#8217;s a familiar ritual: Ahead of a serve, a tennis player will be brought two, three, or even four balls by a waiting ball boy or ball girl. One by one, the player will test out each ball—perhaps by bouncing it off the floor or on the racket, or cupping it in their hands. Any balls found wanting will be chucked away, while the ones deemed acceptable are duly thrown into the air and walloped across the net.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what\u0026#8217;s the difference between the balls that make the cut and those that don\u0026#8217;t? And why do male players seem so much pickier than female players when it comes to tennis ball preferences?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost tennis balls are much the same. On the inside: a rubber core, containing pressurized air. On the outside: a fuzzy \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/02/what-color-tennis-ball-green-yellow/523521/\"\u003egreen-yellow\u003c/a\u003e felt shell. At the US Open, however, the balls played by men and women are subtly different. Men use \u003ca title=\"A review of Wilson’s extra-duty tennis balls.\" href=\"http://bradwelltv.com/bradley/review-on-wilson-tennis-balls-extra-duty-and-extra-rendement/\"\u003eWilson’s extra-duty version\u003c/a\u003e, with a black Wilson logo and a red US Open print. Due to Women\u0026#8217;s Tennis Association regulations, women use different balls—regular-duty, with the colors reversed. They\u0026#8217;re both the same size—Type 2—but the regular-duty balls are a little sleeker, with shorter fibers, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/07/sports/tennis/07tennis.html\"\u003eplay a little faster\u003c/a\u003e by consequence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026#8217;s the rub. Because of the longer fibers, extra-duty balls have greater potential to be bashed around in use, making the fuzzy felt even fluffier. To minimize perceived drag as the ball soars over the net, male players generally prefer tennis balls to be as unfluffed as possible and will select accordingly, however slight the difference. For female players, there\u0026#8217;s less variation, hence less need to pick and choose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026#8217;s why, when the Swiss player Roger Federer serves, he\u0026#8217;ll look for the “fastest ball for the first serve,\u0026#8221; \u003ca href=\"https://www.tennis-x.com/story/2009-09-06/i.php\"\u003ehe said in 2009\u003c/a\u003e. \u0026#8220;I don\u0026#8217;t always do it.

French player Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, who may knock back as many as 60% of the balls he\u0026#8217;s offered, dismissed it as little more than ritual: “I think this one is good, I think this one is good,” \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/07/sports/tennis/07tennis.html\"\u003ehe said, jokingly\u003c/a\u003e. “They’re all the same.”\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://qz.com/1700317/us-open-why-are-balls-rejected-more-often-in-mens-tennis/","published":"2019-09-02T16:07:48Z","guid":"https://qz.com/1700317/auto-draft/"}]},{"url":"https://www.vice.com/en_us/rss","items":[{"title":"Weekly Horoscope: September 2 - 8","content":"\u003cp\u003e \u003cb\u003e Download the \u003ca href=\"https://c.singular.net/api/v1/ad?st=348143644919\u0026h=684756aa22d6d0d8ed4255571371f2186f3946c8\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAstro Guide app\u003c/a\u003e by VICE on an iOS device to read daily horoscopes personalized for your sun, moon, and rising signs, and learn how to apply cosmic events to self care, your friendships, and relationships.\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"article__media--image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1558453751149-Articles-970x250.jpeg\" alt=\"Astro Guide app banner\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e \u003cp\u003eOn Monday, the sun meets action planet Mars in Virgo, making our actions clear—there’s a truth to whatever it is we’re doing, and an increased awareness of passion and force.

There's actually another angle to this and I think we we kind of specifically moved pass quickly that is small and personal. Jay didn't check-in with Kap about this right? Per Kap's girlfriend, I believe girlfriend, Jay-Z talked to him later. The conversation, through a source, was not good. Here's \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/08/jay-z-helps-nfl-banish-colin-kaepernick/596146/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eexact quote from the Jemele Hill piece\u003c/a\u003e, \"Kaepernick’s girlfriend, Nessa Diab, wrote on Twitter that Kaepernick didn’t speak with Jay-Z before he brokered his deal with the NFL. Jay-Z said yesterday that he spoke to Kaepernick on Monday, but he wouldn’t divulge how their conversation went. A source close to Kaepernick, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the topic, told me, “It was not a good conversation.”\"\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003ePatricK:\u003c/b\u003e Also when he was asked about, like he did this Q\u0026A with Rodger Goodell, Jay-Z got a couple of fairly hostile questions, because even a public audience that was like around for this shitty announcement was like \"uh what?\" And someone asked you know \"how you reflect on this whole kneeling thing that's been such an issue for the last couple of years?\" and he said \"I think we've moved past kneeling.

Or at least try to explain yourself before you make the decision.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIf Jay really did conceptualize this as part two in Kaepernick's action, for me that has to begin with a conversation with Kap, maybe you don't get the sign off, but you start there and you go \"listen, this thing came across my desk. This thing is exciting to me because yes, it's going to make me a lot of money, but also because I am going to be able to influence them in their offices with deals. I'm gonna be able to pay a bunch of black artist. I gonna do this, this, and this.\" \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAnd when you do that then I can conceptualize it as [Jay-Z] at least conceptualizing it as the follow-through to what Kaepernick started, but that isn't what happened here. We know this didn't begin with Jay and Kap being like \"all right, what's next, what's step two,\" or even him going like \"bless me Father for I have sinned.\" It is just him going forward on this thing and asking for forgiveness later, and I guess that's just never going to sit right with me.\u003c/p\u003e \u003chr\u003e \u003cp\u003eYou can subscribe on \u003ca href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/vice-gamings-new-podcast/id1159170164?mt=2\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eApple Podcasts\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://play.google.com/music/listen?u=0#/ps/Izfkcqyhf4bqbsjwh4q4dwjuomq\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGoogle Play\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/match-3/vice-gamings-new-podcast\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eStitcher\u003c/a\u003e.

Among more than 2,200 such patients who underwent any form of weight-loss surgery, heart-related events dropped by 39% over eight years of follow up and deaths from any cause declined by 41% compared to a group of more than 11,000 matched controls who did not receive any weight loss surgery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;As a cardiologist, I cannot remember any study, not studies involving statins, or studies involving blood pressure medication, having this large of a treatment effect,\u0026rdquo; says Dr. Steven Nissen, chairman of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic and senior author of the paper. \u0026ldquo;What this tells me is that the heart-related morbidity and mortality associated with diabetes and obesity is reversible with the right procedure.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe magnitude of the reduction in heart events and deaths suggests that the benefits of the surgery may extend beyond those attributable to weight loss alone. \u0026ldquo;There are neurohormonal changes we see after these procedures that could have significant metabolic effects and benefits for patients,\u0026rdquo; says Arminian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe majority of the study participants who had weight-loss surgery underwent gastric bypass, an operation in which surgeons shrink the size of the stomach by creating a small pouch from its tissues and shunting food more directly from that pouch to the upper intestine. The researchers found that, after patients had their digestive tracts re-routed, there were changes in the pattern of hormones their bodies produced. Insulin, produced by beta cells in the pancreas, is responsible for breaking down glucose, and those with diabetes have lower insulin responses to food. But gastric bypass surgery seemed to restore some of the normal insulin response in the study\u0026mdash;Arminian found that many patients no longer needed insulin by the end of the study period. In addition, the share of patients relying on non-insulin diabetic medications also dropped, by half, from 80% to nearly 40%.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeight-loss surgery, and in particular gastric bypass, may also change the composition of healthy bacteria living in the gut. Previous studies have shown that people with diabetes have\u003ca href=\"https://time.com/5597688/microbiome-diabetes-premature-birth-prediction/\" \u003e different species of bacteria\u003c/a\u003e in their digestive tract compared to people without diabetes, which may influence how their bodies respond to sugars. In other research in his lab, Arminian has taken fecal samples from patients pre- and post-surgery and transferred them to mice, which acted as simulated human guts. Animals receiving samples from patients before surgery tended to become obese and develop diabetes and fatty liver syndrome, while those receiving samples from patients three months after weight-loss surgery did not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese findings, taken together, strongly suggest that addressing obesity among diabetics may reverse some of their risk of disease and early death, but that weight loss alone, especially through lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise, may not be enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s not just one factor. Weight loss is important, the gut hormones are important, and the microbiome is important,\u0026rdquo; says Arminian. \u0026ldquo;They all work together like an orchestra to improve the metabolic condition of the patient.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe and Nissen agree that weight loss surgery may not be an option for every overweight or obese diabetic patient, but the data suggest that it might be considered for more people in coming years. Because the study did not randomly assign diabetic patients to surgery or the control group, but relied on a matched set of controls for comparison, the next step in confirming the results would be to conduct a randomized control trial.

It\u0026rsquo;s where I had decided to have my last non-vegan meal. Over the course of the many laps she took between the kitchen and my booth I learned that she was 32 years old and a single mother of three boys; that she lived in Newark\u0026rsquo;s West Ward in a public housing complex; that her \u0026#8220;dream\u0026#8221; job was to be a counselor.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNatasha illustrates, as James Baldwin so eloquently put it, how extremely expensive it is to be poor.

Instead, it requires swinging the pendulum of economic power back toward the workers of this country \u0026mdash; the ones actually driving profits \u0026mdash; and away from corporations and moneyed interests. We must combat corporate power with worker power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis can be tackled in many forms. For starters, we must make it easier, not harder, for \u003ca href=\"https://time.com/5663465/labor-day-union-history/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eworkers to join a union\u003c/a\u003e. The right to organize is a bedrock principle of workers\u0026rsquo; rights and our laws should reflect that. Employers shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be able to interfere as easily as they currently do when their workers try to join together to bargain for better wages and working conditions. If they do, there should be strong \u0026mdash; and swift \u0026mdash; penalties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecondly, we must \u003ca href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/363201855/Monopsony-Letter\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ereinvigorate our tepid antitrust agencies\u003c/a\u003e. Congress has strong antitrust laws on the books dating back to the 1890s. They\u0026rsquo;re meant to ensure competition for the benefit of both consumers and workers, but at some point over the last three decades, the agencies responsible for enforcing those laws have completely forgotten about the part of their mandate that applies to labor. In an analysis of several decades of cases, my office was unable to identify a single instance in which the Justice Department or the Federal Trade Commission has challenged a proposed merger or acquisition due to labor market concerns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlong these same lines, we need to restrict anti-competitive practices like non-compete agreements and no poach clauses that limit worker mobility and keep wages down. No poach agreements are often forged between large corporate franchisors, like IHOP, and their franchisees, usually unbeknown to the worker. Such covenants prohibit the franchisees from recruiting and hiring away one another\u0026rsquo;s workers. This means, for example, that none of the thousands of IHOP franchises may hire an individual who is currently employed \u0026mdash; or was recently employed \u0026mdash; by any other IHOP franchisee. So, if Natasha wanted to get a raise by becoming a shift manager at the IHOP further south in Elizabeth, it would be impossible. The Elizabeth IHOP would have been prohibited from hiring her. IHOP thankfully ended this collusive practice last year amid public outcry, but dozens of other companies still have such anticompetitive and exploitative agreements on the books.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor workers like Natasha, these agreements mean that an already limited range of options narrows further. These clauses \u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/03/01/booker-warren-take-aim-at-businesses-that-promise-not-to-poach-each-others-workers/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eshould be banned\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLastly, we need mitigate the dangerous culture of \u0026ldquo;short-termism\u0026rdquo; that pervades corporate boardrooms and C-suites, as companies prioritize short-run returns to wealthy investors and executives over long-term investments in workers, like higher wages and expanded training. Indicative of this trend is the massive wave of stock buybacks, in which companies purchase their own stock shares in order to reduce supply in the market and drive up their price. According to the economist William Lazonick, between 2007 and 2016, companies on the S\u0026amp;P 500 dedicated \u003ca href=\"https://prospect.org/article/curse-stock-buybacks-0\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e96% of their earnings to stock buybacks\u003c/a\u003e and corporate dividends. That left just 4% for investments in the workforce, like raises for workers. We need to crack down on the proliferation of these buybacks, or, at the very least, ensure that if a corporation buys back stock to increase shareholder value, it must also pay out a commensurate sum to all of its employees who help drive the profits \u0026mdash; \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/3/6/17083398/booker-buyback-populist\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethe \u0026ldquo;workers dividend\u003c/a\u003e.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is no reason that a country as rich and as powerful as ours should have to choose between great wealth for the few, like corporate CEOs, and great opportunity for all of its citizens, like Natasha. We must work to be a country in which any American who wants to work can get a job; where if you work hard, you are paid what you are worth; and where a free market means freedom for workers to move across the labor market to translate their value and increasing productivity into higher wages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike Franklin Delano Roosevelt\u0026rsquo;s New Deal and Lyndon B. Johnson\u0026rsquo;s Great Society, we must reimagine what we can and should expect out of our government. We didn\u0026rsquo;t achieve this vision while Natasha was alive. But I\u0026rsquo;m hopeful that her children, and her children\u0026rsquo;s children, will live to see the day where workers like their mom and grandma truly get a fair shake in this economy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/time/topstories/~4/d8fZ7vX_Al8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/d8fZ7vX_Al8/","published":"2019-09-02T11:00:19Z","guid":"http://time.com/?p=5665619"},{"title":"At Least 1 Million People in These Counties Are Under Evacuation Orders As Hurricane Dorian Approaches","content":"\u003caside class=\"right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad\" id=\"right-rail__ad-5666941\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module\" data-src=\"https://time.com/5666941/hurrican-dorian-evacuation-orders-counties/\" data-widget-id=\"SB_2\" data-ob-template=\"timemag\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least 1 million people have been ordered to evacuate in three U.S. states beginning Monday ahead of \u003ca href=\"https://time.com/5661353/hurricane-dorian-track-forecast/\" \u003eHurricane Dorian,\u003c/a\u003e a slow-moving Category 5 storm currently raging over the \u003ca href=\"https://time.com/5661353/hurricane-dorian-track-forecast/\" \u003eBahamas\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHurricane Dorian is the most powerful such storm to hit the Bahamas since records began, with maximum sustained winds of over 185 miles per hour since it made landfall Sunday afternoon. \u003cspan style=\"font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\"\u003eIt is moving westwards and is projected to hit or skirt areas along the U.S. east coast, the \u003c/span\u003eNational Hurricane Center (NHC) \u003cspan style=\"font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\"\u003e said Monday. \u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\"\u003eThe NHC has issued a hurricane watch for Florida\u0026#8217;s east coast from Deerfield Beach north to the Volusia and Brevard county line.

Policy Is Jobs Policy","content":"\n\u003cp\u003eLabor Day offers Americans a chance to\nappreciate the tremendous value of America’s workers and job creators. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt the Department of Labor, where I serve, we are proud of the hard work Americans have put in to build today’s historically strong labor market, and of the regulatory reform we’re doing to ensure opportunities continue to expand for years to come. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHere at Labor, we cherish the dignity of work\nthat should accompany every paycheck. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSince President Donald Trump took office, 5.7\nmillion jobs have been created and more people are working in America than ever\nbefore. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the Trump administration, the\nunemployment rate reached its lowest level since 1969, the year America first\nput a man on the moon. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis job growth has led to bigger paychecks. For\n12 straight months, annual wage growth has been at or above 3%. And 7.3 million\nopen jobs means that we have even more opportunity for Americans to find their\ncareer path. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBuilding on this positive momentum, more than\n350 job creators around the nation have committed to upskilling, reskilling,\nand providing more job opportunities to more than 13 million individuals by\nsigning the president’s \u003ca href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/pledge-to-americas-workers/\"\u003ePledge\nto America’s Workers\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe work experience that people gain today\nwill change the trajectory of their lives—along with their children’s lives—for\nyears to come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnother advantage of today’s strong labor\nmarket is that employers are realizing the vast potential of individuals who\nthey may have overlooked previously. This includes individuals returning from\nthe criminal justice system, overcoming substance abuse, facing long-term\nunemployment, or worried that they lack necessary job skills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Labor Department has many programs and\nenforcement arms under its authority. But the one unifying mission behind\neverything that we do is simple—increasing opportunity for people of all\nbackgrounds to build lasting careers. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOne aspect of increasing work opportunities is\nallowing job creators to do what they do best—provide Americans with jobs. As\npart of our ongoing efforts to cut red tape, we ranked second among federal\ndepartments last year for deregulating, with \u003ca href=\"https://www.reginfo.gov/public/pdf/eo13771/EO_13771_Final_Accounting_for_Fiscal_Year_2018.pdf\"\u003e$3.28\nbillion\u003c/a\u003e in cost savings. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBesides getting rid of job-killing,\nunnecessary regulations, another major priority is bringing clarity to\nregulations through relying on a transparent rulemaking process. This focus on\ntransparency involves substantial public input and allows the department to\nprotect workers while limiting the burdens that regulations place on job\ncreators.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis emphasis on protecting workers while\nencouraging job growth is why the Labor Department launched the \u003ca href=\"https://www.dol.gov/agencies/oasp/compliance-initiatives\"\u003eOffice\nof Compliance Initiatives\u003c/a\u003e in August 2018.

Somehow, just about every topic that people want to argue about splits into two camps. If you visualize the vast array of topics you could have an opinion about as a switchboard full of toggles, it seems improbable that so many people in each camp should have nearly identical switchboards, but they do. This can even extend to factual issues, like science—one camp typically does not accept that climate change is real and human-caused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow in the world do we end up with these opinion sets? And why does something like climate change start an inter-camp argument, while other things like the physics behind airplane design enjoy universal acceptance?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne obvious way to explain these opinions is to look for underlying principles that connect them.

Pin the throttle flat and for a brief moment, until respect for one's fellow humans or fear of the speeding ticket takes over, it's possible to experience \u003cem\u003eall\u003c/em\u003e of the torque and power. But reaching the Vmax for most of these hand-built exotics remains an abstract idea, even on Germany's derestricted Autobahns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, there is one paved road long and flat enough to finally run out of steam. It's at a \u003ca href=\"https://jalopnik.com/why-volkswagens-are-the-only-cars-that-can-drive-faster-1540470407\"\u003eVolkswagen-owned test track\u003c/a\u003e in a town called Ehra-Lessien in Germany, located a few miles from the company's Wolfsburg HQ. Among its features are a 12-mile (20km) high-speed circuit that includes a 5.4-mile (8.7km) straight, just the thing for finding out a very fast top speed. In 1998 it's where McLaren found out its F1 road car would reach 240.1mph (386.4km/h), and where Bugatti then beat that production record with the 253.8mph (408.5km/h) Veyron in 2007.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFast forward another nine years and Bugatti replaced the Veyron with the \u003ca href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2016/02/1479-horsepower-261-mph-2-6-million-the-new-bugatti-chiron/\"\u003eChiron\u003c/a\u003e, another scarab-like hypercar but this time with an even more powerful 8L W16 engine, packing almost 1,500hp (1,103kW). But when the new car arrived, Bugatti revealed that its top speed was actually electronically limited to a maximum of 261mph (420km/h). It could theoretically go faster than that but its specially designed Michelin tires would fail under the extreme forces. Presumably that fact must have been gnawing away at Bugatti's bosses, because the company decided to do something about that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1561091#p3\"\u003eRead 4 remaining paragraphs\u003c/a\u003e | \u003ca href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1561091\u0026comments=1\"\u003eComments\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"feedflare\"\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=qh2VzVK1SsU:DCx7OwRsGYM:V_sGLiPBpWU\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=qh2VzVK1SsU:DCx7OwRsGYM:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=qh2VzVK1SsU:DCx7OwRsGYM:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=qh2VzVK1SsU:DCx7OwRsGYM:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=qh2VzVK1SsU:DCx7OwRsGYM:qj6IDK7rITs\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=qh2VzVK1SsU:DCx7OwRsGYM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","url":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1561091","published":"2019-09-02T13:15:01Z","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1561091"},{"title":"First encounter: Ohio Challenger 2P (and its 4KB of RAM)","content":"\u003cdiv id=\"rss-wrap\"\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"intro-image intro-left\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/challenger-2p.jpg\" alt=\"Personal computing, 1980-style.\"\u003e\u003cp class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"\u003ePersonal computing, 1980-style.

I had signed up for Russian 1, which involved a daily bus ride to the nearby high school in Aurora, Colorado where it was offered. My excitement at learning the language of the enemy during the height of the Cold War dropped considerably when only four students—from across the entire school district—showed up the first day of class. Such low enrollment meant Russian was cancelled a few short days later, forcing me to rework my schedule. I substituted Latin for Russian—which eliminated the need to hop on a bus each day— and that in turn opened a spot on my schedule for Introduction to Computer Programming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://arstechnica.com/?p=178070#p3\"\u003eRead 15 remaining paragraphs\u003c/a\u003e | \u003ca href=\"http://arstechnica.com/?p=178070\u0026comments=1\"\u003eComments\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"feedflare\"\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=hVfKHuPh_Ng:dY8JJPvdWZs:V_sGLiPBpWU\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=hVfKHuPh_Ng:dY8JJPvdWZs:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=hVfKHuPh_Ng:dY8JJPvdWZs:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=hVfKHuPh_Ng:dY8JJPvdWZs:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=hVfKHuPh_Ng:dY8JJPvdWZs:qj6IDK7rITs\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=hVfKHuPh_Ng:dY8JJPvdWZs:yIl2AUoC8zA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","url":"http://arstechnica.com/?p=178070","published":"2019-09-02T12:16:27Z","guid":"http://arstechnica.com/?p=178070"}]},{"url":"https://gigaom.com/feed/","items":[]},{"url":"https://scobleizer.com/feed","items":[]},{"url":"https://feeds.feedburner.com/oreilly/radar/atom","items":[]},{"url":"https://feeds.feedburner.com/blogspot/MKuf?format=xml","items":[]},{"url":"http://feeds.mashable.com/Mashable?format=xml","items":[{"title":"Huawei Mate 30 will launch on Sept. 19","content":"\n\n\u003cimg alt=\"\" src=\"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1041211%252F7224fe25-4816-4ffb-a08a-2ca9ba249899.jpg%252F575x323__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=RY8PVX96XkcwSqWaqCEp_Vc7lRo=\u0026amp;source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com\" /\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"float: right; width: 50px;\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/share?via=Mashable\u0026text=Huawei+Mate+30+will+launch+on+Sept.+19\u0026url=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Farticle%2Fhuawei-mate-30-sept-19%2F\" style=\"margin: 10px;\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Twitter\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://a.amz.mshcdn.com/assets/feed-tw-e71baf64f2ec58d01cd28f4e9ef6b2ce0370b42fbd965068e9e7b58be198fb13.jpg\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Farticle%2Fhuawei-mate-30-sept-19%2F\u0026src=sp\" style=\"margin: 10px;\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Facebook\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://a.amz.mshcdn.com/assets/feed-fb-8e3bd31e201ea65385a524ef67519d031e6851071807055648790d6a4ca77139.jpg\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eHuawei's next flagship phone is coming out on Sept. 19.\u0026#160;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Huawei Mate 30 announced a launch event in Munich, Germany on Twitter, with a short teaser video that, unsurprisingly, points to the phone's camera as one of its most important features.\u0026#160;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote that the teaser says \"series,\" meaning that Huawei will launch more than one phone at the event, likely the Mate 30 and the Mate 30 Pro.\u0026#160;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid you get it right?

With NHS wait times several weeks if not months for access to physiotherapy, Urban thinks it has spotted a gap in the market for people that need ongoing treatment or a quick appraisal for a recently sustained injury \u0026#8212; and are willing to pay \u0026#8220;out of pocket\u0026#8221; for the privilege.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a call with Urban founder Jack Tang and the company\u0026#8217;s general manager for physical wellbeing, Joe Jarman, the pair explained that the new service aims to provide access to a private physiotherapist with as little as two hours\u0026#8217; notice, available seven days per week. It will initially be available in London, with a focus on central London where demand (and, presumably, ability to pay) is highest, followed by Manchester and Birmingham.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith that said, pricing is competitive with physiotherapy that is typically offered at a private clinic, and compared to arranging a home visit from a private clinic, it is considerably cheaper. That\u0026#8217;s because, claims Jarman, Urban is able to cut down on travel time by clustering nearby bookings via its app in order to maximise potential sessions per day, similar to what it does for other existing Urban wellbeing services. Of course, it doesn\u0026#8217;t have the same brick \u0026#8216;n\u0026#8217; mortar overheads, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJarman says that many of Urban\u0026#8217;s physiotherapists work in the NHS during the day but are looking to earn additional income in the evenings and at weekends or want to transition into private practice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsked if a service like Urban could place more pressure on the NHS by stretching an already scare resource, he says that the sector as a whole is growing. This has seen a 22% increase in the number of physiotherapists since 2015. In addition, Jarman says one in every three GP consultations relates to MSK issues, and early access to an Urban physiotherapist could help lessen this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEither way, it\u0026#8217;s certainly true that at present and within its current funding and organisational structure, the NHS isn\u0026#8217;t very well-positioned to provide speedy MSK-related advice or treatment. Physiotherapy is also an obvious extension to Urban\u0026#8217;s existing osteopathy and sports massage treatments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;We see physiotherapy as the final vital piece so that we can offer a complete package to attain good physical health,\u0026#8221; adds Jarman in a statement. \u0026#8220;If someone has a problem with their body, we make sure they get the right treatment plan – and they get to choose the time and place\u0026#8221;.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, Tang says that now Urban has completed its suite for physical wellbeing, the startup\u0026#8217;s attention now turns to \u0026#8220;doubling down\u0026#8221; on its beauty and body confidence category with more news to share \u0026#8220;very soon\u0026#8221;.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"feedflare\"\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=QIpc29GUFKA:Dt6n6VUsao8:2mJPEYqXBVI\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=QIpc29GUFKA:Dt6n6VUsao8:7Q72WNTAKBA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=QIpc29GUFKA:Dt6n6VUsao8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=QIpc29GUFKA:Dt6n6VUsao8:-BTjWOF_DHI\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=QIpc29GUFKA:Dt6n6VUsao8:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=QIpc29GUFKA:Dt6n6VUsao8:D7DqB2pKExk\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=QIpc29GUFKA:Dt6n6VUsao8:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=QIpc29GUFKA:Dt6n6VUsao8:qj6IDK7rITs\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/QIpc29GUFKA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/QIpc29GUFKA/","published":"2019-09-02T08:00:51Z","guid":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=1875923"},{"title":"Spotawheel picks up €5M for its online used car dealership","content":"\u003cp id=\"speakable-summary\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.spotawheel.gr/\"\u003eSpotawheel\u003c/a\u003e, a startup operating in Greece and Poland with a car dealership model quite similar to \u003ca href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/28/auto-site-carvana-tumbles-26-in-stock-market-debut/\"\u003eCarvana\u003c/a\u003e in the U.S., has picked up €5 million in new funding.

Food delivery service DoorDash, another gig economy company that classifies its couriers as freelancers, says it will chip in $30 million. Uber and Lyft also support a separate bill to create a new designation for gig economy workers, but view the ballot initiative is portrayed as a “last resort,” according to the \u003cem\u003eTimes\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"3rZ3jT\"\u003eThis desperate maneuver contrasts with the blasé attitude of Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, who when asked about AB5 in an \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/8/20793793/uber-5-billion-quarter-loss-profit-lyft-traffic-2019\"\u003eearnings call earlier this month\u003c/a\u003e. “If AB5 passes, it’ll simply be a qualification of existing law.

Earlier this year, a federal labor lawyer in the Trump administration \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/14/18623467/uber-driver-freelancers-employees-federal-labor-lawyer-contractor\"\u003eissued an opinion\u003c/a\u003e that ride-hail drivers are independent contractors, not employees. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"HLaJZd\"\u003eThe Department of Labor \u003ca href=\"https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/gig-economy-misclassification-addressed-by-labor-department\"\u003ehas also stated\u003c/a\u003e that gig workers like Uber drivers are contractors ineligible for minimum wages and overtime pay. A federal judge ruled basically the same way \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/12/17231060/uber-drivers-freelancers-employees-judge-ruling\"\u003elast year\u003c/a\u003e in what is said to be the first classification of Uber drivers under federal law. That means that even if AB5 passes into law, unions seeking to organize drivers will run into strong headwinds. Uber and Lyft could force organizing drivers to face a vote by the Trump-controlled National Labor Relations Board, which could undermine those efforts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"dxjrUo\"\u003eThis has been brewing for years. Hundreds of Uber drivers \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/8/18537194/uber-driver-strike-ipo-public-relations-nyc\"\u003ewent on strike\u003c/a\u003e ahead of the company’s much-anticipated IPO in May. Drivers said they want better working conditions and more transparency from Uber over wages and access to the platform. Uber’s stock price has fallen steadily since the IPO amid concerns over the company’s lack of profitability; Uber lost a staggering $5.2 billion in the second quarter of 2019, most of which attributable to one-time stock payouts. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-float-left c-float-hang\"\u003e\u003caside id=\"1MbYJn\"\u003e\u003cq\u003eCalifornia’s passage of AB5 could have a domino effect\u003c/q\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"RWtfsW\"\u003eThere are some labor groups that represent drivers, but all of them lack the ability to collectively bargain with the companies over essential issues like pay scales, hours, and workers compensation.

But it will run into strong resistance from Uber and Lyft, which have deep pockets to spend on lobbying and public relations campaigns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"VgCY1Y\"\u003e“They will continue to pour money into their misinformation campaign to convince voters that their refusal to provide employment protections helps the workers,” said Liss-Riordan, who is now running for US Senate in Massachusetts. “What it does is allow them to shift all expenses and burdens of employment from themselves to the workers whose labor has made these companies what they are today.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"3XEW8W\"\u003eUber and Lyft have long argued that drivers don’t want to be classified as employees, preferring the flexibility to set their own schedules and drive for multiple apps that comes with gig work. “Our drivers consistently tell us that the reason why they value Uber is they value their freedom,” Khosrowshahi said on the earnings call. “They’re their own boss.

He notes that if drivers in California were reclassified as employees, their employers could provide them improved pay and benefits and full reimbursement for driving expenses, allow drivers to organize, while maintaining driver flexibility over their work hours. “Nothing in federal or state law precludes allowing employees to choose different or similar blocks of work hours each week,” Reich told \u003cem\u003eThe Verge\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"F88k3W\"\u003eUber and Lyft describe driving as a “side gig” — and for many drivers, it certainly starts that way. It did for Edan Alva, who started driving for Lyft eight years ago to help make ends meet. But after he lost his main job, driving became his primary source of income.

In both cases, nothing is really explained to you about how to get the vehicle moving or how you might get a giant wall to move out of your way, aside from the three button prompts the game uses to teach you how to jump, pick up items, and zoom in the camera. This forces you to experiment. The game’s design encourages this since there aren’t really any harsh penalties for messing up or taking too long, aside from the game taking longer to finish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Qz2ptc\"\u003eHow the vehicle works is a good example of this. It’s full of big red buttons that all do different things. What you eventually figure out from running or jumping into them is how the vehicle’s different systems work: there is a balancing act to manage them in order to keep the vehicle moving. There is a button that powers up the engine to make the vehicle move, but it unsticks every so often so you have to keep pushing it back in. There is also a limited amount of fuel, which you can add to by collecting items you’ll come across on the road or in ruins that you then feed into the fuel tank when needed. Steam also builds up as the engine is active, which needs to be released every so often, but also provides a small speed boost when you do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Jn6IsN\"\u003eIf you can manage to keep all of these spinning plates going, then you’re rewarded with quickly getting to the next set of ruins blocking your path. But if you keep forgetting to push the engine’s power button in or to refuel, and it’ll slow down your progress. Run out of things to turn into fuel, and you’ll have to go walking a little ways to find some on the road. As you progress, you’ll settle into a rhythm — although this will likely happen just as a new part for the vehicle is added, which makes things a little easier and more complicated. Sails let you cruise through windy areas without using fuel if you don’t mind moving slowly, or very fast if you want to use the engine with it as well. \u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/csTuZVUMdymtifszsOWUaKK0BcE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19129625/FARLoneSails_Screenshot04_Bridge.jpg\"\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"LAuBRD\"\u003eYou’ll find these parts in the ruins that impede your journey. Although, despite ostensibly being obstacles, the ruins also serve as a respite from the plate-spinning required by piloting your vehicle. The ruins feature platforming puzzles that unlock the next leg of the journey, while also giving you the opportunity to collect some fuel to load in your vehicle. It’s also a good chance to take in your surroundings; you can see the changing landscape as you drive your vehicle, but you often don’t get to take it in and register what is going on since you are so focused on keeping things going. But at the ruins, you start to get a sense from the abandoned structures what the world was like before the apocalypse happened and the downfall of civilization since then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"1pNbcJ\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eFar: Lone Sails\u003c/em\u003e is a lonesome experience, but it’s also kind of a meditative one.

Here’s Andy Wallace, Le Mans winner and Bugatti test driver, reaching a top speed of 304.773 mph (490.484 km/h) on August 2nd on the VW-owned test track at Ehra-Lessien in the German state of Lower Saxony. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"VmSE6F\"\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"\u003e\u003ciframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FuS_bXJNync?rel=0\" style=\"border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"encrypted-media; accelerometer; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"EvK5Hx\"\u003eTo put it in more relatable terms, 300 mph is fast enough to cover the length of a football field — doesn’t matter which version of football you prefer — in less than a second. Of course it’s more about bragging rights than any real-world applications. You don’t ever \u003cem\u003eneed\u003c/em\u003e to go that fast, at least not outside the \u003cem\u003eFast and Furious\u003c/em\u003e cinematic universe.

Ali, segundo dados da prefeitura, 100% da população depende do SUS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA um custo de quase R$ 209 mil por mês, o posto e seus 48 funcionários – apenas dois são médicos – são responsáveis por atender 9,5 mil pessoas, entre elas Tâmara e sua família. Foi ali que ela descobriu a pneumonia do filho mais novo, Pedro, então com nove meses de idade, rapidamente encaminhado para um hospital pela médica cubana Lesbia Eloina Rodriguez Baez. O número de usuários da UBS, porém, pode ser ainda maior. A prefeitura só contabiliza o atendimento dos moradores cadastrados, excluindo quem vive em áreas sem CEP e que também usa o serviço. Em todo o distrito, entre atendimento básico, emergencial e especializado, cada médico é responsável por 2,1 mil pessoas, se dividir o número total de habitantes pelo de médicos – mais de cinco vezes mais pessoas por médico do que recomenda o \u003ca href=\"http://bvsms.saude.gov.br/bvs/publicacoes/pacto_nacional_saude_mais_medicos.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ePacto Nacional pela Saúde\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEm 2012, o índice de mortalidade infantil em Cidade Tiradentes era o mais alto da cidade de São Paulo, com \u003ca href=\"https://www.prefeitura.sp.gov.br/cidade/secretarias/upload/saude/arquivos/publicacoes/Boletim_CEInfo_Dados_2013.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003e17,2 mortes\u003c/a\u003e a cada mil crianças com até um ano de idade.

Contratada em janeiro como atendente de uma loja de roupas em Santana, bairro de classe média da zona norte de São Paulo, ela ainda não está acostumada com o trem lotado que encontra pelas manhãs para ir ao serviço. Seu filho mais velho, de 15 anos, não gosta da ideia da mãe trabalhar longe de casa. Dos seus três filhos, ele é quem toma o lugar de “mãe e pai” quando Tâmara não está. Não faz isso por opção, mas porque os irmãos mais novos, de 13 e 3 anos, não têm com quem ficar. O pai das crianças saiu de casa quando o caçula era recém-nascido e nunca mais voltou.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTâmara engravidou de Pedro Henrique, seu filho mais novo, em 2014, enquanto fazia um tratamento de um câncer de mama no Instituto Brasileiro de Controle do Câncer.

O bebê passou 12 dias internado. Foi a médica cubana também que diagnosticou a segunda pneumonia de Pedro, quando ele tinha 1 ano e 6 meses de vida. O menino passou mais 17 dias internado.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePor conta de algumas crises de bronquite, de uma obstrução nasal e das duas pneumonias, Pedro iniciou um acompanhamento com uma pneumologista, brasileira, na UBS São Carlos, em Guaianases, também na zona leste de São Paulo, a uma hora de ônibus de distância de sua casa.

A diferença entre os dois modelos é que os médicos terceirizados não têm vínculos com os pacientes e a rotatividade é alta, principalmente em locais periféricos, como Cidade Tiradentes. Em um dia, a Unidade Básica de Saúde de Tâmara perdeu metade dos médicos. Um dos dois terceirizados pela prefeitura pediu demissão no dia 20 de maio, algumas semanas após a unidade ter sido assaltada, me contou o gerente da UBS. Ele trabalhava no local havia cerca de seis meses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutra estratégia para repor as vagas ocupadas pelos cubanos é a contratação de médicos brasileiros inscritos no Mais Médicos.

Com uma rotina que começa às 5h e termina por volta das 21h, Raimundo não vai ao médico para um consulta rotineira há mais de um ano. “A única coisa que perguntam na UBS Jardim Vitória é se ele é hipertenso, diabético… Ele não é, já passou no particular, mas precisa de um acompanhamento médico”, diz Tâmara.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cu\u003e23 DE MAIO DE 2019.\u003c/u\u003e Seguindo a recomendação do médico que atendeu seu pai, Tâmara retornou ao pronto-socorro logo cedo.

hazardous working conditions and meagre wages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChildren as young as five were often found working at plants and factories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese conditions fuelled the first labour unions, which began to organise strikes and protests in an effort to force employers into providing better working conditions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, many of these rallies turned violent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn September 5, 1882, 10,000 workers took unpaid time off to march in a parade from City Hall to Union Square in New York City as a tribute to American workers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOrganised by New York’s Central Labor Union, it was the country’s first unofficial Labor Day parade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree years later, some city ordinances marked the first government recognition, and legislation soon followed in a number of states.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn May 11 1894, a major strike by workers ended up shaking a small town in Illinois that had been founded by George Pullman, an engineer and industrialist who created the railroad sleeping car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe community, located on the Southside of Chicago, was designed as a “company town” in which most of the factory workers who built Pullman cars lived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen wage cuts hit, 4,000 Pullman workers staged a strike that pitted the American Railway Union against the Pullman Company and the federal government.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe strike and subsequent boycott against trains triggered a nationwide transportation nightmare for freight and passenger traffic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt its peak, the strike involved about 250,000 workers in more than 25 states.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRiots broke out in many cities and President Grover Cleveland was forced to call in Army troops to break the strikers, resulting in the deaths of more than a dozen people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scenes led to Congress passing an act to make the first Monday in September “Labor Day”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe act came into force on June 28, 1894, and has been a legal holiday

near the city of Zonouz in northwestern East Azarbaijan province. It lies next to the provincial capital of Tabriz.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHomes in the village boast beautiful architecture and the yard of each house above is, in fact, the roof of another house below. Local women wear traditional and colourful costumes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe passageways and coloured houses in the village still maintain their historical identity. Some of the houses there date back to the Safavid era. Some experts believe the village dates back to the Ilkhanate rule, but there are manuscripts in the local cemetery which show the village was established in an era before the Ilkhanate rule.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe main industry in the village is the production of orchard produce such as apples, apricots and walnuts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVillagers pay due regard to education, and there are people with Master’s and PhD degrees in each and every house there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition to its different architecture and great antiquity, the village can
