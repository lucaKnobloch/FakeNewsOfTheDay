class=\"pf-content\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is what happens when no one trusts information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrexit was supposed to free the U.K. from European tyranny, keep the immigrants out, save money at the NHS, everything but provide free sliced bread.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo you had people voting against their interests. Not knowing that European companies were responsible for their paychecks. It all felt good, but the devil was in the details.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe devil is always in the details.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey call it the Information Age. What we didn\u0026#8217;t expect was that everybody would make up their own information, to suit their own purposes. To the point where no one trusts information at all. Like in the vaccine debate. Something must have caused the child\u0026#8217;s autism, vaccines sound good, because there\u0026#8217;s no way in hell I can be the victim of fate, drawing the short end of the stick, someone must be responsible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd speaking of responsibility, that\u0026#8217;s what right-leaning pols are selling. The no-goodniks sucking on the tit of the government. If everybody just got down to work and pulled themselves up by their bootstraps, you wouldn\u0026#8217;t even need a government.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo Brexit passes on feel good nationality and falsehoods, never mind a lack of actual knowledge of the issues. But once it passes, everybody wakes up and sees the consequences. It wasn\u0026#8217;t supposed to happen. Now the country is in deep doo-doo. How do we fix this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurns out you can\u0026#8217;t. Nothing can be done. The government has come to a standstill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only ones who want a no-deal Brexit are the people who lied to get the exit. Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage\u0026#8230; They see the government as their plaything, damn the consequences if it works out for me!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then we\u0026#8217;ve got the fearmongers talking about the disaster of a no-deal Brexit. Is it Y2K or real? One side says it\u0026#8217;s no big deal, as the pound falls, and the other says it\u0026#8217;s a disaster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026#8217;s no truth anymore. No facts the public can rely on. They hate the people in government, the government itself, they don\u0026#8217;t know who to turn to. And many end up making up their own facts. When it comes to health issues, it\u0026#8217;s the educated left with their cockamamie ideas. I said I had cancer and people inundated me with info on nutrition and meditation, saying my blood cancer could be cured if I just subscribed to Goop and believed Dr. Oz and took control of my health care and dissed the industrial medical complex and its quacks. Kinda like Marianne Williamson saying the \u0026#8220;power of the mind\u0026#8221; could stop a hurricane Dorian disaster. Oh, she deleted that tweet, once she was informed it was looney-tunes, but the truth is that\u0026#8217;s what she\u0026#8217;s selling, and she\u0026#8217;s not selling it to the underclass, but the educated. Meanwhile, the poor go to the doctor and listen to him/her, assuming they can afford to do so.\u003cbr /\u003e\nAnd then not only the right excoriates Medicare-for-All, but so does the left. And then you\u0026#8217;ve got a story like the one in the \u0026#8220;New York Times,\u0026#8221; where a hospital is suing for exorbitant bills and people are losing their houses. Do you think this would happen in a Medicare-for-All world? Of course not. These people had insurance, but insurance doesn\u0026#8217;t cover everything, no way. All those people afraid of losing their employer insurance are just afraid of change, like the people who said files would never supersede CDs and streaming would never supersede files.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou see it\u0026#8217;s not only the right that lies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then you\u0026#8217;ve got the right\u0026#8217;s house organ, Fox News, which is criticized by Trump. It\u0026#8217;d be like Elizabeth Warren saying not to trust MSNBC. Then who do you trust?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd despite politics/government/Boris/Trump being the story of our age, despite people following it closer than ever before, people still have to work, go to school, live their lives, they can\u0026#8217;t sacrifice everything to study the issues. And the outlets they rely on? The right has neutered the \u0026#8220;New York Times,\u0026#8221; according to Republicans you can\u0026#8217;t even trust its sports scores. Of course that\u0026#8217;s an exaggeration, but not by much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd in this social media/influencer world, people believe they can generate their own news, their own spin, it doesn\u0026#8217;t matter whether you\u0026#8217;re educated or not, you\u0026#8217;re entitled to an opinion!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo Brexit does not happen. Been over three years now. And now that people have a greater understanding of its consequences, they want to be assured they\u0026#8217;re not negatively impacted. Everybody\u0026#8217;s on high alert. And Boris Johnson tries to ram his vision through, and people protest and not only does Labour stand up to him, but members of his own party!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe haven\u0026#8217;t had that spirit here since John McCain voted not to get rid of Obamacare. He did the right thing, knowing he was never gonna run for re-election and he didn\u0026#8217;t have to pay fealty to Trump, never mind the party.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026#8217;s one thing that\u0026#8217;s amazing. In Britain, lawmakers broke ranks. But we\u0026#8217;ve yet to see this happen in the U.S. But of course it would have happened if the Democrats had impeached Trump six months ago and actively pursued it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow most people don\u0026#8217;t even know that impeachment is not kicking someone out of office, it\u0026#8217;s just an investigation by the House, and if the House thinks expulsion is warranted, it\u0026#8217;s kicked up to the Senate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd having lived through Watergate\u0026#8230; Nixon was innocent until the plethora of evidence showed that he could not govern and the Republicans told him he had to go. If you don\u0026#8217;t think this would have happened with Trump, you\u0026#8217;re too young. In the face of overwhelming evidence, everybody caves. You just jump to the other side and say you\u0026#8217;re shocked, positively shocked that this was going on and the integrity of the government must be preserved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Trump passes legislation to increase pollution, i.e. global warming, and now Al Gore and the prognosticators\u0026#8217; predictions have borne evidence. That\u0026#8217;s right, no one ever believes there\u0026#8217;ll be a payday, but when it\u0026#8217;s 90 degrees in Alaska, you know the witching hour has arrived. Yup, the religious nuts think Jesus will save them, but the truth is man has to save himself. You\u0026#8217;ve got to plan. You\u0026#8217;re not gonna be an M.D. if you don\u0026#8217;t graduate from college.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut if you can find one scientist who says global warming is a hoax\u0026#8230;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd you\u0026#8217;ve got Joe Biden railing against climate change the day before he\u0026#8217;s going to a fundraiser hosted by big oil\u0026#8230;you know he\u0026#8217;s on the wrong track, and maybe too old to know what\u0026#8217;s going on. But we\u0026#8217;re propping him up, he\u0026#8217;s our savior, according to the same people who say impeachment will alienate voters and African-Americans won\u0026#8217;t vote for Warren. Didn\u0026#8217;t Trump teach us the old paradigm is out the window?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now the left\u0026#8217;s story is it\u0026#8217;s all about white nationalism, racism, but if you think that\u0026#8217;s the reason Trump got elected you\u0026#8217;re probably a big city denizen wondering how you\u0026#8217;re gonna make it on 200k a year\u0026#8230;how are you gonna pay for your European trips and your Benz, never mind private school? No wonder the underclass has contempt for you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaxes are cut to help the little guy and the law only helps the corporation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd you wonder why people don\u0026#8217;t trust the government and the media\u0026#8230;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd just because people were nationalistic four years ago, that does not mean they\u0026#8217;re nationalistic today. Sure, politicians can\u0026#8217;t change their minds, but people do all day long, they learn things, they get educated. So Warsaw goes left instead of right. You learn from the past and then go forward. So what we know is too many have suffered in the race to globalization. So now all these leaders are trying to isolate their countries to their detriment instead of taking care of those who suffered under open trade laws.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSure, China is gonna cave to Trump. What, are you nuts? They\u0026#8217;re operating with a different playbook, if the public suffers, so what? They won\u0026#8217;t let the U.S. dictate to them. And now it\u0026#8217;s not only farmers suffering in America, but the regular folk, what they\u0026#8217;re buying\u0026#8230;the price has gone up. And it\u0026#8217;s their spending that keeps this country alive. Their entire paycheck goes into the system, whereas the rich hoard their money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut if you\u0026#8217;re not a student of the game, you throw your hands in the air, who knows what to believe?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho cares if going from the U.K. to Europe is difficult if you don\u0026#8217;t go? But that free border benefits you in ways you haven\u0026#8217;t been informed of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, those running the governments are in the disinformation business. Mexico is gonna build the wall? China is paying the tariffs?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen again, too many people are not educated enough to analyze the issues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo we\u0026#8217;ve got gridlock. Those who want to move forward and those who want to move back. And the truth is in every change, someone suffers, but no one is willing to suffer anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurns out most people don\u0026#8217;t want the Brexit sold to them in 2016. Turns out the issues are much more complicated than they were sold as. But it\u0026#8217;s kinda like that Trump tax cut, if we do it fast enough, no one will know what the consequences are. And if you load up the disinformation, and there\u0026#8217;s always some pundit to take your side, you can spin it that it\u0026#8217;s not castor oil, but lemonade!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, Facebook doesn\u0026#8217;t stop lying while it continues to invade our privacy, and now the one to one paradigm Zuckerberg is moving toward will inundate you with updates from people you do know, I mean they\u0026#8217;ve got to sell advertising, they\u0026#8217;ve got investors, Wall Street is king!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that\u0026#8217;s how Trump got elected\u0026#8230; Who is looking out for the little guy?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNobody, there\u0026#8217;s no money in it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe post \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ritholtz.com/2019/09/brexit/\"\u003eBrexit\u003c/a\u003e appeared first on \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\"

It doesn’t feel cold or cavernous but as if you’re somewhere else. “It’s a different space and time,” says restaurant co-owner Randall Cook. “And everything is on purpose.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eInspiration for the concept was taken, in part, from chef Hiroki Fujiyama’s home: Kyoto, Japan. The restaurant’s 10-foot circular wooden entryway was created by local father and son woodworking team Workerman Studios and finished with \u003cem\u003eyakisugi\u003c/em\u003e, a Japanese technique of heating the wood to preserve it. The pebbled sidewalk in front of the building flows through the entrance and into the vestibule, effectively bringing nature into the building—another Japanese influence. Inside, the height of warm wood-paneled ceilings varies, and that’s by design, too. “We spent three hours discussing what the height of that ceiling should be,” Cook says, pointing over the sushi bar. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eCook, along with with Daniel Olsovsky and David Grasso, runs Method Co., a Philly-based design, real estate, and hospitality firm with projects that include Roost, a mini-chain of apartment hotels peppered around the city. Hiroki came about on the heels of the team’s successful first restaurant, Wm. Mulherin’s Sons. This stylish Italian spot serving rustic homemade pastas and wood-fired pizzas helped transform the neighborhood into a dining destination when it opened in 2016. Method Co. owned the building that housed Mulherin’s, and an extra 1,000-square-foot space behind the restaurant seemed perfect for an intimate Japanese concept. The firm recruited Fujiyama, who had spent over a decade working with Iron Chef Masaharu Morimoto, to run the show in his first solo project. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThough the team originally imagined a menu focused on nigiri, the chef had another vision. “In general, I did not want to serve only sushi,” Fujiyama says. “I hope that our guests are more enlightened by a diverse \u003cem\u003eomakase\u003c/em\u003e menu focused on seasonality.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Hiroki_0585_M18.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2692132\" srcset=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Hiroki_0585_M18.jpg 1094w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Hiroki_0585_M18.jpg?resize=150,109 150w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Hiroki_0585_M18.jpg?resize=300,217 300w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Hiroki_0585_M18.jpg?resize=768,556 768w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Hiroki_0585_M18.jpg?resize=1024,741 1024w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Hiroki_0585_M18.jpg?resize=281,203 281w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Hiroki_0585_M18.jpg?resize=695,503 695w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Hiroki_0585_M18.jpg?resize=100,72 100w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Hiroki_0585_M18.jpg?resize=60,43 60w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Hiroki_0585_M18.jpg?resize=154,111 154w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Hiroki_0585_M18.jpg?resize=544,394 544w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Hiroki_0585_M18.jpg?resize=392,284 392w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Hiroki_0585_M18.jpg?resize=232,168 232w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Hiroki_0585_M18.jpg?resize=642,465 642w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Hiroki_0585_M18.jpg?resize=215,156 215w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Hiroki_0585_M18.jpg?resize=460,333 460w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Hiroki_0585_M18.jpg?resize=532,385 532w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Hiroki_0585_M18.jpg?resize=600,434 600w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Hiroki_0585_M18.jpg?resize=90,65 90w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Hiroki_0585_M18.jpg?resize=83,60 83w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Hiroki_0585_M18.jpg?resize=170,123 170w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Hiroki_0585_M18.jpg?resize=115,83 115w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Hiroki_0585_M18.jpg?resize=680,492 680w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Hiroki_0585_M18.jpg?resize=716,518 716w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1094px) 100vw, 1094px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eHiroki offers an omakase menu with an attention to detail and meticulous sourcing that set it apart from anything else in the city.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"image-credit\"\u003eHiroki\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe dramatic lighting, designed by Copenhagen-based firm Menu, spotlights the chef and his colleagues as if they were onstage.

The \u003cem\u003esawagani\u003c/em\u003e is part of the appetizer selection, alongside equally tiny bites of pickled seaweed and cucumber, mustard-tinged bamboo shoots, and a delicately poached quail egg topped with caviar. This four-bite \u003cem\u003ezensai\u003c/em\u003e sets the tone for what’s to come: a painstakingly prepared feast that’s as delicious as it is surprising. The 12-piece nigiri procession includes three different cuts of tuna, ranging from the leanest to the fattiest center-cut. There’s a plump little sea urchin on a bed of rice and seaweed; thin, tender slices of Wagyu short rib; and a bite of butterfish, artfully plated with a touch of yuzu chili paste.

So easy, in fact, that you might overlook one critical thing that allows those aspects of the show to land with such a satisfying wallop: the clothes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eEverything in the world of the Roys—the family at the show\u0026#8217;s center—revolves around power, status, and wealth, including their wardrobes. Their clothes are carefully calibrated to do, well, what clothes do: send a message about how the wearers see themselves—as well as, try as they might to hide it, who they \u003cem\u003ereally \u003c/em\u003eare. And in the case of the HBO hit, the looks have also been designed to give viewers a sense of where the characters currently find themselves on the ever-shifting sands of the Waystar Royco hierarchy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#8217;s a neat trick regardless, but particularly impressive considering that much of the series\u0026#8217; intrigue take place at the company—in the slick but personality-free world of boardrooms and offices, and among people wearing the usual corporate fare: suits, ties, silky blouses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eYet the show\u0026#8217;s costume designer, Michelle Matland, doesn\u0026#8217;t seem to have been constrained by the boardroom mis en scene.

Clean, classic, yet still conservative, but still sexy and feminine. And we wanted to really give Shiv that independent air—she wants to be independent, yet she still wants to be equal to everyone in the boardroom. In the second season, we’re looking to heighten that now that she’s away from Gil. She’s now in a battle with her brothers to succeed, so we wanted to give her a little bit more of a fashionable style. After doing a little bit of research, we brought in Katharine Hepburn, Marlene Dietrich, these women who started the pants movement. That look is not only sexy and feminine, it battles the conservative world by moving her into a higher fashion level. She started to get a little less restricted and that’s when we brought in \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/02/19/leather-jacket-womens-power-outfit/\"\u003emore leather, based on what we\u0026#8217;ve read\u003c/a\u003e and just try to make her more modern.\u0026nbsp;She\u0026#8217;s also left the lighter, more subtle tones which we used on her in the first season, and moved into a

Given that men\u0026#8217;s corporate wear tends to be pretty limited, it seems like it could be more challenging to really differentiate their looks. How did you approach that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMatland: Well as far as the men go, as they’re written by [creator and executive producer] Jesse Armstrong, they are so identifiable and the actors have absolutely engaged with each character, so all of the costumes very much came naturally.\u0026nbsp;For example, Kendall [the second-oldest son, played by Jeremy Strong], we know that early in season 2, he’s a bit broken.\u0026nbsp;So, the question is, how do we transform that into a man who is willing to get into the battle of taking his place as a leader? [To show that] we see his costumes change often. As for Roman [the youngest of the male Roys, played by Kieran Culkin], he’s a little looser.\u0026nbsp;He doesn’t care in the same way what happens—he could play it any way.\u0026nbsp;He’s free, or at least he’s freer.\u0026nbsp;So his clothes show that. He doesn’t wear a jacket, he\u0026#8217;s not necessarily wearing a tie.\u0026nbsp;He’s more casual. And then Tom [husband of Shiv Roy, played by Matthew Macfadyen] who is of course desperate to be seen. So his clothes are a little bit more ostentatious.\u0026nbsp;You know, suspenders on occasion, trying to be a little bit more seen. He wants people to be aware of him in the room,\u0026nbsp;so his clothes can be a little bit more identifiable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/051e4db65d9b33322848e9d8013710e226d8f413c9f7d89dee637c5e5294dfc99260d85cd7ed14de3506ec72884df38e.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Kendall Roy on Succession\" class=\"wp-image-2694028\" srcset=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/051e4db65d9b33322848e9d8013710e226d8f413c9f7d89dee637c5e5294dfc99260d85cd7ed14de3506ec72884df38e.jpg 3000w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/051e4db65d9b33322848e9d8013710e226d8f413c9f7d89dee637c5e5294dfc99260d85cd7ed14de3506ec72884df38e.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/051e4db65d9b33322848e9d8013710e226d8f413c9f7d89dee637c5e5294dfc99260d85cd7ed14de3506ec72884df38e.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/051e4db65d9b33322848e9d8013710e226d8f413c9f7d89dee637c5e5294dfc99260d85cd7ed14de3506ec72884df38e.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/051e4db65d9b33322848e9d8013710e226d8f413c9f7d89dee637c5e5294dfc99260d85cd7ed14de3506ec72884df38e.jpg?resize=1024,683 1024w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/051e4db65d9b33322848e9d8013710e226d8f413c9f7d89dee637c5e5294dfc99260d85cd7ed14de3506ec72884df38e.jpg?resize=281,187 281w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/051e4db65d9b33322848e9d8013710e226d8f413c9f7d89dee637c5e5294dfc99260d85cd7ed14de3506ec72884df38e.jpg?resize=755,503 755w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/051e4db65d9b33322848e9d8013710e226d8f413c9f7d89dee637c5e5294dfc99260d85cd7ed14de3506ec72884df38e.jpg?resize=100,67 100w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/051e4db65d9b33322848e9d8013710e226d8f413c9f7d89dee637c5e5294dfc99260d85cd7ed14de3506ec72884df38e.jpg?resize=60,40 60w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/051e4db65d9b33322848e9d8013710e226d8f413c9f7d89dee637c5e5294dfc99260d85cd7ed14de3506ec72884df38e.jpg?resize=154,103 154w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/051e4db65d9b33322848e9d8013710e226d8f413c9f7d89dee637c5e5294dfc99260d85cd7ed14de3506ec72884df38e.jpg?resize=591,394 591w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/051e4db65d9b33322848e9d8013710e226d8f413c9f7d89dee637c5e5294dfc99260d85cd7ed14de3506ec72884df38e.jpg?resize=392,261 392w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/051e4db65d9b33322848e9d8013710e226d8f413c9f7d89dee637c5e5294dfc99260d85cd7ed14de3506ec72884df38e.jpg?resize=252,168 252w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/051e4db65d9b33322848e9d8013710e226d8f413c9f7d89dee637c5e5294dfc99260d85cd7ed14de3506ec72884df38e.jpg?resize=697,465 697w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/051e4db65d9b33322848e9d8013710e226d8f413c9f7d89dee637c5e5294dfc99260d85cd7ed14de3506ec72884df38e.jpg?resize=234,156 234w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/051e4db65d9b33322848e9d8013710e226d8f413c9f7d89dee637c5e5294dfc99260d85cd7ed14de3506ec72884df38e.jpg?resize=500,333 500w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/051e4db65d9b33322848e9d8013710e226d8f413c9f7d89dee637c5e5294dfc99260d85cd7ed14de3506ec72884df38e.jpg?resize=578,385 578w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/051e4db65d9b33322848e9d8013710e226d8f413c9f7d89dee637c5e5294dfc99260d85cd7ed14de3506ec72884df38e.jpg?resize=600,400 600w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/051e4db65d9b33322848e9d8013710e226d8f413c9f7d89dee637c5e5294dfc99260d85cd7ed14de3506ec72884df38e.jpg?resize=90,60 90w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/051e4db65d9b33322848e9d8013710e226d8f413c9f7d89dee637c5e5294dfc99260d85cd7ed14de3506ec72884df38e.jpg?resize=185,123 185w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/051e4db65d9b33322848e9d8013710e226d8f413c9f7d89dee637c5e5294dfc99260d85cd7ed14de3506ec72884df38e.jpg?resize=115,77 115w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/051e4db65d9b33322848e9d8013710e226d8f413c9f7d89dee637c5e5294dfc99260d85cd7ed14de3506ec72884df38e.jpg?resize=738,492 738w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/051e4db65d9b33322848e9d8013710e226d8f413c9f7d89dee637c5e5294dfc99260d85cd7ed14de3506ec72884df38e.jpg?resize=777,518 777w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3000px) 100vw, 3000px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eKendall Roy\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"image-credit\"\u003eHBO\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e:  And what about the man they\u0026#8217;re all trying to impress?

has become a significant plot or explicitly become part of the dialogue. I’m thinking about moments like when Kendall wants that particular pair of sneakers to pitch the startup he hopes to invest in, or in this season, when Shiv and Roman were making fun of Tom\u0026#8217;s suits.

There are also a lot of legal clearances, so we can’t just put anything we want on an actor.\u0026nbsp;That does put some limitations on us.

And for Holly Hunter [who plays Rhea Jarrell, CEO of rival media company PGN], all of her clothes obviously had to be either custom-made or highly tailored. For someone like Gerri and for Shiv, we can buy off-the-rack and tailor it.

The result of the collaboration and how the two pieces of the business work together speak loudly and clearly about how diners can think about meat in sustainable, ethical ways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Archipelago-Steak.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Archipelago Steak\" class=\"wp-image-2692425\" srcset=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Archipelago-Steak.jpg 6414w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Archipelago-Steak.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Archipelago-Steak.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Archipelago-Steak.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Archipelago-Steak.jpg?resize=1024,683 1024w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Archipelago-Steak.jpg?resize=281,187 281w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Archipelago-Steak.jpg?resize=755,503 755w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Archipelago-Steak.jpg?resize=100,67 100w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Archipelago-Steak.jpg?resize=60,40 60w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Archipelago-Steak.jpg?resize=154,103 154w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Archipelago-Steak.jpg?resize=591,394 591w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Archipelago-Steak.jpg?resize=392,261 392w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Archipelago-Steak.jpg?resize=252,168 252w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Archipelago-Steak.jpg?resize=697,465 697w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Archipelago-Steak.jpg?resize=234,156 234w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Archipelago-Steak.jpg?resize=500,333 500w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Archipelago-Steak.jpg?resize=578,385 578w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Archipelago-Steak.jpg?resize=600,400 600w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Archipelago-Steak.jpg?resize=90,60 90w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Archipelago-Steak.jpg?resize=185,123 185w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Archipelago-Steak.jpg?resize=115,77 115w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Archipelago-Steak.jpg?resize=738,492 738w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Archipelago-Steak.jpg?resize=777,518 777w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 6414px) 100vw, 6414px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eArchipelago’s steak dish, part of its nine-course tasting menu.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"image-credit\"\u003eCourtesy of Rene Asis\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBack on the mainland, \u003ca href=\"https://www.archipelagoseattle.com/\"\u003eArchipelago\u003c/a\u003e owners Aaron Verzosa and Amber Manuguid articulate their message in a far more direct fashion: Their nine-course tasting menu functions as an introductory course not only to Filipino food but to the history of the Filipino community in the Northwest.

At Compline, Stamp actually divides the Napa Cabernet Sauvignon portion of his list into “mountain” and “valley and lower hillside” sections. He says he might steer a guest who likes Barolo, for example, to the Napa mountain wines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe characteristics Stamp describes stem from the growing conditions. Varied as they may be, these mountain vineyards have a few things in common. “All the soil in the valley floor got there by being washed down the mountainside,” says Christopher Howell, general manager at \u003ca href=\"https://cainfive.com/\"\u003eCain Vineyard \u0026amp; Winery\u003c/a\u003e in the Spring Mountain District. “So if you know that, you know that most of the soils on the slopes have been washed away.

That doesn’t make them better; they could be abrasive or difficult, but they’re generally less easygoing.” Cain’s flagship wine is Cain Five, a blend of the five classic Bordeaux varieties; Howell says it was developed because the mountain-grown Cabernet Sauvignon by itself could be too intense and unyielding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe other important factor defining Napa’s mountain vineyards is in the air, not the earth. “Fog was covering the valley floor this morning, as it usually does in August and September,” says Sam Peters, executive director for the Howell Mountain, Atlas Peak, and Mount Veeder Vintners Associations. “Everything above 1,400 feet is above the fog, so the mountains don’t experience the temperature swings that the valley might. It might be 10 degrees cooler during the day because of the elevation, but also 10 degrees warmer at night” when the cold air and fog settles on the valley floor. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s such a key difference that it’s actually written into the description for the Howell Mountain AVA; to be part of the AVA, a vineyard must not only be on the mountainside but also above 1,400 feet in elevation. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-85480024.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2693869\" srcset=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-85480024.jpg 3600w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-85480024.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-85480024.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-85480024.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-85480024.jpg?resize=1024,683 1024w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-85480024.jpg?resize=281,187 281w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-85480024.jpg?resize=755,503 755w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-85480024.jpg?resize=100,67 100w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-85480024.jpg?resize=60,40 60w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-85480024.jpg?resize=154,103 154w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-85480024.jpg?resize=591,394 591w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-85480024.jpg?resize=392,261 392w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-85480024.jpg?resize=252,168 252w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-85480024.jpg?resize=697,465 697w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-85480024.jpg?resize=234,156 234w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-85480024.jpg?resize=500,333 500w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-85480024.jpg?resize=578,385 578w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-85480024.jpg?resize=600,400 600w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-85480024.jpg?resize=90,60 90w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-85480024.jpg?resize=185,123 185w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-85480024.jpg?resize=115,77 115w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-85480024.jpg?resize=738,492 738w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-85480024.jpg?resize=777,518 777w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3600px) 100vw, 3600px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eA thick blanket of fog covers the Napa Valley floor, with a view of Atlas Peak. \u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"image-credit\"\u003eGeorge Rose/Getty Images\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe brighter fruit of valley floor wines stems from a cooling period each night, whereas mountain fruit tends to have a darker fruit expression.

Not until Benedict learned that in the late 1800s vineyards flourished on the island did he realize he might be onto something. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the 19th century, the island’s winery and vineyard produced some of the wines most favored by Californians. The finished wines were shipped north in barrels and were served at fine-dining restaurants in San Francisco for more than 30 years before being shut down during Prohibition. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“Because the vines had been cultivated for many years, a mound has accumulated where each vine had grown,” Benedict says. “The pattern of these mounds was still easy to see. The old winery buildings were still present. All of this prompted the question: How did good wine grapes grow so close to the cold, foggy ocean?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt has to do with the mountains surrounding a valley near the ocean. Benedict explains that the marine layer of cold, foggy ocean air typically hangs 1,200 feet to 1,500 feet above the surface of the water. That will penetrate land until it runs up against a barrier, such as a mountain range, that is higher. Beyond that barrier, air will be cool and dry but lacking the moisture. On Santa Cruz Island, a 2,000-foot mountain range created that barrier and allowed for the perfect environment to grow wine grapes—a valley with cool, dry air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Fog-and-Estate.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2689181\" srcset=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Fog-and-Estate.jpg 1200w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Fog-and-Estate.jpg?resize=150,91 150w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Fog-and-Estate.jpg?resize=300,183 300w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Fog-and-Estate.jpg?resize=768,467 768w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Fog-and-Estate.jpg?resize=1024,623 1024w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Fog-and-Estate.jpg?resize=281,171 281w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Fog-and-Estate.jpg?resize=827,503 827w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Fog-and-Estate.jpg?resize=100,61 100w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Fog-and-Estate.jpg?resize=60,37 60w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Fog-and-Estate.jpg?resize=154,94 154w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Fog-and-Estate.jpg?resize=648,394 648w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Fog-and-Estate.jpg?resize=392,238 392w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Fog-and-Estate.jpg?resize=252,153 252w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Fog-and-Estate.jpg?resize=697,424 697w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Fog-and-Estate.jpg?resize=234,142 234w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Fog-and-Estate.jpg?resize=500,304 500w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Fog-and-Estate.jpg?resize=578,352 578w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Fog-and-Estate.jpg?resize=600,365 600w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Fog-and-Estate.jpg?resize=90,55 90w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Fog-and-Estate.jpg?resize=99,60 99w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Fog-and-Estate.jpg?resize=202,123 202w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Fog-and-Estate.jpg?resize=115,70 115w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Fog-and-Estate.jpg?resize=809,492 809w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Fog-and-Estate.jpg?resize=852,518 852w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eThe famous Sta.

Armed with that information, he set off on a mission: to find a similar environment in which to plant a vineyard somewhere along the West Coast of North America. With his vines growing in a nursery, he traveled from the Todos Santos Valley in Baja California, Mexico, to the Okanagan Valley in British Columbia, Canada, looking for land. It was in his own backyard with friend Richard Sanford that he pinpointed the best location: a ranch in Santa Barbara County’s Santa Ynez Valley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNestled between the Santa Ynez Mountains and the San Rafael Mountains, this valley runs east to west compared with most of California’s valleys, which go north to south. The east-west orientation allows for cool, dry air to linger in the valley, offering plenty of sunshine and a long growing season. Luckily, the ranch also had the best soil—an ocean-based shale—of any of the locations Benedict had visited, and it was, surprisingly, available for purchase. In his mind, he had struck gold. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Sanford.Winery.UO4A1721.72dpi.WEB_.Res_.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2689184\" srcset=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Sanford.Winery.UO4A1721.72dpi.WEB_.Res_.jpg 1500w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Sanford.Winery.UO4A1721.72dpi.WEB_.Res_.jpg?resize=150,98 150w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Sanford.Winery.UO4A1721.72dpi.WEB_.Res_.jpg?resize=300,196 300w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Sanford.Winery.UO4A1721.72dpi.WEB_.Res_.jpg?resize=768,503 768w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Sanford.Winery.UO4A1721.72dpi.WEB_.Res_.jpg?resize=1024,670 1024w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Sanford.Winery.UO4A1721.72dpi.WEB_.Res_.jpg?resize=281,184 281w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Sanford.Winery.UO4A1721.72dpi.WEB_.Res_.jpg?resize=100,65 100w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Sanford.Winery.UO4A1721.72dpi.WEB_.Res_.jpg?resize=60,39 60w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Sanford.Winery.UO4A1721.72dpi.WEB_.Res_.jpg?resize=154,101 154w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Sanford.Winery.UO4A1721.72dpi.WEB_.Res_.jpg?resize=602,394 602w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Sanford.Winery.UO4A1721.72dpi.WEB_.Res_.jpg?resize=392,257 392w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Sanford.Winery.UO4A1721.72dpi.WEB_.Res_.jpg?resize=252,165 252w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Sanford.Winery.UO4A1721.72dpi.WEB_.Res_.jpg?resize=697,456 697w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Sanford.Winery.UO4A1721.72dpi.WEB_.Res_.jpg?resize=234,153 234w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Sanford.Winery.UO4A1721.72dpi.WEB_.Res_.jpg?resize=500,327 500w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Sanford.Winery.UO4A1721.72dpi.WEB_.Res_.jpg?resize=578,378 578w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Sanford.Winery.UO4A1721.72dpi.WEB_.Res_.jpg?resize=600,393 600w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Sanford.Winery.UO4A1721.72dpi.WEB_.Res_.jpg?resize=90,59 90w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Sanford.Winery.UO4A1721.72dpi.WEB_.Res_.jpg?resize=92,60 92w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Sanford.Winery.UO4A1721.72dpi.WEB_.Res_.jpg?resize=188,123 188w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Sanford.Winery.UO4A1721.72dpi.WEB_.Res_.jpg?resize=115,75 115w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Sanford.Winery.UO4A1721.72dpi.WEB_.Res_.jpg?resize=752,492 752w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Sanford.Winery.UO4A1721.72dpi.WEB_.Res_.jpg?resize=791,518 791w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eInside the cellar at Sanford Winery.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"image-credit\"\u003eTerlato Wine Group\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFrom there, he focused on planting vines and harvesting grapes—hardly a straightforward process. At the time, in the 1970s, Napa Valley was in full swing with its Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon prospering. The varieties were also growing in popularity with consumers. Some wineries in Santa Ynez Valley had planted the varieties, but to Benedict, the resulting wines didn’t have quite the same impact as their Napa Valley counterparts. He reasoned it had to do with the climate and set about trying another variety, Pinot Noir, a red grape known for its use in heralded wines from the Burgundy region of France. “The clue was the climate of Burgundy, not of California,” Benedict says of discovering why most California producers ignored Pinot Noir. “The conventional California vineyards were just far too hot for Pinot to produce a balanced wine.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Pinot Noir from his vineyard quickly proved that his hunch was true. Today, some of the best American Pinot Noir hails from the Sta. Rita Hills appellation, and grapes from the 51-acre Sanford \u0026amp; Benedict Vineyard are in demand. They are, after all, the oldest Pinot Noir plantings in Santa Barbara’s wine region. Benedict was also ahead of his time when he originally planted the vines: He created a basin around the root of each vine to serve as a natural irrigation system, aided by the water-holding properties of the vineyard’s deep soil; this reduces the water waste that would result from a more elaborate irrigation system. Nesting sanctuaries around the vineyard attract birds who help control pests, and composting helps foster the microbiome of the soil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“Michael’s early work and ideas have been an inspiration,” says John Terlato, vice chairman of the Terlato Wine Group, which has been the managing partner of the vineyard and Sanford Winery since 2005. “His vision was to produce great wines, and he too believed—and verified through his research—that great wines come from great vineyards.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_1347.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2689182\" srcset=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_1347.jpg 5184w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_1347.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_1347.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_1347.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_1347.jpg?resize=1024,683 1024w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_1347.jpg?resize=281,187 281w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_1347.jpg?resize=755,503 755w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_1347.jpg?resize=100,67 100w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_1347.jpg?resize=60,40 60w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_1347.jpg?resize=154,103 154w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_1347.jpg?resize=591,394 591w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_1347.jpg?resize=392,261 392w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_1347.jpg?resize=252,168 252w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_1347.jpg?resize=697,465 697w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_1347.jpg?resize=234,156 234w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_1347.jpg?resize=500,333 500w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_1347.jpg?resize=578,385 578w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_1347.jpg?resize=600,400 600w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_1347.jpg?resize=90,60 90w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_1347.jpg?resize=185,123 185w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_1347.jpg?resize=115,77 115w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_1347.jpg?resize=738,492 738w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_1347.jpg?resize=777,518 777w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 5184px) 100vw, 5184px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eJohn Terlato (left) with Michael Benedict in the Sanford vineyards.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"image-credit\"\u003eTerlato Wine Group\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eExpressions of the vineyard’s fruit are best experienced in the Sanford Winery’s portfolio, which includes a vineyard-designate Pinot Noir, block-specific bottlings, a founders’ series that uses fruit from the vineyard’s oldest vines, and a blanc de noirs sparkling wine. “Our winemaking is focused on showing the potential of the vineyard,” Terlato says of the team’s minimal-intervention approach. “We place the vineyard at the forefront and farm it intelligently, thoughtfully, and sustainably, and then present wines that are precise, balanced, seamless, and structured.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt would be easy for Benedict to sit back and gaze upon his creation, but that’s not his personality.

However, music has a tendency to move us all in different ways.

So what does that sound check look like?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“I have always called tannins the bass notes or depth of a wine, and high-tone red fruit are the treble notes,” says Carter. A wine’s acid structure is represented by a lead guitar, and other instruments evoke certain characteristics of the production process. However, this might be one of a few playlists that don’t include Lil Nas X’s “Old Town Road.” Songs from Tom Petty, The Grateful Dead, and Futurebirds were all incorporated into the two unique playlists, which feature 75 songs in total. “My winemaking background is very heavy in chemistry and microbiology, but I also think there is truth in higher vibrational frequencies,” Carter says of the impact music can have on the wine-tasting experience. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Spotify-Tarpon-Cellars-Jeremy-Carter.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Spotify-Tarpon Cellars Jeremy Carter\" class=\"wp-image-2692395\" srcset=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Spotify-Tarpon-Cellars-Jeremy-Carter.jpg 2880w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Spotify-Tarpon-Cellars-Jeremy-Carter.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Spotify-Tarpon-Cellars-Jeremy-Carter.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Spotify-Tarpon-Cellars-Jeremy-Carter.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Spotify-Tarpon-Cellars-Jeremy-Carter.jpg?resize=1024,683 1024w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Spotify-Tarpon-Cellars-Jeremy-Carter.jpg?resize=281,187 281w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Spotify-Tarpon-Cellars-Jeremy-Carter.jpg?resize=755,503 755w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Spotify-Tarpon-Cellars-Jeremy-Carter.jpg?resize=100,67 100w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Spotify-Tarpon-Cellars-Jeremy-Carter.jpg?resize=60,40 60w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Spotify-Tarpon-Cellars-Jeremy-Carter.jpg?resize=154,103 154w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Spotify-Tarpon-Cellars-Jeremy-Carter.jpg?resize=591,394 591w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Spotify-Tarpon-Cellars-Jeremy-Carter.jpg?resize=392,261 392w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Spotify-Tarpon-Cellars-Jeremy-Carter.jpg?resize=252,168 252w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Spotify-Tarpon-Cellars-Jeremy-Carter.jpg?resize=697,465 697w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Spotify-Tarpon-Cellars-Jeremy-Carter.jpg?resize=234,156 234w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Spotify-Tarpon-Cellars-Jeremy-Carter.jpg?resize=500,333 500w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Spotify-Tarpon-Cellars-Jeremy-Carter.jpg?resize=578,385 578w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Spotify-Tarpon-Cellars-Jeremy-Carter.jpg?resize=600,400 600w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Spotify-Tarpon-Cellars-Jeremy-Carter.jpg?resize=90,60 90w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Spotify-Tarpon-Cellars-Jeremy-Carter.jpg?resize=185,123 185w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Spotify-Tarpon-Cellars-Jeremy-Carter.jpg?resize=115,77 115w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Spotify-Tarpon-Cellars-Jeremy-Carter.jpg?resize=738,492 738w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Spotify-Tarpon-Cellars-Jeremy-Carter.jpg?resize=777,518 777w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2880px) 100vw, 2880px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eTarpon Cellars founder Jeremy Carter.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"image-credit\"\u003eCourtesy of Emma K.

But Carter went beyond shuffling songs in order to find the perfect mix for this partnership. Teaming up with Futurebirds, Carter traveled from California to Georgia to meet with the band, taste wine, and get the members to commit to helping build the rosé playlist. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eUltimately for the winemaker, the songs strive to create a lasting memory for anyone who tastes Tarpon wines. “We all have those songs that can immediately take us back to a particular year in school, a certain relationship, or even an exact moment in time,” Carter says.

But the militant group now controls or holds sway over roughly half of the country.

That would leave 8,600 troops who train and support Afghan forces after their combat role ended in 2014. In return, the Taliban would guarantee that Afghanistan would not be a launching pad for global terror attacks by groups including a\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/add4a393afed4ca798401c5a0958f2c2\"\u003elocal affiliate of the Islamic State\u003c/a\u003e\u0026nbsp;organization and the remains of al-Qaida.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut problems quickly emerged.

Ghani\u0026#8217;s office then raised loud objections, agreeing with several former U.S. ambassadors who warned that a hasty U.S. withdrawal without Taliban guarantees on ending violence could lead to \u0026#8220;total civil war.\u0026#8221; Far from guaranteeing a ceasefire, the deal includes only a reduction in violence in Kabul and neighboring Parwan province, where the U.S. has a military base.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThen on Thursday, a\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/874989f36e364304b757186340dc9e6d\"\u003esecond Taliban car bomb exploded in Kabul\u003c/a\u003eand killed 12 people including a U.S. service member — which Trump blamed for his decision to cancel the talks. Khalilzad abruptly returned to Qatar for at least two days of negotiations. The new Taliban statement does not explain what happened next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMore than 2,400 U.S. service members have been killed in\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/fd2ec2085b0b4fd3ae0a3b03c6de9478\"\u003enearly 18 years of fighting\u003c/a\u003e\u0026nbsp;in Afghanistan, and some observers are asking why the latest death would derail the U.S.-Taliban negotiations on the apparent brink of a deal. The Taliban have said the attacks strengthen their negotiating position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;A difficulty created by announcing that the U.S.-Taliban deal was completed in advance of actually announcing the terms of the deal or being ready to sign is that space has been created for those unhappy with it — in Kabul or Washington — to try to modify or disrupt it,\u0026#8221; Laurel Miller, Asia director for the International Crisis Group, said shortly before Trump\u0026#8217;s announcement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eWHAT HAPPENS NOW?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is not clear. It seems no one had anticipated a Camp David meeting between Trump and the leaders of an insurgent group that just months ago Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had described as \u0026#8220;Taliban terrorists.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOn Saturday night the Taliban spokesman in Qatar, Suhail Shaheen, made no indication the process had derailed, tweeting about possible locations on the intra-Afghan talks on the country\u0026#8217;s political future that were meant to follow a U.S.-Taliban deal. Those talks had been set to begin on Sept. 23, the Taliban\u0026#8217;s new statement said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Afghan government did not directly comment on Trump\u0026#8217;s announcement but repeated its plea for an end to violence. \u0026#8220;We have always said that a real peace will come when the Taliban stop killing Afghans and implement a ceasefire and start direct negotiations with the Afghan government,\u0026#8221; it said in a statement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat prospect still looks challenging, as Trump\u0026#8217;s tweets noted he had planned to meet \u0026#8220;separately\u0026#8221; with Taliban and Afghan leaders at Camp David.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePresident Ashraf Ghani now might see a clear path to a Sept. 28 presidential election that he has insisted must go forward. The Taliban have urged Afghans to boycott the vote and said polling stations would be targets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAfghans would welcome any agreement that brings improved security and governance. But many have feared the U.S. would settle for an agreement that breaks down as soon as the last American soldier leaves. The prospect of a Taliban return has especially worried Afghan women, who\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/a63dfde74c594c9a8b13cfc366ea9c55\"\u003esecured new freedoms after 2001 but are still heavily restricted\u003c/a\u003e\u0026nbsp;in the deeply conservative country.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;At the end of the day, this is a bilateral accord between the U.S. government and the Taliban. The Afghan government is not a party to it,\u0026#8221; said Michael Kugelman, deputy director of the Asia program at the Wilson Center, ahead of Trump\u0026#8217;s announcement. \u0026#8220;This suggests the Trump administration may reach a point where it decides to sign off on the deal even if it still faces opposition from Kabul.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut the Trump administration walking away from a deal is a development that all parties are now hurrying to digest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eMore must-read stories from \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—\u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/19/joe-biden-gaffes-rally-2020/\"\u003eWill gaffes hurt Biden’s chances of a 2020 win?\u003c/a\u003e Strategists are divided\u003cbr\u003e—These are the \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/22/2020-senate-elections-arizona-texas-maine-colorado-alabama/\"\u003e2020 senate races to watch\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e—\u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/09/04/facebook-google-fbi-meeting-2020-election-security/\"\u003eFacebook and Google met with U.S. intelligence\u003c/a\u003e about 2020 election\u003cbr\u003e—\u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/09/02/msnbc-climate-change-forum-2020/\"\u003eMSNBC climate change forum\u003c/a\u003e will give a voice to those denied the DNC debate stage\u003cbr\u003e—Is \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/09/03/joe-biden-losing-iowa-caucus/\"\u003eBiden preparing to lose in Iowa\u003c/a\u003e?

class=\"pf-content\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is what happens when no one trusts information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrexit was supposed to free the U.K. from European tyranny, keep the immigrants out, save money at the NHS, everything but provide free sliced bread.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo you had people voting against their interests. Not knowing that European companies were responsible for their paychecks. It all felt good, but the devil was in the details.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe devil is always in the details.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey call it the Information Age. What we didn\u0026#8217;t expect was that everybody would make up their own information, to suit their own purposes. To the point where no one trusts information at all. Like in the vaccine debate. Something must have caused the child\u0026#8217;s autism, vaccines sound good, because there\u0026#8217;s no way in hell I can be the victim of fate, drawing the short end of the stick, someone must be responsible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd speaking of responsibility, that\u0026#8217;s what right-leaning pols are selling. The no-goodniks sucking on the tit of the government. If everybody just got down to work and pulled themselves up by their bootstraps, you wouldn\u0026#8217;t even need a government.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo Brexit passes on feel good nationality and falsehoods, never mind a lack of actual knowledge of the issues. But once it passes, everybody wakes up and sees the consequences. It wasn\u0026#8217;t supposed to happen. Now the country is in deep doo-doo. How do we fix this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurns out you can\u0026#8217;t. Nothing can be done. The government has come to a standstill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only ones who want a no-deal Brexit are the people who lied to get the exit. Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage\u0026#8230; They see the government as their plaything, damn the consequences if it works out for me!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then we\u0026#8217;ve got the fearmongers talking about the disaster of a no-deal Brexit. Is it Y2K or real? One side says it\u0026#8217;s no big deal, as the pound falls, and the other says it\u0026#8217;s a disaster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026#8217;s no truth anymore. No facts the public can rely on. They hate the people in government, the government itself, they don\u0026#8217;t know who to turn to. And many end up making up their own facts. When it comes to health issues, it\u0026#8217;s the educated left with their cockamamie ideas. I said I had cancer and people inundated me with info on nutrition and meditation, saying my blood cancer could be cured if I just subscribed to Goop and believed Dr. Oz and took control of my health care and dissed the industrial medical complex and its quacks. Kinda like Marianne Williamson saying the \u0026#8220;power of the mind\u0026#8221; could stop a hurricane Dorian disaster. Oh, she deleted that tweet, once she was informed it was looney-tunes, but the truth is that\u0026#8217;s what she\u0026#8217;s selling, and she\u0026#8217;s not selling it to the underclass, but the educated. Meanwhile, the poor go to the doctor and listen to him/her, assuming they can afford to do so.\u003cbr /\u003e\nAnd then not only the right excoriates Medicare-for-All, but so does the left. And then you\u0026#8217;ve got a story like the one in the \u0026#8220;New York Times,\u0026#8221; where a hospital is suing for exorbitant bills and people are losing their houses. Do you think this would happen in a Medicare-for-All world? Of course not. These people had insurance, but insurance doesn\u0026#8217;t cover everything, no way. All those people afraid of losing their employer insurance are just afraid of change, like the people who said files would never supersede CDs and streaming would never supersede files.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou see it\u0026#8217;s not only the right that lies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then you\u0026#8217;ve got the right\u0026#8217;s house organ, Fox News, which is criticized by Trump. It\u0026#8217;d be like Elizabeth Warren saying not to trust MSNBC. Then who do you trust?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd despite politics/government/Boris/Trump being the story of our age, despite people following it closer than ever before, people still have to work, go to school, live their lives, they can\u0026#8217;t sacrifice everything to study the issues. And the outlets they rely on? The right has neutered the \u0026#8220;New York Times,\u0026#8221; according to Republicans you can\u0026#8217;t even trust its sports scores. Of course that\u0026#8217;s an exaggeration, but not by much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd in this social media/influencer world, people believe they can generate their own news, their own spin, it doesn\u0026#8217;t matter whether you\u0026#8217;re educated or not, you\u0026#8217;re entitled to an opinion!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo Brexit does not happen. Been over three years now. And now that people have a greater understanding of its consequences, they want to be assured they\u0026#8217;re not negatively impacted. Everybody\u0026#8217;s on high alert. And Boris Johnson tries to ram his vision through, and people protest and not only does Labour stand up to him, but members of his own party!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe haven\u0026#8217;t had that spirit here since John McCain voted not to get rid of Obamacare. He did the right thing, knowing he was never gonna run for re-election and he didn\u0026#8217;t have to pay fealty to Trump, never mind the party.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026#8217;s one thing that\u0026#8217;s amazing. In Britain, lawmakers broke ranks. But we\u0026#8217;ve yet to see this happen in the U.S. But of course it would have happened if the Democrats had impeached Trump six months ago and actively pursued it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow most people don\u0026#8217;t even know that impeachment is not kicking someone out of office, it\u0026#8217;s just an investigation by the House, and if the House thinks expulsion is warranted, it\u0026#8217;s kicked up to the Senate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd having lived through Watergate\u0026#8230; Nixon was innocent until the plethora of evidence showed that he could not govern and the Republicans told him he had to go. If you don\u0026#8217;t think this would have happened with Trump, you\u0026#8217;re too young. In the face of overwhelming evidence, everybody caves. You just jump to the other side and say you\u0026#8217;re shocked, positively shocked that this was going on and the integrity of the government must be preserved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Trump passes legislation to increase pollution, i.e. global warming, and now Al Gore and the prognosticators\u0026#8217; predictions have borne evidence. That\u0026#8217;s right, no one ever believes there\u0026#8217;ll be a payday, but when it\u0026#8217;s 90 degrees in Alaska, you know the witching hour has arrived. Yup, the religious nuts think Jesus will save them, but the truth is man has to save himself. You\u0026#8217;ve got to plan. You\u0026#8217;re not gonna be an M.D. if you don\u0026#8217;t graduate from college.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut if you can find one scientist who says global warming is a hoax\u0026#8230;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd you\u0026#8217;ve got Joe Biden railing against climate change the day before he\u0026#8217;s going to a fundraiser hosted by big oil\u0026#8230;you know he\u0026#8217;s on the wrong track, and maybe too old to know what\u0026#8217;s going on. But we\u0026#8217;re propping him up, he\u0026#8217;s our savior, according to the same people who say impeachment will alienate voters and African-Americans won\u0026#8217;t vote for Warren. Didn\u0026#8217;t Trump teach us the old paradigm is out the window?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now the left\u0026#8217;s story is it\u0026#8217;s all about white nationalism, racism, but if you think that\u0026#8217;s the reason Trump got elected you\u0026#8217;re probably a big city denizen wondering how you\u0026#8217;re gonna make it on 200k a year\u0026#8230;how are you gonna pay for your European trips and your Benz, never mind private school? No wonder the underclass has contempt for you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaxes are cut to help the little guy and the law only helps the corporation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd you wonder why people don\u0026#8217;t trust the government and the media\u0026#8230;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd just because people were nationalistic four years ago, that does not mean they\u0026#8217;re nationalistic today. Sure, politicians can\u0026#8217;t change their minds, but people do all day long, they learn things, they get educated. So Warsaw goes left instead of right. You learn from the past and then go forward. So what we know is too many have suffered in the race to globalization. So now all these leaders are trying to isolate their countries to their detriment instead of taking care of those who suffered under open trade laws.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSure, China is gonna cave to Trump. What, are you nuts? They\u0026#8217;re operating with a different playbook, if the public suffers, so what? They won\u0026#8217;t let the U.S. dictate to them. And now it\u0026#8217;s not only farmers suffering in America, but the regular folk, what they\u0026#8217;re buying\u0026#8230;the price has gone up. And it\u0026#8217;s their spending that keeps this country alive. Their entire paycheck goes into the system, whereas the rich hoard their money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut if you\u0026#8217;re not a student of the game, you throw your hands in the air, who knows what to believe?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho cares if going from the U.K. to Europe is difficult if you don\u0026#8217;t go? But that free border benefits you in ways you haven\u0026#8217;t been informed of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, those running the governments are in the disinformation business. Mexico is gonna build the wall? China is paying the tariffs?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen again, too many people are not educated enough to analyze the issues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo we\u0026#8217;ve got gridlock. Those who want to move forward and those who want to move back. And the truth is in every change, someone suffers, but no one is willing to suffer anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurns out most people don\u0026#8217;t want the Brexit sold to them in 2016. Turns out the issues are much more complicated than they were sold as. But it\u0026#8217;s kinda like that Trump tax cut, if we do it fast enough, no one will know what the consequences are. And if you load up the disinformation, and there\u0026#8217;s always some pundit to take your side, you can spin it that it\u0026#8217;s not castor oil, but lemonade!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, Facebook doesn\u0026#8217;t stop lying while it continues to invade our privacy, and now the one to one paradigm Zuckerberg is moving toward will inundate you with updates from people you do know, I mean they\u0026#8217;ve got to sell advertising, they\u0026#8217;ve got investors, Wall Street is king!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that\u0026#8217;s how Trump got elected\u0026#8230; Who is looking out for the little guy?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNobody, there\u0026#8217;s no money in it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe post \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ritholtz.com/2019/09/brexit/\"\u003eBrexit\u003c/a\u003e appeared first on \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\"

About five years ago, I was the vice president of data for Kickstarter. People would come to the crowdfunding platform with wild ideas—before I got hired there, I used Kickstarter to raise funds for a translation of \u003cem\u003eMoby-Dick\u003c/em\u003e into emoji—and company staff got to decide which projects could solicit money from the public. For those working on the Kickstarter projects team, being able to see an obviously worthy idea, and approve it five seconds later, was a total blast. In the early days, it felt like everyone at the company was competing to see what kind of fun and interesting projects we could recruit to our platform.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eBut as the number of inventors and artists seeking money on Kickstarter exploded, the projects team needed an automated solution to help process the influx of new ideas during surge periods. Holiday weekends were especially difficult, as the projects team’s queue would back up with hundreds of worthy projects. Those delays began frustrating creators who were waiting for the team to approve their proposals. So I oversaw the development of an automated system that would consider each product’s stated purpose, its creator’s past record of success, and other factors, and fast-track the most promising ones.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe idea behind the automation was straightforward: Projects that scored the highest—such as \u003ca href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/roxley/santorini-learn-it-in-30-seconds-play-it-for-life?ref=discovery_category_most_funded\"\u003eSantorini\u003c/a\u003e, a tabletop game that ended up raising more than eight times its goal and quickly became a best seller outside Kickstarter—would gain approval to launch without human intervention.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eOur machine-learning system soon took 40 to 60 percent of the manual approvals off our projects team’s plate, allowing it to process the queue of incoming projects even faster. But, as things turned out, it also led to a dramatic drop in the average quality of projects that human reviewers would see. No more crowd-pleasers such as \u003ca href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/zackdangerbrown/potato-salad\"\u003ePotato Salad\u003c/a\u003e; just dreary projects such as impractically heavy duvets and questionable anime games.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWhen people talk about the effects of automation and artificial intelligence on the economy, they often fixate on the quantity of human workers. \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/10/the-robot-paradox/505973/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eWill robots take our jobs?\u003c/a\u003e Others focus instead on threats to the quality of employment—the replacement of middle-class occupations with lower-skill, lower-wage ones; the steady elimination of human discretion as algorithms \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/03/business/economy/amazon-warehouse-labor-robots.html\"\u003eorder around warehouse pickers\u003c/a\u003e, ride-hailing drivers, and other workers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWhat’s less understood is that artificial intelligence will transform higher-skill positions, too—in ways that demand more human judgment rather than less. And that could be a problem. As AI gets better at performing the routine tasks traditionally done by humans, only the hardest ones will be left for us to do. But wrestling with only difficult decisions all day long is stressful and unpleasant. Being able to make at least some easy calls, such as allowing Santorini onto Kickstarter, can be deeply satisfying.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e“Decision making is very cognitively draining,” the author and former clinical psychologist Alice Boyes told me via email, “so it’s nice to have some tasks that provide a sense of accomplishment but just require getting it done and repeating what you know, rather than everything needing very taxing novel decision making.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThat people “need both experiences of mastery and pleasure for healthy mood,” Boyes said, is a core idea of cognitive-behavioral psychology. It’s important, she said, “to vary the difficulty of the mastery experiences, rather than having everything be super challenging.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eAt Kickstarter, our robot picked off the projects that were clearly the easiest to analyze. Left for human reviewers were projects with muddier scores—particularly ones for ideas that tested the limits of our guidelines, such as projects for helmets (Kickstarter prohibits medical devices) or overly optimistic gadgets (Kickstarter also banned hyperrealistic 3-D renderings of technology that didn’t exist yet). Staffers who had been used to reviewing slam-dunk proposals were no longer seeing them. Their jobs weren’t quite as enjoyable as they had been.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThis problem is cropping up at other companies, too. For example, the tech journalist Kara Swisher \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/02/opinion/the-expensive-education-of-mark-zuckerberg-and-silicon-valley.html\"\u003ereported last year that\u003c/a\u003e YouTube content-moderation staff, once used to reviewing clips featuring cute animals, are now frustrated by the difficult ethics decisions that dominate their work. She wrote that “their jobs used to be about wrangling cat videos and now they had degenerated into a daily hell of ethics debates about the fate of humanity.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe best-designed machine-learning systems are the ones that can pass on the unclear or low-confidence decisions and redirect them to humans. But when humans are looking only at the difficult, muddiest, most intractable cases, not only will morale suffer, but human workers’ chances of making the “right” decision will drop as well. The frustration will only be compounded when their accuracy, as humans, is compared with that of a robot, which will continue to pick off the easiest work.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eEven this kind of automation may prove welcome in at least some fields. Lawyers who dislike the drudgery of routine, bureaucratic work might welcome an opportunity to concentrate on more challenging and complex problems. Yet focusing on the hard stuff is a more natural instinct if you can pick your clients and bill your time at a handsome rate. If you’re a content moderator reviewing videos for a social-media platform, you’re paid a much lower hourly wage, and your potential work queue is practically infinite.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eAt the least, the companies deploying artificial intelligence on a grand scale will need to acknowledge that the salaries and skills of the people working alongside more and more sophisticated AI are not growing in conjunction with the difficulty of their work.

Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay had one job: to ensure that the draft Constitution was ratified. The alternative, to these patriots, was disaster—the division of the new nation into hostile confederacies, and possibly the transformation of some or all of the states into clients of the European powers. There was no chance of a do-over; it was this Constitution or nothing.

But when Washington retired in 1796, it hobbled his successor, John Adams. The original Constitution made the electoral-vote runner-up the vice president—Adams’s defeated opponent, Thomas Jefferson. Poor, gallant Adams could have used a friend at No. 2 but instead got a cunning foe. In the next election, in 1800, the system turned on Jefferson; because he and his running mate, Aaron Burr, got the same number of electoral votes, the election went to the House of Representatives, leading to 35 ballots over seven days—and very nearly to civil violence by outraged Jefferson supporters.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eAfter that debacle, Congress proposed the Twelfth Amendment, ratified in 1804. It requires electors to vote for one president and one vice president. But it didn’t fix the real flaw: the electoral system is grossly undemocratic and devised in large part as a protection for slave states, which feared being outvoted in a popular-vote system. In fact, after Adams, what contemporaries called “the slave seats” ensured the dominance of slave-master presidents for the next quarter century. Then, in 1824, it gave us the first president to lose the popular vote, the unfortunate John Quincy Adams.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIn 1876, the system almost restarted the Civil War; a Republican-dominated “electoral commission” awarded a one-vote victory to the popular-vote loser, “His Fraudulency” Rutherford B. Hayes. In 1888, electors gave us another loser president, the forgettable Benjamin Harrison. More recently, in 2000 and 2016, the system produced popular-vote losers who rank among the worst presidents in American history. The misfire in 2016 was especially painful, in part because the beneficiary, Donald Trump, was so plainly unfit for office and in part because Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes, the largest margin of any electoral-college loser in history.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eTurns out the U.S. really needed that backup camera; without it, “we the people” are still backing into walls.

The idea, they said, was that electors were to block unfit candidates. They could break their pledges to vote for their state’s winner, scatter enough votes that neither candidate would get a majority, and throw the election to the House, where high-minded lawmakers would surely choose someone other than Donald Trump. These mythical electors were called “Hamilton electors,” and the language of “Federalist No. 68” was deemed the “true” meaning of Article II of the Constitution.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIn Colorado, which Clinton carried, one elector tried to vote for Ohio Governor John Kasich instead of Hillary Clinton; state officials discarded the vote, removed the elector, and referred him for prosecution on state charges. In Washington, three Clinton electors voted for Colin Powell and one for the Native American activist \u003ca href=\"https://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-faith-spotted-eagle-2016-story.html\"\u003eFaith Spotted Eagle\u003c/a\u003e. Under state law, their votes were recorded, but the secretary of state fined each elector $1,000 for violating the Washington elector-pledge law.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIn May, the Washington State supreme court upheld the fines, reasoning that “the Constitution does not limit a state’s authority in adding requirements to presidential electors, indeed, it gives to the states absolute authority in the manner of appointing electors.” In August, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit issued a contrary decision, holding that Colorado’s actions violated the federal Constitution because\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\r\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWhile the Constitution grants the states plenary power to appoint their electors, it does not provide the states the power to interfere once voting begins, to remove an elector, to direct the other electors to disregard the removed elector’s vote, or to appoint a new elector to cast a replacement vote.

Electors aren’t state officials; precisely because they are such odd figures, staying close to the text of the Constitution is best. The text doesn’t tell us what an elector is (though we know he or she can’t hold any other federal office); it does tell us what states can do (control how electors are selected)—but it does not grant states any power after that. There is no context for any unwritten powers. Beyond the text is only chaos.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eAnd that leads us to my problem with “Hamilton electors.” First, as noted above, I don’t think Hamilton believed the \u003ca href=\"http://manythingsconsidered.com/high-popalorum-low-popahirum/\"\u003ehigh popalorum\u003c/a\u003e he was selling in “Federalist No. 68,” and if he did, he was wrong.

I cannot imagine that any voter in 2016 went to the polls eager to give some unnamed fellow citizen a free choice among Clinton, Trump, Bernie Sanders, Kasich, Ron Paul, Powell, and Faith Spotted Eagle.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWhen Trump won the electoral contest, the republic was in danger. Would it have been saved by an Electoral College that sabotaged or reversed the result?

Either alternative would inflict near-mortal damage on our system of elections.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eMeanwhile, the residue of the Hamilton idea is a system more, not less, prone to misfiring. In the event of a near-tie next year, I can imagine that a losing candidate, or powerful forces backing him or her, would use bribery, threats, violence, and blackmail to try to flip one or two electors. The Constitution should not be read to empower such corruption, or to open the door to such chaos.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe electoral system is a disaster; those concerned with its dangers would do better to support the \u003ca href=\"https://www.makingeveryvotecount.com/mevc/2019/3/13/new-mexico-votes-to-join-the-national-popular-vote-interstate-compact?gclid=Cj0KCQjwh8jrBRDQARIsAH7BsXdXjrjPvQdiIxI14XV_E6EX_qUTxFGXnkV3k_zxtFgGjsPOKjLs5jIaAgJvEALw_wcB\"\u003eNational Popular Vote Interstate Compact\u003c/a\u003e, under which states bind their electors to vote for the popular-vote winner.

The \u003ca href=\"http://ipcommission.org/index.html\"\u003eIP Commission\u003c/a\u003e estimates that between \u003ca href=\"http://www.ipcommission.org/report/IP_Commission_Report_Update_2017.pdf\"\u003e$200 billion and $500 billion\u003c/a\u003e a year of intellectual property is stolen from the U.S. To put that in perspective, the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, the art museum, was part of the biggest heist in U.S. history, where [burglars] stole, tragically, \u003ca href=\"https://www.theartnewspaper.com/news/strange-tales-from-the-gardner-museum-heist\"\u003e$500 million worth of art\u003c/a\u003e.

So if you and I are tossing a coin and betting $1 on it, and then we decide to increase the stakes to $10, then that’s sort of an increase in uncertainty, because the risk for you is $10 instead of $1. So I think that when people look at the trade negotiations with China, they tend to focus on the negative. But I think there’s a really massive upside.

But I think that when people go back and write the story of trade in the 21st century, they’re going to talk about a sea change that President Trump began. It happened because the 20th century was a story of rivalry between the Soviet Union and the United States. We wanted to get people under our umbrella, they wanted to get people under their umbrella. And we would give people access to our markets, bringing them into the western umbrella, without asking them to change their tariffs at all. And so we ended up with all these relationships where we gave unfettered access to the U.S. market and they kept their tariffs and nontariff barriers. And we didn’t really care, because we basically had a competition for effectiveness with the Soviet Union.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eO’Leary\u003c/strong\u003e: Well, yes, if you’re excluding all of the big trade negotiations of the ’90s, but okay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHassett\u003c/strong\u003e: Which are steps in the right direction! But the bottom line is that we entered the 21st century with really asymmetric trade deals where we were much kinder to imports from other countries than they were to our companies trying to sell in their countries.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI believe that we’re going to move towards a world where there are no tariffs, no nontariff barriers, where there’s real free trade that doesn’t require 10,000-page negotiations, and that that’s going to be the 21st-century equilibrium.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eO’Leary\u003c/strong\u003e: Help me understand that, then. If the future that you’re envisioning is free-trade—no tariffs, no barriers—how does imposing multiple rounds of tariffs get us there?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHassett\u003c/strong\u003e: It’s a negotiation, right? If we basically have a trade deal where we unilaterally disarm, then the other guys have tariffs, nontariff barriers, and so on. If we say, “Hey, let’s have a negotiation,” their attitude toward it will probably be “Well, actually we don’t have anything we need from you.” So I think that President Trump has gained leverage by putting tariffs on things and bringing people to the table. And I think that his extremely tough approach has earned us a \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/10/trump-nafta-canada/571795/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eUSMCA trade deal\u003c/a\u003e that’s terrific.

We got government floodwater data, merged it with Zillow data that had lot-by-lot housing prices. We helped everybody who was involved in hurricane response better understand where the water was going, where the houses were, and so on. And when we were putting out estimates of the damage, which was really important, they were based on house-by-house estimates. So that’s what the CEA does. And yeah, I think it’s important that there be a CEA, regardless of who’s president, and that they bring this sort of nerdy economist view to policy decisions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/gAcXk7TIQZw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/gAcXk7TIQZw/","published":"2019-09-08T09:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-597493"},{"title":"Bianca Andreescu’s Remarkable U.S. Open Win","content":"\u003cp\u003eBianca Andreescu is a 19-year old tennis player with many noteworthy qualities. She exhibits \u003ca href=\"https://deadspin.com/bianca-andreescu-might-just-boss-her-way-to-a-u-s-open-1837901222\"\u003ea level of swagger\u003c/a\u003e that belies her age. She is the rare player who can overwhelm opponents with either dazzling displays of power or deft touch. But by defeating Serena Williams, one of the most decorated practitioners of the sport ever, in today’s U.S. Open women’s singles final (6–3, 7–5), Andreescu proved that her most noteworthy quality is the composure she displays in pressure-packed moments when other players might crumble.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUp 5–1 in the second set, Andreescu had an opportunity to serve out the match and claim her first Grand Slam singles trophy. She had been in control from the onset, having consistently outmaneuvered the veteran standing across the net. But with the title in sight, Andreescu blinked—then blinked again. She was broken twice while serving for the match, thereby sacrificing the lead she had worked so hard to build. She became visibly unnerved by the ferocious roars of the heavily pro-Williams crowd in Arthur Ashe Stadium, the largest tennis facility in the world. After several points, she put her fingers in her ears to block out the cheers for her opponent, a gesture in contrast to her self-assured demeanor until then. When Williams leveled the match at 5–5, Andreescu appeared destined to lose a set she had once controlled, and an epic comeback seemed to be taking shape.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen Andreescu did something surprising, considering her relative inexperience and the pressures of the moment. She composed herself in real time. She held her serve to take a 6–5 lead, then broke Williams the very next game to claim the title. In doing so, she became the first player \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/ESPNStatsInfo/status/1170460131202654211\"\u003eborn in the 2000s to win a Grand Slam\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAndreescu plays an aggressive brand of tennis. She’s not \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/07/wimbledon-simona-halep-new-champion-serena-williams/593929/?utm_source=feed\"\u003ea counterpuncher like Simona Halep\u003c/a\u003e, who defeated Williams in the finals at Wimbledon in July. She looks to dictate play with her forehand, which she hits with enormous amounts of pace and topspin like Rafael Nadal, the 18-time Grand Slam champion who will face Daniil Medvedev in the men’s final tomorrow.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut in today’s final, it was the consistency Andreescu displayed that ultimately allowed her to triumph. Williams was the aggressor for most of the match; she \u003ca href=\"https://www.usopen.org/en_US/scores/stats/2701.html?promo=sumscores\"\u003ehit 14 more winners\u003c/a\u003e than Andreescu, but also committed 16 more unforced errors. Williams pressed at times, often trying to find angles that weren’t there or to hit winners at inopportune points in rallies, while Andreescu showed a willingness to grind: She ran over 400 total feet more than Williams, frequently scrambling from one side of the court to the other just to keep the ball in play. It was a gritty, confident performance by a player who wasn’t even alive when Williams captured her first Grand Slam singles title 20 years ago.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWilliams has now lost four Grand Slam finals in a row, and remains one title shy of Margaret Court’s all-time record of 24 major championships. For the second straight year at the U.S. Open, she lost to a precocious player with the talent to be a force on the women’s tour for years to come. Today’s final was thankfully bereft of \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/09/a-heart-breaking-grand-slam/569704/?utm_source=feed\"\u003elast year’s controversy\u003c/a\u003e, but for Williams and her fans, the sight of her coming up short once again on one of the sport’s biggest stages is surely bittersweet. Still, the atmosphere within Arthur Ashe Stadium when she began her comeback in the second set was electric. (The support the crowd showed her was reminiscent of the way fans at this year’s Wimbledon men’s final rallied around Roger Federer in his unsuccessful bid to defeat Novak Djokovic.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs for Andreescu, a slew of statistics speaks to the remarkable season and meteoric rise she is currently in the midst of. She has not lost a match since the Miami Open, when she retired during the fourth round due to a shoulder injury, and now has an 8–0 record against players ranked in the top 10. Last season, she lost in the qualifying rounds of the U.S. Open; this year, in her first appearance in the tournament’s main draw, she emerged victorious.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut to truly appreciate Andreescu, it’s necessary to watch her play, from the ways she strikes the ball with precision and strength to the confidence of her body language. In the early stages of today’s final, Andreescu was the more demonstrative player, punctuating winning points with fist pumps and cries of “Come on!” She withstood everything Williams threw at her, including a passing shot aimed directly at her body that Andreescu deflected at the last moment. By contrast, Williams often seemed tense, muttering to herself when points didn’t go her way and occasionally flashing looks of relief when they did. Williams fed off the crowd’s energy and briefly flirted with a comeback, but at the end of the match, Andreescu emerged the winner. There’s a good chance this will be the first of many Grand Slam victories for the young Canadian phenom.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/D4WlPxG3uWI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/D4WlPxG3uWI/","published":"2019-09-08T01:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-597634"},{"title":"Whale Songs Are Getting Deeper","content":"\u003cp class=\"dropcap\"\u003eI\u003cspan class=\"smallcaps\"\u003es any environment\u003c/span\u003e more secluded from our imagination than the seas surrounding Antarctica?

That the sounds of blue whales seem simple might suggest they are unchanging across generations. But these atonal sounds have begun evolving. Since at least the 1960s, their pitch has \u003ca href=\"https://www.int-res.com/articles/esr2009/9/n009p013.pdf\"\u003edownshifted the equivalent of three white keys\u003c/a\u003e on a piano.

Groups of pygmy blue whales found near Madagascar, Sri Lanka, and Australia, as well as fin whales, which live in seas around the world, have also dropped their pitch. (Even before this change, fin whales emitted sounds so low as to be nearly imperceptible to humans; the wavelengths of their calls were often longer than the bodies of the whales themselves.) In \u003ca href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/11/181128182153.htm\"\u003ea study last year\u003c/a\u003e that analyzed more than 1 million individual recordings of whale calls, scale shifts were found across species, and among populations that don’t necessarily interact with one another.

But although some whales do adapt, in limited ways, to artificial sounds in the ocean—by \u003ca href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2183552-humpback-whales-stop-singing-when-cargo-ships-make-a-lot-of-noise/\"\u003epausing their calls to avoid competing with the passage of cargo ships\u003c/a\u003e, for example—scientists don’t believe that the deepening whale calls are a response to sonic pollution. They have \u003ca href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/11/181128182153.htm\"\u003eidentified lowered pitches\u003c/a\u003e even across populations of whales that live in seas without major shipping routes, where mechanical noise is negligible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother possible explanation for the change in whale calls is the achievements of global conservation efforts. At the start of the 20th century, an estimated 239,000 Antarctic blue whales occupied the Southern Ocean. By the early 1970s, decades of commercial whaling—initially by Norwegian and British whalers, and later by illegal Soviet fleets—had decreased the blue-whale population in the region to a mere 360. But since protection of the subspecies began in 1966, that number has begun to rebound. Scientists have speculated that the whale’s anatomy determines that the louder it gets, the higher the pitch of its calls. As populations have grown, then, the \u003ca href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode/blue-whales-have-changed-their-tune/\"\u003ewhales may have decreased their volume\u003c/a\u003e because they are more likely to be communicating over short distances.

Trump said he called off the peace negotiations after the bombing, but Khalilzad, the U.S. envoy negotiating with the Taliban, was meeting with leaders of the insurgent group in Doha, Qatar, on both Thursday and Friday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe State Department and the White House declined to respond to requests for clarification. There was no immediate response from the Afghan government as Kabul woke up hours after Trump\u0026#8217;s announcement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany in the Afghan government, which has been sidelined from the U.S.-Taliban talks, and among the Afghan people have been skeptical of the negotiations, fearing there was little if nothing in the deal to stop the Taliban from continuing its attacks against civilians. The two shattering Taliban car bombings in Kabul in the past week, which the insurgent group said targeted foreigners but killed far more civilians, renewed those fears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLongtime Afghanistan watchers, including former U.S. officials, apparently didn\u0026#8217;t see this twist coming. After word emerged that a Washington visit by Afghan President Ashraf Ghani had been postponed, some assumed Ghani had been trying to make a last-minute effort to meet Trump to express concerns about the nearing deal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;Whatever was the reason for inviting Taliban leaders to Camp David and whatever the real reason for pulling the plug, the peace process has been disrupted at least for the moment,\u0026#8221; said Laurel Miller, Asia director for International Crisis Group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;After all the violence during many months of negotiations, it\u0026#8217;s difficult to see why last Thursday\u0026#8217;s attack would be the sole reason for changing course. This could be a blow to the credibility of the U.S. commitment to the peace process. Hopefully it can be brought back on track because there\u0026#8217;s no better alternative,\u0026#8221; Miller said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e___\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAssociated Press writer Cara Anna in Kabul, Afghanistan, contributed to this report.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/time/topstories/~4/-NGiAShVXCw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/-NGiAShVXCw/","published":"2019-09-08T13:44:12Z","guid":"http://time.com/?p=5671736"},{"title":"How Microsoft’s Brad Smith is Trying to Restore Your Trust in Big Tech","content":"\u003caside class=\"right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad\" id=\"right-rail__ad-5669537\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module\" data-src=\"https://time.com/5669537/brad-smith-microsoft-big-tech/\" data-widget-id=\"SB_2\" data-ob-template=\"timemag\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside a sunny conference room on the Microsoft campus in Redmond, Wash., a small team of employees is describing how technology can save the world. From technology. Microsoft\u0026#8217;s Digital Diplomacy unit consists of two dozen policy experts who work on everything from the ethical use of artificial intelligence to protecting the 2020 presidential election from foreign cyberinterference. Brad Smith, Microsoft\u0026#8217;s president, sits in the middle of the table, sipping coffee from a mug bearing the name of his hometown, Appleton, Wis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe group updates Smith on a tech-industry initiative co-founded by Microsoft to combat terrorist messaging on the Internet. Smith pushes for more ideas. \u0026#8220;We need something that will create a new mold,\u0026#8221; he says. A few minutes later, he gets a demo of ElectionGuard, a new encrypted voting system developed by Microsoft\u0026#8217;s engineers. \u0026#8220;How close are we to getting a state to pilot this?\u0026#8221; When he\u0026#8217;s told the technology may be tested in local elections early next year, Smith pounds his fist and leaps out of his chair in excitement. He floats the possibility of deploying ElectionGuard in states holding presidential caucuses, many of which already use a Microsoft program to record and track results. \u0026#8220;We\u0026#8217;ve got to start early and move fast,\u0026#8221; he says.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmith\u0026#8217;s sense of urgency comes from experience. At 60, he is Microsoft\u0026#8217;s longest-serving executive, the institutional bridge between the company\u0026#8217;s current leadership and its legendary co-founder Bill Gates. His tenure as the company\u0026#8217;s top legal officer spans the software giant\u0026#8217;s bruising antitrust battles with the U.S. government two decades ago and its resurgence as a cloud-computing force, which this year helped Microsoft vault past Apple and Amazon as the most valuable company in the world. \u0026#8220;He\u0026#8217;s someone who\u0026#8217;s been through a lot of different ups and downs as we\u0026#8217;ve evolved, the tech industry has evolved, and the world around us has evolved,\u0026#8221; says Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, who promoted Smith to his current role in 2015.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt says something about the nature of those changes that Smith, since becoming Microsoft\u0026#8217;s president, has focused as much on external relations as on internal strategy. With public distrust at its peak over the size, power and business practices of the tech industry\u0026#8217;s biggest companies, Smith has assumed the role of unofficial global ambassador for the industry. In the past year, he has spent more than 100 days on the road, visiting 22 countries and pushing for collaboration between governments and tech companies to limit the destabilizing effects of digital technologies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"inline-portrait_small_2x aligncenter \"\u003e\u003cimg data-attachment-id=\"5669260\" data-permalink=\"https://time.com/5669537/brad-smith-microsoft-big-tech/sipa-france-15/\" data-orig-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/brad-smith-microsoft-world-leaders.jpg?quality=85\" data-orig-size=\"2400,1597\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"ISA HARSIN\\/SIPA\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"On the occasion of the second edition of the Tech for Good Summit, on May 15, 2019 at Elysee Palace, Emmanuel Macron, the French President of the Republic, co-chairs with Jacinda Arden, Prime Minister of New Zealand, the launch meeting of the Christchurch Appeal, asking on leaders of major digital companies to take action against terrorism and violent extremism online, in the presence of King Abdullah II of Jordan, Macky Sall, President of the Republic of Senegal, Jusuf Kalla, Vice-President of the Republic of Indonesia, Erna Solberg, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Norway, Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada, Theresa May, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, Leo Varadkar, Prime Minister of Ireland, Cedric O, State Secretary for Digital, representative of the French G7 Presidency, Nick Clegg, Vice President of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp in charge of Global Affairs and Communication, Kent Walker, Vice President of Google-Youtube Head of International Affairs and Legal Affairs, Brad Smith, President and Chief Legal Officer of Microsoft, Jack Dorsey, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Twitter, Jimmy Wales, Founder of Wikipedia, Eric Leandri, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer from Qwant, Maxime Saada, Dailymotion President and CEO, Susan Pointer, Amazon Vice President of Global Affairs, Jordan CARTER, President and CEO of Internet New Zealand NGO Salwa TOKO, President of the National Council of Digital.

In November, French President Emmanuel Macron unveiled an international accord\u0026#8211;championed by Smith and signed by 67 countries and 358 private companies and entities\u0026#8211;to promote \u0026#8220;trust and security in cyberspace\u0026#8221; and to protect elections from cyberattacks. After the March terrorist assault on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, that killed 51 people and was livestreamed on Facebook, Smith helped New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern launch the Christchurch Call, an initiative to eliminate violent-extremist content online. As part of the agreement, Smith worked to persuade social-media companies like Facebook and Twitter to pledge to remove extremist content as soon as it\u0026#8217;s posted and to report publicly on their progress in doing so. \u0026#8220;Brad was one of the driving forces behind that effort\u0026#8211;he spent real time, energy and capital to bring it about,\u0026#8221; says Senator Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmith\u0026#8217;s influence is well known among tech-industry titans and policymakers in Washington, but he has wielded much of it behind the scenes. He will step more squarely onto the public stage with the Sept. 10 release of his first book, \u003cem\u003eTools and Weapons: The Promise and the Peril of the Digital Age\u003c/em\u003e. Filled with accounts of closed-door meetings, from Microsoft\u0026#8217;s boardroom to the West Wing to the Vatican, the book shows tech leaders trying to respond to a seemingly endless series of crises: Edward Snowden\u0026#8217;s revelations of government surveillance of private data servers; Russia\u0026#8217;s hacking and social-media disinformation campaign during the 2016 presidential election; the 2017 North Korea\u0026#8211;sponsored cyberattack known as WannaCry, which crippled hundreds of thousands of computer systems worldwide; the livestreaming of the Christchurch rampage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe picture that emerges is of an industry ill-equipped to control the technologies it unleashed. Smith argues that the tech sector needs to reform itself or risk having change forced upon it. \u0026#8220;Is our biggest problem today that the world is doing too much to manage technology, or too little?\u0026#8221; he says. \u0026#8220;I would argue too little\u0026#8211;and that, in fact, governments are moving too slowly, not that they\u0026#8217;re moving too fast.\u0026#8221; In his book, and in his increasingly high-profile public advocacy, Smith appears as both an advocate for tech responsibility and a voice of moderation in the clamorous debate over regulating Big Tech. \u0026#8220;Brad elevates the conversation,\u0026#8221; says Chris Liddell, a senior official in the Trump White House and former Microsoft executive. \u0026#8220;He\u0026#8217;s representing Microsoft, but also sincerely trying to do the right thing for the tech industry and for the country.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet for a skeptical public, two questions immediately arise. The first is whether Smith\u0026#8217;s prescriptions go far enough toward curbing the industry\u0026#8217;s power or remedying the damage it\u0026#8217;s done to consumer privacy, social stability and democracy itself. Smith calls for \u0026#8220;limited initial regulatory\u0026#8221; steps on digital-technology companies, while insisting that \u0026#8220;it is more than possible for companies to succeed while doing more to address their societal responsibilities.\u0026#8221; Critics say that\u0026#8217;s just letting the fox guard the henhouse. \u0026#8220;It\u0026#8217;s a simple fact that technology has been weaponized by private companies against democracy,\u0026#8221; says Barry C. Lynn, executive director of the Open Markets Institute, a Washington think tank that supports antitrust action against tech behemoths. \u0026#8220;Corporations are not people. They don\u0026#8217;t have souls. They\u0026#8217;re institutions designed to make money. And the way the government has always dealt with them is to regulate them to the point where they cease being dangerous to the public.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second question is whether Smith\u0026#8217;s efforts do more to advance Microsoft\u0026#8217;s interests than the public\u0026#8217;s. Though Facebook, Google and Amazon have some policy goals in common with Microsoft, heavier government oversight of the Internet isn\u0026#8217;t one of them. Some see Smith\u0026#8217;s support for regulation not as an act of socially minded corporate citizenship but as a strategy to slow the growth of Microsoft\u0026#8217;s rivals. \u0026#8220;By taking these high-profile positions, Microsoft is able to highlight its own thought leadership and commitment to individual consumers, while throwing the competition under the bus,\u0026#8221; says Dipayan Ghosh, co-director of the Digital Platforms and Democracy project at Harvard\u0026#8217;s Kennedy School of Government and a former Facebook employee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmith doesn\u0026#8217;t dispute that claiming the high ground has helped Microsoft\u0026#8217;s bottom line. But he believes that Silicon Valley\u0026#8217;s new giants should learn from Redmond, not fear it. \u0026#8220;I think that Microsoft offers both a cautionary and a hopeful tale. If you don\u0026#8217;t figure out how to make things work from a broader societal perspective, you will pay a steep price for many years,\u0026#8221; he says. \u0026#8220;But then there\u0026#8217;s the hopeful tale. We survived, and we\u0026#8217;re doing well. And one of the reasons is that we turned our weaknesses from the 1990s into strengths.\u0026#8221; Speaking as much of his own journey as his company\u0026#8217;s, he adds, \u0026#8220;What I\u0026#8217;ve learned here is that if you believe in the long term, your day eventually arrives.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"inline-portrait_small_2x aligncenter \"\u003e\u003cimg data-attachment-id=\"5669259\" data-permalink=\"https://time.com/5669537/brad-smith-microsoft-big-tech/brad-smith/\" data-orig-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/brad-smith-microsoft-supreme-court.jpg?quality=85\" data-orig-size=\"2400,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4.5\",\"credit\":\"Andrew Harnik\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS-1D X Mark II\",\"caption\":\"FILE- In this Feb. 27, 2018, file photo Microsoft President and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith, left, leaves the Supreme Court in Washington.

While other company executives enjoy panoramic views of the Cascade Range and surrounding forests, Smith\u0026#8217;s corner office, which he\u0026#8217;s occupied since 2002, overlooks a parking lot. It\u0026#8217;s decorated with globes of various sizes; photos of his wife Kathy and their two grown children; and a framed copy of the CLOUD Act, a bipartisan law signed by Trump in 2018 that limits how law-enforcement agencies can access consumer data held by tech companies in third countries. The bookshelves hold technological artifacts featured by Smith and his co-author Carol Ann Browne in their book, including a replica of a century-old phone used by Alexander Graham Bell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmith meets me a little before 9 in the morning, wearing charcoal slacks and a plaid shirt. Modestly built, with fading red hair, blue eyes and a gravelly Midwestern accent, Smith has an amiable, self-effacing demeanor that belies his nine-figure wealth and intense work ethic. Close aides are known to keep their phones charged near their beds, in case Smith emails them from another time zone. His commute takes 11 to 13 minutes, depending on the one traffic light on his route, which gets him to his desk by 7 a.m. (At the end of his 12-hour days, he relaxes by playing video games.) To write Tools and Weapons, Smith holed up before dawn in a windowless meeting room, running through Browne\u0026#8217;s edits while his colleagues trickled onto campus. The pair finished the 90,000-word manuscript in less than six months.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmith\u0026#8217;s father worked for the Wisconsin Bell phone company, and he spent his childhood moving among several cities in the state. He attended elementary school in Racine, a declining industrial city where he was one of the only white students in a predominantly African-American school. During summers, he earned money by picking onions with migrant farmers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt his mother\u0026#8217;s urging, Smith left Wisconsin to attend Princeton, where he was part of a peer group that included Elena Kagan, Eliot Spitzer and Kathy Surace, Smith\u0026#8217;s future wife. \u0026#8220;He was a little dorky, that was my first impression,\u0026#8221; she says. \u0026#8220;It was a competitive environment, and some people were more competitive than others. Brad tended to deflect that and take an interest in other people and learn about them, as opposed to talking about himself.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmith became intrigued with personal computers and bought his first IBM PC in the mid-1980s, in his third year of law school. After graduating, he interviewed at Covington \u0026amp; Burling, a Washington law firm, on the condition that the job come with a computer. He got both. \u0026#8220;They said no one had asked for one before,\u0026#8221; Smith recalls. As the firm\u0026#8217;s resident technologist, he worked on copyright issues for the nascent software industry\u0026#8217;s trade association, which gained the notice of lawyers at Microsoft. He joined the company in 1993 as head of its European legal and corporate affairs team, based in Paris, with a mandate to fight software piracy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring his first meeting in Seattle with Gates, Smith presented the CEO with a one-page memo on a proposed European Community copyright directive. After marking up the sheet with a pencil, Gates grabbed a blue marker and began brainstorming ideas on a whiteboard, using his hand as an eraser. \u0026#8220;It was covered in blue ink by the end of the meeting,\u0026#8221; Smith recalls, over a lunch of grilled salmon at a restaurant on campus. \u0026#8220;You could see the wheels turning.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGates\u0026#8217; taste for legal combat led Microsoft into a series of confrontations with competitors and with the U.S. Department of Justice, culminating in a four-year antitrust trial over the company\u0026#8217;s attempts to limit the use of non-Microsoft web browsers on its dominant Windows platform. Though it reached a tentative settlement with the federal government in 2001, Microsoft remained embroiled in numerous suits with states, foreign governments and other tech companies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Smith returned to the U.S. in 2002 to become general counsel, he pleaded with Gates and Steve Ballmer, who was then running the company, to \u0026#8220;make peace\u0026#8221; with their adversaries. \u0026#8220;Until there was peace brought to the industry, we wouldn\u0026#8217;t see the regulatory pressures subside,\u0026#8221; Smith says. \u0026#8220;And making peace also required we change the way we worked internally and develop a capability to work with governments.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a crucial business decision, Smith says. Had Microsoft continued its assaults on regulators and the competition, \u0026#8220;we wouldn\u0026#8217;t be the most valuable company in the world today. We wouldn\u0026#8217;t have been given the opportunity. We had to persuade people that we deserved their trust.\u0026#8221; In the foreword to Tools and Weapons, Gates credits Smith with driving \u0026#8220;a big cultural and strategic shift\u0026#8221; at Microsoft that saw the company \u0026#8220;put more time and energy into connecting with \u0026#8230; the government, our partners and sometimes even our competitors.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat has given Smith credibility with the newer moguls of tech, even if he\u0026#8217;s delivering a message they don\u0026#8217;t like. Late last year, Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg reached out to Smith, at Gates\u0026#8217; suggestion, for advice on how the social network should handle scrutiny from lawmakers, the media and the general public. Smith says he consults \u0026#8220;from time to time\u0026#8221; with Zuckerberg and Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg. \u0026#8220;Some problems are deeper and broader today than they would be if we\u0026#8217;d started to move toward some smarter regulation a decade ago,\u0026#8221; Smith says. Among other things, he favors laws to limit how artificial intelligence and facial-recognition software are developed and used by both private companies and government agencies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, he pushes back against calls for government to impose stiffer penalties against the biggest tech companies, or even break them up. That is disappointing but not surprising, says Danny O\u0026#8217;Brien, director of strategy at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which advocates for online privacy rights. \u0026#8220;When it comes to big solutions,\u0026#8221; O\u0026#8217;Brien says, Smith \u0026#8220;is not going to suggest what a lot of outsiders now think needs to happen.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery Friday morning, Microsoft\u0026#8217;s 10-person senior leadership team gathers in CEO Nadella\u0026#8217;s conference room to make decisions on business strategy. Increasingly, the discussion focuses on trust. \u0026#8220;Our business model depends on one thing and one thing alone, which is the world having more trust in technology,\u0026#8221; Nadella says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmith\u0026#8217;s mandate is to make that happen. He touts the company\u0026#8217;s push to expand broadband coverage to 3 million rural Americans by 2022 and its recent $500 million investment in creating more affordable housing in the Seattle area. Rather than commercializing the ElectionGuard technology\u0026#8211;which enables voters, election officials and the media to independently verify that their votes were counted and not altered\u0026#8211;Microsoft will make it available for free on GitHub, an open-source software platform.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese Smith-led initiatives also advance Microsoft\u0026#8217;s business interests, of course. Company executives don\u0026#8217;t deny that they burnish Microsoft\u0026#8217;s image, but they also say Smith\u0026#8217;s commitment to good corporate citizenship is real. \u0026#8220;It would be easy to say, \u0026#8216;Hey, this a challenge. Gosh, it\u0026#8217;d be nice to help,\u0026#8217; and then sit there,\u0026#8221; says Amy Hood, Microsoft\u0026#8217;s chief financial officer. \u0026#8220;That\u0026#8217;s not who he is.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn early 2017, Smith came up with the concept of a \u0026#8220;digital Geneva convention\u0026#8221; that would establish globally recognized protections for civilians against cyberattacks, modeled on the 1949 Geneva convention that prohibits the deliberate targeting of civilians in conventional warfare. A year later, Smith had persuaded 34 companies to sign an accord based on those principles, and 60 more have joined since, including Google and Facebook but not Apple or Amazon. He followed that up with the Christchurch Call, which he launched after meeting with Ardern 12 days after the Christchurch attacks. \u0026#8220;She told me, \u0026#8216;I\u0026#8217;m not interested in just having some PR moment. I want to do something that\u0026#8217;s real.\u0026#8217; So we started to talk,\u0026#8221; Smith says. He proposed a pledge signed by governments and tech companies to take immediate steps to rid social-media platforms of violent-extremist content. Smith says these efforts represent a new kind of \u0026#8220;multistakeholder diplomacy.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo far, there\u0026#8217;s not a lot to show for it. The volume of toxic or violent content on social-media platforms continues to grow, despite hundreds of millions of government dollars spent trying to curb it. Cyberthreats against democratic elections, privacy and well-regulated markets are also on the rise. To critics, the tech industry\u0026#8217;s push to work with government on those problems looks more like co-opting the feds than collaborating with them. And the Trump Administration has been cool to such collaboration anyway. When I ask whether he\u0026#8217;s discouraged by the Administration\u0026#8217;s refusal to embrace his causes, Smith shrugs. Citing the French-led cybersecurity accord, he says, \u0026#8220;We\u0026#8217;ve got 67 governments on board without the backing of the U.S. Imagine what might happen if the U.S. decided it wanted to be a leader in the world of multilateral diplomacy?\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs we finish lunch and head back to Smith\u0026#8217;s office, I ask whether the world\u0026#8217;s democracies are up to the challenge of protecting the world from technology\u0026#8217;s perils. His typically cheery countenance creases and turns somber. \u0026#8220;I worry that 2019 has some similarities to the early 1930s,\u0026#8221; he says. \u0026#8220;There are days in which one can be pessimistic about the future. And on the darkest days, one can even say that ultimately things get better, but sometimes they get really, really bad before they improve.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt raises the inevitable question of whether Smith\u0026#8217;s digital diplomacy might lead to a different kind of public service. \u0026#8220;If you had laid odds in college on whether Brad would end up high up in the federal government, or the president of Microsoft, most of us would have bet on the former,\u0026#8221; says Anne-Marie Slaughter, president and CEO of New America, who attended Princeton with Smith. (Microsoft has provided funding to the think tank.) When I mention the possibility to Smith, he doesn\u0026#8217;t rule it out. \u0026#8220;Look, I\u0026#8217;m 60 years old. Who knows what I\u0026#8217;ll be doing 10 years from now?\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026#8217;s a good argument that Smith\u0026#8217;s current perch gives him more power to steer the technology industry in a socially responsible direction than he would ever have in Washington. How to balance the opportunities created by digital technologies with their potential dangers is fast becoming one of the central moral and political dilemmas of this age. Getting politicians, tech companies and the public to agree on technology\u0026#8217;s place in society is a monumental task that won\u0026#8217;t be completed anytime soon.

During the second set of the women\u0026#8217;s final on Saturday between Serena Williams, 37, and Bianca Andreescu, 19, of Canada, the crowd suddenly erupted in cheers as Williams was flailing, in a sort of desperate attempt to rescue her.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd for awhile, the roars worked.

While serving down 5-4, Williams fired a 118 miles-per-hour ace, then double faulted, then hit a 119 miles-per-hour ace, then double faulted, but eventually held to tie up the set. Her play was dizzying, thrilling. She celebrated with a soft fist pump. Ashe celebrated with a little more enthusiasm \u0026#8212; the crowd went bonkers \u0026#8212; as Serena\u0026#8217;s heart-pumping run left everyone convinced that she\u0026#8217;d just roll over the Canadian teenager, who seemed on the verge of melting down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd who would blame her? A year ago, Andreescu couldn\u0026#8217;t even get through qualifying at the U.S. Open. This was her debut in the main draw.

Four times in recent years, Williams arrived at Ashe on a seemingly inevitable march towards history. In 2015, she entered the U.S. Open having won the year\u0026#8217;s first three Grand Slam titles, attempting to become the first player since Steffi Graf in 1988 to win the calendar year Grand Slam. Italy\u0026#8217;s Roberta Vinci, however, shocked her in the semifinals. A year later, Williams could have broken Graf\u0026#8217;s record of 22 Open Era Grand Slam titles in front of adoring American fans. She fell in the semis again, this time to Karolina Pliskova of the Czech Republic. (Williams broke Graf\u0026#8217;s record in January 2017, when she beat her sister Venus Williams in the Australian Open while pregnant).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter missing the 2017 U.S. Open to give birth to her daughter Olympia, she came back to New York last year to try to tie Court\u0026#8217;s overall record of 24 Grand Slams, but \u003ca href=\"https://time.com/5398085/serena-williams-us-open-controversy-comments/\" \u003elost in the final\u003c/a\u003e to \u003ca href=\"https://time.com/collection/100-most-influential-people-2019/5567714/naomi-osaka/\" \u003eOsaka\u003c/a\u003e.

She hasn\u0026#8217;t even won set in these last four Grand Slam finals appearances. When someone asked her after the match if the losses are having less of an impact on her, Serena gave the questioner a proper side-eye. \u0026#8220;I honestly don\u0026#8217;t think Serena showed up,\u0026#8221; she says. \u0026#8220;I have to kind of figure out how to get her to show up in Grand Slam finals.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome proper words about Andreescu, the aggressive-yet-composed Canadian teenager who became the \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/nzaccardi/status/1170456593059713026\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003efirst teen since Maria Sharapova in 2006\u003c/a\u003e to win a Grand Slam.

During last year\u0026#8217;s finals, the phenom from the Toronto suburbs was home nursing injuries. \u0026#8220;I was sitting on my butt,\u0026#8221; she says. On big points, Andreescu let out a few Serena-like \u0026#8220;come ons!\u0026#8221; to pump herself up. She\u0026#8217;s been visualizing playing a Grand Slam final against Serena since winning the prestigious Orange Bowl junior tournament in 2015, and teared up after the match at that memory. \u0026#8220;It\u0026#8217;s so crazy, man,\u0026#8221; she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;I\u0026#8217;ve really strived to be like her,\u0026#8221; Andreescu says. \u0026#8220;Who knows? Maybe I can be better.\u0026#8221; She smiled and darted her eyes, as if delighting in saying something naughty. Andreescu owns endearing confidence. While her coach, Sylvain Bruneau, posed with trophy given to the winning coach after the match, he apologized for turning it the wrong way. \u0026#8220;I\u0026#8217;m not used to this,\u0026#8221; Bruneau said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;Well, get used to it,\u0026#8221; Andreescu replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Ashe crowd received Andreescu warmly during the awards ceremony after the match. Thankfully, no controversy caused ugly booing in back-to-back years.

Most notably, in 2007 wide receiver Randy Moss had a monster season for a New England team that finished 16-0 (but lost to the New York Giants in the Super Bowl). Last season, the Patriots won the Super Bowl, their sixth.

It’s such an incredible world to see from a perspective that we haven’t seen a lot of, even though there are strip clubs in every movie and TV show. So I was really excited to tell the story from [the strippers’] point of view. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"OvHeD4\"\u003eI was also really interested in the friendship story.

There are a lot of movies that I think have touched upon these themes — \u003cem\u003eThe Wolf of Wall Street\u003c/em\u003e or movies like \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2015/12/12/9947796/the-big-short-review-movie-ryan-gosling\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Big Short\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e —\u003c/em\u003e which explain [financial downturns] from the bullpen. But I’m really interesting in seeing the impact that the 2008 recession had on these women who worked in Wall Street’s backyard. The financial crisis had an impact on everybody. The value of $20 changed. What [a client] expected for $20 was different from what [a stripper] was willing to do for $20. So it had a profound impact on their industry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"FWhwsz\"\u003eI met with a lot of strippers and strip club employees, former and current, and that only reinforced that thesis more, that 2008 really did change things. A lot of the dancers quit and became bartenders or managers. Of course, strip clubs are still going, but technology has changed those, too; the recession happened right when the iPhone was released. Everything collided at the same time. It was a turning point culturally.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\"A scene from Hustlers\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iX4BSZBcRnoy54mGu5R_n2WtIb4=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19175092/hustlers2.jpg\"\u003e\n      \u003ccite\u003eSTX Entertainment\u003c/cite\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003eWatch out, gentlemen.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Ufgbvz\"\u003e[In writing \u003cem\u003eHustlers\u003c/em\u003e], we looked at sports movies. because I feel like there’s so much athleticism involved in [the strippers’] jobs.

But it’s interesting in this case, because they’re not sex workers. They’re entertainers.

You dramatize that situation in the movie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"JPXXTt\"\u003eLorene Scafaria\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"KBgi37\"\u003eYeah, there is a stigma [against strippers]. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"V7IoGk\"\u003eAlissa Wilkinson\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"bvyl6k\"\u003eThere’s a stigma against them, even though the women are also smart, powerful, creative, capable, and inventive.

And there’s definitely a lot of skin in this one! But something about the way the club and the women and men in it are depicted on screen feels different, somehow, from what we’ve seen before. It’s like we’re seeing the strippers as they think of themselves rather than as someone else looks at them. From a visual standpoint, how did you think about that? \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"D9ckx9\"\u003eLorene Scafaria\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"BtHUT4\"\u003eI wanted to show the normalcy of their lives, to see from their point of view. But it’s also the story \u003cem\u003ethey\u003c/em\u003e want us to tell. And there’s a theme of control that runs through the movie. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"T90GFg\"\u003eThere are scenes where I think Ramona is in total control — possibly all of them! — of the camera. But in some scenes, like her first dance or when we find her on the rooftop, there’s a bit of a fantasy quality, because in those scenes Destiny is telling us her version of the story of meeting Ramona. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"LMLAkh\"\u003eFor some of the girls onstage, they feel powerful. Jennifer [Lopez] said that she felt really powerful up there, but that there are other moments where you’re completely insecure, feeling vulnerable. So we tried to have the camera match where our characters were depending on who was in control of us at that moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"riz6Tb\"\u003eAlissa Wilkinson\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"abgdmy\"\u003eSomething that goes along with control is power, and in some ways I think you could think of this as a “girl power” movie. But it’s much more complicated than that: After all, what they’re doing in the second half of the movie is a crime! How do you navigate the tricky balance of creating powerful, empathetic characters we can root for while also knowing that they’re doing a morally reprehensible thing? \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"kcEYxv\"\u003eLorene Scafaria\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"CI4ChM\"\u003eWe all know the difference between right and wrong. So I wasn’t trying to change what’s right or wrong. But there might be some people who watch the movie and feel empowered, and there might be some people who watch this and feel horrified. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"b8zME6\"\u003eThis was not a manufactured female story. It’s very much about being women; it’s very much about characters who \u003cem\u003ehave\u003c/em\u003e to be women in order for the story to exist. In that way, it feels more organic than a lot of scripts I’ve read or been sent over the years, once “female empowerment” became a genre a few years ago. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"9PLG6f\"\u003eI wanted to stay true to what happened: The crimes themselves, the punishments. I didn’t want to water down what they did. But I also didn’t feel like I needed to embellish the really bad behavior in the club or the daily microaggressions and aggressions that these women faced — maybe all women face, but typically at the clubs. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"SNQmvN\"\u003eI hope people see the movie and feel that sisterhood and friendship that I think is part of what works for these women. They needed that family dynamic that they created for themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"iqutZJ\"\u003eAlissa Wilkinson\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"skc1vj\"\u003eThat friendship, sisterhood, and family aspect is the core of the story. Ramona and Destiny’s relationship almost feels, beat for beat, like a romance. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"Cg55tc\"\u003eLorene Scafaria\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"2nBCiX\"\u003eI met with Jennifer first. There was nobody else for Ramona but her. It took a really long search to figure out who Destiny was, and the minute I met with Constance, I was so enchanted and excited about the idea of her in this role and the two of them opposite each other. I thought that they would have great chemistry together. They’re very different actors, but they also have similarities. They’re both so gifted and complex. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"o3Vj7w\"\u003eI saw them together for the first time at the camera test and immediately felt that electricity between them. They felt like a big sister and a little sister immediately. Watching that relationship unfold on screen and on set was a beautiful thing. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"bj65Cy\"\u003eIt really is a love story at its heart, whether the people want to call it friendship or love. Family runs deep, and female friendships run really deep. Sisters fight, and you can have a really complicated relationship with the person that you love and rely on the most. And of course, the two of them have different value systems and come from different places and approach the world differently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"aa7JH8\"\u003eBut there’s something so symbiotic about them.

The drive for independence was intensifying. But Marechera could see through the deceptive characters that were at the brink of leading Zimbabwe. Most of them were his contemporaries and former classmates. Marechera’s no holds barred book, \u003cem\u003eMindblast\u003c/em\u003e, published in 1984 provides a searing review of the early years of Mugabe’s presidency. He writes:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e…it seems to me for all the ideals our independence is supposed to represent, it’s still the same old ox-wagon of the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer. There’s even an attempt to make poverty a holy and acceptable condition. You say you’re hungry, and the shef peers over his three chins down at you and says Comrade, you’re the backbone of the revolution as if your life’s ambition is to be thin and lean as a mosquito’s backbone. And you try to say ‘Shef, I don’t want to be the backbone, I want to be the big belly of the struggle aginst neo-colonialism like the one you got there underneath that Castro beard.’ And before you even finish what you are saying he’s got the CIO and the police and you are being marched at gunpoint to the interrogation barracks. I’m not saying there’s such a thing as an absence of free speech. Rather there’s an excess of it to feed the numerous ears that have been unleashed ‘for security reasons.’\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMugabe who was known for being a vindictive character by political opponents probably never forgave Marechera for the embarrassment. After Marechera returned to independent Zimbabwe, he was harassed and persecuted by state security for his refusal to join the system, or his public rebukes directed towards the status quo. Marechera made it uncomfortable for politicians to be in the same room with him. He would call them out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a result, Marechera was effectively banished from public gatherings. The government\u0026#8217;s solution was to periodically throw him in prison to keep him away from the media or his network of international friends who often visited him. These episodes contributed to the elevation of his reputation as a fearless critic of the establishment who spoke truth to power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cracks in Zimbabwe were always there, only the heat of time deepened them. After the landslide victory of Mugabe’s party in the 1980 elections, the sense of euphoria, which followed, was short-lived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBob Marley who was invited to play at the independence gala composed a song titled, Zimbabwe. Throughout the song Marley repeatedly warns the leadership:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eSo soon we’ll find out who is the real revolutionaries\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eAnd I don’t want my people to be tricked by mercenaries\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMugabe’s big man politics were entrenched in the early years. He annexed all political power to himself and mastered absolute authority by creating a one party state in 1987 to give shape to his dreams of total conquest and to hold under his sway the country, which he insensibly considered his private property.

Marechera was sublimely scathing of the slogans that surrounded the euphoria of independence. He was deeply suspicious of the black leadership led by Mugabe. Current political leaders such as Tendai Biti, Douglas Mwonzora and others who have become prominent figures in the opposition ranks embraced Marechera\u0026#8217;s gospel.

This was a photo moment Mugabe would not let pass though Marechera was right to have been cynical.

There are also significant differences in the information density of each language, meaning the amount of information contained per syllable.

It's also a morality tale that leaves the audience to decide where the right, wrong, and gray areas might lie in drugging and robbing the men who brought on the 2008 market crash that left millions financially devastated. To quote \u003ci\u003e The Players Club,\u003c/i\u003e another iconic film about a strip club, it's a lesson in \"using what you've got to get what you want.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\"[Control is] certainly a big part of what these women are dealing with at their jobs,\" said Scafaria. \"The truth is, they are in control. They're in control of their bodies, they're in control of what they do with it, how they use it.\"\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAnd the protagonists definitely flex that. Destiny, played by Wu, finds that the club offers her a space to gain the independence and self-reliance she craves, especially as a single mom who was abandoned by her parents and now supports the grandmother who raised her. For Ramona—the maternal, street-smart, Bronx-bred mastermind behind the scheme, and truly a role Lopez was born to play—the club is a means of survival that also affords her the luxuries she desires (Gucci shoes, an Escalade) and the ability to give her daughter the advantages she didn't have. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\"If Ramona is the sun shining on you, it's a warm place to be,\" explained Scafaria. \"If she's staring at you too much, you might get burned. When she's looking away, it's cold in the shade. She's a mother figure and a big sister, and a ring leader. Jennifer, honestly, has that quality about her. If she told you to get in her fur coat and do bad things you might just say yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIt's hard to deny Ramona's magnetism (and by extension Lopez's) after what will surely become known as the Infamous Dance Scene. While it's widely known that Lopez is a skilled, trained dancer who has performed in arenas around the world, watching her bounce her illustrious, fully bare glutes up and down on a club stage to the tune of Fiona Apple's \"Criminal\" while surrounded by dollar bills is not something anyone can easily recover from. Is it on par with what dancers at \u003ca href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/gqwn3w/power-of-the-pussy-takes-you-behind-the-pole-at-magic-city\" target=\"_blank\"\u003elegendary strip clubs\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://i-d.vice.com/en_us/article/43jevd/intimate-photographs-of-the-dancers-at-atlantas-magic-city-strip-club\" target=\"_blank\"\u003elike Atlanta's Magic City \u003c/a\u003eor L.A.'s Ace of Diamonds do? Probably not. But it's still a sight to behold.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe entire scene also pulls off the rare feat of not feeling like an exploitation of a woman's body for the male gaze; instead, it pays homage to the work of a stripper as an art form. It is also emblematic of Ramona's power, the command she conjures through the sheer boldness of her presence and bangingness of her body. The men handing over their stacks of cash are awestruck, and so is Destiny, who sees in Ramona something to aspire to, someone whose dominance of the stage reflects the authority she holds in her life. In another director's hands, this could've been a bawdy excuse to see some booty, but in Scafaria's hands, the dance allows us to marvel at Lopez's athleticism and see why Destiny—or anyone, for that matter—would want to follow Ramona into this kind of scheme.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBut those money moves can't keep Ramona or Destiny safe forever. The market crash forces both women into survival mode, as the club suffers from the repercussions of much of its extremely rich, creepy clientele losing their jobs on Wall Street. While pre-2008 was about raking up thick stacks of bills and dancing for Usher (another excellent scene in the film), the financial collapse forces Ramona to get, well, creative. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThat's when she turns to \"fishing,\" a term for luring rich guys at fancy bars into the strip club, where she and her hot cohorts get them even more drunk and run up their tab, taking a cut from the club. Drugging them becomes the essential shortcut to ensuring a fat payday. While the film changes the names of those involved in the scheme, as well as some of the details, it is an almost point-by-point account of what actually went down. And considering an \u003ca href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/cardi-b-robbed-drugged-men_n_5c9a392ae4b06826fee8932e\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eold Instagram live video of Cardi B\u003c/a\u003e recently resurfaced in which she admitted to drugging and robbing men during her own stripper days in New York City, it adds another layer of veracity and authenticity to the film as a whole.

We know bad behavior when we see it; we know right from wrong, we know creeps from nice guys.\"\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAs Ramona and her co-conspirators get increasingly greedy, the line of who and who isn't worthy of the growing cashflow gets blurred, and the Escalade they're cruising in begins to feel like it's veering downhill with no brakes. This metaphor becomes central to Destiny's growing realization that things are getting out of hand. Eventually, the law is what stops them and they must relinquish control altogether. What's left is their story, and it's a compelling one. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAs Ramona says, \"This city, this whole country, is a strip club.

His tenure as the company\u0026#8217;s top legal officer spans the software giant\u0026#8217;s bruising antitrust battles with the U.S. government two decades ago and its resurgence as a cloud-computing force, which this year helped Microsoft vault past Apple and Amazon as the most valuable company in the world. \u0026#8220;He\u0026#8217;s someone who\u0026#8217;s been through a lot of different ups and downs as we\u0026#8217;ve evolved, the tech industry has evolved, and the world around us has evolved,\u0026#8221; says Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, who promoted Smith to his current role in 2015.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt says something about the nature of those changes that Smith, since becoming Microsoft\u0026#8217;s president, has focused as much on external relations as on internal strategy. With public distrust at its peak over the size, power and business practices of the tech industry\u0026#8217;s biggest companies, Smith has assumed the role of unofficial global ambassador for the industry. In the past year, he has spent more than 100 days on the road, visiting 22 countries and pushing for collaboration between governments and tech companies to limit the destabilizing effects of digital technologies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"inline-portrait_small_2x aligncenter \"\u003e\u003cimg data-attachment-id=\"5669260\" data-permalink=\"https://time.com/5669537/brad-smith-microsoft-big-tech/sipa-france-15/\" data-orig-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/brad-smith-microsoft-world-leaders.jpg?quality=85\" data-orig-size=\"2400,1597\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"ISA HARSIN\\/SIPA\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"On the occasion of the second edition of the Tech for Good Summit, on May 15, 2019 at Elysee Palace, Emmanuel Macron, the French President of the Republic, co-chairs with Jacinda Arden, Prime Minister of New Zealand, the launch meeting of the Christchurch Appeal, asking on leaders of major digital companies to take action against terrorism and violent extremism online, in the presence of King Abdullah II of Jordan, Macky Sall, President of the Republic of Senegal, Jusuf Kalla, Vice-President of the Republic of Indonesia, Erna Solberg, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Norway, Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada, Theresa May, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, Leo Varadkar, Prime Minister of Ireland, Cedric O, State Secretary for Digital, representative of the French G7 Presidency, Nick Clegg, Vice President of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp in charge of Global Affairs and Communication, Kent Walker, Vice President of Google-Youtube Head of International Affairs and Legal Affairs, Brad Smith, President and Chief Legal Officer of Microsoft, Jack Dorsey, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Twitter, Jimmy Wales, Founder of Wikipedia, Eric Leandri, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer from Qwant, Maxime Saada, Dailymotion President and CEO, Susan Pointer, Amazon Vice President of Global Affairs, Jordan CARTER, President and CEO of Internet New Zealand NGO Salwa TOKO, President of the National Council of Digital.

In November, French President Emmanuel Macron unveiled an international accord\u0026#8211;championed by Smith and signed by 67 countries and 358 private companies and entities\u0026#8211;to promote \u0026#8220;trust and security in cyberspace\u0026#8221; and to protect elections from cyberattacks. After the March terrorist assault on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, that killed 51 people and was livestreamed on Facebook, Smith helped New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern launch the Christchurch Call, an initiative to eliminate violent-extremist content online. As part of the agreement, Smith worked to persuade social-media companies like Facebook and Twitter to pledge to remove extremist content as soon as it\u0026#8217;s posted and to report publicly on their progress in doing so. \u0026#8220;Brad was one of the driving forces behind that effort\u0026#8211;he spent real time, energy and capital to bring it about,\u0026#8221; says Senator Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmith\u0026#8217;s influence is well known among tech-industry titans and policymakers in Washington, but he has wielded much of it behind the scenes. He will step more squarely onto the public stage with the Sept. 10 release of his first book, \u003cem\u003eTools and Weapons: The Promise and the Peril of the Digital Age\u003c/em\u003e. Filled with accounts of closed-door meetings, from Microsoft\u0026#8217;s boardroom to the West Wing to the Vatican, the book shows tech leaders trying to respond to a seemingly endless series of crises: Edward Snowden\u0026#8217;s revelations of government surveillance of private data servers; Russia\u0026#8217;s hacking and social-media disinformation campaign during the 2016 presidential election; the 2017 North Korea\u0026#8211;sponsored cyberattack known as WannaCry, which crippled hundreds of thousands of computer systems worldwide; the livestreaming of the Christchurch rampage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe picture that emerges is of an industry ill-equipped to control the technologies it unleashed. Smith argues that the tech sector needs to reform itself or risk having change forced upon it. \u0026#8220;Is our biggest problem today that the world is doing too much to manage technology, or too little?\u0026#8221; he says. \u0026#8220;I would argue too little\u0026#8211;and that, in fact, governments are moving too slowly, not that they\u0026#8217;re moving too fast.\u0026#8221; In his book, and in his increasingly high-profile public advocacy, Smith appears as both an advocate for tech responsibility and a voice of moderation in the clamorous debate over regulating Big Tech. \u0026#8220;Brad elevates the conversation,\u0026#8221; says Chris Liddell, a senior official in the Trump White House and former Microsoft executive. \u0026#8220;He\u0026#8217;s representing Microsoft, but also sincerely trying to do the right thing for the tech industry and for the country.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet for a skeptical public, two questions immediately arise. The first is whether Smith\u0026#8217;s prescriptions go far enough toward curbing the industry\u0026#8217;s power or remedying the damage it\u0026#8217;s done to consumer privacy, social stability and democracy itself. Smith calls for \u0026#8220;limited initial regulatory\u0026#8221; steps on digital-technology companies, while insisting that \u0026#8220;it is more than possible for companies to succeed while doing more to address their societal responsibilities.\u0026#8221; Critics say that\u0026#8217;s just letting the fox guard the henhouse. \u0026#8220;It\u0026#8217;s a simple fact that technology has been weaponized by private companies against democracy,\u0026#8221; says Barry C. Lynn, executive director of the Open Markets Institute, a Washington think tank that supports antitrust action against tech behemoths. \u0026#8220;Corporations are not people. They don\u0026#8217;t have souls. They\u0026#8217;re institutions designed to make money. And the way the government has always dealt with them is to regulate them to the point where they cease being dangerous to the public.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second question is whether Smith\u0026#8217;s efforts do more to advance Microsoft\u0026#8217;s interests than the public\u0026#8217;s. Though Facebook, Google and Amazon have some policy goals in common with Microsoft, heavier government oversight of the Internet isn\u0026#8217;t one of them. Some see Smith\u0026#8217;s support for regulation not as an act of socially minded corporate citizenship but as a strategy to slow the growth of Microsoft\u0026#8217;s rivals. \u0026#8220;By taking these high-profile positions, Microsoft is able to highlight its own thought leadership and commitment to individual consumers, while throwing the competition under the bus,\u0026#8221; says Dipayan Ghosh, co-director of the Digital Platforms and Democracy project at Harvard\u0026#8217;s Kennedy School of Government and a former Facebook employee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmith doesn\u0026#8217;t dispute that claiming the high ground has helped Microsoft\u0026#8217;s bottom line. But he believes that Silicon Valley\u0026#8217;s new giants should learn from Redmond, not fear it. \u0026#8220;I think that Microsoft offers both a cautionary and a hopeful tale. If you don\u0026#8217;t figure out how to make things work from a broader societal perspective, you will pay a steep price for many years,\u0026#8221; he says. \u0026#8220;But then there\u0026#8217;s the hopeful tale. We survived, and we\u0026#8217;re doing well. And one of the reasons is that we turned our weaknesses from the 1990s into strengths.\u0026#8221; Speaking as much of his own journey as his company\u0026#8217;s, he adds, \u0026#8220;What I\u0026#8217;ve learned here is that if you believe in the long term, your day eventually arrives.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"inline-portrait_small_2x aligncenter \"\u003e\u003cimg data-attachment-id=\"5669259\" data-permalink=\"https://time.com/5669537/brad-smith-microsoft-big-tech/brad-smith/\" data-orig-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/brad-smith-microsoft-supreme-court.jpg?quality=85\" data-orig-size=\"2400,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4.5\",\"credit\":\"Andrew Harnik\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS-1D X Mark II\",\"caption\":\"FILE- In this Feb. 27, 2018, file photo Microsoft President and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith, left, leaves the Supreme Court in Washington.

While other company executives enjoy panoramic views of the Cascade Range and surrounding forests, Smith\u0026#8217;s corner office, which he\u0026#8217;s occupied since 2002, overlooks a parking lot. It\u0026#8217;s decorated with globes of various sizes; photos of his wife Kathy and their two grown children; and a framed copy of the CLOUD Act, a bipartisan law signed by Trump in 2018 that limits how law-enforcement agencies can access consumer data held by tech companies in third countries. The bookshelves hold technological artifacts featured by Smith and his co-author Carol Ann Browne in their book, including a replica of a century-old phone used by Alexander Graham Bell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmith meets me a little before 9 in the morning, wearing charcoal slacks and a plaid shirt. Modestly built, with fading red hair, blue eyes and a gravelly Midwestern accent, Smith has an amiable, self-effacing demeanor that belies his nine-figure wealth and intense work ethic. Close aides are known to keep their phones charged near their beds, in case Smith emails them from another time zone. His commute takes 11 to 13 minutes, depending on the one traffic light on his route, which gets him to his desk by 7 a.m. (At the end of his 12-hour days, he relaxes by playing video games.) To write Tools and Weapons, Smith holed up before dawn in a windowless meeting room, running through Browne\u0026#8217;s edits while his colleagues trickled onto campus. The pair finished the 90,000-word manuscript in less than six months.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmith\u0026#8217;s father worked for the Wisconsin Bell phone company, and he spent his childhood moving among several cities in the state. He attended elementary school in Racine, a declining industrial city where he was one of the only white students in a predominantly African-American school. During summers, he earned money by picking onions with migrant farmers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt his mother\u0026#8217;s urging, Smith left Wisconsin to attend Princeton, where he was part of a peer group that included Elena Kagan, Eliot Spitzer and Kathy Surace, Smith\u0026#8217;s future wife. \u0026#8220;He was a little dorky, that was my first impression,\u0026#8221; she says. \u0026#8220;It was a competitive environment, and some people were more competitive than others. Brad tended to deflect that and take an interest in other people and learn about them, as opposed to talking about himself.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmith became intrigued with personal computers and bought his first IBM PC in the mid-1980s, in his third year of law school. After graduating, he interviewed at Covington \u0026amp; Burling, a Washington law firm, on the condition that the job come with a computer. He got both. \u0026#8220;They said no one had asked for one before,\u0026#8221; Smith recalls. As the firm\u0026#8217;s resident technologist, he worked on copyright issues for the nascent software industry\u0026#8217;s trade association, which gained the notice of lawyers at Microsoft. He joined the company in 1993 as head of its European legal and corporate affairs team, based in Paris, with a mandate to fight software piracy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring his first meeting in Seattle with Gates, Smith presented the CEO with a one-page memo on a proposed European Community copyright directive. After marking up the sheet with a pencil, Gates grabbed a blue marker and began brainstorming ideas on a whiteboard, using his hand as an eraser. \u0026#8220;It was covered in blue ink by the end of the meeting,\u0026#8221; Smith recalls, over a lunch of grilled salmon at a restaurant on campus. \u0026#8220;You could see the wheels turning.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGates\u0026#8217; taste for legal combat led Microsoft into a series of confrontations with competitors and with the U.S. Department of Justice, culminating in a four-year antitrust trial over the company\u0026#8217;s attempts to limit the use of non-Microsoft web browsers on its dominant Windows platform. Though it reached a tentative settlement with the federal government in 2001, Microsoft remained embroiled in numerous suits with states, foreign governments and other tech companies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Smith returned to the U.S. in 2002 to become general counsel, he pleaded with Gates and Steve Ballmer, who was then running the company, to \u0026#8220;make peace\u0026#8221; with their adversaries. \u0026#8220;Until there was peace brought to the industry, we wouldn\u0026#8217;t see the regulatory pressures subside,\u0026#8221; Smith says. \u0026#8220;And making peace also required we change the way we worked internally and develop a capability to work with governments.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a crucial business decision, Smith says. Had Microsoft continued its assaults on regulators and the competition, \u0026#8220;we wouldn\u0026#8217;t be the most valuable company in the world today. We wouldn\u0026#8217;t have been given the opportunity. We had to persuade people that we deserved their trust.\u0026#8221; In the foreword to Tools and Weapons, Gates credits Smith with driving \u0026#8220;a big cultural and strategic shift\u0026#8221; at Microsoft that saw the company \u0026#8220;put more time and energy into connecting with \u0026#8230; the government, our partners and sometimes even our competitors.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat has given Smith credibility with the newer moguls of tech, even if he\u0026#8217;s delivering a message they don\u0026#8217;t like. Late last year, Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg reached out to Smith, at Gates\u0026#8217; suggestion, for advice on how the social network should handle scrutiny from lawmakers, the media and the general public. Smith says he consults \u0026#8220;from time to time\u0026#8221; with Zuckerberg and Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg. \u0026#8220;Some problems are deeper and broader today than they would be if we\u0026#8217;d started to move toward some smarter regulation a decade ago,\u0026#8221; Smith says. Among other things, he favors laws to limit how artificial intelligence and facial-recognition software are developed and used by both private companies and government agencies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, he pushes back against calls for government to impose stiffer penalties against the biggest tech companies, or even break them up. That is disappointing but not surprising, says Danny O\u0026#8217;Brien, director of strategy at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which advocates for online privacy rights. \u0026#8220;When it comes to big solutions,\u0026#8221; O\u0026#8217;Brien says, Smith \u0026#8220;is not going to suggest what a lot of outsiders now think needs to happen.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery Friday morning, Microsoft\u0026#8217;s 10-person senior leadership team gathers in CEO Nadella\u0026#8217;s conference room to make decisions on business strategy. Increasingly, the discussion focuses on trust. \u0026#8220;Our business model depends on one thing and one thing alone, which is the world having more trust in technology,\u0026#8221; Nadella says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmith\u0026#8217;s mandate is to make that happen. He touts the company\u0026#8217;s push to expand broadband coverage to 3 million rural Americans by 2022 and its recent $500 million investment in creating more affordable housing in the Seattle area. Rather than commercializing the ElectionGuard technology\u0026#8211;which enables voters, election officials and the media to independently verify that their votes were counted and not altered\u0026#8211;Microsoft will make it available for free on GitHub, an open-source software platform.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese Smith-led initiatives also advance Microsoft\u0026#8217;s business interests, of course. Company executives don\u0026#8217;t deny that they burnish Microsoft\u0026#8217;s image, but they also say Smith\u0026#8217;s commitment to good corporate citizenship is real. \u0026#8220;It would be easy to say, \u0026#8216;Hey, this a challenge. Gosh, it\u0026#8217;d be nice to help,\u0026#8217; and then sit there,\u0026#8221; says Amy Hood, Microsoft\u0026#8217;s chief financial officer. \u0026#8220;That\u0026#8217;s not who he is.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn early 2017, Smith came up with the concept of a \u0026#8220;digital Geneva convention\u0026#8221; that would establish globally recognized protections for civilians against cyberattacks, modeled on the 1949 Geneva convention that prohibits the deliberate targeting of civilians in conventional warfare. A year later, Smith had persuaded 34 companies to sign an accord based on those principles, and 60 more have joined since, including Google and Facebook but not Apple or Amazon. He followed that up with the Christchurch Call, which he launched after meeting with Ardern 12 days after the Christchurch attacks. \u0026#8220;She told me, \u0026#8216;I\u0026#8217;m not interested in just having some PR moment. I want to do something that\u0026#8217;s real.\u0026#8217; So we started to talk,\u0026#8221; Smith says. He proposed a pledge signed by governments and tech companies to take immediate steps to rid social-media platforms of violent-extremist content. Smith says these efforts represent a new kind of \u0026#8220;multistakeholder diplomacy.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo far, there\u0026#8217;s not a lot to show for it. The volume of toxic or violent content on social-media platforms continues to grow, despite hundreds of millions of government dollars spent trying to curb it. Cyberthreats against democratic elections, privacy and well-regulated markets are also on the rise. To critics, the tech industry\u0026#8217;s push to work with government on those problems looks more like co-opting the feds than collaborating with them. And the Trump Administration has been cool to such collaboration anyway. When I ask whether he\u0026#8217;s discouraged by the Administration\u0026#8217;s refusal to embrace his causes, Smith shrugs.

During the second set of the women\u0026#8217;s final on Saturday between Serena Williams, 37, and Bianca Andreescu, 19, of Canada, the crowd suddenly erupted in cheers as Williams was flailing, in a sort of desperate attempt to rescue her.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd for awhile, the roars worked.

She saved a match point. She won eight of nine points. While serving down 5-4, Williams fired a 118 miles-per-hour ace, then double faulted, then hit a 119 miles-per-hour ace, then double faulted, but eventually held to tie up the set. Her play was dizzying, thrilling. She celebrated with a soft fist pump. Ashe celebrated with a little more enthusiasm \u0026#8212; the crowd went bonkers \u0026#8212; as Serena\u0026#8217;s heart-pumping run left everyone convinced that she\u0026#8217;d just roll over the Canadian teenager, who seemed on the verge of melting down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd who would blame her? A year ago, Andreescu couldn\u0026#8217;t even get through qualifying at the U.S. Open. This was her debut in the main draw. If the moment overtook her \u0026#8212; the fans desperately wanted to see Serena tie Margaret Court\u0026#8217;s record for most career Grand Slam singles titles, 24 \u0026#8212; she could chalk it up to rookie nerves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndreescu, however, wouldn\u0026#8217;t have it, proving fortitude beyond her years. She held serve to go back up 6-5, and with Serena serving, she got it back to match point.

Canada won its first Grand Slam singles title.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo Serena\u0026#8217;s U.S. Open heartbreak continues. Four times in recent years, Williams arrived at Ashe on a seemingly inevitable march towards history. In 2015, she entered the U.S. Open having won the year\u0026#8217;s first three Grand Slam titles, attempting to become the first player since Steffi Graf in 1988 to win the calendar year Grand Slam. Italy\u0026#8217;s Roberta Vinci, however, shocked her in the semifinals. A year later, Williams could have broken Graf\u0026#8217;s record of 22 Open Era Grand Slam titles in front of adoring American fans. She fell in the semis again, this time to Karolina Pliskova of the Czech Republic. (Williams broke Graf\u0026#8217;s record in January 2017, when she beat her sister Venus Williams in the Australian Open while pregnant).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter missing the 2017 U.S. Open to give birth to her daughter Olympia, she came back to New York last year to try to tie Court\u0026#8217;s overall record of 24 Grand Slams, but \u003ca href=\"https://time.com/5398085/serena-williams-us-open-controversy-comments/\" \u003elost in the final\u003c/a\u003e to \u003ca href=\"https://time.com/collection/100-most-influential-people-2019/5567714/naomi-osaka/\" \u003eOsaka\u003c/a\u003e.

She hasn\u0026#8217;t even won set in these last four Grand Slam finals appearances. When someone asked her after the match if the losses are having less of an impact on her, Serena gave the questioner a proper side-eye. \u0026#8220;I honestly don\u0026#8217;t think Serena showed up,\u0026#8221; she says. \u0026#8220;I have to kind of figure out how to get her to show up in Grand Slam finals.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome proper words about Andreescu, the aggressive-yet-composed Canadian teenager who became the \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/nzaccardi/status/1170456593059713026\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003efirst teen since Maria Sharapova in 2006\u003c/a\u003e to win a Grand Slam. When Serena won her first U.S. Open in 1999, Andreescu, the daughter of Romanian immigrants, wasn\u0026#8217;t even born (Andreescu becomes the first player born in the 2000s to win a Slam). During last year\u0026#8217;s finals, the phenom from the Toronto suburbs was home nursing injuries. \u0026#8220;I was sitting on my butt,\u0026#8221; she says. On big points, Andreescu let out a few Serena-like \u0026#8220;come ons!\u0026#8221; to pump herself up. She\u0026#8217;s been visualizing playing a Grand Slam final against Serena since winning the prestigious Orange Bowl junior tournament in 2015, and teared up after the match at that memory. \u0026#8220;It\u0026#8217;s so crazy, man,\u0026#8221; she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;I\u0026#8217;ve really strived to be like her,\u0026#8221; Andreescu says. \u0026#8220;Who knows? Maybe I can be better.\u0026#8221; She smiled and darted her eyes, as if delighting in saying something naughty. Andreescu owns endearing confidence. While her coach, Sylvain Bruneau, posed with trophy given to the winning coach after the match, he apologized for turning it the wrong way. \u0026#8220;I\u0026#8217;m not used to this,\u0026#8221; Bruneau said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;Well, get used to it,\u0026#8221; Andreescu replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Ashe crowd received Andreescu warmly during the awards ceremony after the match. Thankfully, no controversy caused ugly booing in back-to-back years.

Ross, a true American patriot. Born in Sioux City, Iowa, in 1930, he grew up dirt poor. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMy grandmother had grown up in a\nhouse made of sod, and my grandfather\u0026#8217;s only skill was horse trading. My\nfather\u0026#8217;s parents couldn\u0026#8217;t even afford to buy my father a toy truck that cost only\na nickel. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt 9, my father stood in the snow\nlate at night in bare feet. He watched while the only home he\u0026#8217;d ever known\nburned to the ground and left him with nothing but the pajamas he was wearing. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe house my father’s family\nsubsequently rented was so filthy he had to shovel chicken droppings out of it\nbefore they could move in. In high school, his parents couldn\u0026#8217;t afford a lock\nfor his locker, so he couldn\u0026#8217;t play football.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut he believed in the American dream,\nand that was all he needed to get ahead. When his country called on him to serve\nin the Marine Corps, he did his duty without complaint. As a navigator, he flew\n48 missions in Korea, sometimes with the bottom shot out of the plane. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he returned to El Toro Marine\nBase near Irvine, California, he married my mother. He attended UCLA on the GI\nBill, not a handout. He earned a master\u0026#8217;s degree in engineering and paid high\ntaxes—as high\nas 50 percent—for most of his life. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHe died in 2010 from cancer, hoping\nhis children and grandchildren would live the same American dream. Unfortunately,\nthat dream has been handed to people who have done nothing to deserve it. They\nare only out for what they can get. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf Americans are left with nothing in\nthe process, so be it.

If doctors work for a\nmedical group, they are contractually obligated to treat Medicare patients, and\nso they deliberately inflict pain on me, frighten me, or anger me so I will go\naway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow California Gov.

An unethical Medi-Cal dentist, I believe, destroyed two of them needing\ncrowns on purpose, so that I would go away. The other tooth was pulled because\nI didn\u0026#8217;t have money for a filling. Medi-Cal no longer covers fillings, only\ntooth pulling. For that, dentists receive $15 instead of the usual $75.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I think of the sacrifices my father made so that his children could have a better life, I want to cry. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThose of us with ancestors and relatives who earned the right to be here are living a Third World existence, with the fear that the situation will get only worse as our elected representatives continue to hand our assets over to foreign invaders who erroneously believe it is their right to have them.—\u003cstrong\u003eMelinda Santa Cruz, Escondido, Calif.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis and That\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDear Daily Signal: \u003c/strong\u003eWhy\nare conservative media outlets dancing around the fact that the so-called\nAntifa activists are no different than the Nazi Brownshirts and Blackshirts and\nthe KKK?\u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe have mayors, members of Congress, and the media supporting Antifa\u0026#8217;s actions, thuggery, and extreme violence.

That’s not how it turned out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore the 2011 law took effect, there was little difference between the proportion of black and white defendants granted release to await trial at home without cash bail. After being mandated to consider a score predicting the risk a person would reoffend or skip court, the state’s judges began offering no-bail release to white defendants much more often than to blacks. The proportion of black defendants granted release without bail increased only slightly, to a little over 25 percent. The rate for whites jumped to more than 35 percent. Kentucky has changed its algorithm twice since 2011, but available data shows the gap remained roughly constant through early 2016.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Kentucky experience, detailed in a study \u003ca class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.minnesotalawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/13Stevenson_MLR.pdf\"\u003epublished\u003c/a\u003e earlier this year, is timely. Many states and counties now calculate “risk scores” for criminal defendants that estimate the chance a person will reoffend before trial or skip court; some use similar tools in sentencing. They are supposed to help judges make fairer decisions and cut the number of people in jail or prison, sometimes as part of eliminating cash bail. Since 2017, Kentucky has released some defendants scored as low-risk based purely on an algorithm’s say-so, without a judge being involved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1564003#p3\"\u003eRead 20 remaining paragraphs\u003c/a\u003e | \u003ca href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1564003\u0026comments=1\"\u003eComments\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"feedflare\"\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=u3VBl-2lPh4:PoEGl9M9PMQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=u3VBl-2lPh4:PoEGl9M9PMQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=u3VBl-2lPh4:PoEGl9M9PMQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=u3VBl-2lPh4:PoEGl9M9PMQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=u3VBl-2lPh4:PoEGl9M9PMQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=u3VBl-2lPh4:PoEGl9M9PMQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","url":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1564003","published":"2019-09-08T11:49:09Z","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1564003"},{"title":"Ars goes back to school: The video games that threatened our college GPA","content":"\u003cdiv id=\"rss-wrap\"\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"intro-image intro-left\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-544281245-800x555.jpg\" alt=\"A photographer's approximation of what LAN party life was like for Ars Technica staffers in the CRT monitor era.\"\u003e\u003cp class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-544281245.jpg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"1648\" data-width=\"2374\"\u003eEnlarge\u003c/a\u003e \u003cspan class=\"sep\"\u003e/\u003c/span\u003e A photographer's approximation of what LAN party life was like for Ars Technica staffers in the CRT monitor era.

Indeed, there\u0026#8217;s a full thirteen screws holding the display module in place. Deconstruction takes work (and care not to lose any of the teeny screws). So this is modularity purely as occasional utility, not flashy party trick \u0026#8212; as with \u003ca href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/01/google-ends-modular-phone-project-ara-though-licensing-may-be-an-option/\"\u003eGoogle\u0026#8217;s doomed Ara Project\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor some that might be disappointing. Exactly because this modular phone feels so, well, boringly normal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVisually the most stand out feature at a glance is the Fairphone logo picked out in metallic white lettering on the back. Those taking a second look will also spot a moralizing memo printed on the battery so it\u0026#8217;s legible through the matte plastic \u0026#8212; which reads: \u0026#8220;Change is in your hands\u0026#8221;. It may be a bit cringeworthy but if you\u0026#8217;ve paid for an ethical premium you might as well flaunt it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#8217;s fair to say design fans won\u0026#8217;t be going wild over the Fairphone 3. But it feels almost intentionally dull. As if \u0026#8212; in addition to shrinking manufacturing costs \u0026#8212; the point is to impress on buyers that ethical internals are more than enough of a hipster fashion statement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#8217;s also true that most smartphones are now much the same, hardware, features and performance wise. So \u0026#8212; at this higher mid-tier price-point (€450/~$500) \u0026#8212; why not flip the consumer smartphone sales pitch on its head to make it about shrinking rather than maximizing impact, via a dull but worthy standard?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat then pushes people to ask how sustainable is an expensive but \u003cem\u003evalueless\u003c/em\u003e \u0026#8212; and so, philosophically speaking, pointless \u0026#8212; premium? That\u0026#8217;s the question Fairphone 3 seems designed to pose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr, to put it another way, if normal can be ethical then shouldn\u0026#8217;t ethical electronics be the norm?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNormal is what you get elsewhere with Fairphone 3. Purely judged as a smartphone its performance isn\u0026#8217;t anything to write home about. It checks all the usual boxes of messaging, photos, apps and Internet browsing. You can say it gets the job done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSure, it\u0026#8217;s not buttery smooth at every screen and app transition. And it can feel a little slow on the uptake at times. Notably the camera, while fairly responsive, isn\u0026#8217;t lightning quick. Photo quality is not terrible \u0026#8212; but not amazing either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTesting the camera I found images prone to high acutance and over saturated colors. The software also struggles to handle mixed light and shade \u0026#8212; meaning you may get a darker and less balanced shot that you hoped for. Low light performance isn\u0026#8217;t great either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat said, in good light the Fairphone 3 can take a perfectly acceptable selfie. Which is what most people will expect to be able to use the phone for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFairphone has said it\u0026#8217;s done a lot of work to improve the camera vs the predecessor model. And it has succeeded in bringing photo performance up to workable standard \u0026#8212; which is a great achievement at what\u0026#8217;s also a slightly reduced handset price-point. Though, naturally, there\u0026#8217;s still a big gap in photo quality vs the premium end of the smartphone market.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the OS front, the phone runs a vanilla implementation of Android 9 out of the box \u0026#8212; preloaded with the usual bundle of Google services and no added clutter so Android fans should feel right at home. (For those who want a Google-free alternative Fairphone says a future update will allow users to do a wipe and clean install of Android Open Source Project.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg class=\"size-large wp-image-1878513 aligncenter\" title=\"Fp3f\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Fp3f.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"Fp3f\" width=\"680\" height=\"455\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Fp3f.jpg 2272w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Fp3f.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Fp3f.jpg?resize=300,201 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Fp3f.jpg?resize=768,514 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Fp3f.jpg?resize=680,455 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Fp3f.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn short, purely as a smartphone, the Fairphone 3 offers very little to shout about \u0026#8212; so no screaming lack either. Again, if the point is to shrink the size of the compromise Fairphone is asking consumers to make in order to buy an ethically superior brand of electronics they are slowly succeeding in closing the gap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#8217;s a project that\u0026#8217;s clearly benefiting from the maturity of the smartphone market. While, on the cellular front, the transformative claims being made for 5G are \u003ca href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/02/5g-phones-are-here-but-theres-no-rush-to-upgrade/\"\u003eclearly many years out\u003c/a\u003e \u0026#8212; so there\u0026#8217;s no issue with asking buyers to stick with a 4G phone for years to come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven where the market has now marched to, a \u0026#8216;fairer\u0026#8217; smartphone that offers benchmark basics at a perfectly acceptable median but with the promise of reduced costs over the longer term \u0026#8212; individual, societal and environmental \u0026#8212; does seem like a proposition that could expand from what has so far been an exceptional niche into something rather larger and more mainstream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZooming out for a second, the Fairphone certainly makes an interesting contrast with some of the expensive chimeras struggling to be unfolded at the top end of the smartphone market right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFoldables like the \u003ca href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/24/samsung-galaxy-fold-review-future-shock/\"\u003eSamsung Galaxy Fold\u003c/a\u003e \u0026#8212; which clocks in at around 4x the price of a Fairphone and offers ~2x the screen real estate (when unfolded), plus a power bump. Whether the Fold\u0026#8217;s lux package translates into mobile utility squared is a whole other question, though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd where foldables will need to demonstrate a compelling use-case that goes above and beyond the Swiss Army utility of a normal smartphone to justify such a whopping price bump, Fairphone need only prick the consumer conscience \u0026#8212; as it asks you pay a bit more and settle for a little less.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither of these sales pitches is challenge free, of course. And, for now, both foldables and fairer electronics remain curious niches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut with the Fairphone 3 demonstrating that ethical can feel so normal it doesn\u0026#8217;t seem beyond the pale to imagine demand for electronics that are average in performance yet pack an ethical punch scaling up to challenge the mainstream parade of copycat gadgets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[gallery ids=\"1878512,1878515,1878516,1878514,1878517,1878513\"]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"feedflare\"\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=RTD2TUsJ7Go:OY4cb1C4LiU:2mJPEYqXBVI\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=RTD2TUsJ7Go:OY4cb1C4LiU:7Q72WNTAKBA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=RTD2TUsJ7Go:OY4cb1C4LiU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=RTD2TUsJ7Go:OY4cb1C4LiU:-BTjWOF_DHI\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=RTD2TUsJ7Go:OY4cb1C4LiU:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=RTD2TUsJ7Go:OY4cb1C4LiU:D7DqB2pKExk\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=RTD2TUsJ7Go:OY4cb1C4LiU:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=RTD2TUsJ7Go:OY4cb1C4LiU:qj6IDK7rITs\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/RTD2TUsJ7Go\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/RTD2TUsJ7Go/","published":"2019-09-08T09:47:16Z","guid":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=1878328"}]},{"url":"https://www.theverge.com/rss/full.xml","items":[{"title":"Wunderlist founder offers to buy back app from Microsoft","content":"\u003cimg alt=\"Wunderlist for Windows Phone\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cZ2XAnQ773YWKXCKXAsGqBDGICk=/0x2:640x429/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/65202339/wunderlist_windowsphone_640.0.jpg\" /\u003e\n\n\n  \u003cp id=\"efun7t\"\u003eWunderlist founder Christian Reber has offered to buy back the popular task management app from Microsoft to avoid it being shut down. “Still sad Microsoft wants to shut down Wunderlist, even though people still love and use it,” says Reber \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/christianreber/status/1169985802421592064\"\u003eon Twitter\u003c/a\u003e. “I’m serious Satya Nadella and Marcus Ash, please let me buy it back.

James Wants to Take Brooklyn’s Fight for Affordable Housing to Congress","content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cu\u003eIt’s a hot,\u003c/u\u003e humid summer evening in Brooklyn, the kind that would keep most people inside with the air conditioner blasting. But not Isiah James.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe towering 32-year-old veteran who’s running for Congress in New York’s 9\u003csup\u003eth\u003c/sup\u003e District, in the heart of Brooklyn, is walking with me down Flatbush Avenue, talking a mile a minute as he points to the luxury developments that have sprouted up amid the modest row homes and small shops of the Prospect Heights neighborhood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“These used to be apartments for Caribbean American immigrants,” he says in a deep, booming voice, his arms sweeping across an intersection dotted with expensive cafes and an upscale donut shop. “But this is lower Manhattan now. You have Wall Street bankers moving in to apartments that cost over $3,000. People who’ve been living here their whole lives can’t afford that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stops walking and points down the street, past the spaceship-like Barclays Center, a massive arena home to the Brooklyn Nets basketball team. “The four harbingers of gentrification are there: There’s a Chipotle, there’s an Apple Store, there’s a Starbucks, and there’s a Whole Foods.” This neighborhood “is no longer affordable for poor people. If you can’t afford to buy food in the neighborhood, you can’t afford to live there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe 9\u003csup\u003eth\u003c/sup\u003e District, like much of New York City and many large cities across the country, is in the throes of an affordable housing crisis. The district’s northern half, which includes Prospect Heights, Crown Heights, and Prospect Lefferts Garden, was once home primarily to working-class Caribbean immigrants and Orthodox Jews. In the last decade or so, rents have skyrocketed, with the median one-bedroom in these neighborhoods going between \u003ca href=\"https://ny.curbed.com/2018/4/24/17276238/nyc-manhattan-brooklyn-the-bronx-one-bedroom-rent-prices-comparison\"\u003e$2,000-$2,500 per month\u003c/a\u003e — more than half of what the \u003ca href=\"https://www.census.gov/mycd/?st=36\u0026amp;cd=09\"\u003emedian household in the district\u003c/a\u003e makes in income. Meanwhile, the city and state have poured hundreds of millions of dollars into Prospect Heights’ Pacific Park development — which includes Barclays Center and surrounding luxury apartments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn January, James launched his campaign to challenge Rep. Yvette Clarke, a seven-term incumbent and champion of the Pacific Park development, in the Democratic primary next spring. James, a democratic socialist, will also have to beat out Adem Bunkeddeko, who narrowly lost to Clarke in 2018 after earning the endorsement of the New York Times, for the progressive vote. (Alexander Hubbard, a tech worker, and Michael Hiller, a Manhattan-based attorney, have more recently filed as candidates.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo pull off an upset in the style of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, James is banking on building a grassroots campaign with what could be the most ambitious plan in Congress’s history to guarantee quality, affordable housing for all Americans. Clarke has taken more corporate money from Amazon than any other New York City rep, and Bunkedekko has ties to predatory real estate developers. James, on the other hand, said that he would introduce a bill to fully fund all public housing authorities in the country as soon as he gets into office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Isiah James is far closer to where the activist base is within the district,\u0026#8221; said Sam Molik, a campaign strategist who works with progressive candidates. \u0026#8220;This guy genuinely cares about the average, everyday lived experience of his neighborhood. \u0026#8230; That’s a level of care and understanding you just don’t see from most people running for office.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c!-- BLOCK(photo)[0](%7B%7D)(%7B%22scroll%22%3Afalse%2C%22align%22%3A%22bleed%22%2C%22bleed%22%3A%22large%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22auto%22%7D) --\u003e\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-bleed large-bleed width-auto' style='width: auto;'\u003e\u003c!-- CONTENT(photo)[0] --\u003e\n\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-article-large wp-image-266403\" src=\"https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/09/isiah-james-profile-11-1567631144.jpg\" alt=\"Isiah James talks about his platform with Brooklyn residents.

Ainda é cedo, mas os ataques mútuos entre Doria e Bolsonaro marcam o início da disputa para atrair o eleitorado identificado com a direita. Enquanto isso, a esquerda segue dividida, desarticulada e paralisada diante da violência do bolsonarismo no poder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNa última segunda-feira, foi lançado na PUC, em São Paulo, um manifesto que busca reorganizar a oposição. Batizado de \u0026#8220;Direitos Já! \u0026#8211; Fórum pela Democracia\u0026#8221;, o movimento é uma tentativa de formar uma frente ampla em defesa da democracia contra os ataques do governo Bolsonaro. O nome do movimento é uma referência às Diretas Já, criado no início dos anos 1980, quando o campo democrático, ainda sob a ditadura, se uniu para reivindicar eleições presidenciais diretas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRepresentantes de 16 partidos e integrantes de diversos segmentos sociais estiveram presentes na PUC. Nomes importantes como Flávio Dino, do PCdoB, o pedetista Ciro Gomes, Márcio França, do PSB, Marta Suplicy, hoje sem partido, deixaram as rusgas de lado em nome da defesa da democracia. Nomes como Kassab (PSD) e os tucanos FHC, Alckmin e Anastasia mandaram mensagens de apoio. É\u0026#8230;eu sei, mas uma frente ampla contra a barbárie não pode ser encarada um clubinho de amigos, mas como um movimento heterogêneo, que reúne amplo espectro da sociedade em torno da defesa de valores democráticos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[0](%7B%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"shortcode\" data-shortcode=\"newsletter\" data-campaign=\"\" data-cta=\"\" data-headline=\"\" data-layout=\"\" data-subhead=\"\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[0] --\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEngolir alguns nomes de centro-direita me parece um preço razoável a se pagar pela defesa da civilização. O avanço da extrema direita não é uma exclusividade brasileira. A formação de frentes amplas desse tipo tem sido a saída que os democratas de vários países encontraram para combater governos autoritários. Não se trata mais de esquerda x direita, mas de civilização x barbárie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA missão do movimento é complicada. Há muitos traumas decorrentes do impeachment, e juntar opositores tradicionais não é fácil. Mas me parece evidente que a ampliação do arco em apoio à defesa dos valores democráticos é o único caminho possível para o enfrentamento à escalada do autoritarismo. Infelizmente nem todos no campo progressista pensam assim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePetistas também participaram do evento, alguns até ajudaram na organização. Mas nenhum dirigente compareceu, o que indica que o partido não irá entrar de cabeça no movimento. Fernando Haddad, que chegou a participar da gestação do grupo em maio, confirmou presença no evento, mas simplesmente não apareceu. Não mandou um recado para ser lido no evento como fizeram outros ausentes, nem mandou um representante. Assim como Haddad, o psolista Guilherme Boulos também participou das primeiras reuniões, mas decidiu não comparecer.

O partido decidiu não se envolver institucionalmente com o movimento por não poder controlar suas pautas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNas redes sociais, parte da militância petista colocou em dúvida a informação do Estadão, dizendo que o PT não participou porque o evento foi organizado pelo PSDB. Não é verdade. O principal idealizador do movimento é o sociólogo Fernando Guimarães, um tucano que lidera uma corrente de esquerda dentro do PSDB.

A condenação de Lula é fruto de um processo de deterioração das instituições democráticas, que culminou com a eleição de Bolsonaro e se intensificou brutalmente com seu governo. Na minha opinião, a defesa de um ex-presidente que foi vítima de um julgamento político deveria ser uma bandeira fundamental de todos que estão dispostos a defender a democracia, mas não é essa a realidade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c!-- BLOCK(promote-related-post)[2](%7B%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22relatedPostNumber%22%3A1%7D) --\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"promote-embed\" data-related-post-number=\"1\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c!-- END-BLOCK(promote-related-post)[2] --\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHá muita gente no campo democrático que discorda de que essa seja uma boa estratégia no combate ao bolsonarismo.

As pesquisas indicavam que apenas Lula venceria Bolsonaro em um segundo turno. Com a confirmação de que o ex-presidente não poderia disputar, o partido escolheu Haddad de última hora, apostando que a transferência de votos de Lula para o candidato do PT aconteceria de forma natural. Àquela altura, já estava claro que o antipetismo era mais forte que Haddad. Era a hora de recuar e compor com Ciro Gomes na cabeça de chapa para tentar evitar a tragédia Bolsonaro. O nome do pedetista aparecia nas pesquisas como o único com chances de derrotar Bolsonaro no segundo turno. Mesmo assim, Ciro não seria garantia de vitória, pelo contrário. As chances de perder também eram grandes. Mas ali poderia ser o início da construção de uma oposição sólida ao bolsonarismo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMas o PT preferiu perder como protagonista do que tentar ganhar como coadjuvante. A estratégia foi boa para o partido, que perdeu a eleição, mas manteve a hegemonia no campo oposicionista ao formar a maior bancada na Câmara.

Esse é um dado da realidade que não pode ser mais ignorado. O bolsonarismo não é uma força política convencional. É liderado por um ex-militar rancoroso, autoritário, imbuído da missão de desmontar o estado, agradar a horda de seguidores fanáticos e passar o trator em cima de quem pensa diferente.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eO PT calcula que o melhor a se fazer é deixar Bolsonaro sangrando até 2022, perdendo popularidade e, assim, derrotar a direita nas urnas. É um erro. É subestimar mais uma vez a força avassaladora do antipetismo, que não vai sumir do dia para noite. Corre-se o risco de não se ter nem democracia nem Lula livre.

ETAK is field mountable and dismountable and does not degrade the capabilities of the existing system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e“The goal of ETAK is to increase the Soldiers’ capability to acquire and engage targets with man-portable weapons,” Novak said. “In addition to being able to acquire targets, the system is also able to show where friendly units are. This capability will help reduce the possibility of having a friendly fire incident on the battlefield.

The use of petrol has barely declined 10 percent in the past five years since this green revolution started, and as has been \u003ca href=\"https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Busting-The-Myth-Of-The-Worlds-Hottest-Electric-Car-Market.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003epointed\u003c/a\u003e out elsewhere, much of the reduction is simply through cleaner petrol vehicles replacing outdated models.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut forget all the numbers, the failure of this policy was predictable just on an intuitive level. As it is any time you use grotesque market distortions to force people to obtain an inferior product. Look at your mobile phone. Now imagine that the government tells you that it will sell you a fancier-looking handset for half the money, but that it will only work where there is Wi-Fi. I guess if you have the spare cash, you\u0026rsquo;ll buy it, but you won\u0026rsquo;t use it all the time, and you probably won\u0026rsquo;t want it to be your only phone. So what you have obtained is a trendy plaything, and one made from expensive materials that was sent to you from half the world away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is exactly what these electric cars are \u0026ndash; imported playthings. Not to mention the egregious oddness of the government trying to push you so hard into undesirable consumer choices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause if you think people actually do want electric cars, and would consider buying them without all these handouts once they\u0026rsquo;ve tried them and the infrastructure is there, consider the case of neighboring Denmark. In 2015, with lavish subsidies \u0026ndash; though nowhere near as rich as those in Norway \u0026ndash; nearly 5,000 vehicles were sold. In 2017, incentives drop, fewer than 1,000 vehicles were sold.\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n        \u003cimg src=\"https://cdni.rt.com/files/2019.09/original/5d72993020302766be6024e2.JPG\"  /\u003e\n                    \u003cfigcaption\u003e\n                                    Equinor's oil platform in Norway's Johan Sverdrup oilfield in the North Sea\n                \n                \u003cspan class = \"copyright\"\u003e\n                       ©\u0026nbsp; REUTERS/NERIJUS ADOMAITIS                                                        \u003c/span\u003e\n            \u003c/figcaption\u003e\n            \u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe whole masquerade illustrates a deeper truth about Norway.

If it really wanted to tackle CO2 emissions in the world, it would simply curtail its extractive industries, rather than pumping the taxes collected from these industries into indulgent white elephant schemes to purchase slick new cars for its ethically-pampered burghers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Norway doesn\u0026rsquo;t really care about the world. It claims to be setting an example to other countries. But its electric car revolution is unaffordable to any but the wealthiest states.

For the first eight months of 2019, exports were off 1% from a year earlier and imports were down 5.6%.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChina\u0026#8217;s global trade surplus rose 25% from a year earlier to $34.8 billion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExports to the European Union rose 3% from a year earlier to $38.3 billion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eU.S.-Chinese negotiations broke down in May over how to enforce any agreement. Beijing says Trump\u0026#8217;s punitive tariffs must be lifted once an agreement takes effect. Washington says some must stay to ensure Beijing carries out any promises it makes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed in June to resume negotiations, though neither side shifted its position. Talks in Shanghai in July ended with no indication of progress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe governments agreed to meet again in September but that was postponed to October. They have yet to announce a date.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWashington imposed 15% tariffs on Sept. 1 on $112 billion of Chinese imports and plans to hit another $160 billion on Dec. 15. That would extend penalties to almost everything the United States buys from China.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeijing responded by imposing duties of 10% and 5% on a range of American imports. More increases are due on Dec. 15 in line with the U.S. penalties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eU.S. tariffs of 25% imposed previously on $250 billion of Chinese goods are due to rise to 30% on Oct. 1.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChina has imposed or announced penalties on an estimated $120 billion of U.S. imports. Some have been hit with increases more than once, while about $50 billion of U.S. goods is unaffected, possibly to avoid disrupting Chinese industries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeijing also has retaliated by canceling purchases of soybeans, the biggest single U.S. export to China.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Chinese government has agreed to narrow its trade surplus with the U.S. but is reluctant to give up development strategies it sees as a path to prosperity and global influence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome analysts suggest Beijing is holding out in hopes Trump will feel pressure to make a more favorable deal as his campaign for the 2020 presidential election picks up. Trump has warned that if he is reelected, China will face a tougher U.S. negotiating stance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/time/world/~4/LJBiPWyFbSM\" height=\"1\"

Tafreshi\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The recent conflicts in London have escalated so greatly that everybody has become concerned about the future of Boris Johnson’s incoming government, and believes that Britain is heading towards the problems with a quite dark prospect,” Tafreshi said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The basic (current) problem in London is that Johnson’s government is faced with a Parliament in which the cabinet and the prime minister himself are not in the majority. Reports suggest that Liberal Democrats have been strengthened in recent days to the detriment of Boris Johnson. These have all happened while Johnson still follows the dream of a no-deal Brexit, which has become an absolute nightmare for Britain.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The UK government and Johnson have failed to attract the Parliament’s support for a hard Brexit. Even the European Union is seeking to pressurize him into avoiding a no-deal Brexit. In this regard, the hours ahead would be very tough for Johnson,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Under these conditions, Johnson would have three paths out of the predicament: first, dissolution of the Parliament and holding a new election to design and implement the no-deal Brexit; second, postponing the Brexit; and third, holding a new referendum on Brexit, which would undoubtedly require a new government to hold the office. Johnson would be wanting to marginalize and put off the latter option. He wants to put the British people in a situation where there\u0026#8217;s no choice, so that the Conservatives could win the votes. However, these are not the only problems, because the leader of the Labour Party has a different scenario in mind,” he explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReferring to the recent comments and stances from the UK Labour Party’s leader, Tafreshi said, “Jeremy Corbyn seeks to put pressure on Johnson for holding an early election in order to hit the Conservatives ultimately. His remarks and behaviour have naturally concerned the Jewish lobby in the UK and inside the Parliament, and as a result, he might receive a blow from that current and end up being marginalized. Because his replacement will be more favorable to both the Jewish lobby and Johnson. In the meanwhile, Boris Johnson is interested in carrying out the hard Brexit, but the question is whether he can do it, because he will have to win support from the European countries. On the other hand, disagreements inside Britain are so strong that his dream of a hard Brexit has turned into a nightmare.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“One should consider that the UK Parliament went on recess in August, but it was clear that we would see the lull before the storm in September and October, because the case of Brexit is still open and faces a bleak future. In the meanwhile, the attacks on Corbyn have increased, since Johnson thought that he could take advantage of this party to serve his interests. In such conditions, the right-leaning British media are constantly releasing and reviewing reports about Corbyn’s support for Palestine, Iran, and closer ties with Muslims, as well as about his anti-war activities, and have come to a common conclusion that he is anti-Semite. Corbyn has repeatedly dismissed these allegations and has stated that he is not an anti-Semite, but attacks on him still continue,” Tafreshi added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Johnson’s ploy to deal with Corbyn is to label him an anti-Semite in order to beat him out and relieve the pressures. Johnson had already used a similar scenario against the former mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, that worked, but I believe that Corbyn is not facing a serious threat. What has become possible for now is that an early election could take place, probably during the last three weeks of September until mid-October.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“On the other hand, Johnson is likely to be dismissed, because it is all about Brexit and he is unable to perform a hard exit. However, the resignation of individuals like Jo Johnson – Boris Johnson’s younger brother and a member of the Conservative Party \u0026#8211; because of his support for the national interest and family commitments clearly indicates that the situation within the ruling party is not appropriate,” he concluded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe post \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ifpnews.com/dark-future-awaiting-johnsons-government-analyst\"\u003eDark Future Awaiting Johnson’s Government: Analyst\u003c/a\u003e appeared first on \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ifpnews.com\"\u003eIran Front Page\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://ifpnews.com/dark-future-awaiting-johnsons-government-analyst","published":"2019-09-08T06:12:47Z","guid":"https://ifpnews.com/?p=150945"},{"title":"Iran Develops Homegrown Decanter Centrifuges","content":"\u003cp\u003eDecanter centrifuges have applications in such industries as fruit juice and liquid oil production.
