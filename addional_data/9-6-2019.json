It's not moving anyone to pen an existential poem about nature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the upside, the $1,000-a-pop buttercream bucket chairs inherited from Grace are crazy comfortable, which is key when you're settling in for 10 courses ($205). (A condensed five-course menu is offered, as well, for $110.) And unlike the design, the food at Y?gen does have the ability to make your brain swell and skin prickle: a quivering Satori oyster in the sheerest tempura bodysuit; a marshmallow-like cube of sweet-pea-and-tofu souffl? floating in miso consomm? of astounding clarity; pristine kanpachi sashimi flavored with lemonade-like sweetness of candied Buddha's Hand.

Topped with choice of cheese, a panko-crusted fried green tomato, Asian pear jam, tomato-pickle aioli, truffle oil, and arugula, that burger was named the best in town in 2012 at the city's annual food and wine festival. It's still on the menu at the caf?, which Katsumura's mother, Nobuko, has continued to operate after Yoshi's passing in 2015.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike many immigrants who get their foothold in America in the restaurant industry, her parents \"did everything in their power to make sure that [their children] didn't follow in their footsteps,\" Katsumura says. She studied art--which makes sense when you behold her talent for plating--but was drawn back to the kitchen. \"I would say I've come full circle,\" which is doubly true when you consider that Katsumura's style echoes her father's. Only at Y?gen, the techniques are just as often Japanese as they are European, and the ingredients just as often American as they are Japanese.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen it works, man, it works.

Katsumura weaves these bundles into a wreath with fried and pickled mushrooms, toasted kale, and pickled huckleberries, the delicate fruit leaching deep purple swirls into the sauce, a classic \u003cem\u003ebeurre mont?\u003c/em\u003e fortified with \u003cem\u003ekombu\u003c/em\u003e oil.

It feels like Katsumura has a ferocious urge to get all her ideas onto one plate. Almost every course could do with one or two fewer components.

But teasing out flavors and textures from, say, a crumb-coated Good Humor Strawberry Shortcake ice cream bar and putting them back together into something fresh and interesting is extra tricky in the context of a Japanese-ish tasting menu that costs more than the monthly lease payment on a Hyundai Elantra.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLamadieu is up for the challenge. The strawberry pre-dessert was a three-bite pink Zamboni, wiping clean the persistent umami and allium heat of the previous course with pulverized strawberry streusel (the inspirational popsicle's signature crumbs), racy kefir sorbet, strawberry caramel, strawberry jus, and arugula. It possesses that floral sweetness and zingy acid that makes a strawberry perfect but is exceedingly hard to translate into a strawberry dessert.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"inline-image-default-width aligncenter\"  \u003e\u003ca href=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/milk-and-cookies.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg data-attachment-id=\"2646404\" data-permalink=\"http://fortune.com/longform/restaurant-review-yugen-chicago/milk-and-cookies/\" data-orig-file=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/milk-and-cookies.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"2880,1920\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{\u0026quot;aperture\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;credit\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;camera\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;created_timestamp\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;copyright\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;focal_length\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;iso\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;shutter_speed\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;title\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;orientation\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Milk-and-Cookies\" data-image-description=\"\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Anthony Tahlier\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/milk-and-cookies.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/milk-and-cookies.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2646404\" src=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/milk-and-cookies.jpg?w=1024\u0026#038;h=683\" alt=\"Milk-and-Cookies\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/milk-and-cookies.jpg?w=1024\u0026amp;h=683 1024w, https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/milk-and-cookies.jpg?w=2048\u0026amp;h=1366 2048w, https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/milk-and-cookies.jpg?w=150\u0026amp;h=100 150w, https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/milk-and-cookies.jpg?w=300\u0026amp;h=200 300w, https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/milk-and-cookies.jpg?w=768\u0026amp;h=512 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"image-caption\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"caption\"\u003eMilk and cookies at Y?gen.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"credit\"\u003eCourtesy of Anthony Tahlier\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA meditation on Oreos as cereal follows.

The Momentum Index, issued by Dodge Data \u0026amp; Analytics, is a monthly measure of the first (or initial) report for nonresidential building projects in planning, which have been shown to lead construction spending for nonresidential buildings by a full year. The May decline for the Momentum Index was due entirely to a 6.9% drop by its commercial component, as its institutional component rose 8.1%.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe Momentum Index continues to settle back from the most recent highs achieved last summer. \u003cb\u003eOn a year-over-year basis, the Momentum Index in May was 9.2% lower than a year ago\u003c/b\u003e, with a 16.0% drop by its commercial component outweighing a 1.8% gain by its institutional component.

In that 1990 horror-comedy, a small Southwestern town called Perfection suffers from an infestation of people-eating sandworms (called Graboids) that local not-so-brainy beefcake Val McKee (Bacon) eventually beats back. Ars' Culture Writer \u003ca href=\"https://arstechnica.com/author/jenniferouellette/\"\u003eJennifer Ouellette\u003c/a\u003e casually refers to this movie as \"perfection,\" not an uncommon sentiment. If B-movie horror with flashes of comedic brilliance and a few edge-of-your-seat scares interests you, viewers likely can't do much better than \u003cem\u003eTremors.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo when news of a modern reboot for television first trickled out in 2015, this development triggered both cautious optimism and premature regret. Various sequels already existed in the straight-to-DVD world, as well as a short-lived 2003 cable series. But they resembled the over-the-top camp of \u003cem\u003eSharknado\u003c/em\u003e more than \u003cem\u003eTremors\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet, Bacon agreed to both reprising his role and executive producing. Writer \u003ca href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0587884/\"\u003eAndrew Miller\u003c/a\u003e put together the script.

Even the most diehard fans couldn't wish for much more 25 years after the original cult classic.

That Ask Whether Humans and Nature Were Always Incompatible","content":"\u003cp\u003e“One of the extraordinary adaptive powers of our species,” Karen Russell writes in her new collection of stories, “is its ability to transmute a stray encounter into a first chapter.” A stray encounter, she describes, could involve the meeting of a 22-year-old man and a 26-year-old woman in a Pennsylvania bar and, soon after, the sudden decision to quit their jobs, rent a car, and drive to the Mojave Desert in California. Because this is a Karen Russell book, a stray encounter could also find that same woman pricking her finger on a Joshua Tree spine, the “insoluble spirit” of the sentient plant leaping into the woman’s body, and the creature immediately realizing it has made a horrible mistake. “Compared with the warm and expansive desert soil,” it laments, “the human body is a cul-de-sac.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn \u003ci\u003eOrange World and Other Stories\u003c/i\u003e, Russell’s third short-story collection and fifth book, nature and humankind find themselves many mistakes removed from their first chance meeting. A May-December relationship that was probably doomed from the start, the romance between \u003ci\u003eHomo sapiens\u003c/i\u003e and whatever life force connects all species on Earth has soured, their differences enormous, their protracted breakup violent. That only half the partnership—guess which one—is just beginning to understand this is where the horror begins for the characters in \u003ci\u003eOrange World\u003c/i\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs she has done\u003cb\u003e \u003c/b\u003esince debuting her 2006 collection, \u003ci\u003eSt. Lucy’s Home for Girls Raised by Wolves\u003c/i\u003e, Russell is playing to anxieties about humanity’s place in the natural world. Her characters tend to behave as if they’re not sure whether they belong to nature or it belongs to them, and when they do land on the correct answer, it’s usually much too late. Whereas Russell’s previous collections treated these worries with doses of myth and magical realism, in \u003ci\u003eOrange World\u003c/i\u003e, Russell is fully awake to the nightmarish side of her imagination.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/04/wildlife-series-finally-addresses-elephant-room/586066/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: Netflix’s ‘Our Planet’ says what other nature series have omitted\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBorn and raised in Miami, the author explicitly addresses climate change in only a handful of \u003ci\u003eOrange World’\u003c/i\u003es stories, most notably “The Gondoliers,” set in a near-future South Florida that is all but entirely underwater. In “Bog Girl: A Romance,” its title alone suggesting \u003ci\u003eNight Shift\u003c/i\u003e–era Stephen King, a teenager drives a peat\u003cb\u003e \u003c/b\u003eharvester through Northern European bogs while wondering how “he could feel so perfectly indifferent to the [clean-energy] debate, even seated in the cab of the world-killing machine. Right or wrong? Right or wrong?” The windstorm-farming narrator of “The Tornado Auction” feels no such detachment, admitting that “when you’re raising weather by artificial means, it’s hard to pretend you don’t have a hand in the Change.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThose stories that don’t name the crisis are still haunted\u003cb\u003e \u003c/b\u003eby it. In “The Prospectors,” the book’s Great Depression–set opener, an avalanche turns 26 men into ghosts who fail to realize that they’re dead. All they want to do is party. In “The Bad Graft,” a park ranger believes that the “tremendous blossoming” of Joshua trees across the Southwest is “the ancient species’ Hail Mary pass.” Even “Black Corfu,” which takes place in 1620, carries the ineluctable dread of a civilization threatened by a world that can do without it. That Russell embodies this threat in 17th-century Croatian zombies and reinvigorates the exhausted walking-dead genre —“posthumous surgeons” sever the hamstrings of corpses to keep them in their graves—is yet another measure of her gifts.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRussell brings\u003cb\u003e \u003c/b\u003eplenty of surface-level absurdity to \u003ci\u003eOrange World. \u003c/i\u003e“The Tornado Auction” really does feature a tornado auction. “Madame Bovary’s Greyhound” affords a point of view—or, at least, “a shimmering precursor to consciousness”—to the dog in Gustave Flaubert’s novel. The book’s title story concerns a minor devil, “a knockoff Satan,” who tricks new mothers into nursing him.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut as clever as all this may be, Russell has weighted the characters in \u003ci\u003eOrange World\u003c/i\u003e with personal crises that—to them—can seem as monumental as global ones. All extinction fears are local, after all. Injustice and loss of reputation frighten the doctor at the center of “Black Corfu” as much as his island’s zombies do. In “The Gondoliers,” the youngest of four sisters has secretly violated a code they established in order to survive in watery New Florida. The farmer in “The Tornado Auction,” meanwhile, is at odds with his disapproving\u003cb\u003e \u003c/b\u003edaughters and mourning just about everyone he’s ever known. “One by one they died,” he says, “my mother, my father, my brothers, my bosses, my rivals, my storms, my wife, and turned my world into an afterlife.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/17/books/review/karen-russell-orange-world.html?searchResultPosition=1\"\u003eReviewers\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://fsgworkinprogress.com/2015/01/30/the-peculiar-states-of-florida/\"\u003enovelists\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/05/18/724569324/short-stories-in-orange-world\"\u003eRussell herself\u003c/a\u003e have credited the strange frequencies passing through her stories to the writer’s \u003ca href=\"https://www.more.com/entertainment/fun/wtflorida-four-theories-why-florida-weirdest-state\"\u003esupposedly weird\u003c/a\u003e home state.

What’s most unusual about Russell’s work is how paradoxically comforting it is, particularly right now, when it takes no great leap of the imagination to picture a world, orange or otherwise, without our species. This is not misanthropy or defeatism. Russell is scared, too, but her new book stands as a reminder that worrying about the future and grieving it are not the same thing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/Egk88moYmek\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/Egk88moYmek/","published":"2019-06-09T13:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-591049"},{"title":"The TV Is Too Damn Long","content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eChernobyl\u003c/em\u003e, which wrapped up its five-episode run on HBO last week, is one of the more unlikely hits of 2019—a bleak, panicky, emetic drama about a nuclear disaster whose defining stylistic qualities were British accents, a fanatical commitment to historical detail, and a score that sounded like two pieces of metal being scraped together. And yet: \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/05/chernobyl-gruesome-riveting-fable-hbo/588688/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eI loved it\u003c/a\u003e.

It was the kind of show whose stakes were so high that a two-degree helicopter detour could mean death. It was allegorical. And, best of all, the whole thing concluded in less than six hours.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt probably hasn’t escaped your notice that television episodes are getting longer. The paradox of living in this specific cultural moment is that people have less free time than ever and infinitely more things to watch—and yet the powers that be have been compelled to stretch many of those shows into packages that rival, in their running time, the audiobook of \u003cem\u003eMoby Dick. \u003c/em\u003eSingle installments in dramatic series run 70, 80, even 90 minutes long. Mid-season streaming episodes in which not a single dynamic thing happens reliably last an entire hour. Even existing shows returning for contemporary continuations or reboots are getting drawn out into formats that simply don’t do them favors.

They’re carefully structured and intentionally taut. And they reward viewers who enjoy engaging mindfully with shows, rather than listening to them with one ear while idly scrolling through Instagram.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe scourge of overlong television episodes—as has been \u003ca href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2018/04/long-episodes-are-the-manspreading-of-tv.html\"\u003ethoughtfully documented\u003c/a\u003e by Kathryn VanArendonk at \u003cem\u003eVulture\u003c/em\u003e—is a reaction to the rise of prestige television. On premium cable, where shows can fill a whole hour without ads, the 55-minute episode used to be a hallmark of series such as \u003cem\u003eThe Sopranos \u003c/em\u003eand \u003cem\u003eThe Wire\u003c/em\u003e. And over time, length came to be correlated with quality, and with TV auteurs who declined to have their genius constrained by such arbitrary forces as “formats” or “editors.” It’s a gendered phenomenon that VanArendonk called “the manspreading of TV,” where creators demand the same time privileges as other prestige dramas, and so episodes creep further and further beyond the boundaries of the 60-minute mark. Overlong episodes have come to be associated with quality, but also with power. All eight episodes of Matthew Weiner’s recent Amazon series \u003cem\u003eThe Romanoffs\u003c/em\u003e ran between 63 and 90 minutes. Four out of the six final episodes of \u003cem\u003eGame of Thrones \u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://time.com/4913247/game-of-thrones-season-8-premiere-date/\"\u003eran at least 75 minutes long\u003c/a\u003e—not because they needed to, but because who, at HBO, could say no?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe trend plays out slightly differently on streaming television, where series feel like they’re running long for no reason other than that they can. At this point in life, I’m habituated to the inevitability that the most impotent mid-season episodes of a Netflix drama will also be the ones that are 57 minutes long. Netflix seems, thankfully, to have moved away from the 13-episode standard of its Marvel superhero shows, series that padded out TV episodes as if they were mountaineers dressing for Everest. All too often, though, success means extension, like \u003cem\u003eThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel \u003c/em\u003ebeing bumped from eight episodes to 10, or \u003cem\u003eThe Handmaid’s Tale \u003c/em\u003efrom 10 to 13, a creative decision that’s only further exposed how challenging the Hulu series finds plotting.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe phenomenon of stretched-out television is frustrating because, among other things, it isn’t necessary. It’s cheaper to make shows with fewer episodes, and it doesn’t mean viewers will enjoy them any less. \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/04/gentleman-jack-jaunty-disappointment/587893/?utm_source=feed\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eGentleman Jack\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, HBO’s co-production with the BBC about the architect of Britain’s first lesbian marriage, could have been an exceptional costume drama in the standard three- or four-episode miniseries template; drawn out across eight hours, it struggled to find things for its heroine to do.

That’s not to say that the eight-episode drama can’t be well crafted.

Now Trump Is Using the Same Playbook.","content":"\u003cp\u003eThe general-election campaign is happening today. And Donald Trump is running unopposed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePresidents who have recently won reelection seeded their victories not in the final sprint before Election Day, but by executing a two-year campaign to exploit a contentious primary on the other side, reconnect with their base of supporters, and define the election as a choice, not a referendum. I served as the national press secretary on President Barack Obama’s 2012 reelection campaign, when we used that strategy to great effect. Now I’m watching President Trump executing the same strategy that powered Obama to reelection, while the Democratic organizations that could answer him have left an open playing field in the battleground states where the election will be decided.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Trump campaign launched at the start of 2019 and hasn’t paused for a day. It is using the candidate’s schedule, a staffed-up campaign team, and a sophisticated digital-advertising effort to reach its target voters. The campaign has spent more than \u003ca href=\"https://2020campaigntracker.com/\"\u003e$5 million on Facebook ads\u003c/a\u003e, with a particular focus on older voters and women, firing up the base by attacking “fake news” and promoting its message on immigration. The advertising team has gone beyond social-media campaigns, sponsoring podcasts and creating a significant paid-media presence on YouTube. In fact, Trump is outspending Democrats six to one on video ads, the primary digital-engagement tool for voters today.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSimultaneously, Trump has begun to hold rallies in battleground states across the country, dipping into media markets where he can fire up his base, such as Panama City, Florida, and battleground markets, such as Green Bay, Wisconsin. Many of these visits lead to localized polling bumps that last for weeks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLook no further than \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/kayleighmcenany\"\u003ethe Trump campaign’s press secretary’s Twitter feed\u003c/a\u003e to watch daily footage of the campaign reconnecting with supporters and asking them to engage its networks. Trump’s campaign manager is raising general-election funds and appearing before influential audiences.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, neither the Democratic National Committee nor any of the major Democratic super PACs are live with any notable broadcast or digital-advertising budget in battleground states targeted toward general-election swing voters. The 23 Democratic presidential campaigns are naturally focused on proximate targets, such as winning early states and meeting the DNC’s fundraising thresholds. As a partner at Bully Pulpit Interactive, a communications and digital-marketing agency that has in the past served as an advertiser for Democratic presidential campaigns and super PACs, I follow this world closely. I’ve seen a number of campaigns begin to spend on digital advertising, but their ads are not focused on messages that will erode support for Trump. That’s not the role they are expected to play at this stage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDemocrats face the urgent necessity of countering the Trump campaign in the battleground states. The leading Democratic presidential candidates have \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/04/democrats-lackluster-fundraising-2020-sanders-harris-trump/587377/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eraised less this year\u003c/a\u003e than they did in 2007. (In the first quarter, Senator Bernie Sanders topped out at $18.2 million, followed by Senator Kamala Harris at $12 million. In the first quarter of 2007, Hillary Clinton raised $26.1 million, and Barack Obama raised $25.7 million.) Democratic donors may be sitting on the sidelines because the field is wide and they are undecided. But if so, that also represents an opportunity. They could fund an effort that turns to the general election today even if they haven’t picked their primary horse.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere is no dearth of advertising material to air. The Chinese are importing soybeans from Russia and Brazil instead of Iowa and Ohio. Trump is steadily unwinding protections for LGBTQ Americans. Taxes have gone up on some voters who pay state income taxes after Republicans repealed the state and local tax exemption. And Democrats are again fighting to protect health-care benefits. The content writes itself.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat worries me is that I’ve implemented many aspects of the strategy that the Trump campaign has been executing. The groundwork for President Obama’s 2012 victory against Mitt Romney was laid in 2011. In November of that year, \u003cem\u003eThe\u003c/em\u003e \u003cem\u003eNew York Times Magazine\u003c/em\u003e ran a cover story called “Is Obama Toast?” declaring that Obama had a 17 percent chance of winning reelection based on the economic indicators that had been historically predictive of whether the president wins reelection.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe on the Obama campaign didn’t let those early odds intimidate us. By the spring, we had launched a major effort to reinvigorate Obama’s activists, define Romney to swing voters by highlighting his every jolt to the right, and build a data-driven field and persuasion effort. Quietly, we fed research to media outlets that would highlight Romney’s hypocrisy, providing ammunition to his Republican-primary opponents, and draw attention to the deficiencies in his record in the private sector and as governor, which would concern general-election voters. And as we tested and finessed the most effective frame for the general election, we learned that we needed to do more education about Obama’s success in turning around the economy after the financial crisis.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe, too, had studied prior playbooks. President George W. Bush used the Democratic knife fight between Dick Gephardt, Howard Dean, Wesley Clark, and John Kerry to define the field as angry and unpatriotic and to begin to conduct a persuasion campaign to the segment of voters that would decide the election. In 1995, President Bill Clinton took swift action to recover from devastating losses in the midterm elections by linking Bob Dole with the more extreme and unpopular Newt Gingrich.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile Trump’s soft poll numbers may suggest otherwise, the general-election battle won’t be easy, in large part because he’s getting a head start. The Trump campaign entertained appeals from the Russians and WikiLeaks the last time around; it’s anyone’s guess what measures he and his staff will take to win reelection. The Democratic candidates should be careful not to get caught up in a primary debate that rewards purity (No fundraisers! Attend every forum regardless of audience!) over preparing a precise plan to win the broadest set of voters in order to halt President Trump’s historic assault on Democratic—and democratic—values.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s not time for Democrats to despair; it’s time for us to engage. Because primary campaigns have finite resources and shorter-term needs to address before they can get to the main battle, the DNC and allied super PACs need to begin advertising now in battleground states to provide air cover for the future nominee while he or she is tied up in what will likely be a highly competitive and lengthy primary race.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDonors, including those waiting to pick their favored candidate, should invest now in a serious, year-long fill-the-gap effort that ensures that the Trump campaign’s dominance is checked as quickly as possible. And activists, as they engage in primary organizing, should also consider what steps they can take today to win next year’s election, from registering voters to persuading swing voters in battleground states.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf Democrats don’t act now, the Trump campaign will define the general election on its own terms, before we can even choose our nominee.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/kZyKwgZKavQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/kZyKwgZKavQ/","published":"2019-06-09T10:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-591265"}]},{"url":"https://feeds.feedburner.com/time/topstories?format=xml","items":[{"title":"President Trump Still Floats Tariff Threat Over Mexico Despite Deal","content":"\u003caside class=\"right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad\" id=\"right-rail__ad-5603622\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module\" data-src=\"https://time.com/5603622/trump-mexico-tariff-threats/\" data-widget-id=\"SB_2\" data-ob-template=\"timemag\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(STERLING, Va.) \u0026mdash; President Donald Trump on Sunday dangled the prospect of renewing his tariff threat against Mexico if the U.S. ally doesn\u0026#8217;t cooperate on border issues, while some of his Democratic challengers for the White House said the last-minute \u003ca href=\"https://www.state.gov/u-s-mexico-joint-declaration/\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003edeal\u003c/a\u003e to avert trade penalties was overblown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a series of tweets, Trump defended the agreement heading off the 5% tax on all Mexican goods that he had threatened to impose Monday, but he warned Mexico that, \u0026#8220;if for some unknown reason\u0026#8221; cooperation fails, \u0026#8220;we can always go back to our previous, very profitable, position of Tariffs.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"time-embed time-embed__twitter\" data-provider=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1137697507218264064\" \u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"embed-twitter\"\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\"\u003e\n\u003cp lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u0026#8230;..there is not, we can always go back to our previous, very profitable, position of Tariffs \u0026#8211; But I don\u0026rsquo;t believe that will be necessary.

Mexico, however, had already intended to do that before Trump\u0026#8217;s latest threat and had made that clear to U.S. officials.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;We want to continue to work with the U.S. very closely on the different challenges that we have together. And one urgent one at this moment is immigration,\u0026#8221; said Mexico\u0026#8217;s ambassador in Washington, Martha Barcena.

Could he make this surge last? Would Nadal falter?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat the questions arose at all was significant. The answers arrived swiftly. Nadal reasserted himself, as he usually does at Roland Garros, by grabbing 16 of the next 17 points and 12 of the remaining 14 games, pulling away to beat Thiem 6-3, 5-7, 6-1, 6-1 for his record-extending 12th championship at the French Open.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;I gave everything I had,\u0026#8221; Thiem said. \u0026#8220;It\u0026#8217;s amazing: 12 times here.

Then again, no one ever has been as suited for success on any of the sport\u0026#8217;s surfaces as this 33-year-old Spaniard is on red clay: Nadal is 93-2 for his career at Roland Garros, winning four in a row from 2005-08, five in a row from 2010-14, and now three in a row.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;I can\u0026#8217;t explain my emotions,\u0026#8221; said the No. 2-seeded Nadal, who dropped to his back after the final point, getting that rust-colored dirt all over his neon yellow shirt, then wiped away tears during the trophy ceremony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking at the bigger picture, he is now up to 18 Grand Slam trophies, moving within two of Roger Federer\u0026#8217;s men\u0026#8217;s record of 20.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThiem, a 25-year-old Austrian who was seeded No. 4 and upset No. 1 Novak Djokovic in the semifinals, was eyeing his first major title in this rematch of the 2018 final in Paris. But again, he couldn\u0026#8217;t solve Nadal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;First thing that I want to say is congrats to Dominic.

This had been, by his lofty standards, a rough season, from the most lopsided Grand Slam final loss of his career \u0026mdash; against Djokovic at the Australian Open \u0026mdash; to entering May without a title for the first year since 2004.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started to right himself by taking the title on clay in Rome last month, then found himself in a familiar position in Paris: playing in the final, and winning it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis one began on a cloudy afternoon, with the temperature in the low 60s (mid-teens Celsius) and only a slight breeze. In the initial game \u0026mdash; interrupted briefly by a baby wailing in the stands, drawing a laugh from other spectators and prompting Nadal to back away from the baseline between serves \u0026mdash; three of the five points lasted at least 11 strokes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd, thereby, a pattern was established: By the end of the 3-hour, 1-minute match, a total of 46 points went 10 strokes or more. Each man claimed half.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth would station themselves along the baseline and sprint, scramble, slide, stretch to somehow reach just about every ball, not merely putting a racket on it but conjuring a booming reply. It was an impressive display of athleticism, skill and will, with Thiem managing to give just as good as he got, particularly with his ferocious backhand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the get-go, it was such a physical grind that Nadal was soaked with sweat and changed neon yellow shirts after seven games and 45 minutes, eliciting catcalls from the stands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEarly on, there were no signs of fatigue for Thiem, even though he was competing for a fourth straight day, because of rain that jumbled the schedule. Nadal, meanwhile, entered Sunday having played just once in the previous four days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot only that, but while Nadal dismissed Federer with relative ease in a straight-set semifinal that concluded Friday, Thiem was forced to work overtime, eliminating Djokovic in a five-setter that wrapped up less than 24 hours before the final began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThiem showed he can play defense. Showed he can flip to offense in a blink. Showed power off both sides. Showed precision, too, making only three of the match\u0026#8217;s first 12 unforced errors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIndeed, it was Thiem who nosed ahead first, closing a 12-stroke exchange by ripping a forehand to earn the first break point of the final, then converting it with an overhead to cap a 20-stroke point for a 3-2 edge. He turned with a clenched right hand to face his guest box, where all of his supporters were yelling and shaking fists, too, including his girlfriend, French tennis player Kristina Mladenovic, who won the women\u0026#8217;s doubles championship earlier in the day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNadal immediately responded. He grabbed the next four games with elan, using a drop shot to help break for a 5-3 lead, then a serve-and-volley to help hold for the set.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat must have been demoralizing for Thiem. But at the ensuing changeover, he didn\u0026#8217;t whack a ball toward the stands, as Federer memorably did during his semifinal loss. He didn\u0026#8217;t spike a racket or kick a ball. He casually sat in his gray sideline seat, bounced his legs and chewed on an energy bar, furtively glancing to his left at Nadal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThiem bounced back, if only briefly. Talk about a stunning shift: Nadal won 25 of 26 points on his serve before \u0026mdash; with spectators trading between-point chants of nicknames, \u0026#8220;Ra-fa!\u0026#8221; and \u0026#8220;Do-mi!\u0026#8221; \u0026mdash; he got broken to cede the second set. That was the only set he\u0026#8217;d managed to steal from Nadal in four career meetings at Roland Garros.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe this was going to be a long one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Thiem, put simply, wilted a bit. He made three unforced errors in the next set\u0026#8217;s opening game to get broken at love, creating an opening that Nadal barged through. By now, Nadal was creating magic at the net, and he won the point on 23 of 27 times he went forward. One drop volley was spun so marvelously that it landed on Thiem\u0026#8217;s side, then bounced back toward the net. All Thiem could do was watch \u0026mdash; and offer an appreciative thumbs-up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoon enough, it was over.

Current New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio had a particularly dismal showing: He received the support of exactly zero respondents — not just zero percent rounding downward, but he lacked the support of even a single respondent. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"JzoMm6\"\u003eWhile Biden still tops the field, his campaign may have reason to be concerned. \u003ca href=\"https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/iowa-poll/2018/12/16/iowa-poll-caucuses-2020-joe-biden-bernie-sanders-beto-orourke-elizabeth-warren-register-cnn-democrat/2312541002/\"\u003eBack in December\u003c/a\u003e, the same poll found his support to be at 32 percent; then \u003ca href=\"https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/iowa-poll/2019/03/10/election-2020-joe-biden-bernie-sanders-harris-warren-democrats-iowa-caucuses-poll-president-caucus/3098982002/\"\u003ein March\u003c/a\u003e, it had slipped to 27 percent; and now, he is at 24 percent — still in first place, but no longer in a clearly dominant position. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"8t1Wy5\"\u003eIt is important to keep in mind that in caucus states, voters’ second (or even third) choices can factor into the final result. If a candidate does not meet the minimum threshold of 15 percent support in a local precinct, each individual supporter has the opportunity to switch their support over to another candidate. With a field as large as the current one, it is very possible some caucus participants may well find themselves having to select another candidate to support. Because of this, the Iowa poll gave respondents the option to give three levels of possible support to each candidate: First choice, second choice, or “actively considering.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"N3n7gW\"\u003eWhen all three tiers of support (by those planning to vote in person) were added together, Biden again topped the list of candidates, with 61 percent possible support. However, Warren matched him exactly, with 61 percent possible support. Three other candidates manage to reach potential support of over 50 percent: Sanders at 56 percent, and Buttigieg and Harris, who each had 52 percent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"0FGRcC\"\u003eA major beneficiary in this poll is Elizabeth Warren: She was at just 8 percent in December, and then 9 percent in March. But she has now shot up to 15 percent support overall, in a dead heat with Sanders for the second-place position behind Biden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"qcPNF6\"\u003e“That’s a strong showing for Elizabeth Warren,” Selzer told the \u003cem\u003eRegister\u003c/em\u003e. “I think that all of the publicity lately and all of the polls lately are so Biden-heavy that for her to have any metric that shows her on par (with him) … it says to me there are people who are paying attention. Again, in a field this big, that’s step one. First, you have to get people to pay attention.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Lrdrk9\"\u003eHarris also appears to be a candidate with potential in Iowa, despite her current 5th place position. While the California senator was not the first choice of many voters, the same number of people listed her and Elizabeth Warren as their second choices (14 percent) and as candidates they were “actively considering” (32 percent). Harris does not quite have the same name recognition in the state as Biden, Warren, or Sanders, with 23 percent of respondents saying they were not sure what they thought of her. As she continues to campaign in Iowa, her standing could improve in a manner similar to Warren’s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"gv4gkR\"\u003eBernie Sanders seems to be stuck in place. In the December poll, his support was at 19 percent, then it went up to 25 percent in March — but now he is back down into the teens, at 16 percent. These numbers mark a sharp decline from the 2016 election cycle, when he nearly matched Hillary Clinton in the Iowa caucuses, and they show that he has a lot of work to do in a divided field.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"cwlLLf\"\u003eBeto O’Rourke, however, has not been stagnant; his support has dropped significantly. Back in December, the poll showed the former Texas congressman had 11 percent support among Iowa Democratic caucus-goers. This declined to only 5 percent support in the next poll in March. And this latest survey from the same pollster has his base shrinking to only 2 percent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"yzfb3T\"\u003ePete Buttigieg has experienced the opposite trend. In March, he was at only 1 percent support. (He wasn’t included in the December poll.) He is now at 14 percent, very nearly matching Warren. While he seems to have won supporters, it could be argued, that he needs to remain on guard and work to ensure he does not suffer the same boom-and-bust cycle as O’Rourke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"7tnnvB\"\u003eThe effect of the virtual caucus \u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"jKYEwp\"\u003eIn previous election cycles, caucus participation was limited to people who physically showed up at the local caucus sites.

Their support for candidates also seemed softer than the prospective in-person voters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"JUR6JF\"\u003eFor the moment, intended virtual voters are displaying different levels of support than the overall average: Joe Biden is at 33 percent with them, while Bernie Sanders is at just 10 percent, along with 10 percent for Kamala Harris, and 9 percent for Pete Buttigieg. Elizabeth Warren is the only top-tier candidate whose support is roughly even across both groups, with 14 percent among the likely virtual voters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"wZwbVs\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","url":"https://www.vox.com/2019/6/9/18658583/2020-iowa-democrats-poll-joe-biden-elizabeth-warren-pete-buttigieg","published":"2019-06-09T15:44:12Z","guid":"https://www.vox.com/2019/6/9/18658583/2020-iowa-democrats-poll-joe-biden-elizabeth-warren-pete-buttigieg"},{"title":"Chernobyl’s stellar finale makes a case for the show as science fiction","content":"\u003cimg alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5kgs_b39ne4XJSP9dJcOPh2Ab2Q=/229x0:2100x1403/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/63974664/a6e2f8daf120b54f869c6314d5d8bb449217064adf782530c4f74fef995035b6005e1fdc8e1faee847f46b863c02926a.0.jpg\" /\u003e\n\n\n\n  \u003cp\u003eIt also cements the show’s status as one of the best TV shows of the year.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp id=\"i5zmv9\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eEvery week, we pick a new episode of the week.

The red ones represent a nuclear plant cascading toward a disaster that will soon engulf large portions of Europe in radiation, require the evacuation of an entire city, and kill as many as 90,000 people. As blue turns to red, no matter how calm the man’s voice remains, we know doom is on the horizon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"WUgJOk\"\u003eThis is the trick of \u003cem\u003eChernobyl\u003c/em\u003e, one of my favorite TV shows of the year so far and a surprise hit for both HBO and Sky, the British network that co-funded it. The five-episode miniseries breaks down big, impossibly dense topics, in part by having actors you know and love from other projects explain them to you in minute detail. But it’s never boring, perhaps because it opens with the explosion and its immediate aftermath, so you know what’s at stake (in the worst-case scenario, an entire continent could be irradiated). It’s always compelling and often terrifying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"rEWLDj\"\u003eYet \u003cem\u003eChernobyl \u003c/em\u003eisn’t a polemic against nuclear power or against the Soviet Union or against communism in general. That would be too easy, and it would let American and British viewers off the hook too readily. Instead, \u003cem\u003eChernobyl\u003c/em\u003e is a polemic against lies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"NR86iW\"\u003eAnd “lies,” in this case, include stories themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"sxRrzZ\"\u003eTrying to find “the whole truth” is almost always impossible, especially in societies that are all too comfortable with easy lies\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"i1m0ra\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/6/4/18647339/chernobyl-finale-hbo-truth-how-accurate\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eChernobyl\u003c/em\u003e writer Craig Mazin told me in a recent interview\u003c/a\u003e that he wrote the first couple of episodes of the miniseries in the buildup to the 2016 presidential election, and the last couple episodes immediately after Donald Trump had been elevated to the Oval Office. Perhaps that’s why so much of \u003cem\u003eChernobyl\u003c/em\u003e seems so pointed, so directed not at the crumbling Soviet Union of the mid-1980s but at a very different and much more contemporary crumbling nation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"chFhY7\"\u003eBut you can go even bigger than that, because the truths at the center of \u003cem\u003eChernobyl\u003c/em\u003e are not only pretty universal but deeply damning. Human institutions, after a certain point, become mostly interested in sustaining themselves — and as a result, they will frequently accept convenient lies over difficult truths, provided the convenient lies will allow them to avoid rethinking the way they do things. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"oiF8Kz\"\u003eRight now, we live on a planet that is getting warmer and warmer because it’s more convenient to believe that we still have plenty of time to slow the effects of climate change rather than understand that our window is rapidly closing. No matter how loud the drumbeat of disaster, humans are just dense enough to assume that we’ll continue to persist much the way we always have because, well, we adapt to just about anything. It’s kind of what we’re best at.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"3Cy8zo\"\u003eThis problem with our affinity for convenient lies only becomes more of an issue once they’re tied to narratives that are deeply interwoven with our sense of self. Ideas like “American exceptionalism” or “the Soviet Union is built atop absolute equality and community interest” aren’t really true, but they \u003cem\u003efeel\u003c/em\u003e true because they’re rooted in stories that citizens of those nations hear time and again, from birth until death. To puncture those stories, something seismic has to happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"LY2ObN\"\u003eSo it is with the explosion at Chernobyl, which starts out as something very bad and then proceeds toward something much, much worse, before it is stopped from reaching “worst” by brave people who throw themselves into the path of a freight train. Yet the tension within “Vichnaya Pamyat” (which roughly translates to “everlasting memory”) is about whether the Soviet system — so deeply focused on not being humiliated — will even let the truth about the faulty construction of Chernobyl, which led to the explosion, out for public consumption.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"3JSkkM\"\u003eThat’s why the central scene of the episode involves Valery Legasov (Jared Harris) and those placards. He has been asked to present a case that suggests the explosion was preventable, that human error might be the reason for the whole ordeal. And while he knows the men in the control room that fateful night made several bad decisions, he also knows that the construction of the plant itself was flawed, due to a safety measure that turned out to be anything but. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"PL59J1\"\u003eYet because nuclear power plants in the West had already corrected for this opposite-of-safety measure, the Soviets don’t want the world to know that their plants were faulty from the moment they were designed, time bombs just waiting to go off. Legasov is asked to present some of the truth — the men in the control room \u003cem\u003edid\u003c/em\u003e make bad decisions — but not all of it. The decisions were bad not only because the men (and one man named Dyatlov in particular) moved too hastily and made incredibly misguided choices. They were also bad because the plant’s design was flawed to begin with, and they had no way of knowing that. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"rq0ZJv\"\u003eAnd then so many lives were lost to the bombardment of radiation in the wake of the explosion simply because, at every level of the Soviet power structure, it was easier to insist that things were okay, that the plant explosion was just a minor fire, even though it was obvious to people as far away as Sweden (who detected an alarming rise in radiation levels in the air) that something terrible had happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"qw2eXL\"\u003eBut here’s the final twist of the knife: In reality, Legasov wasn’t in that courtroom. He didn’t deliver the testimony we see him deliver in “Vichnaya Pamyat.” It was presented by other people, who are not characters within \u003cem\u003eChernobyl\u003c/em\u003e, but Mazin knew that after having followed Legasov this long, viewers would want to see him bring everything home. To tell you a partial truth, Mazin had to tell you a completely fabricated version of what “really” happened, and then hope you will go and find out the rest on your own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003caside id=\"P1iSP9\"\u003e\u003cdiv data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"HBO’s Chernobyl is a terrific miniseries.

Well, technically, the episode begins with Legasov hanging himself, two years to the day after the explosion, but it then flashes back to the explosion itself and follows through in chronological order, proceeding with the many heroic attempts to halt the course of disaster and navigate its grim aftermath (which includes a heart-wrenching scene in which men walk through Pripyat and kill irradiated cats and dogs, which have become dangerous merely by an accident of geography).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"8UpxwR\"\u003eSo it’s a bit of a surprise when the finale begins not with the courtroom — the logical endpoint of this story — but with a sunny, happy day in Pripyat, around 12 hours before the reactor explosion that will force the city’s residents to abandon it forever. What follows is a series of cuts between Legasov’s dry, detached commentary on the disaster in the courtroom and the actual buildup to the disaster on the night it happened. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"nxiEnf\"\u003eThe men on trial, now looking haggard and sickly and distraught, answer questions in clipped dialogue, which feels alien compared to the mounting panic we see every time the episode cuts back to that horrible night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"rO0Mbh\"\u003eThe structure of “Vichnaya Pamyat” is vaguely reminiscent of the film \u003cem\u003eTitanic\u003c/em\u003e, which features a computer recreation of the sinking of its titular ship in its early going, so that we viewers can know exactly what’s happening when it actually begins sinking in the 1912-set scenes that make up the bulk of the film. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"YNOyhe\"\u003eBut here, the divide between “careful recreation of a disaster” and “seeing the disaster actually unfold” is one that yields two kinds of horror. One is the futile cautionary tale of a scientific report that explains the worst — while knowing the worst has only narrowly been averted — and the other is the immediate, crushing disquietude of watching things spiral out of your control, followed by the awful realization that humanity is so, so fallible and so, so mortal in the face of awesome cosmic forces we pretend to control.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\"Valery Legasov being told that his testimony won’t be accepted by the state.\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nnl7Ao0ewyopSHxrGVHmkEEtSoo=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16326231/2a92154a95ad048e6e4ce01d490c57eb4946b442d91ec73ffc8b4ddbf508230bbf8233d478ed8eedac0cfd2c489cfb0b25a889bc6eface5b10bf57c6a845d450.jpg\"\u003e\n      \u003ccite\u003eHBO\u003c/cite\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003eValery Legasov being told that his testimony won’t be accepted by the state.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Qzykdh\"\u003eIn a strange way, however, there’s another divide at work: the gap between seeing the explosion through a faraway kitchen window in \u003cem\u003eChernobyl\u003c/em\u003e’s premiere and then seeing it up close, from the point of view of the people working at the nuclear plant, as it unfolds in the finale. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"QJiu0Q\"\u003eExploring that gap is what the series has been doing all along.

But the myth of the superiority of specialists is apparently based on limited data, and there\u0026#8217;s plenty of evidence, now collected in a new book, to suggest that range is the true engine of innovation and creativity in the game of life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid Epstein\u0026#8217;s \u003ca href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/550188/range-by-david-epstein/9780735214484/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eRange: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, released in May by Penguin Random House, upends conventional wisdom about what it takes to succeed in postmodernity. While tiger moms and the golfer Tiger Woods were popularizing the notion that the best and brightest decide what to be as kids, \u003ca href=\"https://qz.com/1633978/when-should-students-start-to-specialize/?utm_source=Twitter\u0026amp;utm_medium=qz-organic\u0026amp;utm_campaign=hootsuite\"\u003edrill vehemently throughout childhood\u003c/a\u003e, and quickly rise to the top of their fields by being gritty and focused, researchers have been studying the world\u0026#8217;s most influential athletes, scientists, artists, musicians, inventors, and business leaders to see what makes them tick. It turns out that in many fields, being a bit of a dilettante, \u003ca href=\"https://qz.com/1556797/why-late-bloomers-are-happier-and-more-successful/\"\u003ea curious late bloomer\u003c/a\u003e with multiple interests, is often the trick to excellence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe book is an eye-opener for those who have submitted to the cult of head starts and 10,000 hours of practice made famous by Malcolm Gladwell (who is quoted on the cover of Epstein\u0026#8217;s book, saying, \u0026#8220;I loved \u003cem\u003eRange\u003c/em\u003e.\u0026#8221;) It\u0026#8217;s also a bit of a balm on the wounds of any generalist who has felt \u0026#8220;behind\u0026#8221; in life because they didn\u0026#8217;t alight on their purpose before they were teens, or switched career tracks, or—gasp!—dared to cultivate more than one interest or be more than one thing, including Epstein.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe writer studied environmental science, worked as a general assignment reporter, became a sports journalist, and finally found his true calling when researching great athletes for his 2013 book \u003cem\u003eThe Sports Gene\u003c/em\u003e. That\u0026#8217;s when Epstein learned that not all professional athletes succeed thanks to their exceptional early focus. Some—like tennis champion Roger Federer—seem to have blossomed in one area despite having played many different sports in youth. Meanwhile, research on professional soccer players in Germany revealed that the best players were those who didn\u0026#8217;t take the sport seriously until their twenties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, Epstein\u0026#8217;s an evangelist of range, the voice of the deeply superficial. He was invited to speak to groups of career-switchers and learned that, like him, many were filled with shame and regret over the very thing that makes them exceptional and necessary in a specialized world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn \u003cem\u003eRange \u003c/em\u003eEpstein makes a very compelling case for generalization. He provides reams of scientific data on education and professional excellence, showing that high grades and early promise are often not harbingers for later exceptionalism but can be signs of a mind too inflexible to innovate and too steeped in convention to challenge intellectual norms. He shows how throughout history dabblers have managed to connect ideas from different fields and thus changed the world, pointing to the 15th-century artist Michelangelo, who fancied himself a poet; Johannes Kepler, the 17th-century mathematician, astronomer, and astrologer whose work challenged human understanding of the universe\u0026#8217;s workings and spawned a scientific revolution; and the 19th-century naturalist, geologist, and biologist Charles Darwin of evolutionary theory fame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThis \u0026#8220;wicked\u0026#8221; world\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost compelling of all is the evidence that having a capacity for abstraction and \u003ca href=\"https://qz.com/1123896/its-better-to-understand-something-than-to-know-it/\"\u003ethe ability to transfer concepts\u003c/a\u003e is the key to success in our \u0026#8220;wicked\u0026#8221; world. While it\u0026#8217;s true that some chess grandmasters and world-class athletes start early and drill hard, this repetition is only effective in golf or games with strict rules and easily quantifiable results, Epstein says. Those are \u0026#8220;kind\u0026#8221; worlds with limited possibilities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn life, however, and especially in postmodern life, where rote tasks are increasingly automated and pretty much any fact can be discovered with a web search, the rules aren\u0026#8217;t straightforward. What it takes to be great is intellectual flexibility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEpstein argues that people who don\u0026#8217;t have a strict plan dictating what they will be and a narrow focus on a single interest end up making amazing contributions to the culture because they can transfer knowledge from one field to another. They understand concepts and see how these might apply to other areas, whereas the specialists are so steeped in one set of facts that they may miss the forest for the trees. If you only have one tool, you\u0026#8217;ll use it in every situation—but you can\u0026#8217;t use a hammer to screw things and you can\u0026#8217;t use a saw to hammer a nail, so the wise human accumulates a bunch of tools, and getting this varied toolkit takes time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#8217;s more than just a pleasing theory for dilettantes. Epstein talks to self-taught music virtuosos, business leaders who never even planned to work at all, and scientists who were widely mocked for their unbound curiosity and ultimately, through creative experimentation, found solutions for conundrums that the single-minded couldn\u0026#8217;t resolve because they never thought to look beyond the narrow focus of their knowledge. He examines research on the creators of comic books and Broadway shows, movies, literature, and art, and finds that the most innovative contributors move across genres instead of singularly drilling down. Being curious and flexible proved more important than having experience or expertise cultivated in one field.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps most important, Epstein promotes the notion that we don\u0026#8217;t know who we are and what will work for us until we\u0026#8217;re doing things. Life unfolds. We grow. We change. That\u0026#8217;s why we need range. Perhaps it would be nice to determinedly move forward in a chosen field based on an early prediction that it will always hold your interest, but knowing when to quit can be as important as grit, Epstein argues. Until you find your match, which may not happen in your first college major or first job or even your fifth, you won\u0026#8217;t know what you are capable of and there\u0026#8217;s no need to force the question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou have to try and fail, over and over, in order to occasionally alight on an exceptionally successful idea or solution or the job in which you\u0026#8217;ll excel, Epstein contends. He cites Thomas Edison\u0026#8217;s thousand-plus patents as evidence of this. They were mostly for inventions that were \u0026#8220;completely unimportant.\u0026#8221; As Epstein puts it, \u0026#8220;His failures were legion but his successes—the mass-market lightbulb, the phonograph, a precursor of the film projector—were earthshaking.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eAn abstract formula\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a generalist haunted by a sense of superficiality, I found Epstein\u0026#8217;s book refreshing. It is also incredibly readable. Still, despite enjoying it, I must admit I left it unopened on my desk for about 10 days while suspiciously eying the cover, with its telling keyring indicating many keys are superior to a master key and that Gladwell quote. And I read it with trepidation, fearful throughout that Epstein would replace the 10,000 hours of practice cliche with some other simple and trite formula for success that would ultimately undermine my ambling approach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did not, however. In fact, although people asked for just that as he was presenting ideas from \u003cem\u003eRange\u003c/em\u003e at speaking engagements before the book was published, he resisted the temptation to simplify because life isn\u0026#8217;t simple and that is the point of the book. We don\u0026#8217;t operate in a \u0026#8220;kind\u0026#8221; world with easy-to-discern rules, and Epstein is not offering any.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, Epstein promotes concepts. He urges individuals—\u003ca href=\"https://qz.com/1628680/what-should-my-child-do-this-summer-sample-dont-specialize/\"\u003eand parents especially\u003c/a\u003e—to abandon the desire for instant gratification and easy answers as early performance on tests isn\u0026#8217;t an indicator of professional success. He emphasizes traits over particular skills—be curious, flexible, open-minded, adventurous, experimental, and playful. Try and fail and try again. Explore. Read outside your field. Supply your mind with lots of ideas so that you can make the connections that specialists miss, helping you thrive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNever decide you are too old or too late to the game to try something new. \u0026#8220;The tidy specialization narrative cannot easily fit even [the] relatively kind domains that have most successfully marketed it,\u0026#8221; Epstein concludes. \u0026#8220;So, about that, one sentence of advice: \u003ca href=\"https://qz.com/1274484/40-isnt-the-new-30-and-thats-good-news/\"\u003eDon\u0026#8217;t feel behind\u003c/a\u003e\u0026#8230;research in myriad areas suggests that mental meandering and personal experimentation are sources of power, and head starts are overrated.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://qz.com/1638869/david-epsteins-range-argues-for-generalizing-vs-specializing/","published":"2019-06-09T14:06:07Z","guid":"https://qz.com/1638869//"},{"title":"The FBI has released 22 pages of its investigation into Bigfoot","content":"\u003cimg width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/squatch.jpeg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;w=1024\" class=\"attachment-medium_10 size-medium_10 wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/squatch.jpeg 1922w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/squatch.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/squatch.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/squatch.jpeg?resize=160,90 160w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/squatch.jpeg?resize=320,180 320w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/squatch.jpeg?resize=640,360 640w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/squatch.jpeg?resize=940,529 940w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/squatch.jpeg?resize=1600,900 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe American Pacific Northwest, from California to Canada, is Sasquatch country.

During the 2010 winter Olympics in Vancouver, Canada, for example, the mascot Quatchi was based on this mythology. To this day, Sasquatch enthusiasts claim to have spotted the mysterious beast wandering deep in the North American rainforest.

She warned observers to expect many close decisions in the 27 remaining undecided cases to be resolved before the spring term ends this month and offered delightful insights into the inner workings of the high court.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGinsburg, known in popular culture as RBG, indicated, albeit indirectly, to anyone \u003ca href=\"https://qz.com/1504963/ruth-bader-ginsburg-had-lung-cancer-surgery/\"\u003ewaiting for her to retire\u003c/a\u003e that they should not hold their breath. Ginsburg began her remarks by reminding conference attendees that just after their last such gathering in 2018, justice Anthony Kennedy announced his retirement. \u0026#8220;It was, I would say, the event of greatest consequence for the current term, and perhaps for many terms ahead.\u0026#8221; In other words, don\u0026#8217;t expect her to make a similar retirement announcement any time soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe justice then went on to gently poke fun at the two conservatives who Donald Trump appointed to the bench, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. The dig showed that no matter how honorable the job may seem, and despite the esteem that the justices enjoy as the most powerful lawyers in the US, working on the high court involves dull duties, like any other gig. Ginsburg explained:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith justice Kavanaugh’s arrival, justice Gorsuch cheerfully relinquished to our newest colleague the tasks assigned to the junior justice—answering the telephone the rare times it rings during conference, opening the door when an aide appears to deliver papers a justice left behind, conveying to the entourage from the clerk’s office, the public information office, and other court administrators the dispositions reached at conference, and, most thankless of all chores, \u003ca href=\"https://qz.com/955214/neil-gorsuch-will-assume-three-humble-duties-as-newcomer-on-the-us-supreme-court/\"\u003esitting on the court’s Cafeteria Committee\u003c/a\u003e.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she didn\u0026#8217;t just rib the new guys. Ginsburg remarked on how talkative—or not—her colleagues had been this term, noting that justice Stephen Breyer \u0026#8220;retained his title\u0026#8221; as the one who spoke the most during oral arguments, while Sonia Sotomayor ranked a close second. Sotomayor asked the first question more often than anyone else, leading the queries a total of 48 times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for the famously reticent justice Clarence Thomas, he was unusually curious this term. Thomas broke his silence for the first time since 2016, asking three questions in a single argument, though he \u0026#8220;ordinarily asks no questions because he thinks the rest of us ask too many,\u0026#8221; Ginsburg quipped. She was referring to \u003ca href=\"https://qz.com/1634993/us-supreme-court-justice-clarence-thomas-is-surprisingly-funny/\"\u003ea recent interview \u003c/a\u003ein which Thomas responded to a query about whether justices should pose more questions with, \u0026#8220;Oh God no. Don\u0026#8217;t say that.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGinsburg also noted laudable new developments this year, pointing out that Kavanaugh made history by bringing on board an all-female law clerk crew. As a result, for the first time ever, women clerks outnumbered men at the high court. But she noted that female advocates arguing before the bench were still vastly outnumbered by male counselors, making up only about 21% of the attorneys presenting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNotably, RBG didn\u0026#8217;t make any charming observations about her boss, \u003ca href=\"https://qz.com/1593989/us-supreme-court-chief-justice-john-roberts-has-always-wanted-to-stay-ahead-of-the-crowd/\"\u003echief justice John Roberts,\u003c/a\u003e though she also didn\u0026#8217;t single out Elena Kagan or Samuel Alito, so perhaps rank wasn\u0026#8217;t a consideration, after all. She saved her last remarks for the advocates who will be filing future briefs, pointing out that the word limit for their main written arguments has been cut down from 15,000 words to 13,000.

On June 4, YouTube announced that it would not be taking any action against Crowder. The following morning, it announced new policies against extremism on the platform and, shortly after, announced it was demonetizing Crowder’s account (only to muddy the waters later in the day about the actions it’d be taking against Crowder). \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e Because of the rapid succession of these confusing announcements, a range of conservative YouTubers started pinning the blame for the wider policy changes on Maza. Hence, #VoxAdpocalypse.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e In reality, platform policies take months to develop and publicly roll out. As my colleague Joan Donovan\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/BostonJoan/status/1136433802224578561\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e wrote on Twitter\u003c/a\u003e, “large bureaucracies are slow and rigid,” and these specific policies were likely decided “after months of internal debate at YouTube.” In other words, there is no feasible possibility that the new policies were a response to Maza’s tweets. Still, by releasing this announcement the morning after making policy decisions on Maza and Crowder, YouTube all but ensured that harassment against Maza would escalate further. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e And it has escalated: since Wednesday afternoon, the hashtag has gone viral, harassers have dredged up out-of-context tweets from Maza’s past, and Senator Ted Cruz tweeted about it, falsely claiming Maza had gotten Crowder’s channel removed. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e In short, YouTube's big policy announcement ended up acting as incitement to harassment against one of its own creators.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"article__pull-quote\"\u003eYouTube’s stilted response to Maza showcases how ill-equipped the platform is to grapple with incitement to harassment\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e Incitement to harassment happens when influential users on a platform direct their viewers or followers to harass someone on their behalf. Sometimes this incitement is clear, as was the case when alt-right poster-boy Milo Yiannopolous directed his Twitter followers to attack comedian and actress Leslie Jones. In other cases, it can be more oblique: when a YouTuber harasses someone through their content, there is a strong likelihood that their viewers will follow suit, even if they weren’t explicitly directed to do so. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e In these cases, it can be incredibly difficult to draw a direct link between the incitement and the harassment, because viewers of a video may move across channels or even platforms to pursue a target, making it difficult to identify the original source of inspiration. In some cases, this process may even happen accidentally, if a celebrity’s followers take it upon themselves to harass another figure without the celebrity’s intention or knowledge.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e YouTube’s stilted response to Maza showcases how ill-equipped the platform is to grapple with incitement to harassment. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e First, the lines are incredibly blurry and can be difficult to determine. It can be impossible to tell the difference between genuine incitement to harassment and a simple “YouTube beef,” a popular genre of YouTube content in which at least two users mutually turn a (real or otherwise) feud into entertainment for their followers. Callout culture and beefs have become a staple of the platform, and they can often be highly lucrative for all involved parties. Harassers, in turn, exploit these blurry lines to claim that genuine abuse is simply a debate or a joke. This is partly why is was so troubling to see YouTube echoing that exact reasoning in its decision not to punish Crowder further, claiming that his harassment was made in the context of a larger argument. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e But beyond that, YouTube has historically been loath to punish its celebrity creators, as they are major revenue drivers for the platform and often have the fandom and reach to successfully damage the company’s PR efforts. So, certain YouTubers in effect become “too big to fail.” Thus, the content creators YouTube is incentivized to placate are the same ones with the power to do the most harm to others (intentionally or otherwise). In many cases, harassment generates views and thus in effect becomes a part of the business model for YouTube and its creators alike. In the days following Youtube’s policy announcements, Steven Crowder gained tens of thousands of \u003ca href=\"https://socialblade.com/youtube/user/stevencrowder\" target=\"_blank\"\u003enew channel subscribers\u003c/a\u003e—significantly more than his usual rate. The data suggests that, despite YouTube’s contingent demonetization, the attention has helped him further grow his audience.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e On Wednesday, I expressed my skepticism about the timing of YouTube's announcement\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/beccalew/status/1136331473911312384\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e on Twitter\u003c/a\u003e, writing, “It is extremely difficult not to see the new YouTube policies in part as a way to change a negative PR narrative after refusing to address the harassment faced by [Maza].” Even if this was not YouTube’s intention, however, it was deeply irresponsible for YouTube to make the announcement when it did. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e Perhaps YouTube hoped that announcing its new hate and extremism rules would appease those who were upset that Crowder’s channel would not be removed. Instead, by making a splashy and poorly-timed PR announcement, it drove more people his way. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e For myself and other researchers of online harassment, watching the events unfold was like watching a slow-moving train crash we knew was going to occur.

It included a commitment from Mexico, for instance, to deploy its new National Guard to the country\u0026#8217;s southern border with Guatemala. Mexico, however, had already intended to do that before Trump\u0026#8217;s latest threat and had made that clear to U.S. officials.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;We want to continue to work with the U.S. very closely on the different challenges that we have together. And one urgent one at this moment is immigration,\u0026#8221; said Mexico\u0026#8217;s ambassador in Washington, Martha Barcena.

But U.S. officials had already been working to expand the program, which has already led to the return of about 10,000 to Mexico, without Mexico\u0026#8217;s public embrace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;The president has completely overblown what he reports to have achieved.

That development brought fans to their feet in Court Philippe Chatrier, roaring and clapping and, above all, wondering: Was this, now, a real contest? Could Thiem push Nadal more? Could he make this surge last? Would Nadal falter?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat the questions arose at all was significant. The answers arrived swiftly. Nadal reasserted himself, as he usually does at Roland Garros, by grabbing 16 of the next 17 points and 12 of the remaining 14 games, pulling away to beat Thiem 6-3, 5-7, 6-1, 6-1 for his record-extending 12th championship at the French Open.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;I gave everything I had,\u0026#8221; Thiem said. \u0026#8220;It\u0026#8217;s amazing: 12 times here. It\u0026#8217;s unreal.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one in tennis ever has won any major tournament that many times. Then again, no one ever has been as suited for success on any of the sport\u0026#8217;s surfaces as this 33-year-old Spaniard is on red clay: Nadal is 93-2 for his career at Roland Garros, winning four in a row from 2005-08, five in a row from 2010-14, and now three in a row.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;I can\u0026#8217;t explain my emotions,\u0026#8221; said the No. 2-seeded Nadal, who dropped to his back after the final point, getting that rust-colored dirt all over his neon yellow shirt, then wiped away tears during the trophy ceremony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking at the bigger picture, he is now up to 18 Grand Slam trophies, moving within two of Roger Federer\u0026#8217;s men\u0026#8217;s record of 20.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThiem, a 25-year-old Austrian who was seeded No. 4 and upset No. 1 Novak Djokovic in the semifinals, was eyeing his first major title in this rematch of the 2018 final in Paris. But again, he couldn\u0026#8217;t solve Nadal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;First thing that I want to say is congrats to Dominic. I feel sorry, because he deserves it here, too,\u0026#8221; Nadal said. \u0026#8220;He has an unbelievable intensity.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, of course, does Nadal. This had been, by his lofty standards, a rough season, from the most lopsided Grand Slam final loss of his career \u0026mdash; against Djokovic at the Australian Open \u0026mdash; to entering May without a title for the first year since 2004.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started to right himself by taking the title on clay in Rome last month, then found himself in a familiar position in Paris: playing in the final, and winning it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis one began on a cloudy afternoon, with the temperature in the low 60s (mid-teens Celsius) and only a slight breeze. In the initial game \u0026mdash; interrupted briefly by a baby wailing in the stands, drawing a laugh from other spectators and prompting Nadal to back away from the baseline between serves \u0026mdash; three of the five points lasted at least 11 strokes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd, thereby, a pattern was established: By the end of the 3-hour, 1-minute match, a total of 46 points went 10 strokes or more. Each man claimed half.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth would station themselves along the baseline and sprint, scramble, slide, stretch to somehow reach just about every ball, not merely putting a racket on it but conjuring a booming reply. It was an impressive display of athleticism, skill and will, with Thiem managing to give just as good as he got, particularly with his ferocious backhand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the get-go, it was such a physical grind that Nadal was soaked with sweat and changed neon yellow shirts after seven games and 45 minutes, eliciting catcalls from the stands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEarly on, there were no signs of fatigue for Thiem, even though he was competing for a fourth straight day, because of rain that jumbled the schedule. Nadal, meanwhile, entered Sunday having played just once in the previous four days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot only that, but while Nadal dismissed Federer with relative ease in a straight-set semifinal that concluded Friday, Thiem was forced to work overtime, eliminating Djokovic in a five-setter that wrapped up less than 24 hours before the final began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThiem showed he can play defense. Showed he can flip to offense in a blink. Showed power off both sides. Showed precision, too, making only three of the match\u0026#8217;s first 12 unforced errors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIndeed, it was Thiem who nosed ahead first, closing a 12-stroke exchange by ripping a forehand to earn the first break point of the final, then converting it with an overhead to cap a 20-stroke point for a 3-2 edge. He turned with a clenched right hand to face his guest box, where all of his supporters were yelling and shaking fists, too, including his girlfriend, French tennis player Kristina Mladenovic, who won the women\u0026#8217;s doubles championship earlier in the day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNadal immediately responded. He grabbed the next four games with elan, using a drop shot to help break for a 5-3 lead, then a serve-and-volley to help hold for the set.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat must have been demoralizing for Thiem. But at the ensuing changeover, he didn\u0026#8217;t whack a ball toward the stands, as Federer memorably did during his semifinal loss. He didn\u0026#8217;t spike a racket or kick a ball. He casually sat in his gray sideline seat, bounced his legs and chewed on an energy bar, furtively glancing to his left at Nadal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThiem bounced back, if only briefly. Talk about a stunning shift: Nadal won 25 of 26 points on his serve before \u0026mdash; with spectators trading between-point chants of nicknames, \u0026#8220;Ra-fa!\u0026#8221; and \u0026#8220;Do-mi!\u0026#8221; \u0026mdash; he got broken to cede the second set. That was the only set he\u0026#8217;d managed to steal from Nadal in four career meetings at Roland Garros.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe this was going to be a long one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Thiem, put simply, wilted a bit. He made three unforced errors in the next set\u0026#8217;s opening game to get broken at love, creating an opening that Nadal barged through. By now, Nadal was creating magic at the net, and he won the point on 23 of 27 times he went forward. One drop volley was spun so marvelously that it landed on Thiem\u0026#8217;s side, then bounced back toward the net. All Thiem could do was watch \u0026mdash; and offer an appreciative thumbs-up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoon enough, it was over.

In that 1990 horror-comedy, a small Southwestern town called Perfection suffers from an infestation of people-eating sandworms (called Graboids) that local not-so-brainy beefcake Val McKee (Bacon) eventually beats back. Ars' Culture Writer \u003ca href=\"https://arstechnica.com/author/jenniferouellette/\"\u003eJennifer Ouellette\u003c/a\u003e casually refers to this movie as \"perfection,\" not an uncommon sentiment. If B-movie horror with flashes of comedic brilliance and a few edge-of-your-seat scares interests you, viewers likely can't do much better than \u003cem\u003eTremors.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo when news of a modern reboot for television first trickled out in 2015, this development triggered both cautious optimism and premature regret. Various sequels already existed in the straight-to-DVD world, as well as a short-lived 2003 cable series. But they resembled the over-the-top camp of \u003cem\u003eSharknado\u003c/em\u003e more than \u003cem\u003eTremors\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet, Bacon agreed to both reprising his role and executive producing. Writer \u003ca href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0587884/\"\u003eAndrew Miller\u003c/a\u003e put together the script.

Even the most diehard fans couldn't wish for much more 25 years after the original cult classic.

Why are small companies nimbler than large ones? Why are private companies generally more efficient than governments? Primarily because in each case, the former has a better feedback loop. When faced with a baffling question \u0026#8212; such as, \u0026#8220;why do online companies do such a terrible job at dealing with abuse?\u0026#8221; \u0026#8212; it\u0026#8217;s often helpful to look at the feedback loops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet\u0026#8217;s look at the small vs. large and private vs. government comparisons first, as examples. Small companies have extremely tight feedback loops; a single person makes a decision, sees the results, and pivots accordingly, without the need for meetings or cross-division consensus. Larger companies have to deal with other departments, internal politics, red tape, the blessing of multiple vice-presidents, legal analysis, etc., before they can make meaningful changes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimilarly, if a private company\u0026#8217;s initiative isn\u0026#8217;t going well, its revenue immediately begins to plummet, a very strong signal that it needs to change its course quickly. If a government initiative isn\u0026#8217;t going well, the voters render their verdict \u0026#8230; at the next election, mingled with their verdicts on all the other initiatives. In the absence of specific and meaningful external feedback, various proxies exist \u0026#8230; but it\u0026#8217;s difficult to definitively determine actual signal from noise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd when a social-media platform, especially an algorithm-driven one, determines what content to amplify \u0026#8212; which implicitly means deciding which content to de-amplify \u0026#8212; and which content to ban \u0026#8230; what is its feedback loop? Revenue is one, of course. Amplifying content which leads to more engagement leads to more revenue. So they do that. Simple, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAhahahahahaha no, as you may have noticed. Anything but simple. Content which is amplified is often bad content. Abuse. False news. Horrifyingly creepy YouTube videos. Etcetera.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuppose that (many of) the employees of these platforms genuinely wish to deal with and hopefully eliminate these problems. I know that seems like a big supposition, but let\u0026#8217;s just imagine it. Then why have they consistently seemed so spectacularly bad at doing so? Is it purely because they are money-grubbing monsters making hay off bullying, vitriol, the corrosion of the social contract, etc.?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr is it that, because it did not occur to them to try to measure the susceptibility and severity of the effects on their own systems by bad actors, they had to rely on others \u0026#8212; journalists, politicians, the public \u0026#8212; for a slow, imprecise form of feedback. Such as: \u0026#8220;your recommendation algorithm is doing truly terrible things\u0026#8221; or \u0026#8220;you are amplifying content designed to fragment our culture and society\u0026#8221; or \u0026#8220;you are consistently letting assholes dogpile-abuse vulnerable people, while suspending the accounts of the wronged,\u0026#8221; to name major criticisms most often leveled at Google, Facebook, and Twitter respectively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut this is a subtle and sluggish feedback loop, one primarily driven by journalists and politicians, who in turn have their own agendas, flaws, and their own feedback loops to which they respond. There is no immediately measurable response like there is with, say, revenue. And so whatever they do in response is subject to that same slow and imprecise feedback.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo when Google finally responds by banning right-wing extremism, but also history teachers, which is clearly an insanely stupid thing to do, is this a transient, one-time, edge-case bug, or a sign that Google\u0026#8217;s whole approach is fundamentally flawed and they need to rethink things? Either way, how can we tell? How can \u003ci\u003ethey\u003c/i\u003e tell?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(Before you object, no, it\u0026#8217;s not done purely by algorithms or neural networks.

I mean, look at \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyJWqwbI7CPAZpCqJ_yTg2w\"\u003ethis channel\u003c/a\u003e which YouTube \u003ca href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jun/06/youtube-blocks-history-teachers-uploading-archive-videos-of-hitler\"\u003erecently banned\u003c/a\u003e; it\u0026#8217;s \u003cem\u003eclear\u003c/em\u003e at \u003cem\u003efirst glance\u003c/em\u003e, and confirmed by subsequent study, that this is not right-wing extremism. This should not have been a tough call.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026#8217;ve long been suspicious of what I call \u0026#8220;the scientific fallacy\u0026#8221; \u0026#8212; that if something cannot be measured, it does not exist. But at the same time, in order to construct meaningful feedback loops which allow your system to be guided in the desired direction, you need a meaningful measure for comparisons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I put it to you that a fundamental problem (although not \u003cem\u003ethe\u003c/em\u003e fundamental problem) with tackling the thorny problem of content curation in social media is that we have no way to concretely measure the scale of what we\u0026#8217;re talking about when we say \u0026#8220;abuse\u0026#8221; or \u0026#8220;fake news\u0026#8221; or \u0026#8220;corrupted recommendation algorithms.\u0026#8221; Has it gotten better?

That may not be the best source of truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of measuring anything, we seem to be relying on Whack-a-Mole in response to viral outrage and/or media reports. That\u0026#8217;s still much better than doing nothing at all. But I can\u0026#8217;t help but wonder: do the tech platforms have any way of measuring what it is they\u0026#8217;re trying to fight? Even if they did, would anyone else believe their measurements? Perhaps what we need is some form of trusted, or even crowdsourced, third-party measure of just how bad things are.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you would look to make a meaningful difference to these problems \u0026#8212; which are admittedly difficult, although, looking back at the banned history teacher\u0026#8217;s YouTube channel, perhaps not so difficult as the companies claim \u0026#8212; you could come up with a demonstrable, reliable way to measure them.

Instead of drilling down to Settings \u0026gt; General \u0026gt; Accessibility, the accessibility settings are now a “top level domain,” in the same list view as Notifications, Screen Time, and so on. Apple also told me this move applies to watchOS 6 as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"embed breakout\"\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"\u003e\n\u003cp lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003eApple confirmed to me Accessibility, the menu, has been moved to front page of Settings. Also, selecting acccessibility features is now part of first-run “setup buddy” process. I’m told goal of both moves was to increase visibility of accessibility feature set as a whole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026mdash; Steven Aquino (@steven_aquino) \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/steven_aquino/status/1135675639426473984?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"\u003eJune 3, 2019\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cscript async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimilarly, Apple said they’ve added accessibility to the first-run “setup buddy” experience. When someone sets up a new iPhone or other device for the first time, the system will prompt them to configure any desired accessibility features such as VoiceOver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth changes are long overdue and especially important symbolically. While it may not affect the average user much, if at all, the fact Apple is making this move speaks volumes about how much they care for the accessibility community. By moving Accessibility to the front page in Settings, it gives disabled users (and by extension, accessibility) just a bit more awareness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a disabled person myself, this is not insignificant. This change reinforces Apple’s position as the leader in the industry when it comes to making accessibility a first-class citizen; by elevating it to the top level, Apple is sending the message that accessibility is a critical aspect of the operating system, and a critical part of the user experience for so many, myself included.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eHandoff for HomePod\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI enjoy my HomePod for listening to music, podcasts, and controlling our HomeKit devices. Until now, however, one of the biggest annoyances with HomePod has been the inability to pick up where I left off. If I come home from the supermarket listening to music or a podcast and want to keep going, I have to stop and change the output source to my office’s HomePod. It’s not difficult to do, but from an accessibility perspective it’s a lot of extra taps. I definitely feel that bit of friction, and curse the dance every time I have to go through the rigamarole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith iOS 13, that friction goes away. All I need to do is place my iPhone XR close to the HomePod (as if I were setting it up) and the iPhone will “hand off” whatever audio is playing to the speaker. Again, changing source is not a huge deal in the grand scheme of things, but as a disabled person I’m attuned to even the slightest inconveniences. Likewise with the ability to hear incoming iMessages read aloud to you on AirPods, these little refinements go a long way in not only having a more enjoyable, more seamless experience—it makes the experience more accessible, too. In this sense, this technology is magical in more ways than one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThe victory of Voice Control\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe addition of Voice Control is definitely a headliner, but the backstory to it certainly isn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone I’ve spoken to during the week, whether it be fellow reporters, developers or Apple employees, shared the same sentiment: Voice Control is \u003cem\u003eso great\u003c/em\u003e. In fact, the \u003ca href=\"https://castro.fm/episode/ti5cGK#34:55\"\u003esegment\u003c/a\u003e of John Gruber’s live episode of his podcast, The Talk Show, where he and special guests Craig Federighi and Greg Joswiak discussed the feature is a perfect example. It totally meshes with what I was told. Federighi explained how he had “friggin’ tears in my eyes” after watching an internal demo from somebody on Apple’s accessibility team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"embed breakout\"\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"\u003e\n\u003cp lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003eI’ll have fuller thoughts on it later, but the unbridled joy and enthusiasm for Voice Control is unlike anything I’ve seen in my years covering Apple.

Can it truly claim to be a mobile-friendly platform when it only supports a few of its own phones at launch? More so, do people want to connect a game controller to their phone?

This will probably bring in some free Stadia Base 1080p users, but it\u0026#8217;s going to be the latency \u0026#8212; no matter how minimal Google can claim it to be \u0026#8212; that shuts out a lot of PC die-hards from signing onto the Stadia Pro plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor single-player experiences, Stadia won\u0026#8217;t have too many issues, but a lot of the top game publishers are focusing their full efforts on multi-player. Google barely touched on the topic of multi-player at its event, the fact is if developers enable cross-platform play with Stadia, those users are likely going to be at a tactical disadvantage. For a platform like Xbox One, Microsoft has enough existing reach that they can probably cordon off those streaming users into their own servers and keep the odds even, but Google may have some issues here fresh-out-the-gate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is still quite a bit we don\u0026#8217;t know about Stadia, and I\u0026#8217;m very anxious to see what Microsoft has up its sleeve, but Google just doesn\u0026#8217;t feel like the right kind of company to pull this off\u0026#8230; Let me know what your thoughts are though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eSend me feedback\u003cbr /\u003e\non Twitter \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/lucasmtny?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\"\u003e@lucasmtny\u003c/a\u003e or email\u003cbr /\u003e\nlucas@techcrunch.com\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn to the rest of the week’s news.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"attachment_1829158\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1836345\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GOOG4029.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"453\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GOOG4029.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GOOG4029.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GOOG4029.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GOOG4029.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GOOG4029.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GOOG4029.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eTrends of the week\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere are a few big news items from big companies, with green links to all the sweet, sweet added context.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eApple\u0026#8217;s hardware finally goes Pro\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\nYou might have a MacBook Pro or an iPad Pro but chances are most of you aren\u0026#8217;t much in the way of a professional.

In 2017,  authorities made a break in the case: they were able to determine that one of the victims was the daughter of a man named Terrence “Terry” Peder Rasmussen, and who was connected to the disappearance of a woman named Denise Beaudin and her daughter in 1981. He had been convicted of murdering his wife, Eunsoon Ju in 2002, and died in prison in 2010.

With this latest break in the case, Moon released a new episode earlier this week. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"4g8qIa\"\u003eAccording to Moon, this latest break from two unrelated efforts. An online investigator named Becky Heath had been following the case for more than a decade, trawling through an Ancestry.com forum where people were looking to reconnect with long-lost loved ones and comparing their stories against the profiles of the Bear Brook victims, hoping that a family member might have posted about them. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"LS8Zy5\"\u003eIn 2017, she came across a name: Sarah McWaters. A woman \u003ca href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2019/06/06/missing-half-sister-how-search-for-relative-helped-identify-bear-brook-victims/xiMWdamAZqaWRaCDJWJqxJ/story.html\"\u003ehad posted on the forum\u003c/a\u003e, noting her husband and his family had been looking for his half-sister and two family members, who had vanished in the 1970s. Heath was able to match the birthdates to the rough age ranges of the Bear Brook victims, but never followed up on the tip, until she began listening to the podcast. “I don’t know why I didn’t pursue it more the first time,” Heath told Moon on the podcast. “I didn’t really get feedback from anyone, so I didn’t really pursue more.” But when she began listening to the podcast last fall, she went back to her findings, and realized that she was onto something, and reached out to the author of the post, learning that Sarah’s mother was married to a man named Rasmussen. She soon submitted a tip to law enforcement. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"w5LG2v\"\u003eAt the same time, a genetic genealogist named Barbara Rae-Venter had been working on trying to find some usable DNA from the victims. She was the one who had used \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/29/science/barbara-rae-venter-gsk.html\"\u003eDNA databases to link Rasmussen to the Bear Brook murders in 2017\u003c/a\u003e, and had used the same techniques to \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/26/17288532/golden-state-killer-east-area-rapist-genealogy-websites-dna-genetic-investigation\"\u003ehelp identify the Golden State Killer last year\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"QdItlG\"\u003eBut while she had been able to identify Rasmussen’s identity, the bodies recovered in Bear Brook were badly decomposed. Forensics experts had been able to extract mitochondrial DNA from the remains, but to utilize Rae-Venter’s techniques, they needed autosomal DNA.

The gate has a heart-shaped lock with a key that is split into two pieces that you can also see on the map. This is a clear visual example of the brilliance of how the game is set up. You can immediately see the end goal and the last step in how you get there along with an entire world full of tantalizing unknowns. It raises plenty of questions, like why is there a big snail near a racetrack? Why is that penguin shivering? What’s the deal with that Totoro-looking thing in the forest? \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Syi4lL\"\u003eThis produces a natural curiosity, inviting you to explore this space even before you’re presented with puzzles. Once you start encountering puzzles, that exploration helps you piece things together. Most of the puzzles in the game are sort of item chains in which you have to collect something for one character, who, in turn, wants something from someone else, and so on, in order to progress and get the thing. An early example is when you need to cross a broken bridge. You can get it fixed, but the carpenter lost their hammer. By just looking at the game world or by talking to the other animals, you’ll learn a bird probably took it. Going to the bird, they’ll give it up in exchange for finding their missing egg. With a little bit of lateral thinking, you’ll realize the snake probably has it, but then you need to figure out how to get the snake to give it up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"bqNnKP\"\u003eIt’s not as tedious as it sounds. Being able to see the entire game world solves some of the backtracking problems that adventure games can have.

If you get stuck, you can just look around and spot something you haven’t noticed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"JNasvQ\"\u003eThe simplicity of \u003cem\u003ePear Quest\u003c/em\u003e’s appearance and gameplay, along with the density of its world, makes the game feel somehow shorter than it actually is.

bearing migrants that are caught in distress has spiked, according to groups involved in running search and rescue operations there. Advocates say that European policies aimed at limiting the number of migrants reaching their shores are in fact making the route more deadly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore migrants than usual have been leaving Libya for southern Europe in small crafts in the last month and falling into danger along the way, according to Haidi Sadik of Sea-Watch, a nonprofit that does search and rescue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Our civil reconnaissance aircraft called Moonbird has been flying missions throughout the year, including in May, and has seen a significant increase in the number of boats in distress from the air,” said Sadik.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ve definitely also seen an increase over the last few weeks,” said Maurice Stierl, who helped found Alarm Phone, an activist collective that runs an emergency hotline for migrants in distress in the Mediterranean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to the \u003ca href=\"https://missingmigrants.iom.int/region/mediterranean?migrant_route%5B%5D=1376\u0026amp;migrant_route%5B%5D=1377\u0026amp;migrant_route%5B%5D=1378\"\u003eMissing Migrants Project\u003c/a\u003e, at least 107 migrants died in May 2019 crossing the Mediterranean, up from 60 in April. And though far fewer migrants overall compared to this time last year are making the trip, a greater portion of those who do attempt the crossing are dying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the first six months of 2018, 791 of the 70,531 people who attempted the Mediterranean crossing to Europe — 1.1 percent — died. Since January 2019, 35,122 people have attempted the crossing, and 543 have died — 1.5 percent overall, per the Missing Migrants Project.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother factor in the sudden uptick in crossing attempts is the recent increase of violence in Libya, the country through which thousands of migrants fleeing violence and poverty have passed on their way to Europe. Last month, Amnesty International voiced concerns that \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/05/16/libya-conflict-migrants-refugees/\"\u003ethe lives of hundreds\u003c/a\u003e of migrants and refugees in detention centers in Libya were under imminent threat as fighting between armed militias in the area drew closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Sam Turner, Médecins Sans Frontières’ head of mission for Libya, says the increased death rate in the Mediterranean is of particular note. “That’s a really key point in terms of challenging the narrative that the actions taken to prevent people from crossing the central Mediterranean … [are] leading to fewer deaths,” he told The Intercept. About 1 in 13 migrants making the crossing in the central Mediterranean region in the first five months of this year died, says Turner; last year for the same period, the number was 1 in 58.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cu\u003eMeanwhile, according to\u003c/u\u003e data compiled by Matteo Villa, a researcher at the think tank Italian Institute for International Political Studies, the number of migrants returned to Libya by the Libyan Coast Guard or others increased nearly tenfold from April to May, with an estimated 1,224 migrants being returned to the war-torn country in May, compared to 130 the month before. This is the greatest number of people returned to Libya since July 2018.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/jun/03/icc-submission-calls-for-prosecution-of-eu-over-migrant-deaths\"\u003eOn Monday\u003c/a\u003e, two human rights lawyers filed a 244-page complaint with the International Criminal Court, or ICC, accusing European Union governments of knowingly sending thousands of migrants to their deaths in implementing their deterrence-based migration policies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOmer Shatz, one of the lawyers who co-authored the request for the case to be taken on by the ICC, said that there used to be four major actors in the Mediterranean dealing with migrants crossing in boats: European governments, NGOs, commercial vessels, and the Libyan Coast Guard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCommercial vessels, which once rescued migrants from the water, now avoid doing so to evade being implicated in an increasingly politicized act. “You can guarantee that you will end up in a political standoff without somewhere to disembark these people despite the fact that you have simply engaged in a humanitarian act,” said Turner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNGOs, according to the ICC complaint, became critical actors in the Mediterranean after the EU’s \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/04/01/europe-keeps-its-rescue-ships-far-from-the-coast-of-libya-where-thousands-of-refugees-have-drowned/\"\u003e2014 decision\u003c/a\u003e to decrease its search and rescue operations. Yet “EU and Italian actors launched a broad political persecution against rescue NGOs, which includes intimidation, defamation, harassment, and formal criminalization,” the complaint reads.

As the EU has scaled down its involvement, the principal actor on these waters has become the Libyan Coast Guard, said Shatz.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Libyan Coast Guard does save lives every day, says Turner, but they can’t keep up with the number of attempted crossings, and the people they do save are sent back to dangerous and deadly conditions.

Though the MEK is known to be widely loathed among Iranians, Alavi described the group as the “main Iranian opposition group” in a 2017 \u003ca href=\"https://dailycaller.com/2017/02/03/language-iran-understands-loud-and-clear/\"\u003eDaily Caller\u003c/a\u003e article.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Diplomat, a foreign policy website that published a handful of Alavi’s pieces in 2017, said that Alavi sent drafts from a Gmail account.

In the years that followed, the group focused on attacking nuclear diplomacy between Iran and the U.S., and, after 2015, attacking the deal itself. Throughout, the MEK’s messaging has emphasized regime change — and attempted to present the MEK as a viable alternative to the Islamic Republic’s leadership, offering Rajavi, who has been the group’s public face for a decade and a half, as a potential figure to lead the country.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlavi’s articles often track closely with these objectives. In his stories, Alavi has included positive references to Rajavi, as well as the MEK’s political wing, the National Council of Resistance of Iran. In an article in Forbes effectively calling for international support for regime change in Iran, \u003ca href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/heshmatalavi/2018/02/01/irans-future-in-its-own-words/#26644d841c17\"\u003eAlavi wrote\u003c/a\u003e:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe time has come to set aside the “reformist” mirage in Iran.

In 2002, the MEK helped reveal the existence of a covert Iranian nuclear facility near the \u003ca href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iran/1441113/Irans-nuclear-history.html\"\u003ecity of Natanz\u003c/a\u003e.

Minutos depois, às 14h08, Dallagnol respondeu pelo Telegram. Moro rebateu, também pelo aplicativo de mensagens: “Na minha opiniao estao provocando confusão.

Dallagnol disse que haveria problemas logísticos para acatar a sugestão. No dia seguinte, ocorreu a 23ª fase da Lava Jato, a Operação Acarajé.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDias depois, Moro cometeu um deslize de linguagem que revela como a acusação e o juiz, que deveria avaliar e julgar o trabalho do MP, viraram uma coisa só. “O que acha dessas notas malucas do diretorio nacional do PT? Deveriamos rebater oficialmente? Ou pela ajufe?”, escreveu o juiz em 27 de fevereiro, usando a primeira pessoa do plural, dando a entender que as reações do juiz e do MP deveriam ser coordenadas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEm 31 de agosto de 2016, Moro mais uma vez escancarou seu papel de aliado dos acusadores ao questionar o ritmo das prisões e apreensões. “Não é muito tempo sem operação?”, perguntou o então juiz ao procurador às 18h44.

O procurador disse que ligou para a fonte, mas ela não quis falar. “Estou pensando em fazer uma intimação oficial até, com base em notícia apócrifa”, cogitou Dallagnol. Ao que tudo indica, o procurador estava considerando criar uma denúncia anônima para justificar o depoimento da fonte ao MP. O juiz Sergio Moro poderia condenar a solução – ou ficar quieto.

With these actions, Moro grossly overstepped the ethical lines that define the role of a judge. In Brazil, as in the United States, judges are required to be impartial and neutral, and are barred from secretly collaborating with one side in a case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther chats in the archive raise fundamental questions about the quality of the charges that ultimately sent Lula to prison. He was accused of having received a beachfront triplex apartment from a contractor as a kickback for facilitating multimillion-dollar contracts with the state-controlled oil firm Petrobras. In group chats among members of the prosecutorial team just days before filing the indictment, Dallagnol expressed his increasing doubts over two key elements of the prosecution\u0026#8217;s case: whether the triplex was in fact Lula\u0026#8217;s and whether it had anything to do with Petrobras.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese two questions were critical to their ability to prosecute Lula. Without the Petrobras link, the task force running the Car Wash investigation would have no legal basis for prosecuting this case, as it would fall outside of their jurisdiction. Even more seriously, without proving that the triplex belonged to Lula, the case itself would fall apart, since Lula’s alleged receipt of the triplex was the key ingredient to prove he acted corruptly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOperation Car Wash is one of the most consequential political forces in the history of Brazilian democracy and also one of the most controversial. It has taken down powerful actors once thought to be untouchable and revealed massive corruption schemes that sucked billions out of public coffers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe probe, however, has also been accused of political bias, repeated violations of constitutional guarantees, and illegal leaks of information to the press. (A separate article \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/06/09/brazil-car-wash-prosecutors-workers-party-lula\"\u003epublished today\u003c/a\u003e by The Intercept reveals that the Car Wash prosecutors, who long insisted that they were apolitical and concerned solely with fighting corruption, were in fact internally plotting how to prevent the return to power by Lula and his Workers\u0026#8217; Party).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe successful prosecution of Lula rendered him ineligible to run in the 2018 presidential election at a time when all polls showed that the former president was the clear frontrunner. As a result, Operation Car Wash was scorned by Lula\u0026#8217;s supporters, who considered it a politically motivated scheme, driven by right-wing ideologues masquerading as apolitical anti-corruption prosecutors, in order to prevent Lula from running for president and to destroy the Workers\u0026#8217; Party.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut on the Brazilian right, there was widespread popular support for the corruption probe, the team of prosecutors, and Moro.

Over the course of more than two years, Moro suggested to the prosecutor that his team change the sequence of who they would investigate; insisted on less downtime between raids; gave strategic advice and informal tips; provided the prosecutors with advance knowledge of his decisions; offered constructive criticism of prosecutorial filings; and even scolded Dallagnol as if the prosecutor worked for the judge. Such conduct is unethical for a judge, who is responsible for maintaining neutrality to guarantee a fair trial, and it violates the Judiciary\u0026#8217;s Code of Ethics for Brazil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn one illustrative chat, Moro, referring to new rounds of search warrants and interrogations, suggested to Dallagnol that it might be preferable to “reverse the order of the two planned [phases].\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNumerous other instances in this archive reveal Moro — then a judge, and now Bolsonaro’s justice minister — actively collaborating with the prosecutors to strengthen their case. After a month of silence from the Car Wash task force, Moro asked: \u0026#8220;Hasn\u0026#8217;t it been a long time without an operation?\u0026#8221; In another instance, Moro said, \u0026#8220;You cannot make that kind of mistake now\u0026#8221; — a reference to what he considered to be an error by the Federal Police. \u0026#8220;But think hard whether that\u0026#8217;s a good idea… the facts would have to be serious,\u0026#8221; he counseled after Dallagnol told him of a motion he planned to file. \u0026#8220;What do you think of these crazy statements from the PT national board? Should we officially rebut?\u0026#8221; he asked, using the plural — \u0026#8220;we\u0026#8221; — in response to criticisms of the Car Wash investigation by Lula\u0026#8217;s Workers\u0026#8217; Party, showing that he viewed himself and the Car Wash prosecutors as united in the same cause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs in the United States, Brazil\u0026#8217;s criminal justice system employs the accusatory model, which requires separation between the accuser and judge. Under this model, the judge must analyze the allegations of both sides in an impartial, disinterested manner. But the chats between Moro and Dallagnol show that, when he was a judge, the current justice minister improperly interfered in the Car Wash task force\u0026#8217;s work, acting informally as an aid and advisor to the prosecution. In secret, he was helping design and construct the very criminal case that he would then “neutrally” adjudicate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuch coordination between the judge and the Public Prosecutor\u0026#8217;s Office outside of official proceedings squarely contradicts the public narrative that Car Wash prosecutors, Moro, and their supporters have presented and vigorously defended over the years. Moro and Dallagnol have been accused of secret collaboration since the early days of Car Wash, but these suspicions — until now — were not backed by concrete evidence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother example of Moro crossing the line separating prosecutor and judge is in a conversation with Dallagnol on December 7, 2015, when he informally passed on a tip about Lula\u0026#8217;s case to the prosecutors. \u0026#8220;So. The following. Source informed me that the contact person is annoyed at having been asked to issue draft property transfer deeds for one of the ex-president\u0026#8217;s children. Apparently the person would be willing to provide the information. I\u0026#8217;m therefore passing it along.

Moro added, \u0026#8220;And it would be dozens of properties.\u0026#8221; Dallagnol later advised Moro that he called the source, but she would not talk: \u0026#8220;I\u0026#8217;m thinking of drafting a subpoena, based on apocryphal news,\u0026#8221; the prosecutor said. While it is not entirely clear what this means, it appears that Dallagnol was floating the idea of inventing an anonymous complaint that could be used to compel the source to testify. Moro, rather than chastise the prosecutor or remain silent, appears to endorse the proposal: \u0026#8220;Better to formalize then,\u0026#8221; the judge replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoro has publicly and vehemently denied on several occasions that he ever worked in partnership with the team of prosecutors.

Their indictment accused Lula of receiving a beachfront triplex apartment from the construction firm Grupo OAS as a bribe in exchange for facilitating millions of dollars in contracts with Petrobras, but they lacked solid documentary evidence to prove that the apartment was Lula’s or that he ever facilitated any contracts. Without the apartment, there was no case, and without the Petrobras link, the case would fall out of their jurisdiction and into that of the São Paulo division of the Public Prosecutor\u0026#8217;s office, which had argued that it, rather than Operation Car Wash prosecutors, had jurisdiction over the case against Lula.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;They will say that we are accusing based on newspaper articles and fragile evidence \u0026#8230; so it\u0026#8217;d be good if this item is wrapped up tight.

I\u0026#8217;m going to kiss whichever one of you found this.\u0026#8221; The \u003ca href=\"https://oglobo.globo.com/politica/caso-bancoop-triplex-do-casal-lula-esta-atrasado-3041591\"\u003earticle\u003c/a\u003e, headlined \u0026#8220;Bancoop Case: Lula Couple\u0026#8217;s Triplex Is Delayed,\u0026#8221; was the first to publicly mention Lula owning an apartment in Guarujá, a coastal town in São Paulo state. The 645-word article, published years before the Car Wash investigation began, does not mention OAS or Petrobras and instead covers the bankruptcy of the construction cooperative behind the development and how it could negatively impact the delivery date of Lula\u0026#8217;s new vacation apartment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe article was submitted as evidence and, in his decision to convict Lula, Moro wrote that the O Globo article \u0026#8220;is quite relevant from a probative point of view.\u0026#8221; But Lula’s defense attorneys dispute that he was the owner of a triplex, claiming instead that he purchased a smaller, single level apartment on a lower floor, and the O Globo article presented no documentation proving otherwise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoreover, there is a small but telling inconsistency between the O Globo article and the claims of the prosecution regarding the triplex. The article itself puts Lula’s penthouse in Tower B, and even notes that Tower A is yet to be built at the time the article was written: “The second tower, if constructed according to the project blueprints, finalized in the early 2000s, may end part of Lula’s joy: the building will be in front of the president\u0026#8217;s property, obstructing his ocean view at Guarujá.” But the prosecutors alleged that Lula owned the beachfront triplex in Tower A. Without noting this contradiction, Item 191 of the indictment cites the O Globo article: “This article explained that the then President LULA and [his wife] MARISA LETÍCIA would receive a triplex penthouse, with a view to the sea, in the said venture.\u0026#8221; That is the apartment that would eventually be seized by authorities and that Lula would be convicted of receiving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCar Wash prosecutors used the article as evidence that the triplex belonged to the presidential family, but indicted and convicted Lula on a triplex in a different building — demonstrating that the investigation was imprecise on the central point of their case: identifying the bribe that Lula allegedly received from the contractor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"shortcode\" data-shortcode=\"newsletter\" data-campaign=\"\" data-cta=\"\" data-headline=\"\" data-layout=\"\" data-subhead=\"\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the indictment was revealed during a press conference on September 14, the triplex and its provenance as a bribe from OAS were the key pieces of evidence on the charges of passive corruption and money laundering. In a now infamous moment, Dallagnol presented a typo-laden PowerPoint presentation that showed \u0026#8220;Lula\u0026#8221; written in a blue bubble surrounded by 14 other bubbles containing everything from “Lula’s reaction” and “expressiveness” to “illicit enrichment” and “bribeocracy.” All arrows pointed back to Lula, whom they characterized as the mastermind behind a sprawling criminal enterprise.

Sobre ela, o juiz escreveu: “\u003ca href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6144458-sentenc3a7a-Lula.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eA matéria em questão é bastante relevante do ponto de vista probatório.\u003c/a\u003e”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMas a reportagem não bate com ao menos dois pontos do que é dito na denúncia do MPF. O texto do Globo atribui o triplex a Lula e, para comprovar isso, usa a declaração do então candidato à reeleição apresentada à Justiça Eleitoral em 2006. Ela afirma o seguinte: “Participação Cooperativa Habitacional Apartamento em construção no Guarujá \u0026#8211; SP Maio 2005 \u0026#8211; R$ 47.695,38 já pagos”. Em tese, a cota poderia ser usada para qualquer apartamento – a defesa de Lula alegaria mais tarde que se tratava de uma unidade simples. O que é certo é que a palavra \u003ci\u003etriplex\u003c/i\u003e não aparece na lista de bens do político usada pelo Globo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA segunda inconsistência poderia ter sido percebida pelos procuradores com uma leitura atenta da própria reportagem. A matéria do Globo atribuiu a Lula a propriedade de um triplex na torre B, o prédio dos fundos do condomínio. Isso fica claro na matéria: “A segunda torre (a torre A), se construída como informa a planta do empreendimento, lançado no início dos anos 2000, pode acabar com parte da alegria de Lula: o prédio ficará na frente do imóvel do presidente, atrapalhando a vista para o mar do Guarujá, cidade do litoral paulista.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class='stylized pull-right'data-shortcode-type='pullquote' data-pull='right'\u003eA Lava Jato usou a reportagem como prova de que o apartamento era, sim, uma propriedade ou uma aspiração da família presidencial, mas indicou outro imóvel na denúncia.\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNa denúncia feita pela Lava Jato, no entanto, os procuradores afirmam que o triplex de Lula fica na torre A, que ainda não existia quando a reportagem foi publicada. Mas, no item 191 da denúncia assinada pelos 14 procuradores, há o seguinte trecho (citando a reportagem do Globo): “Essa matéria dava conta de que o então Presidente LULA e MARISA LETÍCIA seriam contemplados com uma cobertura triplex, com vista para o mar, no referido empreendimento”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSegundo a apuração do jornal, isso não é verdade. A reportagem diz claramente que o casal Lula da Silva perderia a vista para o mar com a construção da torre A, que seria erguida à frente da torre B, portanto, em frente ao triplex que o Globo atribuiu a Lula.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Lava Jato usou a reportagem como prova de que o apartamento era, sim, uma propriedade ou uma aspiração da família presidencial, mas indicou outro imóvel na denúncia. Uma evidência de que a investigação foi imprecisa num dos pontos mais cruciais da acusação: na definição do imóvel que materializaria a propina que Lula teria recebido da empreiteira.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAo longo de semanas, nós tentamos contatos com fontes que poderiam ter acesso à troca de e-mails entre a assessoria do petista e a repórter do jornal, mas não obtivemos sucesso. Enquanto o Globo alega que os e-mails foram “inutilizados”, a assessoria diz não ter guardado cópia. Uma terceira dúvida, portanto, ainda permanece: a reportagem diz que Lula era dono de um triplex no prédio, mas diz que a assessoria da Presidência confirmou que o petista tinha um “imóvel” no local.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eO que é verdade: a cota estava declarada em seu imposto de renda. Sem os e-mails, não há como saber se o Globo inquiriu Lula sobre o \u003ci\u003etriplex\u003c/i\u003e ou apenas sobre um \u003ci\u003eimóvel,\u003c/i\u003e ou se a assessoria do petista tomou uma coisa por outra – e, sem querer, abasteceu a denúncia que viria contra Lula anos depois.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAinda que a localização do triplex na torre A ou B pareça irrelevante para a acusação por lavagem de dinheiro, ela deveria ao menos colocar em dúvida o valor de prova da reportagem, mencionada por Moro como um dos argumentos para a condenação de Lula.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"shortcode\" data-shortcode=\"chapter\" data-id=\"three\" data-label=\"%E2%80%98A%20den%C3%BAncia%20%C3%A9%20baseada%20em%20muita%20prova%20indireta%20de%20autoria%2C%20mas%20n%C3%A3o%20caberia%20dizer%20isso%E2%80%99\" data-content=\"%E2%80%98A%20den%C3%BAncia%20%C3%A9%20baseada%20em%20muita%20prova%20indireta%20de%20autoria%2C%20mas%20n%C3%A3o%20caberia%20dizer%20isso%E2%80%99\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-bleed xtra-large-bleed width-auto' style='width: auto;'\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-254131\" src=\"https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/06/triplex-1-1560094594.jpg\" alt=\"Triplex 1\" /\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-top: -20px\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"photo-grid\" data-columns=\"2\" data-credit=\"Fotos: Nelson Almeida/AFP/Getty Images\" data-photos=\"%5B%7B%22alt%22%3A%22Triplex%202%22%2C%22src%22%3A%22https%3A%5C%2F%5C%2Ftheintercept.com%5C%2Fwp-uploads%5C%2Fsites%5C%2F1%5C%2F2019%5C%2F06%5C%2Ftriplex-2-1560094586.jpg%22%7D%2C%7B%22alt%22%3A%22Triplex%203%22%2C%22src%22%3A%22https%3A%5C%2F%5C%2Ftheintercept.com%5C%2Fwp-uploads%5C%2Fsites%5C%2F1%5C%2F2019%5C%2F06%5C%2Ftriplex-3-1560094582.jpg%22%7D%5D\" data-size=\"xtra-large\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cu class=\"no-underline\"\u003eNa véspera da denúncia,\u003c/u\u003e Dallagnol voltou ao celular e comentou mais uma vez sobre a peça de acusação, analisando a qualidade das provas que eles tinham em mãos. \u0026#8220;A opinião pública é decisiva e é um caso construído com prova indireta e palavra de colaboradores contra um ícone que passou incolume pelo mensalão\u0026#8221;, ele teclou no grupo Filhos do Januário 1.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo dia seguinte, quarta-feira 14, a Lava Jato mostraria sua primeira denúncia contra Lula, numa entrevista coletiva em uma sala de reuniões de um hotel de luxo em Curitiba. O triplex – segundo a Lava Jato, reformado pela OAS e doado ao político como propina em contratos da empreiteira com a Petrobras – era a peça central da denúncia por corrupção passiva e lavagem de dinheiro.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDallagnol voltaria ao assunto numa conversa privada com o então juiz Sergio Moro, em 16 de setembro, dois dias após a denúncia. O procurador estava sendo duramente criticado por parte da opinião pública, que alegava fragilidade na denúncia. Tinha virado, também, alvo de chacotas e memes pelo PowerPoint que apresentou na entrevista coletiva.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eO coordenador da Lava Jato escreveu a Moro: \u0026#8220;A denúncia é baseada em muita prova indireta de autoria, mas não caberia dizer isso na denúncia e na comunicação evitamos esse ponto.” Depois, entrou em detalhes técnicos: “Não foi compreendido que a longa exposição sobre o comando do esquema era necessária para imputar a corrupção para o ex-presidente.

It also reveals a long-denied political and ideological agenda. One glaring example occurred 10 days before the first round of presidential voting last year, when a Supreme Court justice granted a petition from the country’s largest newspaper, Folha de São Paulo, to interview Lula, who was in prison on corruption charges brought by the Car Wash task force.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImmediately upon learning of that decision on September 28, 2018, the team of prosecutors who handled Lula’s corruption case — who spent years vehemently denying that they were driven by political motives of any kind — began discussing in an encrypted, private Telegram chat group how to block, subvert, or undermine the Supreme Court decision. This was based on their expressed fear that the decision would help the PT — Lula’s party — win the election. Based on their stated desire to prevent the PT\u0026#8217;s return to power, they spent hours debating strategies to prevent or dilute the political impact of Lula’s interview.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Car Wash prosecutors explicitly said that their motive in stopping Lula’s interview was to prevent the PT from winning. One of the prosecutors, Laura Tessler, exclaimed upon learning of the decision, “What a joke!” and then explained the urgency of preventing or undermining the decision. “A press conference before the second round of voting could help elect Haddad,” she wrote in the chat group, referring to the PT\u0026#8217;s candidate Fernando Haddad. The chief of the prosecutor task force, Deltan Dallagnol, conducted a separate conservation with a longtime confidant, also a prosecutor, and they agreed that they would “pray” together that the events of that day would not usher in the PT’s return to power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"promote-embed\" data-promo=\"secret-brazil-archive\" data-crop=\"promo\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany in Brazil have long accused the Car Wash prosecutors, as well as the judge who adjudicated the corruption cases, Sérgio Moro (now the country’s justice minister under President Jair Bolsonaro), of being driven by ideological and political motives.

Supporters of the PT and many others in Brazil have long insisted that these prosecutors, while masquerading as apolitical and non-ideological actors whose only agenda was fighting corruption, were in fact right-wing ideologues whose overriding mission was to destroy the PT and prevent Lula\u0026#8217;s return to power in the 2018 election.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese documents lend obvious credibility to those accusations. They show extensive plotting in secret to block and undermine the September 28 judicial order from Supreme Court Justice Ricardo Lewandowski, which authorized one of the country’s most prominent reporters, Folha\u0026#8217;s Mônica Bergamo, to interview Lula in prison. Lewandowski’s decision was expressly grounded in the right of a free press, which he said entitled the newspaper to speak to Lula and report on his perspectives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his decision, Lewandowski also explained that the arguments that had been used all year to prevent a prison interview with Lula — namely, “security fears“ and the need to keep prisoners silent — were blatantly invalid given the numerous other prison interviews “permitted for prisoners condemned of crimes such as trafficking, murder and international organized crime.” The ruling also noted that Lula was neither in a maximum-security prison nor under a specially restrictive prison regime, further eroding the rationale for a ban on interviewing him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUp until that point, Lula — widely regarded as one of the most effective and charismatic political communicators in the democratic world — had been held incommunicado, prevented from speaking to the public about the election. Any pre-election interview of Lula, in which he could have offered his views on Bolsonaro and the other candidates, including the PT’s Haddad, would have commanded massive media attention and likely influenced a decisive block of voters who, to this day, remain highly loyal to the former president (which is why Lula, even once he was imprisoned, remained the poll frontrunner).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Car Wash prosecutors learned of the judicial decision authorizing Folha’s pre-election prison interview with Lula when an article about it was posted in their encrypted Telegram chat group. The panic among them was immediate. They repeatedly worried that the interview, to be conducted so close to the first round of voting, would help the PT’s Haddad win the presidential election. Based explicitly on that fear, the Car Wash prosecutors spent the day working feverishly to develop strategies to either overturn the ruling, delay Lula’s interview until after the election, or ensure that it was structured so as to minimize its political impact and its ability to help the PT win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacting to the decision, Tessler, one of the prosecutors, exclaimed: “What a joke!!! Revolting!!! There he goes hold a rally in prison. A true circus. After Mônica Bergamo, based on the principle of equal treatment, I’m sure many other journalists will also be coming … and we’re left here, made to act like clowns with a supreme court like that …” Another prosecutor, Athayde Ribeiro Costa, responded to the decision with one word and numerous exclamation marks: “Mafiosos!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe prosecutors, according to the time stamps on their chats, spent nearly a full day inventing strategies for how to prevent the Lula interview from taking place before the election or at least dilute its impact — from speculating whether a press conference would be less effective than a one-on-one interview, or whether they should petition to allow all other prisoners to be interviewed to distract attention from Lula. Tessler then made clear why these prosecutors were so deeply upset that the public could be allowed to hear from the former president so soon before the election: “Who knows … but an interview before the second round of voting could help elect Haddad.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-bleed large-bleed width-auto' style='width: auto;'\u003e\n\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-253991\" src=\"https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/06/GettyImages-632785312-1560054341.jpg\" alt=\"Brazilian Deltan Dallagnol, attorney of the Federal Public Ministry, speaks during an interview in Curitiba, Brazil on January 26, 2017.

To the contrary, the entire discussion, held over many hours, reads far less like a meeting of neutral prosecutors than a war-room session of anti-PT political operatives and strategists, focused on the goal of determining the most effective way to prevent or minimize the political impact of Lula’s interview.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAthayde Ribeiro Costa, for instance, cynically suggested that the omission of any date in Lewandowski’s decision could allow the Federal Police to purposely schedule the interview for after the election while pretending to comply with the order: “There’s no date. So the Federal Police could just schedule this for after the election, and we’ll still be in compliance with the decision.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother prosecutor, Januário Paludo, proposed a series of actions designed to prevent or minimize the Lula interview: “Plan A: we could enter an appeal on the Supreme Court itself, zero probability [of success].

It’ll be chaotic but reduces the likelihood that the interview is directed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt no point did Dallagnol, who actively participated in the discussion throughout the day, or any other Car Wash prosecutor, suggest that it was improper for such political considerations to drive prosecutorial strategizing.

Their critics have insisted that they have abused and exploited their law enforcement powers with the politicized goal of preventing Lula from returning to the presidency and destroying his leftist Workers\u0026#8217; Party, or the PT. Moro and the prosecutors have, with equal vehemence, denied that they have any political allegiances or objectives and have said they are simply trying to cleanse Brazil of corruption.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut, until now, the Car Wash prosecutors and Moro have carried out their work largely in secret, preventing the public from evaluating the validity of the accusations against them and the truth of their denials. That\u0026#8217;s what makes this new archive so journalistically valuable: For the first time, the public will learn what these judges and prosecutors were saying and doing when they thought nobody was listening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday\u0026#8217;s articles show, among other things, that the Car Wash prosecutors spoke openly of their desire to prevent the PT from winning the election and took steps to carry out that agenda, and that Moro secretly and unethically collaborated with the Car Wash prosecutors to help design the case against Lula despite serious internal doubts about the evidence supporting the accusations, only for him to then pretend to be its neutral adjudicator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Intercept’s only role in obtaining these materials was to receive them from our source, who contacted us many weeks ago (long before the \u003ca href=\"https://riotimesonline.com/brazil-news/brazil/brazils-justice-ministers-smartphone-hacked-for-six-hours/\"\u003erecently alleged hacking of Moro\u0026#8217;s telephone\u003c/a\u003e) and informed us that they had already obtained the full set of materials and was eager to provide them to journalists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInforming the public of matters in the public interest and exposing wrongdoing was our guiding principle in doing this initial reporting on the archive, and it will continue to be our guiding principle as we report further on the large number of materials we have been provided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sheer volume of materials in this archive, as well as the fact that many documents include private conversations among public officials, requires us to make journalistic decisions about which documents should be reported on and published, and which documents should be withheld.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen making these judgments, we employ the standard used by journalists in democracies around the world: namely, that material revealing wrongdoing or deceit by powerful actors should be reported, but information that is purely private in nature and whose disclosure may infringe upon legitimate privacy interests or other social values should be withheld.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIndeed, in our reporting on this material, we are guided by the same rationale that led much of Brazilian society — including many journalists, commentators, and activists — to praise the \u003ca href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/17/release-tapped-phone-calls-lula-rousseff-deepens-brazil-chaos\"\u003edisclosure in 2016 by Moro and various media outlets of the private telephone calls\u003c/a\u003e between Lula and former President Dilma Rousseff, in which the two leaders discussed the possibility of Lula becoming a minister in Dilma’s government. Disclosure of those private calls was crucial in turning public opinion against the PT, helping to lay the groundwork for Dilma\u0026#8217;s 2016 impeachment and Lula\u0026#8217;s 2018 imprisonment. The principle invoked to justify that disclosure was the same one we are adhering to in our reporting on these materials: that a democracy is healthier when significant actions undertaken in secret by powerful figures are revealed to the public.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut unlike those disclosures by Moro and various media outlets of the private conversations between Lula and Dilma — which included not only matters whose disclosures were in the public interest, but also private communications of Lula that \u003ca href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/transcript-of-phone-calls-between-former-brazilian-president-luiz-inacio-lula-da-silva-and-various-political-supporters/article29285890/\"\u003ehad no public relevance\u003c/a\u003e and that many argued were released with the intention of personally embarrassing Lula — The Intercept has resolved to withhold any private communications, audio recordings, videos, or other materials relating to Moro, Dallagnol, or any other parties that are purely private in nature and thus unrelated to matters of public interest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"shortcode\" data-shortcode=\"newsletter\" data-campaign=\"\" data-cta=\"\" data-headline=\"\" data-layout=\"\" data-subhead=\"\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe have taken measures to secure the archive and all of its component materials outside of Brazil, so that numerous journalists have access to it, ensuring that no authorities in any country will have the ability to prevent reporting based on these materials. We intend to report on and publish stories based on the archive as expeditiously as possible in accordance with our high standards of factual accuracy and journalistic responsibility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConsistent with journalistic practice in countries where the press operates under the threat of censorship and prior restraint orders, as has been the situation recently in Bolsonaro-led Brazil, we did not seek comment from the powerful legal officials mentioned in these stories prior to publication because we did not want to give them advance notice of this reporting, and because the documents speak for themselves. We contacted them immediately upon publication and will update the stories with their comments if and when they provide them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven the immense power wielded by these actors, and the secrecy under which they have — until now — been able to operate, transparency is crucial for Brazil and the international community to have a clear understanding of what they have really done.

In the classroom it is rare to have the whole class fully-engaged in something for a long period of time, since the children will have different interests and levels, so it is essential to plan a number of activities for each lesson. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eThe more variety you can include in the type of activities and tasks you plan, the easier it is to provide something enjoyable and relevant for each child. Choose short tasks and try to have a couple of extra activities up your sleeve in case something you planned doesn’t work well. However, don’t worry if you don’t have time to do them all – you can always save them for a future lesson.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2.

When planning your lesson, think about how your students might be feeling at each stage. After doing some reading or quiet work, students may start to become restless, and this is the ideal time to get them up and moving about.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eWhile you are in class, pay close attention to the mood of the class.

Why not try introducing brain breaks at strategic points in your lessons? Brain breaks are short physical activities or games designed to get the blood flowing and to re-energise students to help them get ready for learning. They range from short activities that last a couple of minutes, to longer breaks that may be suitable if your lessons last more than an hour.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://unicefkidpower.org/brain-breaks-for-kids/.\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eFind out more about brain breaks. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e4.

For primary classes, start by asking one or two students to take charge of a ready-made activity, e.g. one from your course book. They should give instructions, demonstrate, monitor as necessary, and finally check answers. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eWhen students are used to doing this, you can start to have them work in pairs or small groups to plan their own activities to use in class.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e5.

isn\u0026#8217;t it better for him to settle his own country\u0026#8217;s internal problems first to prevent so much casualties from the French nation?\u0026#8221; the Iranian speaker asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Seyyed Abbas Mousavi had earlier dismissed Macron’s statements, saying such remarks will not at all help save the Iran nuclear deal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Despite [making] some remarks and [issuing] political statements, the European parties have failed so far to fulfil their commitments under the JCPOA and their obligations following the US’ illegal withdrawal from the agreement,” Mousavi said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Europeans, he added, have failed to prepare the grounds for Iran to fully benefit from the multilateral agreement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIran’s reaction came after Macron told Trump he doesn’t think Paris and Washington have differences over Iran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think we do share the same objective on Iran,” the French leader said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe listed four common priorities of the US and France in addressing Iranian behaviour moving forward: preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, reducing Iran’s ballistic activity, containing Iran’s regional activity and establishing peace in the region.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All the other debates are about technicalities,” he said, calling for fresh negotiations to extend the terms of the JCPOA and to achieve those

But what you really want to know about is the games, so let\u0026rsquo;s get to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eStar Wars Jedi: Fallen Order\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eStar Wars Jedi: Fallen Order\u003c/em\u003e kicked off the day, with 15 minutes of gameplay to walk us through this Force-enabled new \u003cem\u003eStar Wars\u003c/em\u003e adventure. Vince Zampella, CEO of Fallen Order developer Respawn Entertainment, and game director Stig Asmussen provided commentary after the gameplay session.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis single-player adventure takes place on a variety of planets, some months after the first enforcement of Order 66, which, as seen in \u0026ldquo;Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith,\u0026rdquo; wiped out all the Jedi in the galaxy. Well, not all of them. Ben Kenobi survived, and so did Cal Kestis. Cal is a mere Padewan as \u003cem\u003eFallen Order\u003c/em\u003e opens, but this gameplay demo begins about three hours into the game, as he\u0026rsquo;s begun to train his Force powers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg class=\"lazyload alignnone size-full wp-image-117434\" src=\"image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" data-src=\"https://news.xbox.com/en-us/wp-content/uploads/JFO_REVEAL_Campfire_1080_Clean.jpg\" alt=\"Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-117434\" src=\"https://news.xbox.com/en-us/wp-content/uploads/JFO_REVEAL_Campfire_1080_Clean.jpg\" alt=\"Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe demo shows part of a mission on the Wookiee homeworld, Kashyyyk, where Imperial forces are mining sap to create a dangerous material. Cal has run across Forest Whitaker\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Rogue One: A Star Wars Story\u0026rdquo; character Saw Gerrera, who sets up a diversion while the young Jedi moves to break imprisoned Wookiees out of jail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as a young Jedi, Cal has enough command over the Force to push and pull Stormtroopers, slow time to the degree that he can dodge laser blasts, and perform double jumps that send him flying over the heads of even the giant spiders that lurk on Kashyyyk. Yeah, I said giant spiders. (They\u0026rsquo;re called Wyyyschokk, if you want to be specific.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are a few black-armored stormtroopers with double-ended energy weapons, called Purge Troopers, and a KX droid which acts as a mini-boss, and begins to bash Cal just as the demo closed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg class=\"lazyload alignnone size-full wp-image-117437\" src=\"image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" data-src=\"https://news.xbox.com/en-us/wp-content/uploads/JFO_REVEAL_2ndSister_1080_Clean.jpg\" alt=\"Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-117437\" src=\"https://news.xbox.com/en-us/wp-content/uploads/JFO_REVEAL_2ndSister_1080_Clean.jpg\" alt=\"Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Cal has a friend, the explorer droid BD-1. (Yeah, \u003cem\u003eTitanfall\u003c/em\u003e fans, that\u0026rsquo;s a naming convention just like the BT-7274. That \u0026ldquo;BT\u0026rdquo; meant \u0026ldquo;Buddy Titan,\u0026rdquo; and here the \u0026ldquo;BD\u0026rdquo; means \u0026ldquo;Buddy Droid.\u0026rdquo;) The droid\u0026rsquo;s sounds are provided by long-time Star Wars sound designer Ben Burtt, and he can hack doors, scan environments, and provide stim packs on demand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eStar Wars Jedi: Fallen Order\u003c/em\u003e is canonical, so everything that happens here can technically affect other \u003cem\u003eStar Wars\u003c/em\u003e stories. That also means you can\u0026rsquo;t just do anything you\u0026rsquo;d like \u0026mdash;\u0026nbsp;there\u0026rsquo;s no choice to lean into the Dark Side of the Force, for example. Cal is a hero, and that\u0026rsquo;s more or less how he has to be played \u0026mdash; not that he\u0026rsquo;s above running a few Stormtroopers through with his lightsaber.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eStar Wars Jedi: Fallen Order\u003c/em\u003e releases November 15 on Xbox One.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eApex Legends\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRespawn Entertainment had more than \u003cem\u003eStar Wars\u003c/em\u003e to offer, too, as they also provided info on Season Two of \u003cem\u003eApex Legends\u003c/em\u003e. Project lead Drew McCoy gave some insight on the new season, Battle Charge, which kicks off on July 2.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are some new tricks in Season 2: A new weapon, a new Legend, a Ranked Mode, and some other big tweaks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg class=\"lazyload alignnone size-full wp-image-117478\" src=\"image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" data-src=\"https://news.xbox.com/en-us/wp-content/uploads/APEX_Legends_Screenshot_Season2_Wattson_Pylon_Shush.jpg\" alt=\"Apex Legends\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-117478\" src=\"https://news.xbox.com/en-us/wp-content/uploads/APEX_Legends_Screenshot_Season2_Wattson_Pylon_Shush.jpg\" alt=\"Apex Legends\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe new Care Package weapon, the plasma-fueled L-Star light machine gun, is designed to be overpowered, but also has ammo limited to what drops with the gun. It can even blow open doors from a distance, which opens up some new tactical possibilities. There will be two new Hop-Ups, though they weren\u0026rsquo;t named, and new skins for legends and weapons. A number of existing weapons have been rebalanced, and some of the weaker weapons buffed up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBattle Pass will behave differently, with progression based on completing challenges rather than timed events. Walk away for a week and the Battle Pass challenges will stack and can be completed when you come back to the game. Badges and stat trackers are gone, but you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to level to 100 much faster than in Season 1, with more crafting medals to use once you hit that point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s also the new ranked mode, which offers progression through six tiers, with special matchmaking for each tier. The only downside there is that matchmaking for higher tiers might take longer than for lower, but the promise is better matchmaking, for play appropriate to the higher-level tier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg class=\"lazyload alignnone size-full wp-image-117479\" src=\"image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" data-src=\"https://news.xbox.com/en-us/wp-content/uploads/APEX_Legends_Screenshot_Season2_Wattson_Rocks.jpg\" alt=\"Apex Legends\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-117479\" src=\"https://news.xbox.com/en-us/wp-content/uploads/APEX_Legends_Screenshot_Season2_Wattson_Rocks.jpg\" alt=\"Apex Legends\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, the 10th legend, Watson, is introduced. She\u0026rsquo;s an active support character inspired by engineers. She can drop pylons which form a defensive grid, and the defenses can conform to the specifics of any given map. Watson\u0026rsquo;s gameplay was compared to almost an RTS-style of play, especially since the fences will blink off for team members to run through, and will ping the entire team if crossed by enemies. She can use an Interception Pylon, which accelerates Watson\u0026rsquo;s cooldown when she\u0026rsquo;s near it, and can also drop grenades and other offensive goodies on enemies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWatson\u0026rsquo;s backstory is interesting as well \u0026mdash;\u0026nbsp;she and her father invented the Ring, and she grew up in the arena as it was being built. Through Watson, we\u0026rsquo;ll start to learn about the lore of the game. She\u0026rsquo;s described as the \u0026ldquo;kid sister\u0026rdquo; to the Legends, and \u0026ldquo;the one person who could probably unite all the Legends.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, one video at the end of the demo teased an absolutely massive creature, with an eye the size of a car. We don\u0026rsquo;t know what that belongs to, but there are \u0026ldquo;a couple of big things coming into King\u0026rsquo;s Canyon at the start of Season 2.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eBattlefield V\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom there, we turn to \u003cem\u003eBattlefield V\u003c/em\u003e. Creative Director Lars Gustavsson announced some big changes as Chapter 4 approaches. The max rank is going up \u0026mdash;\u0026nbsp;way up. While players currently max out at rank 50, that cap is being elevated to 500, starting in August. As players progress through that massively expanded system, there will be new Company coins to earn, and at every 50th rank players will get new rank icons and dog tags to show off their achievement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg class=\"lazyload alignnone size-full wp-image-117480\" src=\"image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" data-src=\"https://news.xbox.com/en-us/wp-content/uploads/BFV_Chapter4_AlSudanAction.jpg\" alt=\"Battlefield V\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-117480\" src=\"https://news.xbox.com/en-us/wp-content/uploads/BFV_Chapter4_AlSudanAction.jpg\" alt=\"Battlefield V\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrivate matches are coming as well, as a replacement for the rented server program. The basic private setup will be free to all, for anyone who wants to set up their own server and define game specifics. That will arrive in September of this year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe also got many details about Chapter 4. The first map, Al-Sundan, coming on June 27, is a huge, very \u0026ldquo;classic Battlefield\u0026rdquo; map set in North Africa. It\u0026rsquo;s adapted from Under No Flag, and sees the team doubling down on land and vehicle combat, with a significant role for air support as well. It\u0026rsquo;s a distance-oriented map, with mounted guns, planes and transports, and six flags placed across the map.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg class=\"lazyload alignnone size-full wp-image-117482\" src=\"image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" data-src=\"https://news.xbox.com/en-us/wp-content/uploads/BFV_Chapter4_SpecialForcesAction.jpg\" alt=\"Battlefield V\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-117482\" src=\"https://news.xbox.com/en-us/wp-content/uploads/BFV_Chapter4_SpecialForcesAction.jpg\" alt=\"Battlefield V\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarita, coming in July, is a much smaller, tighter map, oriented around close infantry combat, and set on the Albanian/Greek border. This one is described as fostering \u0026ldquo;total creative chaos\u0026rdquo; as units explore the narrow streets, with a lot of vertical gameplay options thanks to hills and multi-storey homes. And in August, there will be two more close-quarters maps, set in Provence, France, and the Nordic countryside. Those are oriented around tight squad play, with a lot of flanking routes, both obvious and hidden, to foster more of that creative chaos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd in October, we\u0026rsquo;ll get Operation Underground, a reimagined version of Operation Metro from \u003cem\u003eBattlefield 3\u003c/em\u003e. This is not a remastering, but a total redesign with a mix of large spaces and narrow streets, subway cars, and underground environments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg class=\"lazyload alignnone size-full wp-image-117481\" src=\"image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" data-src=\"https://news.xbox.com/en-us/wp-content/uploads/BFV_Chapter4_Pacific.jpg\" alt=\"Battlefield V\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-117481\" src=\"https://news.xbox.com/en-us/wp-content/uploads/BFV_Chapter4_Pacific.jpg\" alt=\"Battlefield V\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGustavsoon also teased Chapter 5, which arrives at the end of the year and will mark the game\u0026rsquo;s return to the Pacific Theatre. The event showed only brief glimpses of the this \u0026ldquo;modern\u0026rdquo; take on Iwo Jima, but the designers said the maps have been based on real environment capture, and will feature \u0026ldquo;iconic weapons and gadgets, a new set of vehicles,\u0026rdquo; and the experience of invasion and amphibious warfare. The initial Chapter 5 package will have three maps, with two yet to be revealed in addition to Iwo Jima.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eFIFA 20\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe biggest deal in \u003cem\u003eFIFA 20\u003c/em\u003e is the effective revival of \u003cem\u003eFIFA Street\u003c/em\u003e, in the form of the Volta Football mode. Volta is designed as ultra-realistic street footy, with caged areas in London, a rooftop in Tokyo, and an underpass in Amsterdam acting as pitches. The ball never goes out of play in Volta, and players \u0026mdash;\u0026nbsp;including all the game\u0026rsquo;s licensed players and teams \u0026mdash; can use walls and curbs and fast, unique footwork to play dynamic matches of any team size, with or without goalkeepers. You can create female players and gender-mixed teams, with a wide variety of street-ready clothes, shoes, hair, and tattoos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLead gameplay producer Sam Rivera talked about developing this latest \u003cem\u003eFIFA\u003c/em\u003e installment based on community engagement and making a big push for deeper innovation and authenticity. The core gameplay changes here are part of a combination of features the team calls Football Intelligence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg class=\"lazyload alignnone size-full wp-image-117484\" src=\"image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" data-src=\"https://news.xbox.com/en-us/wp-content/uploads/Tokyo_Gameplay_Hires_WM_16x9.jpg\" alt=\"FIFA 20\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-117484\" src=\"https://news.xbox.com/en-us/wp-content/uploads/Tokyo_Gameplay_Hires_WM_16x9.jpg\" alt=\"FIFA 20\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis breaks down into three core pushes. The first is on-the-ball action, with new attacking and defending moves for one-on-one encounters. Composed finishing offers better goal shots, with rewritten fundamentals of the action to scale difficulty on more ambitious shots. Strafe dribbling offers more precise control of the ball while dribbling, and moves to lure defenders in, the better to deploy speed and skills to evade them.

We\u0026rsquo;ll stick with Mahomes. To get into the Zone, a player must complete a set of in-game challenges; Mahomes has to complete four passes of 30 yards or more to get in the zone. Once that\u0026rsquo;s done, he \u0026mdash;\u0026nbsp;and only he \u0026mdash;\u0026nbsp;has access to Bazooka, which increases his maximum passing distance to 80 yards. When he\u0026rsquo;s in the Zone, Mahomes can throw further than anyone in the game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe also has Superstar Abilities, such as Escape Artist, which give him extra speed and agility when scrambling, and Dashing Deadeye, which gives perfect passing accuracy on the run. Those abilities are not exclusive to him. And while that Bazooka ability, combined with some of the Superstar Abilities, would seem to make Mahomes unbeatable, we know from last year\u0026rsquo;s postseason that he isn\u0026rsquo;t infallible, and \u003cem\u003eMadden\u003c/em\u003e works to model that as well. Defenders can knock even an X-Factor player like Mahomes out of the Zone. Aaron Donald, for example, has the Fearmonger Zone ability, which allows him to apply pressure to a quarterback even when being blocked. The whole system is designed to offer bonuses and counters, to replicate the \u0026ldquo;event football\u0026rdquo; games we saw in real stadiums in 2018.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg class=\"lazyload alignnone size-full wp-image-117487\" src=\"image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" data-src=\"https://news.xbox.com/en-us/wp-content/uploads/bears_52_Mack_003.jpg\" alt=\"Madden NFL 20\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1061\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-117487\" src=\"https://news.xbox.com/en-us/wp-content/uploads/bears_52_Mack_003.jpg\" alt=\"Madden NFL 20\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1061\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese players also have new Signature Animations, and the game in general features more robust playbooks with newly-implemented run/pass options \u0026mdash;\u0026nbsp;the RPO you\u0026rsquo;ll now hear discussed in every game \u0026mdash; and new gameplay mechanics like pump fakes\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA closed beta for \u003cem\u003eMadden NFL 20\u003c/em\u003e runs June 14-16; the game arrives on August 2.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Sims 4\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, Executive Producer Lyndsay Pearson and Senior Producer Michael Duke sat down to introduce \u003cem\u003eIsland Living\u003c/em\u003e, a new expansion for \u003cem\u003eThe Sims 4\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the name implies, this locates Sim action on Sulani, a lush island locale inspired by Polyesian cultures.

2019: Bleeding Edge Brings the Mayhem to Xbox and Windows 10 PC!","content":"\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s a super exciting time for us all here at Ninja Theory. During the E3 2019 Xbox briefing, we were thrilled to finally share our next original game \u0026ndash; \u003cem\u003eBleeding Edge\u003c/em\u003e \u0026ndash; a 4v4 team fighter that combines 3\u003csup\u003erd\u003c/sup\u003e person action combat with online team multiplayer, available with Xbox Game Pass for PC and Console. Our technical alpha is kicking off on June 27, so we\u0026rsquo;d love for players to head to \u003ca href=\"https://djeholdingsdrive.sharepoint.com/sites/XboxGamesTeam/Shared%20Documents/Ninja%20Theory/bleedingedge.com\"\u003ebleedingedge.com\u003c/a\u003e and sign up to get involved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach fighter in \u003cem\u003eBleeding Edge\u003c/em\u003e is unique, but roughly fits into an Assassin, Support or Heavy archetype.\u0026nbsp;There\u0026rsquo;s a mix of ranged and melee combat styles, and each character has an expressive kit of moves for players to explore and master. We\u0026rsquo;ve leant on our previous experience with combat games to make the action fast and fun, with stylish animation and a fluid feel. \u003cem\u003eBleeding Edge\u003c/em\u003e\u0026rsquo;s moment to moment gameplay is all about combos, dodging, timing and dexterity, but ultimately, good teamwork, synergy and strategy is needed to secure the win!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition to a diverse roster of fighters, \u003cem\u003eBleeding Edge\u003c/em\u003e features environmental hazards that are unique in every map. Players can yank opponents into an electric fence, charge them into the path of an oncoming train, or trap them in a raging fire pit!\u0026nbsp;These hazards add some extra spice to the objective based game modes, and can be exploited to create cool plays, win big fights, and make unexpected comebacks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlayers are also able to create unique loadouts for each fighter via cybernetic mods. All mods are earnable through gameplay and allow players to tweak builds to suit their playstyle, counter enemies, or capitalize on the team\u0026rsquo;s composition. There\u0026rsquo;s also a bunch of hoverboards to unlock, each fully customizable with paintjobs, stickers and trails.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe are really looking forward to working together with the community to make \u003cem\u003eBleeding Edge\u003c/em\u003e awesome.\u0026nbsp;This has been a passion project of ours at Ninja Theory for some time now, and we couldn\u0026rsquo;t be more excited to share this with our equally passionate fans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0026rsquo;ll have more to share on \u003cem\u003eBleeding Edge\u003c/em\u003e soon, but for now we\u0026rsquo;ll catch everyone at E3!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://news.xbox.com/en-us\"\u003eSee the rest of the story on Xbox Wire\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRelated:\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2019/05/30/microsoft-approach-to-pc-gaming/\"\u003eOur Approach to PC Gaming\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2019/03/21/gdc-2019-the-women-in-gaming-rally-2019-recap/\"\u003eGDC 2019: The Women in Gaming Rally 2019 Recap\u0026nbsp;\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2018/11/09/play-battlefield-v-starting-today-with-ea-access/\"\u003ePlay Battlefield V Starting Today with EA Access\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2018/11/01/guide-to-maps-battlefield-5-holland-and-north-africa/\"\u003eA Soldier\u0026rsquo;s Guide to the Maps of Battlefield V: Holland and North Africa\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2018/09/04/xbox-adaptive-controller-now-available/\"\u003eGaming Gets More Inclusive with the Launch of the Xbox Adaptive Controller\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2018/07/19/ultimate-game-sale-summer-2018/\"\u003eSummer\u0026rsquo;s Heating up with Huge Savings During the Ultimate Game Sale\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2019/06/09/june-9th-new-preview-delta-omega-rings-1906-update-1906-190607-1330/\"\u003eJune 9th : New Preview Delta \u0026amp;
