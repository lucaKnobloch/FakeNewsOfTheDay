Otherwise everybody would use an iPhone and a Mac, but Netflix is not a premium product, it can\u0026#8217;t win appealing to a sliver of the public, it needs all of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is how the publishing industry killed digital books.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite the hosannas of boomers boasting that they saved the physical book, it won\u0026#8217;t be long until they lose the war. You know change\u0026#8230;it looks like it\u0026#8217;s never going to happen, you laugh at the predictions, and then overnight, it takes hold. Can you say digital photography? Can you say internet connection?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople had been using digital cameras for years, but they were expensive. Just like people were communicating via bulletin boards utilizing low speed modems with arcane software. But non-traditional consumer camera companies, like Panasonic and Sony and Samsung, put out products while Nikon and other high-end manufacturers sat by, as well as the everyman\u0026#8217;s company Kodak, and then in a year, digital eclipsed film, just like that. Kinda like AOL turned everybody into an internet user, they made it easy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow we had a similar situation in the music business, with the iTunes Store. At first the labels considered it a joke, being Mac-only. But then when sales far exceeded expectations and distribution included Windows, suddenly this sideshow was throwing off revenue\u0026#8230; And what did the labels want to do? RAISE PRICES!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd who said they couldn\u0026#8217;t?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSTEVE JOBS!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe labels are greedy, short-term thinkers, why else would Universal have stored all those masters in an unprotected facility? The music business was always run on intimidation, but finally it came up against someone who wouldn\u0026#8217;t play that game, Apple kept prices low until consumers were hooked, then they jumped from 99 cents to $1.29.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e99 cents. Ever notice no car is advertised at a round number? How it\u0026#8217;s always something 99? Even gas! Our minds trick us into thinking $3.249 is equivalent to $3.24. But the truth is it\u0026#8217;s only a tenth of a cent from $3.25.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd going back to books, did you see that Pearson is going digital first on textbooks? Physical was killing them. They got no revenue on resale. And prices were so high, sales were less frequent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, they went to the subscription model. That\u0026#8217;s right, for less than print you get something that can be upgraded on a regular basis, like a streaming music service. Your subscription to Spotify, et al, is not a fixed picture, but a constantly rolling enterprise that adds new titles on a regular basis\u0026#8230;and as long as you keep paying ten bucks a month, you can hear them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTen bucks. Spotify is a public company under earnings pressure. It could immediately raise prices, but it would start hemorrhaging customers. If it\u0026#8217;s under ten bucks, it\u0026#8217;s a throwaway. Once it eclipses that number, you start to think about it. I mean there are months when we barely watch Netflix, but we don\u0026#8217;t cancel. But if you\u0026#8217;re counting your pennies, supporting a family, every little bit counts and you look for alternatives that are good enough, like Android and Windows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026#8217;s a huge market in good enough. Not everybody needs to buy Nike or 7 jeans or\u0026#8230; They\u0026#8217;ll settle for the knock-off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo Netflix is under Wall Street pressure, to pay for all that programming. So it keeps raising prices. Now you think they\u0026#8217;re going to keep going up FOREVER! You feel the company no longer cares for you, the bond is broken and you start evaluating cash versus benefit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for HBO\u0026#8230; On one hand, people are accustomed to the $15 price point. But the dirty little secret is that most people don\u0026#8217;t pay that $15, or don\u0026#8217;t think they do. The HBO fee is baked into your cable plan, which is a negotiation worse than buying a car. I got so frustrated I told my provider to cancel everything but the internet, and just before the clerk did this, she told me for $9.99 more, I could get essentially all the channels I was getting, including HBO\u0026#8230;believe me, I don\u0026#8217;t think HBO is costing me $15.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich is why Disney is so brilliantly starting with a low price for its streaming service.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd what Netflix kept doing was adding loads of product while raising the price.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the truth is most of this product sucks. And it\u0026#8217;s an experiment, if it doesn\u0026#8217;t immediately generate an audience, Netflix kills it. That\u0026#8217;s right the Northern Californians are so into algorithms and spreadsheets that they miss the essence\u0026#8230; One or two great shows make up for a slew of crappy ones. Kinda like the CD business!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I can\u0026#8217;t say there\u0026#8217;s been a killer show on Netflix this year. No water cooler moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd one thing we\u0026#8217;re looking for from Netflix is something DIFFERENT! Not only from network, but HBO too. Come on, HBO never would have aired \u0026#8220;Babylon Berlin,\u0026#8221; no way, not enough people would watch it. But if you struggled through the first few episodes on Netflix, you got hooked, I haven\u0026#8217;t stopped talking about the show and I saw it YEARS AGO!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it\u0026#8217;s not like history is unwritten. \u0026#8220;Sex and the City\u0026#8221; ended and HBO suffered, they needed more hits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scan the sites all the time, looking for what to watch. And when I rarely find new Netflix shows, it frustrates me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd screw the algorithm, showing me what I should be interested in, I have no idea what\u0026#8217;s actually on Netflix, I read about a movie being available on the service, but it never pops up on my screen. Where\u0026#8217;s the website where I can scan all the content? Hell, it looks to me like they don\u0026#8217;t have that much, even though they keep telling everybody they do!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026#8217;s too much television for mediocre to survive. Not only are there so many other options on TV, there are non-series/movie distractions only a click away, like YouTube, Instagram, Snapchat\u0026#8230;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn other words, Netflix has lost touch with its customers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust like the publishing business. Who in hell is gonna buy the digital version if the hardcover is cheaper, or only a dollar or two more? It\u0026#8217;s a bad value proposition. Kids are down with virtual purchases, as they do in video games, but the oldsters still need to be convinced. Most people who are anti-digital readers never even read that way! But when all books were $9.99 or less\u0026#8230; If you bought something and it sucked, no big deal. But when it\u0026#8217;s $15?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYup, the book business is just like Netflix. Not aware their business depends on customers. Amazon was growing their business, adding customers and sales. I used to buy a physical book a year, maybe two or three. It just didn\u0026#8217;t make sense, $25? But with digital, I buy a book every other week if not more often. But I must admit, I think twice about my purchases at these inflated prices, and I\u0026#8217;m pissed they\u0026#8217;re so high when there\u0026#8217;s no printing and shipping\u0026#8230;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou want your customers to LOVE you, otherwise you\u0026#8217;re the record business. Devastated at the advent of this century. Customers had been ripped-off for so long, they didn\u0026#8217;t feel bad about stealing, And what did the execs say? Nothing could replace CDs, they were perfect! But the customers didn\u0026#8217;t feel this way, and they wanted instant accessibility and portability, qualities that are the essence of digital.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd streaming saved the music business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut sales don\u0026#8217;t equal the pre-internet heyday, so the streaming services are\u0026#8230;waiting to raise prices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet\u0026#8217;s not talk about what something is intrinsically worth\u0026#8230; It\u0026#8217;s only worth what a buyer is willing to pay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd one thing\u0026#8217;s for sure, I\u0026#8217;m not paying for every streaming video service, no way. I\u0026#8217;m gonna end up paying as much as cable and getting less! I\u0026#8217;m trying to hold off on Hulu. I don\u0026#8217;t have the time, and I feel it\u0026#8217;s an insult.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut, I did pay for Mhz Choice to watch a foreign series, I thought twice, but it was only $7.99 and opened up a world of proven quality television that otherwise I wouldn\u0026#8217;t have access to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow is the time for Netflix to ensure that it trumps the competition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the news is negative. It\u0026#8217;s losing \u0026#8220;The Office,\u0026#8221; \u0026#8220;Friends.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0026#8217;t watch either, but there\u0026#8217;s such blowback that my fealty to Netflix is wavering, I want to be a member of a winning cult. And I know Netflix is countering with all the product it still has, and the press is talking about viewer numbers, but entertainment is not facts, it\u0026#8217;s about hearts and minds!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Netflix is losing them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"pf-content\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e~~~\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVisit the archive:

Talk about luxury weddings, and that number skyrockets into six and seven figures. Music and entertainment are growing chunks of that budget, as couples view the experience for their guests as higher priority than static decor and pour more cash into line items like music, food, and drink. Nearly 20% hire a band, according to \u003ca href=\"https://partners.theknotpro.com/wedding-business-blog/the-knot-2018-real-weddings-study-just-hit-the-wire\"\u003eThe Knot 2018 Real Weddings Study\u003c/a\u003e, and when it comes to a band versus a DJ, couples certainly pay up for live musicians: more than three times as much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the \u003ca href=\"https://www.jordankahnmusiccompany.com/\"\u003eJordan Kahn Orchestra\u003c/a\u003e takes the stage, you can easily see why they charge tens of thousands of dollars for their ensemble. An event can command anywhere from 11 to 20 musicians, including Kahn as lead singer and emcee, along with drummers, guitars, strings, brass, backup singers, soloists, and even dancers. Out of sight are wires, gear, and cables. An engineer manages the room by walking around with an iPad to check sound levels in various corners, and the speakers are controlled wirelessly. The orchestra has a repertoire of more than 500 songs, including foreign language ballads that require the group to learn, say, Spanish or Hebrew.

While mainstream artists like Lady Gaga can follow a set list for a concert, Kahn is constantly trying to understand what the crowd at a wedding wants. It’s an ongoing search for feedback and decision-making as to what to play next. If, for instance, he sees too many guests sitting, he’ll queue up the group to play Etta James’s “At Last.” “I use that song as a tool to fill the dance floor if there are a lot of people in their fifties, sixties, and seventies,” he says. From there, it’s on to Bruno Mars’s “Uptown Funk,” a song that, he notes, has an unique appeal for all ages. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“A lot of musicians and bands make the performances about themselves,” Kahn says. “The terrible bands are the ones who pick songs for themselves or think the quality of their show is how many lights they have. We make our performances about our client and their audience.” The orchestra is so committed that he may play three or four hours without a break. By comparison, your typical cover band will demand a 15-minute break every 45 minutes. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe term “wedding band” is not so appealing to couples, especially younger ones who may lean toward a DJ while their parents ask for a live band. Rago explains that most people say they don’t want a “wedding band,” which is where she steps in to educate them. “These bands are performing at a high level,” she says. “They are seasoned. It’s that live-music experience that everyone loves. The energy is electric.” Sometimes, Rago adds, it’s just about taking them to a showcase to meet the bandleader.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition to reading the crowd, Kahn’s band also interacts with guests. Brass players will wander through the room, and he makes sure the choreography of his dancers is easy to emulate.

He owns four other bands, which range in price point to cater to a wide demographic of wedding budgets.

I think it was the uniqueness of high-end and aged Rieslings that explained the high prices.” Wiest agrees: “One of the issues today with these great dry wines is that we’re killing them by drinking them too young. They need 10 or 15 years to show what really lies inside the bottle.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eToday, Wegeler is one of a handful that are working to show how important aging is. Even its entry levels receive at least two years of aging, and in 2000, the winery began setting aside some of its wines even longer—releasing them for sale only after 10 years or more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAppreciation for high-end German wines lasted until World War II. “Who wanted to enjoy wine from a country [that] had proven to be the leper of the world community for the 20th century?” Dreisinger says. “Instead of waiting for the world’s wine lovers to come back to German wines, the wine industry tried to get back into the market with aggressive pricing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/German-Wine-Weingut-Wegeler-Bottles.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"German-Wine-Weingut-Wegeler-Bottles\" class=\"wp-image-2671216\" srcset=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/German-Wine-Weingut-Wegeler-Bottles.jpg 2880w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/German-Wine-Weingut-Wegeler-Bottles.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/German-Wine-Weingut-Wegeler-Bottles.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/German-Wine-Weingut-Wegeler-Bottles.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/German-Wine-Weingut-Wegeler-Bottles.jpg?resize=1024,683 1024w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/German-Wine-Weingut-Wegeler-Bottles.jpg?resize=281,187 281w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/German-Wine-Weingut-Wegeler-Bottles.jpg?resize=755,503 755w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/German-Wine-Weingut-Wegeler-Bottles.jpg?resize=100,67 100w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/German-Wine-Weingut-Wegeler-Bottles.jpg?resize=60,40 60w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/German-Wine-Weingut-Wegeler-Bottles.jpg?resize=154,103 154w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/German-Wine-Weingut-Wegeler-Bottles.jpg?resize=591,394 591w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/German-Wine-Weingut-Wegeler-Bottles.jpg?resize=392,261 392w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/German-Wine-Weingut-Wegeler-Bottles.jpg?resize=252,168 252w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/German-Wine-Weingut-Wegeler-Bottles.jpg?resize=697,465 697w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/German-Wine-Weingut-Wegeler-Bottles.jpg?resize=234,156 234w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/German-Wine-Weingut-Wegeler-Bottles.jpg?resize=500,333 500w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/German-Wine-Weingut-Wegeler-Bottles.jpg?resize=578,385 578w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/German-Wine-Weingut-Wegeler-Bottles.jpg?resize=600,400 600w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/German-Wine-Weingut-Wegeler-Bottles.jpg?resize=90,60 90w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/German-Wine-Weingut-Wegeler-Bottles.jpg?resize=185,123 185w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/German-Wine-Weingut-Wegeler-Bottles.jpg?resize=115,77 115w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/German-Wine-Weingut-Wegeler-Bottles.jpg?resize=738,492 738w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/German-Wine-Weingut-Wegeler-Bottles.jpg?resize=777,518 777w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2880px) 100vw, 2880px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eWeingut Wegeler bottles.

Growers planted new grape varieties like Muller-Thurgau because they produced more grapes per acre, and even Riesling, though still highly esteemed, was farmed for yield rather than quality. Many of Germany’s best vineyards lie on steep, rocky, south-facing slopes, typically overlooking a river. The better sun exposure and well-draining soils produce concentrated grapes. But flat vineyards are easier and cheaper to farm, so plantings moved away from the river valleys and onto gentler terrain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAreas where this wasn’t possible suffered the most. The Saar River is a tributary to the more famous Mosel. “The area is small and the wine-growing villages are few, but they certainly learned how to make a name for themselves,” wrote Karl Heinrich Koch in a 1897 book about Mosel wines. “Saar wines are generally credited with displaying the nobility of the Riesling aroma in an even more pronounced way than those of the Mosel Valley.” Nonetheless, many of the area’s top vineyards disappeared in the middle of the 20th century. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eToday, Van Volxem is the second-largest producer in the region. Like Wegeler, it concentrates on dry wines and has begun to age its wines longer before releasing them. Roman Niewodniczanski purchased the property in 2000 and has added many vineyards to his holdings since then.  “By 2000 to 2005, no one wanted land in the Saar,” Niewodniczanski says. He’s been buying vineyards in the Saar since the turn of the millennium, often referring to antique maps or church records to track down sites that were once highly regarded. An 1868 map of the Mosel and Saar notes the top sites, designated by color for tax purposes. Niewodniczanski used it to track down lost vineyards like Geisberg. When he rediscovered it, there were no vines left—just trees and shrubs. Van Volxem and another winery, Markus Molitor, have redeveloped the site, and the wines are reclaiming their former glory. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/German-Wine-Van-Volxem-Vineyard-Roman.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2671219\" srcset=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/German-Wine-Van-Volxem-Vineyard-Roman.jpg 2880w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/German-Wine-Van-Volxem-Vineyard-Roman.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/German-Wine-Van-Volxem-Vineyard-Roman.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/German-Wine-Van-Volxem-Vineyard-Roman.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/German-Wine-Van-Volxem-Vineyard-Roman.jpg?resize=1024,683 1024w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/German-Wine-Van-Volxem-Vineyard-Roman.jpg?resize=281,187 281w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/German-Wine-Van-Volxem-Vineyard-Roman.jpg?resize=755,503 755w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/German-Wine-Van-Volxem-Vineyard-Roman.jpg?resize=100,67 100w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/German-Wine-Van-Volxem-Vineyard-Roman.jpg?resize=60,40 60w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/German-Wine-Van-Volxem-Vineyard-Roman.jpg?resize=154,103 154w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/German-Wine-Van-Volxem-Vineyard-Roman.jpg?resize=591,394 591w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/German-Wine-Van-Volxem-Vineyard-Roman.jpg?resize=392,261 392w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/German-Wine-Van-Volxem-Vineyard-Roman.jpg?resize=252,168 252w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/German-Wine-Van-Volxem-Vineyard-Roman.jpg?resize=697,465 697w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/German-Wine-Van-Volxem-Vineyard-Roman.jpg?resize=234,156 234w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/German-Wine-Van-Volxem-Vineyard-Roman.jpg?resize=500,333 500w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/German-Wine-Van-Volxem-Vineyard-Roman.jpg?resize=578,385 578w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/German-Wine-Van-Volxem-Vineyard-Roman.jpg?resize=600,400 600w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/German-Wine-Van-Volxem-Vineyard-Roman.jpg?resize=90,60 90w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/German-Wine-Van-Volxem-Vineyard-Roman.jpg?resize=185,123 185w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/German-Wine-Van-Volxem-Vineyard-Roman.jpg?resize=115,77 115w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/German-Wine-Van-Volxem-Vineyard-Roman.jpg?resize=738,492 738w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/German-Wine-Van-Volxem-Vineyard-Roman.jpg?resize=777,518 777w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2880px) 100vw, 2880px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eRoman Niewodniczanski  photographed in Van Volxem’s vineyards.

For one thing, a little sweetness can mask a lot of flaws in a wine. German dessert wines have been highly treasured for centuries, but lightly sweet wines were actually a rarity before the 1950s and 1960s. Prior to the development of microfiltration in 1927, a lightly sweet wine was at risk of refermenting in the bottle. The dessert wines are stable because the yeast has entirely gorged itself and can’t eat anything more. In “feinherb” wines—as the off-dry style was called—concentrated, high-acid wines could achieve a stable balance, which with well-applied sulfur could suppress the yeasts. But it was risky enough that few attempted it. Once microfiltration became common, yeast could be removed entirely and the danger of refermentation was gone, and off-dry wines became the standard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the 1980s, several trade groups began trying to reestablish the reputation of German wine, often focusing on dry wines. “As German dry wines did not have an image at all, it was easier to build it up from that side,” Dreisinger says. “We experienced that when we released Geheimrat ‘J’, a dry, high-end Riesling starting with the 1983 vintage. It was immediately adopted by important, fine-dining restaurants.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/German-Wine-Van-Volxem-Fermenting.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"German-Wine-Van-Volxem-Fermenting\" class=\"wp-image-2671220\" srcset=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/German-Wine-Van-Volxem-Fermenting.jpg 2880w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/German-Wine-Van-Volxem-Fermenting.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/German-Wine-Van-Volxem-Fermenting.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/German-Wine-Van-Volxem-Fermenting.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/German-Wine-Van-Volxem-Fermenting.jpg?resize=1024,683 1024w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/German-Wine-Van-Volxem-Fermenting.jpg?resize=281,187 281w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/German-Wine-Van-Volxem-Fermenting.jpg?resize=755,503 755w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/German-Wine-Van-Volxem-Fermenting.jpg?resize=100,67 100w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/German-Wine-Van-Volxem-Fermenting.jpg?resize=60,40 60w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/German-Wine-Van-Volxem-Fermenting.jpg?resize=154,103 154w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/German-Wine-Van-Volxem-Fermenting.jpg?resize=591,394 591w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/German-Wine-Van-Volxem-Fermenting.jpg?resize=392,261 392w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/German-Wine-Van-Volxem-Fermenting.jpg?resize=252,168 252w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/German-Wine-Van-Volxem-Fermenting.jpg?resize=697,465 697w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/German-Wine-Van-Volxem-Fermenting.jpg?resize=234,156 234w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/German-Wine-Van-Volxem-Fermenting.jpg?resize=500,333 500w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/German-Wine-Van-Volxem-Fermenting.jpg?resize=578,385 578w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/German-Wine-Van-Volxem-Fermenting.jpg?resize=600,400 600w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/German-Wine-Van-Volxem-Fermenting.jpg?resize=90,60 90w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/German-Wine-Van-Volxem-Fermenting.jpg?resize=185,123 185w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/German-Wine-Van-Volxem-Fermenting.jpg?resize=115,77 115w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/German-Wine-Van-Volxem-Fermenting.jpg?resize=738,492 738w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/German-Wine-Van-Volxem-Fermenting.jpg?resize=777,518 777w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2880px) 100vw, 2880px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eInside Van Volxem’s basement, where the wine is fermented.

The latter can age just as well as the dry wines. “I think the [off-dry] wines have the ability to age,” says Aaron McManus, sommelier at Oriole in Chicago, where the German Riesling selections reach all the way back to 1989. “They transform and often take on a honeysuckle, bruised-apple quality that people really, really like even if they say they don’t like sweet wines. I’ve been having that conversation a lot with guests over the past six or seven years.” In addition, the perception of sweetness fades. “Integration is the best way to describe it,” McManus says. “It becomes a more complete wine. Instead of bright and acidic and super-sweet, it softens,” becoming more of a textural element than a flavor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe best news for wine drinkers is that while Germany’s wines are back on point, their prices remain relatively reasonable. “Germany provides an outrageously good value for the quality of wine on offer,” McManus says. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSweet, off-dry, or dry: Whichever it is, get them now because people are catching on. In June, the wine auction house Acker auctioned off more than 200 lots from Rudi Wiest’s private cellar, with wines dating back to the 1970s. The auction set new world records for 73 different German wines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eMore must-read stories from \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—Germany might be producing the \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/longform/germany-pinot-noir\"\u003ebest Pinot Noirs\u003c/a\u003e available today\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—How \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/07/20/craft-mezcal-national-tequila-day/%E2%80%8E(opens%20in%20a%20new%20tab)\"\u003emezcal\u0026#8217;s boom\u003c/a\u003e is helping lift its makers out of extreme poverty\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—This distillery is releasing its \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/07/20/port-ellen-scotch-whisky\"\u003eoldest whisky yet\u003c/a\u003e–36 years after closing\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—\u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/longform/best-irish-whiskey\"\u003e5 Irish whiskey brands you need to try now\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—How this 24-year-old entrepreneur is \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/longform/best-biergartens-new-york-street-art/\"\u003eupdating the biergarten experience\u0026nbsp;\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://flipboard.com/@fortune\"\u003eFollow \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e on Flipboard\u003c/a\u003e to stay up-to-date on the latest news and analysis.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://fortune.com/2019/07/21/german-dry-wine-producers/","published":"2019-07-21T11:00:29Z","guid":"https://fortune.com/?p=2667780"},{"title":"Your Smart TV Is Getting Too Smart for Your Own Good","content":"\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTo the delight\u003c/strong\u003e of binge-watchers everywhere, it’s no longer prohibitively expensive to purchase a giant television.

In 2009, they introduced the Prosecco DOC and named the Glera the official grape of Prosecco. Regulations were put in place to ensure anything labeled Prosecco DOC would be fresh, fruity, and easy to drink as well as hail from a specific region in northwestern Italy. They have been successfully fending off counterfeiters to grow the category. They have also worked to educate consumers about what Prosecco is, compared with other bubbles from the country such as Franciacorta, and how it’s different from something like Champagne. It’s been beneficial—Prosecco reached an estimated 2.4 billion euros (roughly $2.7 billion) in net sales, with more than 20% coming from North America and the U.S, according to a 2018 report by the consortium.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eCeola explains that he and other producers have watched the rosé explosion in the past few years and realized they needed to revisit a conversation from 2009 about an official rosé designation. Rosé, both still and sparkling, is major in terms of sales, especially in the U.S. According to Nielsen, the rosé wine category overall has been growing at more than 40% per year, and sparkling rosé banked $139 million in sales in 2017. While Mionetto does make an extra-dry rosé for its Prestige collection, the winemaker doesn’t include the term Prosecco on the bottle, and it doesn’t include Glera. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Glera-Grapes.jpeg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2667874\" srcset=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Glera-Grapes.jpeg 1200w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Glera-Grapes.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Glera-Grapes.jpeg?resize=300,201 300w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Glera-Grapes.jpeg?resize=768,514 768w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Glera-Grapes.jpeg?resize=1024,685 1024w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Glera-Grapes.jpeg?resize=281,188 281w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Glera-Grapes.jpeg?resize=752,503 752w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Glera-Grapes.jpeg?resize=100,67 100w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Glera-Grapes.jpeg?resize=60,40 60w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Glera-Grapes.jpeg?resize=154,103 154w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Glera-Grapes.jpeg?resize=589,394 589w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Glera-Grapes.jpeg?resize=392,262 392w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Glera-Grapes.jpeg?resize=252,168 252w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Glera-Grapes.jpeg?resize=695,465 695w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Glera-Grapes.jpeg?resize=234,156 234w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Glera-Grapes.jpeg?resize=498,333 498w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Glera-Grapes.jpeg?resize=575,385 575w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Glera-Grapes.jpeg?resize=600,402 600w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Glera-Grapes.jpeg?resize=90,60 90w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Glera-Grapes.jpeg?resize=184,123 184w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Glera-Grapes.jpeg?resize=115,77 115w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Glera-Grapes.jpeg?resize=735,492 735w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Glera-Grapes.jpeg?resize=774,518 774w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eHarvesting Glera grapes in the Valdobbiadene wine-growing region of Italy.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe addition of the Glera grape, he noted, would elevate the existing rosé Prosecco. Glera is highly prized in the area and including it in the rosé would keep it consistent in flavor with regular Prosecco. Plus, it would potentially allow producers to charge a premium for the bottle. The movement garnered some pushback from Prosecco purists, though, who were worried it might detract from the production of regular Prosecco, deplete Glera from the area, or include so many red grapes that it would overpower the flavors of Glera. “There were certainly doubts among a few producers,” Ceola says. “There was a big discussion which finally ended up as a mutual agreement: blending the first samples to decide on a possible new product.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe group landed on Pinot Noir, known as Pinot Nero in Italy, as the red grape that would give an official rosé Prosecco its pink color. It’s the grape typically used in other areas, like Champagne, to make a white sparkling wine turn rosé. As Glera is a white grape, the addition of even a small percentage of Pinot Nero will enable the wine to take on rosé characteristics, including the iconic hue. “The Pinot Nero offers vibrant color without changing the aromas and sensations that are elicited by Glera,” says Ceola of Mionetto’s own experimentation with sparkling wines made from the two grape varieties. “It only enhances the blend.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Harvest.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2667875\" srcset=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Harvest.jpg 1600w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Harvest.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Harvest.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Harvest.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Harvest.jpg?resize=1024,768 1024w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Harvest.jpg?resize=281,212 281w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Harvest.jpg?resize=671,503 671w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Harvest.jpg?resize=100,75 100w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Harvest.jpg?resize=60,45 60w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Harvest.jpg?resize=154,116 154w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Harvest.jpg?resize=1440,1080 1440w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Harvest.jpg?resize=525,394 525w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Harvest.jpg?resize=392,294 392w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Harvest.jpg?resize=224,168 224w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Harvest.jpg?resize=620,465 620w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Harvest.jpg?resize=208,156 208w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Harvest.jpg?resize=444,333 444w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Harvest.jpg?resize=513,385 513w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Harvest.jpg?resize=600,450 600w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Harvest.jpg?resize=90,68 90w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Harvest.jpg?resize=80,60 80w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Harvest.jpg?resize=164,123 164w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Harvest.jpg?resize=115,86 115w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Harvest.jpg?resize=656,492 656w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Harvest.jpg?resize=691,518 691w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Harvest.jpg?resize=1376,1032 1376w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Harvest.jpg?resize=1044,783 1044w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Harvest.jpg?resize=632,474 632w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Harvest.jpg?resize=536,402 536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eHarvesting Pinot Nero grapes in the Valdobbiadene wine-growing region of Italy.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe consortium then took on the challenge of assessing what exactly should make up a rosé Prosecco DOC wine. Of utmost importance was protecting the value of Prosecco; rosé should enhance the region rather than detract. To do that, the consortium posed restrictions in six major areas. First off, there must be a minimum of 10% Pinot Nero but a maximum of 15%, and the yields of Pinot Nero from the vineyards should remain low, at a maximum of 13.5 kilograms per hectare. The rosé should undergo a longer second fermentation than Prosecco—at least 60 days—and also clock in with lower residual sugar. Finally, it must be a vintage wine released after Jan. 1 of the following year, which is a departure from regular Prosecco, which can be, and often is, nonvintage. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe consortium passed these regulations along to the Ministry of Agriculture, where the final determination takes place. Zanette says there is no guarantee when, or even if, the designation will be approved. It is, after all, up to government bodies. “The Prosecco DOC is the largest Italian appellation in terms of volume and value,” he says, noting that while changes are not necessarily difficult, they aren’t taken lightly. “Nowadays the markets are positively trending, and the appellation has grown while keeping the standard quality. All decisions are taken with the goal of adding to that value, image, and quality.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Valdobbiadene-3.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Valdobbiadene, a wine growing area in the province of Treviso, Veneto, Italy.\" class=\"wp-image-2667877\" srcset=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Valdobbiadene-3.jpg 4256w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Valdobbiadene-3.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Valdobbiadene-3.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Valdobbiadene-3.jpg?resize=768,511 768w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Valdobbiadene-3.jpg?resize=1024,681 1024w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Valdobbiadene-3.jpg?resize=281,187 281w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Valdobbiadene-3.jpg?resize=756,503 756w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Valdobbiadene-3.jpg?resize=100,67 100w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Valdobbiadene-3.jpg?resize=60,40 60w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Valdobbiadene-3.jpg?resize=154,102 154w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Valdobbiadene-3.jpg?resize=592,394 592w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Valdobbiadene-3.jpg?resize=392,261 392w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Valdobbiadene-3.jpg?resize=252,168 252w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Valdobbiadene-3.jpg?resize=697,465 697w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Valdobbiadene-3.jpg?resize=234,156 234w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Valdobbiadene-3.jpg?resize=500,333 500w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Valdobbiadene-3.jpg?resize=578,385 578w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Valdobbiadene-3.jpg?resize=600,399 600w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Valdobbiadene-3.jpg?resize=90,60 90w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Valdobbiadene-3.jpg?resize=185,123 185w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Valdobbiadene-3.jpg?resize=115,77 115w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Valdobbiadene-3.jpg?resize=739,492 739w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Valdobbiadene-3.jpg?resize=778,518 778w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 4256px) 100vw, 4256px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eValdobbiadene, a wine-growing area in the region of Veneto, Italy. \u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the approval date is unknown, brands like Mionetto remain optimistic.

They’re hidden, washed out by the synergy and loudness of a city whose residents beg to keep up with the times. The Chess Forum is one of the last bastions of a society that was content in reveling in a simple concept: This is just a place to play chess. That temperament is evident today in the store’s decor, atmosphere, and incessant roster of personalities that walk in nightly: the Columbia professor who writes detective novels on the side, the anonymous Italian gentleman with a tattoo of a chess piece on his arm, and even the likes of musician Sting, whose manager, Khachan reports, has called the shop the singer’s “favorite in the world.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut the store’s personality and heart find its rhythm in Khachan himself, a 54-year-old who fled Lebanon in 1982 to attend Damascus University and then landed a scholarship at New York University in 1987 to pursue a graduate degree. (“Fast-forward 30 years, and [people] are now escaping to Lebanon from Syria,” the owner says. “Nobody knows how life turns around.”)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1989, following a lead from his professor, Khachan found employment at the Village Chess Shop, a famous Village destination at the time, while working his way through a Ph.D. program that he eventually had to abandon, given the demands of his business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eKhachan claims that his former employer promised him the store in five years’ time. About six years in, the Village Chess Shop’s owner scoffed at the suggestion of a handoff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eKhachan recalls the next portion of his life in the same vein he discusses just about any topic, showcasing a deep religious faith and belief in the good fortune afforded to those who strive to live nobly and peacefully among others. Around 1995, noticing a “For Rent” sign just a few stores away from his employer’s, Khachan walked in and was immediately enthralled by the L-shaped space that remains intact today. As for his financials, Khachan again mentions his luck: \u0026#8220;That same year, my father worked for the UN,\u0026#8221; he explains. \u0026#8220;They gave him a decent retirement plan.

The Chess Forum is a casting call for unforgettable New Yorkers, including the superior chess players that take up residence daily at nearby Washington Square Park, which Khachan avoids (“It’s too ferocious for me”) but of which he appreciates the value. “They are the soul of chess in the city,” he says. “These people sit in the sun all day to make $40, $50.

The owner’s financial scheme involves all sorts of chess-related products that range in price “from $10 to $10,000.” These include a three-person board, chess clocks, and a slew of themed pieces. So renowned is Khachan’s expertise that celebrities have reached out to him to locate hard-to-find sets. When Hugh Grant was filming \u003cem\u003eTwo Weeks Notice\u003c/em\u003e in the city in the early 2000s, an associate of his asked the shop owner about a chess set featuring sex positions to play a prank on costar Sandra Bullock. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNeedless to say, Khachan delivered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile clearly a fan of the arts and philosophy, Khachan is, however, familiar with and grateful for the power of the Internet—and always has been. Back in 1995, he brought a computer into the store. “It was unheard-of,” he says. “It was unbelievable, hundreds of people on line outside of the door” to play against the machine, which eventually broke and was never replaced. Calling the web a blessing for the game of chess (and his own livelihood: He also sells his products online), Khachan fondly recalls the 1997 event that pitted \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/longform/ai-artificial-intelligence-deep-machine-learning/\"\u003eDeep Blue\u003c/a\u003e—the IBM-developed, chess-playing computer—\u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2018/05/10/garry-kasparov-artificial-intelligence-deep-blue/\"\u003eagainst Garry Kasparov\u003c/a\u003e, the reigning world champion.

Solving the puzzle would give investors in\nthe know a huge advantage over the competition. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOver the past decade, one vibrant corner of that still ongoing research has been data analysis. The goal has been to tease out clues about sentiment that are hidden in news articles, regulatory filings, transcripts, and press releases. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWith the rise of artificial intelligence, the sophistication of sentiment-measuring technology is increasing. And a number of companies such as AlphaSense, Alexandria Technology, and Aiera are racing to perfect the software that makes it possible. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut they face a number of\nchallenges. The technology is still imperfect and still must prove that it can\noutperform more basic investment strategies like stock index funds.\u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“If you\ncan systematically and objectively track over time how the facts change, in\nterms of positive facts and negative facts that emerge in a conference call,\nsay, that could have real value,” says David Wong, an investment analyst with\nInstinet. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eLast month, AlphaSense, a startup that sells its service to hedge funds and financial analysts, introduced technology that sifts though documents to determine the tenor of their language. The so-called sentiment tool then provides an overall score for the tone that traders can then use to invest. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eLast week, AlphaSense announced that it had received an additional 50 million in funding, led by Soros Fund Management. Since its founding in 2011, AlphaSense has received over $90 million in financing. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOn a recent day at the company’s\nNew York headquarters, a large monitor on the conference room wall flashed\ngreen and red—indicating changing sentiment for various companies. After being\nfed transcripts, such as from corporate earnings calls, the software spits out\na score on a scale of plus 100 to negative 100. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo help investors quickly find\nthe text that is responsible for the sentiment score, AlphaSense’s service color\ncodes the transcripts or other text fed into it. Green or red coloring on a\nconference call transcript, for example, highlights encouraging and\ndiscouraging passages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOn this particular day, the\npublicly traded company with the most negative score was Sephaku Holdings, a\nSouth African maker of cement plants. It’s not a surprising conclusion\nconsidering that the company’s CEO said during an earnings call that his\ncustomers—construction companies— had “blood on the floor” due to recessionary\ntrends.\u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe company with the most\npositive sentiment was supply-chain services company \u003ca href=\"http://content.fortune.com/fortune500/synnex-212/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSynnex\u003c/a\u003e. Its latest\nearnings call was filled with upbeat language, such as “excellent,” “solid,”\nand “very pleased.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf it all seems a bit obvious,\nthat’s the intention. The automatic analysis is supposed to reach a similar\nconclusion that a human would make. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“If you listened to that\nearnings call, you would say our algorithm accurately reflects your own\nsentiment of the tone of that call,” says AlphaSense CEO Jack Kokko. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAlphaSense says the sentiment\nproduced by its technology mirrors what humans conclude 90% of the time. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eStill, Kokko encourages customers\nto use their own brains and not just follow what the algorithm says. He\ndescribes his technology as “augmented intelligence”—a help, not a replacement\nfor humans. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“This is a product for a human\nanalyst, to make their workflow more efficient,” says Kokko. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSentiment scores can also be used as the basis for a broader economic analysis. In a demonstration, Kokko showed a heat map on his laptop that highlights sentiment about sectors of the U.S. economy over time. In 2007, a year before the Great Recession hit, most business sectors of the U.S. economy in the heat map were flashing green. But a few, such as those representing the industrial sector, had turned pale red, warning of possible trouble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAlphaSense isn’t alone in\ntrying to crack the code. Alexandria Technology, in Los Angeles, has been\nworking on the problem for 12 years, for example. Dow Jones uses Alexandria’s\nsoftware for measuring sentiment in news reports while financial information\nservice FactSet makes it available to subscribers. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, another firm, called Aiera — a play on “A.I.”— uses A.I. to compare the tone in news that mentions a given company to its stock performance. Ultimately, the technology produces a score along with a buy, hold, or sell signal. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn past, with less sophisticated\ntechnology, computers assessed language for sentiment by counting the frequency\nof words in a text, such as “debt,” “layoffs,” “foreclosure.” Modern sentiment\nanalysis can make many more connections between such terms and more distant\nwords in the same paragraph, to understand the context. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eStill,\nthere will be limits to such tools. In the end, the technology may be just one\nof many that investors use to decide how to invest. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“Software like this can be another signal for quant traders and another resource for stock analysts,” says Pierre Ferragu, managing partner with stock research firm New Street Research, using industry jargon for math-driven investors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever,\nMr. Ferragu warns that while the software can speed up work for people in the\nfinancial industry, the public nature of the data it bases its opinions on,\nlike conference call transcripts, reduces the benefit. Over time, rival\ntechnologies that conduct the same kind of textual analysis may reach identical\nconclusions about individual stocks—limiting any trading edge the technology\nprovides.\u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThen, too, gauging sentiment is\ntricky because computers have trouble with irony and metaphors. Human thinking\ncan also be a mystery. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eStill, the biggest question about using such technology for investing is whether it accurately measures factors that lead to successful trading results. Whether sentiment in documents is a good indicator of future stock performance has yet to be proven, and some signals can be misleading if other factors aren\u0026#8217;t considered. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn June, memory chipmaker\n\u003ca href=\"http://content.fortune.com/fortune500/micron-technology-173/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMicron Technology\u003c/a\u003e held a conference call to reiterate yet another dreary\noutlook for the chip industry. After analyzing the conference call transcript,\nAlphaSense’s service came up with a score of negative 24, a big red flag that\nreflected a decline in sentiment from the prior quarter. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut the next day, Micron’s\nshares jumped 8%. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe dour earnings call had been\nthe tipping point that big investors had been waiting for. Bad sentiment is one\nthing, but really bad sentiment can often be a positive indicator of an\nimpending turnaround, as it has been for Micron for some time. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“Investing\nis about having an intuition about something the market is missing,” observes\nNew Street’s Ferragu.

Even with a stolen card, Jones says he\u0026#8217;s never had to—literally—pay the price for it. \u0026#8220;I’ve also been able to dispute charges pretty easily with a favorable outcome,” he said.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;Privacy is a obviously hot topic these days, but it\u0026#8217;s not enough for me personally to move away from my credit card setup,\u0026#8221; Jones added. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eZach Honig, editor at large of \u003ca href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/author/zach/\"\u003eThe Points Guy\u003c/a\u003e, a site that provides information about credit card rewards, agrees that the security benefits of Apple Card are modest. \u0026#8220;While limiting fraud does have the potential to simplify customers\u0026#8217; experience, the financial impact to an account holder is negligible,\u0026#8221; he said.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHonig also pointed out that Apple Card users give up a big perk that many other cards come with: Airline and hotel loyalty points. It\u0026#8217;s a trade off — in favor of cash back and a little extra security—that isn\u0026#8217;t necessarily as attractive, he said. \u0026#8220;Personally, I\u0026#8217;d prefer to earn valuable travel rewards,\u0026#8221; Honig concluded. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSome cards provide as much as 3 points—typically valued at 1 cent each — per dollar spent. That is triple what the Apple Card offers. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, customers of some cards can earn even more. For example, a Chase Sapphire Reserve card owner, for example, gets 3 cents in rewards for every dollar spent at any restaurant. When redeemed for travel, however Chase multiplies points by 1.5, making each dollar spent worth 4.5 cents for travel. This means those who\u0026#8217;ve earned $100 in rewards can buy $150 worth of a plane ticket or hotel stay.

Otherwise everybody would use an iPhone and a Mac, but Netflix is not a premium product, it can\u0026#8217;t win appealing to a sliver of the public, it needs all of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is how the publishing industry killed digital books.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite the hosannas of boomers boasting that they saved the physical book, it won\u0026#8217;t be long until they lose the war. You know change\u0026#8230;it looks like it\u0026#8217;s never going to happen, you laugh at the predictions, and then overnight, it takes hold. Can you say digital photography? Can you say internet connection?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople had been using digital cameras for years, but they were expensive. Just like people were communicating via bulletin boards utilizing low speed modems with arcane software. But non-traditional consumer camera companies, like Panasonic and Sony and Samsung, put out products while Nikon and other high-end manufacturers sat by, as well as the everyman\u0026#8217;s company Kodak, and then in a year, digital eclipsed film, just like that. Kinda like AOL turned everybody into an internet user, they made it easy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow we had a similar situation in the music business, with the iTunes Store. At first the labels considered it a joke, being Mac-only. But then when sales far exceeded expectations and distribution included Windows, suddenly this sideshow was throwing off revenue\u0026#8230; And what did the labels want to do? RAISE PRICES!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd who said they couldn\u0026#8217;t?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSTEVE JOBS!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe labels are greedy, short-term thinkers, why else would Universal have stored all those masters in an unprotected facility? The music business was always run on intimidation, but finally it came up against someone who wouldn\u0026#8217;t play that game, Apple kept prices low until consumers were hooked, then they jumped from 99 cents to $1.29.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e99 cents. Ever notice no car is advertised at a round number? How it\u0026#8217;s always something 99? Even gas! Our minds trick us into thinking $3.249 is equivalent to $3.24. But the truth is it\u0026#8217;s only a tenth of a cent from $3.25.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd going back to books, did you see that Pearson is going digital first on textbooks? Physical was killing them. They got no revenue on resale. And prices were so high, sales were less frequent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, they went to the subscription model. That\u0026#8217;s right, for less than print you get something that can be upgraded on a regular basis, like a streaming music service. Your subscription to Spotify, et al, is not a fixed picture, but a constantly rolling enterprise that adds new titles on a regular basis\u0026#8230;and as long as you keep paying ten bucks a month, you can hear them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTen bucks. Spotify is a public company under earnings pressure. It could immediately raise prices, but it would start hemorrhaging customers. If it\u0026#8217;s under ten bucks, it\u0026#8217;s a throwaway. Once it eclipses that number, you start to think about it. I mean there are months when we barely watch Netflix, but we don\u0026#8217;t cancel. But if you\u0026#8217;re counting your pennies, supporting a family, every little bit counts and you look for alternatives that are good enough, like Android and Windows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026#8217;s a huge market in good enough. Not everybody needs to buy Nike or 7 jeans or\u0026#8230; They\u0026#8217;ll settle for the knock-off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo Netflix is under Wall Street pressure, to pay for all that programming. So it keeps raising prices. Now you think they\u0026#8217;re going to keep going up FOREVER! You feel the company no longer cares for you, the bond is broken and you start evaluating cash versus benefit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for HBO\u0026#8230; On one hand, people are accustomed to the $15 price point. But the dirty little secret is that most people don\u0026#8217;t pay that $15, or don\u0026#8217;t think they do. The HBO fee is baked into your cable plan, which is a negotiation worse than buying a car. I got so frustrated I told my provider to cancel everything but the internet, and just before the clerk did this, she told me for $9.99 more, I could get essentially all the channels I was getting, including HBO\u0026#8230;believe me, I don\u0026#8217;t think HBO is costing me $15.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich is why Disney is so brilliantly starting with a low price for its streaming service.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd what Netflix kept doing was adding loads of product while raising the price.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the truth is most of this product sucks. And it\u0026#8217;s an experiment, if it doesn\u0026#8217;t immediately generate an audience, Netflix kills it. That\u0026#8217;s right the Northern Californians are so into algorithms and spreadsheets that they miss the essence\u0026#8230; One or two great shows make up for a slew of crappy ones. Kinda like the CD business!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I can\u0026#8217;t say there\u0026#8217;s been a killer show on Netflix this year. No water cooler moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd one thing we\u0026#8217;re looking for from Netflix is something DIFFERENT! Not only from network, but HBO too. Come on, HBO never would have aired \u0026#8220;Babylon Berlin,\u0026#8221; no way, not enough people would watch it. But if you struggled through the first few episodes on Netflix, you got hooked, I haven\u0026#8217;t stopped talking about the show and I saw it YEARS AGO!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it\u0026#8217;s not like history is unwritten. \u0026#8220;Sex and the City\u0026#8221; ended and HBO suffered, they needed more hits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scan the sites all the time, looking for what to watch. And when I rarely find new Netflix shows, it frustrates me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd screw the algorithm, showing me what I should be interested in, I have no idea what\u0026#8217;s actually on Netflix, I read about a movie being available on the service, but it never pops up on my screen. Where\u0026#8217;s the website where I can scan all the content? Hell, it looks to me like they don\u0026#8217;t have that much, even though they keep telling everybody they do!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026#8217;s too much television for mediocre to survive. Not only are there so many other options on TV, there are non-series/movie distractions only a click away, like YouTube, Instagram, Snapchat\u0026#8230;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn other words, Netflix has lost touch with its customers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust like the publishing business. Who in hell is gonna buy the digital version if the hardcover is cheaper, or only a dollar or two more? It\u0026#8217;s a bad value proposition. Kids are down with virtual purchases, as they do in video games, but the oldsters still need to be convinced. Most people who are anti-digital readers never even read that way! But when all books were $9.99 or less\u0026#8230; If you bought something and it sucked, no big deal. But when it\u0026#8217;s $15?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYup, the book business is just like Netflix. Not aware their business depends on customers. Amazon was growing their business, adding customers and sales. I used to buy a physical book a year, maybe two or three. It just didn\u0026#8217;t make sense, $25? But with digital, I buy a book every other week if not more often. But I must admit, I think twice about my purchases at these inflated prices, and I\u0026#8217;m pissed they\u0026#8217;re so high when there\u0026#8217;s no printing and shipping\u0026#8230;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou want your customers to LOVE you, otherwise you\u0026#8217;re the record business. Devastated at the advent of this century. Customers had been ripped-off for so long, they didn\u0026#8217;t feel bad about stealing, And what did the execs say? Nothing could replace CDs, they were perfect! But the customers didn\u0026#8217;t feel this way, and they wanted instant accessibility and portability, qualities that are the essence of digital.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd streaming saved the music business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut sales don\u0026#8217;t equal the pre-internet heyday, so the streaming services are\u0026#8230;waiting to raise prices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet\u0026#8217;s not talk about what something is intrinsically worth\u0026#8230; It\u0026#8217;s only worth what a buyer is willing to pay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd one thing\u0026#8217;s for sure, I\u0026#8217;m not paying for every streaming video service, no way.

In the drinks world, such recipes have stood the test of time and grown into industry icons over decades. But unlike similar cultural colossuses elsewhere—from \u003ca href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/01/a-whole-years-worth-of-works-just-fell-into-the-public-domain/\"\u003eMickey Mouse on screen\u003c/a\u003e or \"Hey Jude\" in the stereo—you can find the Negroni being deployed freely at virtually every bar in America.

According to data collected through 2017, the majority of straight couples now meet online or at bars and restaurants. As the co-authors write in their conclusion, “Internet dating has displaced friends and family [as] key intermediaries.” We used to rely on intimates to screen our future partners.

Our friends and moms were underserving us.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eHistorically, the “underserving” was most severe for single gay people. “In the past, even if mom was supportive of her gay kids, she probably didn’t know other gay people to introduce them to,” Rosenfeld said. The rapid adoption of online dating among the LGBT community speaks to a deeper truth about the Internet: It’s most powerful (for better and for worse) as a tool for helping minorities of all stripes—political, social, cultural, sexual—find one another. “Anybody looking for something hard to find is advantaged by the bigger choice set. That’s true whether you’re looking for a Jewish person in a mostly Christian area, or a gay person in a mostly straight area, or a vegan mountain climbing former-Catholic anywhere,” Rosenfeld said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e[ \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/05/what-is-pornography-doing-to-our-sex-lives/589576/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eDerek Thompson: What is pornography doing to our sex lives?\u003c/a\u003e ]\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eOnline dating’s rapid success got an assist from several other demographic trends.

She’d left behind her Church, her God, and her old city, Los Angeles. Then a secular congregation called Sunday Assembly filled the spiritual void—at least for a time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWalford had just turned 40. As a child, she had been deeply religious. Her parents had no interest in religion, and didn’t understand why she would; they’d sent her to a Christian school in hopes of good discipline and education. But Justina fell headlong into faith, delighting in her Church community and dreaming of one day becoming a pastor herself.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eBy the time she turned up in New York, her faith had long since unraveled, a casualty of overseas travel that made her question how any one religious community could have a monopoly on truth. But still she grieved the loss of God. “It was like breaking up with someone that you thought was your soulmate,” Walford told me. “\u003cem\u003eIt’s for the better. It’s for your own good\u003c/em\u003e,” she remembered thinking. Even though it no longer made sense to her to believe, she felt a gaping hole where her Church—her people, her psalms, her stained-glass windows—used to be.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThen Walford read an article about Sunday Assembly, a community started in Great Britain in 2013 that had spread quickly across the Atlantic to her doorstep. Members gather on Sundays, sing together, listen to speakers, and converse over coffee and donuts. Meetings are meant to be just like Church services—but without God. “That’s it,” she thought. “That’s what I want.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWhen Walford shed her faith, she joined a large and fast-growing group—the “nones,” or the religiously unaffiliated. According to \u003ca href=\"http://ava.prri.org/#religious/2018/States/religion/16\"\u003edata\u003c/a\u003e from the latest version of the Public Religion Research Institute’s annual “American Values Atlas,” 25 percent of Americans today are religiously unaffiliated, up from single digits in the 1990s. Among young people, that number is 39 percent. Those numbers describe not just a retreat from organized religion, but also an erosion of community. Many faith congregations have acted as social anchors in their areas, providing a place to see and be seen by the same friendly faces each week. As these and other traditional social supports hollow out, Americans are left “bowling alone,” as the political scientist Robert Putnam famously put it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eSecular congregations such as Sunday Assembly and Oasis—a similar group started in 2012—seek to offer a solution. Both were founded by faithless seekers hoping to carry on certain aspects of religious life: the community, the moral deliberation, and the rich sense of wonder. When they were growing so rapidly in their early years, these congregations were \u003ca href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/sunday-assembly-is-the-hot-new-atheist-church\"\u003eheavily\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/sunday-assembly-atheist_n_5915830\"\u003ecovered\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/09/oasis-secular-groups/499148/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eby media \u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/03/atheist-church-sunday-assembly-islington\"\u003eoutlets\u003c/a\u003e. “The Hot New Atheist Church,” gushed a 2013 \u003cem\u003eDaily Beast\u003c/em\u003e headline about Sunday Assembly. \u003cem\u003eHuffPost\u003c/em\u003e noted that the number of assemblies had doubled in a single weekend in 2014. The media coverage emphasized the new community’s high-energy services, its celebratory message, and the top-of-your-lungs group renditions of pop anthems such as “Livin’ on a Prayer.” For those uncomfortable with the level of overt spirituality even within relatively liberal denominations, such as Unitarian Universalism, secular communities offered a different option.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eBut even as the growth of “nones” has revved up in the intervening years, the growth of secular congregations hasn’t kept pace. After a promising start, attendance declined, and nearly half the chapters have fizzled out—including the New York one that Walford joined. Building a durable community of nonbelievers, it turns out, is more complicated than just excising God.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIf the sudden emergence of secular communities speaks to a desire for human connection and a deeper sense of meaning, their subsequent decline shows the difficulty of making people feel part of something bigger than themselves. One thing has become clear: The yearning for belonging is not enough, in itself, to create a sense of home.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"dropcap\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe New York Sunday Assembly was everything that Justina Walford had been hungering for since leaving her faith. Meetings involved “sermons” from scientists, artists, and academics; members sang pop songs together and snapped their fingers to poetry readings. Old-timers chatted by the snack table and invited newbies to meals outside the group. “I just fell in love with it,” Walford said. “I loved the singing … I loved the interaction. I loved once a month seeing the same people.” She became an organizer, one of the leaders of the chapter working long volunteer hours to put each service together. That lasted for a couple of years—and then things began to fall apart.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThere just weren’t enough people. Making a congregation happen basically meant putting on a big show on a regular basis. Somebody needed to book bands, find speakers, set up chairs, pick up snacks. Anne Klaeysen, who was also involved with the New York chapter at the time, told me the same thing. “The core group worked their hearts out, but it wasn’t sustainable.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIn New York and elsewhere, the basic mechanics of keeping a congregation running have proved difficult. To hire musicians and speakers, buy refreshments, and rent out a venue takes a lot of money. A traditional Church has tithings—but leaders of secular communities have found that attendees are highly suspicious of any plea for donations. Many lapsed believers harbor strong negative associations with the collection plate.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eBeneath the surface were other rifts. Even within the community of nonbelievers were different groups with different priorities: Some ardent atheists wanted to rail against religion, for example, or have heated debates. But at Sunday Assembly, the point wasn’t to put down faith or even to celebrate being faithless, per se—the point of being there was being there, together.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eStill, in a city like New York, people have plenty of other options on a Sunday morning. Boot camps. SoulCycle. Brunch. “You’re competing with hundreds of other events at the same time,” Walford said. Getting enough people to show up felt impossible. The chapter officially closed down in early 2016, three years after opening.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThese issues didn’t just affect the New York chapter. Sunday Assembly has reported a significant loss in total attendees over the past few years—from about 5,000 monthly attendees in 2016 to about 3,500 in 2018. The number of chapters is down from 70 three years ago to about 40 this year.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eSustaining any kind of new congregation—indeed, any new group activity at all—is hard work. But religious groups have more tradition, history, and institutional support behind them, and these factors can stand as a kind of safety net behind religious start-ups. “If Sunday Assembly was a Christian community that suddenly had brand recognition, a flock of pastors would come and bring all their skills and experience,” says Sanderson Jones, one of the founders of Sunday Assembly. “You could buy training videos, there’d be conferences you could go to—there are all these different preexisting structures.” But for secular congregations, there are no training videos. There are no “\u003ca href=\"https://www.christianitytoday.com/pastors/2013/december-online-only/my-top-10-church-planting-tips-from-2013.html\"\u003eChurch planting\u003c/a\u003e” experts to help them grow roots. They’re starting from scratch.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"dropcap\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003eEven more challenging than the logistical barriers are the psychological ones. Linda Woodhead, a scholar of religion and culture at Lancaster University in Great Britain, told me that structured communities just aren’t easy to form. “Meeting in a building with the same group of people every week … I don’t think there’s any natural need for that,” she said.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWoodhead believes that communities can be hugely important to people, of course—but you can’t just meet for the sake of community itself. You need a very powerful motivating element to keep people coming, something that attendees have in common.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eSome congregations have that. That Salt Lake City is home to one of the most successful Oasis chapters may not be a coincidence. The chapter has become an important hub for ex-Mormons; these members are bound by the shared experience of leaving the denomination they grew up in and feeling isolated in a hometown over which the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints looms large.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eFor many nones, however, their lack of religion is not a strong part of their identity. Alan Cooperman, the director of religion research at Pew Research Center, says that about one-third of nones fall into the category of “principled rejecters” of organized religion or “principled embracers” of atheism or humanism. But the majority of nones are just indifferent to religion. “On what basis would you pull them together?” Cooperman asked. “Being uninterested in something is about the least effective social glue, the dullest possible mobilizing cry, the weakest affinity principle, that one can imagine.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eRobert P. Jones, the CEO and founder of PRRI, told me that 93 percent of unaffiliated Americans say they’re not searching for a religion that would be right for them. “One appeal of a secular congregation is to be an alternative but familiar way to fill social and spiritual needs that have historically been filled by Churches and other religious congregations,” he said. “But the overwhelming number of people who were raised religious but now have left report being pretty content.” To hear all these experts talk, the surprise is less that Sunday Assembly and Oasis have shrunk than that they grew so quickly in the first place.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eAra Norenzayan, a psychologist studying religion at the University of British Columbia, told me that secular communities might have trouble getting members to inconvenience themselves, as people of faith routinely do for their congregations. He cited a study by Richard Sosis, an anthropologist at the University of Connecticut who studied 200 American communes founded in the 19th century. Sosis found that 39 percent of religious communes were still functioning 20 years after their start, but only 6 percent of secular communes were alive after the same amount of time. And he determined that a single variable was making this difference: the number of sacrifices—such as giving up alcohol, following a dress code, or fasting—that each commune demanded of its members.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eFor religious communes, the more sacrifices demanded, the longer they lasted; however, this connection didn’t hold for secular communes. The implication, Norenzayan said, was that challenging rituals and taxing rules work only when they’re part of something sacred; once the veil of sacrality is removed, people no longer care to commit to things that demand their time and dedication. “If it’s ‘Come and go as you wish,’ that’s not going to work,” he said. Even if secular congregations could create a sense of the sacred, they tend to attract people who are explicitly looking for a community without costly rituals—one that lets you do what you want.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWhen I talked with Richard Sosis himself, though, he added that costly sacrifice isn’t the only way that groups can inspire devoted membership. Religions can be understood as systems, which consist of core, interconnected features—like sacrifice and belief in the supernatural, but also like ritual or storytelling. Theses phenomena all probably evolved separately, and only together are understood as “religion.” You can remove an element, and the others may be strong enough to uphold the system. But as more of these core features disappear, he said, the system begins to suffer: “You can’t take out the lungs and wonder what’ll happen to the body.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eSosis’s point is that while costly sacrifice might not be present in these communities—and they may be suffering for that reason—they have other tools in their toolkit. They already have collective singing and live music, for example, which sets meetings apart from everyday experiences. And he believes they can and will adapt over time, evolving into something closer to conventional religion, even if no deities are involved. Secular congregations can become as meaningful as religious ones, he said, “but there has to be a sense of transcendence … Transcendence is what gives the community a higher level of meaning than going to Johnny’s Little League game.” It might mean developing more rituals, or sharing more stories. It might mean that ideals they already espouse—such as helping others, or finding wonder in nature—get elevated to a sacred level. The irony is that to get away from religion, they may need to re-create it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"dropcap\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003eSecular-community organizers are trying their hardest every day to prove that Sosis is right—that their nonreligious congregations can provide the same fulfillment as religious ones. Some have spent time researching what makes a lasting religious community, hoping to reverse-engineer its machinery for secular use. Sunday Assembly’s Sanderson Jones, for example, has developed a framework of five core components in any congregation: “community life,” “transformational gatherings,” “personal growth,” “helping others,” and “changing the world.” This may sound like clumsy marketing-speak. It can feel awkward to watch a so-called atheist Church work out its evangelization strategy in real time. Then again, traditional religious groups have spent hundreds or thousands of years figuring out how to get people in the door. We just aren’t seeing the shaky early experiments happen in front of us.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eSome leaders of Sunday Assembly and Oasis told me they’re trying to make those weekly meetings so interesting, so entertaining, so powerful that people will keep showing up. “The quality of the content is what keeps people coming back,” Taylor Gibson, the executive director of Oasis, said in an interview. “There are speakers on so many different issues … these events give people a sense of purpose.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe secular organizers whom I interviewed are thinking carefully about how the social interaction they provide differs from the kinds of relationships that prospective members already have. Being part of a network can be comforting—and the right network can be hard to find. “We get a lot of people asking, how do you make friends as an adult, post-college? How do you meet people outside of your work or school environment?” Gibson said. “It lends [itself] to that—to helping establish connections that are outside your small scope of influence, with people you may not have met before.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eJustina Walford, for her part, has been without a community since the New York Sunday Assembly closed down. After a relocation to Dallas, she tried out a Southern Baptist Church near her home—and she loved it. She loved the services, the singing, the people. But the more enmeshed she became, the guiltier she felt about the secret she was carrying: She didn’t believe in God. So she stopped showing up. Sometimes she thinks about starting a Sunday Assembly chapter in Dallas, but the idea is daunting. She knows now how much work it is, and how much it hurts when things fall apart.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eFor those who stick with Sunday Assembly or Oasis, the challenge now is to make the community last beyond their own generation—and to find new congregants as the number of nonbelievers grows. Organizers hope that other adults will see how wonderful it is to be accepted and accepting, to sing Bon Jovi badly in an abandoned church building or hear a talk about quantum physics in a local Y with other like-minded and familiar people. And that, having had these experiences, they’ll keep showing up.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/9wh-7vpE8o0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/9wh-7vpE8o0/","published":"2019-07-21T10:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-594109"},{"title":"Elizabeth Warren Has Momentum.

They told her the history of bilingual education in the neighborhood around Walker Square Park, and how the blocks have changed over the years. “Talk to me about housing,” Warren said. “Where are the teachers drawn from?” The group walked past a sign for the oldest Latino-advocacy agency in the city, and a gentrification signpost: a store called Antiques Addict.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWarren was in Wisconsin to speak at a Latino political conference. She used the day to release her immigration plan, the latest in a stream of plans proposing how to revamp the system, in ways that go far beyond what Washington wisdom deems possible. The neighborhood walk felt as if Warren’s campaign was merely banking B-roll footage for future ads, while a bunch of reporters tripped over curbs and fire hydrants watching the candidate interact with locals. We ended in a parking lot, beneath a mural of a bald eagle facing a dove under a rainbow, with an olive branch in their beaks, a lightning bolt striking the section closest to the dove.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eTwo days later, in Philadelphia, I showed Warren a photo of the mural. We were sitting down before her speech to the liberal-activist Netroots Nation conference, where she has been a hero for years. I asked her to explain what she said she saw in Milwaukee: “Power, but also change.” She moved in close to my iPhone and pointed to the eagle. “Look at how much power there is. And yet, notice the dove is not afraid.The eagle is static; the dove is more dynamic,” she said. “The lightning bolt is not the most prominent, but it is the piece that says, ‘It all changes.’ And it changes fast and powerfully when the moment comes.”  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eI took out an oversize \u003cspan class=\"smallcaps\"\u003eI’m a Warren Democrat\u003c/span\u003e button that her campaign has been handing out at events and put it on the table.

There’s no Kamala Harris Democrat. No Cory Booker Democrat. No Pete Buttigieg Democrat, Jay Inslee Democrat, Beto O’Rourke Democrat, Amy Klobuchar Democrat. From the moment he entered the race, former Vice President Joe Biden has stressed, and does so every time he finds the slightest opening to squeeze it in, that he is “an Obama-Biden Democrat.” When I brought that last one up to Warren, she rolled her eyes twice and slightly tilted her head to catch up with them, a sort of silent \u003cem\u003eUh-huh\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eWhat else ya got?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/06/joe-biden-vs-kamala-harris-bussing-and-race-issues/592912/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eDavid A.

If put into place, they would make for the biggest active restructuring of the American economy in history. “It’s easier to get more people into the fight, and it’s easier to get more people to pay attention to how it would touch their lives. And that’s our path to winning. So this is the ‘Ask for big or ask for little.’ Ask for big!”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe crowds tell at least part of the story. Despite leading almost every poll, Biden has struggled with turnout: At one stop I was at last month, in Ottumwa, Iowa, the campaign had reserved a 664-seat theater and was excited when about 250 people showed up. Meanwhile, Warren drew more than 850 people on a recent Monday afternoon in Peterborough, New Hampshire, which was prime Bernie Sanders territory in 2016. Three days later, 1,500 people packed a Milwaukee high-school gym late into a Thursday night to see Warren, cheering and laughing along with her through a town hall. She walked out to “9 to 5.” She stood in front of an oversize American flag. She finished to “Respect.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThat night, Elizabeth Lindquist, a 51-year-old oncology pharmacist, poured her heart out to Warren on the photo line about a friend who wishes Warren would stop using the term \u003cem\u003especial needs\u003c/em\u003e.

By the time Warren took the stage in San Francisco, they had T-shirts and buttons with the phrase. “I’m a Warren Democrat” was the general theme of that speech, though it never appeared explicitly in the text. “We need to show what it means to be a Democrat,” was as close as she came.\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr class=\"c-section-divider\"\u003e\u003cp class=\"dropcap\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003eBarack Obama and Donald Trump have pretty much nothing in common—except that their presidential campaigns became movements.

There’s clear frustration among Sanders’s aides with Warren’s rise, but staff on multiple campaigns told me they’re not worried about her success.

So far, what she’s built is not based on a single moment, nor dunking on a rival. Warren is the first—and for now, the only—candidate to start preparing a new movement for 2020. Ever since the spring, when she started getting deeply personal, beyond the bits that had been boiled over in years of speeches and books, as she laid out her policy—introducing her universal child care proposal in the spring by telling how she almost broke down in tears and quit working was a watershed moment—thousands of people are connecting with her viscerally, committed in a way that goes beyond website donations or showing up at campaign stops. We’ve seen Elizabeth Warren on the ropes, I tell her. “Yup!” she says. “And you know what? She looks a lot like she looks like right now.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e“There’s something about her sharing her story that makes people open up,” Warren’s New Hampshire state director, Liz Wester, told me over cold-brew coffee in Manchester the morning before Warren’s stop in Peterborough.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIn New Hampshire, Warren’s campaign organizes “Big Structural Change” meet-ups of about 15 to 20 people once or twice a week. Popular topics include women’s issues, student loans, and climate change. Warren’s staff gets involved only to guide the conversation and encourage people who come to share their personal stories, focusing on how Warren’s plans would change their lives, or would have changed their lives years ago. At the Peterborough town hall, Warren was introduced by a woman who said she’d been at a roundtable earlier in the year and been called on to tell the senator her story of having two kids headed to college while still paying off her own student debt from 20 years ago. “Since then,” the woman said, “I’ve canvassed for her, I’ve marched in parades, and I tweet like crazy.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eMany Democratic strategists I’ve talked with say they’re sure that eventually voters will get real about how radical Warren’s politics are, and that the Cherokee-heritage questions will come flying back with Trump screaming “Pocahontas” whenever he’s taking a break from screaming “socialist.” Warren has been blunt about calling for Trump’s impeachment, and did not shy away from calling him a racist after his attacks on the four freshman congresswomen last week. When I asked her about the Democratic infighting that had preceded Trump’s comments, she said, “I love the inclusion of voices that have been left out for far too long.

People may want to burn down the building, but they want to see the blueprints for what comes next. “It’s the planning and the ability to explain it and get things across,” Ben Silver, a 29-year-old, told me after Warren’s town hall in Peterborough. “It’s about telling people exactly what I believe is broken and what we can do to fix it,” Warren explained to reporters a few minutes later. “The No. 1 thing I hear afterwards when people come through to do selfies is, ‘This gives me hope.’ Hope because it really is a path forward.

It’s not just that Sanders supporters are jumping over to Warren, though there’s a fair amount of that. “I thought I was done with Sanders before, and now I’m completely done,” Chris Rowland, a 54-year-old electrical engineer, told me in Milwaukee, saying he thought the senator from Vermont’s time had passed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eMarkos Moulitsas, the \u003cem\u003eKos\u003c/em\u003e in the \u003cem\u003eDaily Kos\u003c/em\u003e and the man behind Netroots Nation, has been watching Warren from when she first started coming to the conference as a professor trying to get elected to the Senate.

For the most part, Congress has accepted this. But as Trump administration officials talk ever tougher about Iran, many Capitol Hill Democrats, and some Republicans, fear the confrontation could spin out of control into a devastating conflict. And now they’re trying to claw back some of the power the president—whom they view as dangerous and reckless—has to declare war.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAdministration officials like Mike Pompeo have made the rounds to argue for the connection between Iran and al-Qaeda. The president declares he wants to negotiate with the Iranians  in one breath and threatens consequences the likes of which no one has ever seen in the next. This worries Democrats like Colorado Representative Jason Crow, a former Army Ranger who served in Iraq and Afghanistan. “I learned firsthand,” he said recently, “that when politicians talk tough in this town, real people get hurt.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe’s one of 87 cosponsors of a bipartisan amendment to the House defense budget that would prohibit Trump from launching a war with Iran without congressional authorization. Elissa Slotkin, a freshman Democratic House member from Michigan who served in Iraq with the CIA is another. When she heard Pompeo \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/19/us/politics/us-iran.html\"\u003etalking about\u003c/a\u003e al-Qaeda and Iran this summer, she said Saturday at the Aspen Security Forum, “my ears pricked up.” It sounded to her like Pompeo was trying to create space to go to war with Iran, and argue that the administration could legally do so under the 2001 law that authorized military force against al-Qaeda and its associated forces.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNo one who voted for that law after the September 11, 2001, attacks, would have envisioned its use against the Islamic Republic of Iran, she said. Her colleague Mac Thornberry, the ranking Republican on the House Armed Services Committee who voted for the authorization, said at the same event that he certainly didn’t envision all the battles the law is currently being used for—including the fight against ISIS and other counterterrorism missions all over the world.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/06/trump-military-congress-debate-how-read-intel-iran/591139/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: How to navigate the fog of war with Iran\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut this is also why it has proven so hard to change, despite seemingly bipartisan agreement that it needs an update. It’s the law that authorizes virtually all of America’s counterterrorism work overseas, and if it simply goes away without being revised, those missions are arguably illegal. But, Slotkin said, there are wide disagreements on what if anything should replace it. Some members don’t want to authorize anything. Some members want to build in restrictions other members find unacceptable. Some want to keep things exactly the same. “We’ve got 50,000 forces in the Persian Gulf right now,” Slotkin said. “If we took away the authorization of military force—every authorization—right now, what would we do? Would we pull them all back by the letter of the law? We’d have to examine that.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe debate isn’t just about an 18-year-old law: It involves much bigger questions about constitutional powers, and war and peace. These are questions members of Congress acknowledge, but have so far declined to really answer with a debate and a vote. Thornberry himself posed some of them. “When is it war that Congress has to approve? When is it self-defense?” Would Congress have to authorize U.S. military escorts for tankers through the Strait of Hormuz? What about shooting down another country’s drone? What about cyberattacks?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the meantime, Slotkin said, she and her cosponsors felt it necessary to at least lay down a marker that Congress wants to exercise oversight.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/05/iraq-militias-flash-point-between-united-states-and-iran/589003/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: The flash point between America and Iran could be Iraq’s militias\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut despite suspicions Pompeo is trying to build the case to use the 2001 authorization against Iran, it’s not clear the administration would even go that route. Pompeo and his Iran adviser Brian Hook have dodged questions about this in open congressional hearings, saying only that whatever action they took with Iran would be under their legal authorities. But Mark Esper, Trump’s nominee to be secretary of defense, said at his confirmation hearing that the 2001 authorization would not apply to Iran. Instead, he said, the president had the authority under Article II of the constitution as commander in chief. “I don’t think there’s a serious attempt to use [the 2001 authorization] for that purpose,” Thornberry said Saturday. “I don’t think anyone would support it.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe amendment Slotkin cosponsored would not prevent a strike on Iran in self-defense, which is the likeliest justification Trump would claim for a strike if he did order one.

It's harder to define your enemies. It's much harder to define what victory looks like. And we just stopped doing it.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMurphy noted that Obama was widely seen as weak for failing to strike Syria after President Bashar al-Assad used chemical weapons against civilians in 2013, stepping over a “red line” the president had set the year before. Instead, Obama went to Congress, which did not authorize such a strike, and Obama backed off. Murphy said he was right to do so. “Because you can't get authorization is not an excuse to violate the Constitution,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe 2001 authorization for the use of military force against al-Qaeda is in some sense a remnant of the forever wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, launched when the horrors of 9/11 were still raw. Nearly two decades and thousands of U.S. military deaths later, the appetite for new overseas interventions is low even as old ones drag on. Some sixty percent of Americans, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll from May, \u003ca href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-iran-poll/half-of-american-adults-expect-war-with-iran-within-next-few-years-reuters-ipsos-poll-idUSKCN1SR27K\"\u003ewould oppose\u003c/a\u003e a preemptive strike on Iran—but 79 percent said the U.S. military should respond if Iran attacked.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eMore than half expected war within the next few years regardless.

Perhaps spending it on other things would be more fulfilling. “I do think it is less about how much is actually coming in and more about how they’re consciously using the money,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis was similar to what Michelle Tascoe, a financial coach in Los Angeles with some clients making “multiple six figures,” told me. “I can have clients that make half as much money as another client, but they're happier, because they have clarity around where their finances are at,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTascoe also stressed the importance of defining one’s financial goals clearly. “I want to give my kids fulfilling lives” is a noble aim, but a vague one. Sharpening it—maybe to “I want to send my kids to summer camp”—makes it easier to plan and save for, as well as easier to complete. It’s not clear when the task of providing a fulfilling life to one’s kids is finished, if it ever is.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut sometimes, stress about money is not truly about money. Amanda Clayman, a financial therapist who practices in L.A., says that because money is a means of attaining many of the things people dream and fret about, their anxieties about what those things symbolize can get projected onto the money and the things themselves. For instance, if someone starts to feel a need for a bigger house, they might want to ask themselves what having such a house would mean to them, and whether it would really quiet any inner restlessness they may have.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“The proxy nature of money means that we can get stuck,” Clayman said. “Instead of doing our own emotional work, it's like we're trying to do this superficial change instead, to get out of doing the work that's actually much harder and makes us feel a lot more vulnerable. Sometimes it can seem more attainable to just make more money and get a nicer house.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn her work, Clayman often finds herself talking clients through emotional problems that they originally interpret as financial problems. For example, a man who’s convinced he needs a new, bigger house might be reacting to, say, the unresolved trauma of watching his parents go bankrupt and being forced to move to a new house and school; processing those long-ago feelings might do him more good than a new home ever would.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“All this classic [psychological] stuff is going to find some sort of expression in money,” Clayman says. Maybe working through these underlying emotional issues would help people feel more okay with what they have.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe other experts I talked to suggested other tactics for counteracting the sensation of needing more. Many focused on social comparisons. “We can choose to make other kinds of comparisons,” said Keith Payne, the UNC researcher. “For example, we can make downward comparisons to people who are doing less well than us, which frankly sounds kind of mean, but it kind of makes sense.\" He also suggested the less schadenfreude-y strategy of comparing one’s current position to where one was financially and professionally some years ago.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother comparison one could make is to one’s own childhood. For those who are more financially secure than their parents were, remembering their family’s one-time money troubles (or even just their parents’ unhealthy relationship with money) may make them feel more appreciative of their current situation. However, the ranks of Americans for whom this would be an encouraging exercise is, unfortunately, shrinking: According to \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8DQLYMTtIY\"\u003eresearch by the economist Raj Chetty\u003c/a\u003e, kids born in 1940 had a 92 percent chance of going on to out-earn their parents, whereas kids born in the 1980s had closer to a 50 percent chance—meaning that there are now a lot more people who are living with less buying power than what their parents had when they were growing up.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePayne also recommended something that researchers call “self affirmation,” though he admitted to disliking that term because, in his words, “it sounds self-helpy.” But the idea is to block off some time to write down or think through what values one considers most important, which can function as a reminder that one need not keep up with others in order to feel good enough.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese mental exercises may be effective, but they do seem hard to make a regular practice of. Maybe, given what researchers know about social comparisons, it’d be effective instead to be more deliberate about the friends that one keeps—if they share similar values, it wouldn’t be so bad to mimic them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRelatedly, many of the experts I spoke with brought up the idea that social-media follows could be similarly manipulated. \"Virtual reference groups are interesting because we potentially have more choice over [them],” said Elizabeth Dunn. “There's a lot of constraints on what neighborhood you live in or who you're able to socialize with in the real world, but nobody has to follow the Kardashians on Instagram,” or their own conspicuous-consumer acquaintances, for that matter.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd when it comes to peers, the financial coaches had an additional piece of advice. \"I think it's really important to be talkative and honest about your finances with friends and family,” said Maggie Germano. “Because then you can see what other people are struggling with and that you’re not the only one who maybe feels discontent with their finances.\" In the realm of money, it seems people would be better off doing less observing of peers, and more talking with them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/hvkBG1DlmE0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/hvkBG1DlmE0/","published":"2019-07-21T11:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-594439"},{"title":"The Border Patrol–to–Emergency Room Pipeline","content":"\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWhile cradling her baby, who had just finished breastfeeding, Sara reached her other hand out to her older son.

A foggy mist of breathing medication enveloped his nose and swirled in front of his mouth. The 2-year-old, who has asthma, would soon be diagnosed with pneumonia.

Cursory medical screenings and crowded holding rooms leave tired and weak asylum seekers vulnerable to contracting illnesses both minor and severe. Some migrants become so ill that they’re rushed to the emergency room for treatment either while they’re still in detention or just after they’re released.\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr class=\"c-section-divider\"\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e“You never know what time it is,” Sara said, recalling her days in detention.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe lights were always on, she said, but she learned to tell the time by the rhythms of the workers flowing in and out. Like many detained migrants, Sara doesn’t know where she was held. Based on where Sara crossed into Texas, Marianela Ramirez-Watson, the director of the Refugee Respite Program at Good Neighbor Settlement House, thinks she may have been held in Border Patrol’s largest detention center, commonly called “Ursula” for its location on Ursula Avenue in McAllen, Texas.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eEmergency-room doctors and nurses in the Rio Grande Valley, the busiest border region for migrant crossings, say they often see detained immigrants escorted into their offices by immigration agents. A physician’s assistant I spoke with, whose identity is also being withheld so she could speak freely, said that in her regular 12-hour shifts she usually sees between five and 10 patients escorted by Border Patrol agents for issues such as medication refills, the flu, chicken pox, anxiety, pink eye, and bone fractures from jumping off the border wall. Carlos Ramirez, the medical director of a freestanding emergency room run by Rio Grande Regional Hospital, said he regularly sees patients recently released from Border Patrol with advanced coughs, congestion, lung infections, stomach problems, and skin conditions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eOfficial statements confirm this detention-to-hospital pipeline.

A Border Patrol spokesperson didn’t reply to a request for updated information.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eRamirez chalked up migrants’ illness mostly to the “luggage” they bring with them, including a lack of preventive care like vaccines, and the arduous trek. “This is not related to being in a detention center,” he said. “This is because their immune system is not good, because they don’t have the vaccines, because of a bunch of things they don’t have to start with.” But other physicians said that the conditions in the facilities themselves were also to blame. Detainees can’t wash their hands, even after using the bathroom, according to Dolly Lucio Sevier, a local pediatrician who visited Ursula in mid-June. She said this was \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/07/border-patrols-oversight-sick-migrant-children/593224/?utm_source=feed\"\u003e“tantamount to intentionally causing the spread of disease”\u003c/a\u003e in a report she wrote about the visit. Lawyers subsequently used her observations in a lawsuit against the federal government to demand better treatment for these detained children, and a federal judge \u003ca href=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cacd.45170/gov.uscourts.cacd.45170.576.0_1.pdf\"\u003eordered\u003c/a\u003e in late June that an independent mediator should work to quickly improve unsanitary conditions at Texas Border Patrol facilities.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWhat Sara’s family endured in detention certainly didn’t help. In addition to pneumonia, Sara’s 2-year-old also had an ear infection, and though she asked for antibiotics, she said immigration officials didn’t give them to her. About 70 migrants huddled on a freezing tile floor in the room where her family was detained, Sara said. They had floor mats to sleep on, but she said that for a time, not everyone had blankets. Each time a group of migrants was released, others claimed the blankets they left behind. “I wasn’t able to talk because of how cold it was,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe milk for babies smelled sour, she said, and her 1-year-old vomited and had diarrhea after drinking it—a complaint that Ramirez-Watson has recently heard from other families who have passed through Good Neighbor. Sometimes sandwich bread was moldy, and some of the children’s burritos had rotten beans, Sara said. One of the burritos appeared to have a bite mark. “They would pass around a container to put stuff we didn’t eat, and then the next day it seemed like they would give us the food that was thrown away,” she said. (When asked for a comment on the conditions Sara faced in detention, Border Patrol didn’t respond.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eShe said three guards would look at her with disgust and push people, often harassing the children. “One of them would say ‘What the fuck’ and start saying stuff,” she said. “I don’t know English, but I know bad words.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr class=\"c-section-divider\"\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eDozens of migrants flow through the doors of Good Neighbor every day, and the nearby Catholic Charities respite center aids hundreds more in McAllen, Texas. While local respite-center directors say that most newly released migrants don’t require intensive medical care, sometimes they arrive so sick that they have to go straight to an emergency room.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eSome respite centers, such as Catholic Charities, have volunteer doctors to treat minor ailments, and they send migrants to the emergency room for more severe problems. Ramirez-Watson of Good Neighbor says the shelter’s insurance company won’t let it distribute medications like Tylenol without hiring a medical professional, which it can’t afford now. So if migrants, especially children, arrive with a 101-degree fever or higher, she’ll call an ambulance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eReleased migrants are almost always uninsured and usually can’t afford the cost of treatment. Hospitals likely pay for their care with federal and state dollars through a program called Emergency Medicaid, according to Anne Dunkelberg, the associate director of the Texas-based think tank Center for Public Policy Priorities, though that may not apply in all cases, and she said other supplemental funding sources, both federal and local, might also chip in.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eFrom January to April, Good Neighbor sent about one to two people to the emergency room every week, though that frequency has dropped in recent weeks, according to Ramirez-Watson. “Mostly it’s children, babies that are very fragile and may have high fever,” says Sister Norma Pimentel, who runs the Catholic Charities respite center. “They may be dehydrated and unresponsive, so we definitely take them to the hospital right away.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eRoberto “Bert” Johansson, a pediatric intensive-care specialist who volunteers at a respite center in El Paso, has treated hundreds of migrant children released from immigration detention facilities, and he’s seen kids with lice, scabies, and a range of infections that he says could have been treated and, if necessary, isolated sooner.

The novel on which the series is based characterizes Bonnie as being motivated to kill the antagonist Perry (played by Alexander Skarsgård) because she’d experienced violence in her home growing up. But lacking this context, and considering that significant stretches of the season played out with Bonnie in the periphery, her actions on the night of Perry’s death felt rather abrupt. That culminating scene didn’t lend itself to the novel’s intended effect of showing the sisterhood that forms in the midst of trauma.

The episodes start with a significant amount of handwringing over the women’s decision to not tell the truth about the incident—a decision which is hitting Bonnie the hardest, much to the rest of the group’s confusion. In a discussion with Madeline, Bonnie explains that despite the collectiveness of the secret, \u003ci\u003eshe\u003c/i\u003e is the only one who carries the burden of actually killing Perry.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s clear that Bonnie still feels removed from her peers, yet her reasoning for feeling this way is fairly unexamined.

At best, the change certainly waded into demystifying black maternal dynamics.

Bonnie reconciling her trauma is an experience that she largely goes through alone, despite having a pre-existing bond with Celeste (Nicole Kidman), who knows well the complexities of domestic violence and the guilt that comes with being victimized repeatedly.

Her landmark 1928 study of adolescence had just been reissued as a 95-cent paperback for the counterculture generation. The book offered a vision of how to be a teenage girl. I could be the seductive young woman on the cover in a red sarong with a blossom in her hair—free, fearless, and lighthearted, especially about sex. It also offered a vision of how to be an intellectual woman. Mead, with her signature cape and walking stick, after all, was the most famous anthropologist in the world. And, sure enough, in that glorious period after the pill, I grew up to be free and fearless and sexually adventurous. I also grew up, naturally and effortlessly, to become a scientist and a writer. The visions came true—the possibilities were real.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut is that actually what happened? In light of the #MeToo movement, I ask myself whether I have simply edited the threats and slights and misogyny of hippie culture out of my memories. Did I really escape the sexism of academia? I can easily call up moments that contradict my version of my past, even if at the time I dismissed them (that radical-leftist mentor, for instance, who explained to me that women could never belong to the philosophy-department faculty, because they were too distracting). And if I’m not sure that I understand my own experience and culture, how could Mead understand the unfamiliar experience and culture of the girls she observed in Samoa? The project of anthropology has always been to study people who seem very different from the anthropologists themselves. Is that project even possible? And is it worth doing?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"left\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" height=\"272\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/07/CULT_Gopnik_Anthro_Final_Books/951651299.jpg\" width=\"180\"\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"credit\"\u003eDoubleday\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn\u003ci\u003e Gods of the Upper Air: How a Circle of Renegade Anthropologists Reinvented Race, Sex, and Gender in the Twentieth Century\u003c/i\u003e, Charles King, a professor of international affairs and government at Georgetown, makes the case for anthropology in a thoughtful, deeply intelligent, and immensely readable and entertaining way. The book is a joint biography of the people who created anthropology at the turn of the last century: Franz Boas, the father of the field, and the women who were among his most influential students, especially Ruth Benedict, Zora Neale Hurston, and Margaret Mead.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBoas was a German Jew born in Westphalia in 1858, and he was a generation older than his students (and had fearsome dueling scars from his days at the University of Heidelberg). He was a pathbreaking explorer—at 25, he sailed to Baffin Island, where he recorded the lives of the Inuit—and an exceptional teacher. He was also rather touchy and grumpy, with an obsessive dedication to collecting facts. Benedict, 29 years younger than Boas, was the deepest thinker of the group; her book \u003ci\u003ePatterns of Culture\u003c/i\u003e (1934) is still an important text in anthropology. She is also an elusive figure, perhaps because the life of a lesbian university professor in the early 20th century required a certain amount of evasion. Hurston’s story is remarkable and heartbreaking. Being an intellectual woman in the 1920s was difficult enough. Being an intellectual black woman was much harder. Hurston died in 1960 at 69, \u003ca href=\"https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os-xpm-1985-06-09-0300360206-story.html\"\u003eneglected and penniless\u003c/a\u003e, and her work was rediscovered only decades later.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn King’s book, Margaret Mead is the magnetic center of attention, as she was in life, although she never had a tenured faculty position, and she was small and fragile—the stylish walking stick was a necessity. She was only 23 when she went to Samoa, not much more than a teenager herself. Though she had already been married for two years, she spent the long train journey to the West Coast, where the boat voyage began, talking about ideas and making passionate love to Ruth Benedict, her teacher, who was also married. Then Mead spent the long ship journey back talking about ideas and making passionate love to Reo Fortune, who became her second husband. (Airplane travel has clearly been terrible for romance.) On the next trip she met Gregory Bateson, who became her third husband after several steamy months, literally and figuratively, of sharing a hut with her and Fortune in Papua New Guinea. All this time, she wrote long, analytic letters to Benedict, trying to understand it all. For Mead, sex and ideas were inextricable.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe romantic intrigue makes for irresistible reading, but it’s also central to the book’s argument. The anthropologists had a revolutionary new idea, which they called “cultural relativity.” The phrase is a bit misleading, because it implies there is no truth to be found, but Boas and his students didn’t think that. Instead, they argued that all societies face the same basic problems—love and death, work and children, hierarchy and community—but that different societies could find different, and equally valuable, ways of solving them. Anthropologists set out to discover those ways.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"dropcap\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"smallcaps\"\u003eThe dilemmas of \u003c/span\u003esex and gender and the tensions between autonomy and jealousy, adventure and commitment, identity and attraction, were especially vivid to young women of the 1920s like Mead, Benedict, and Hurston. If the 1960s felt like a cultural watershed, the period pales in comparison with the decade when these women were coming of age. Virginia Woolf said that around December 1910, human character changed, and you can feel the reverberations of that change in these stories.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLooking at how other cultures resolved those dilemmas was a way of expanding the possibilities of their own culture. The culture of Samoa was actually more complicated and contradictory than it seems in Mead’s book. But her core idea was right: In other places, there were better paths through adolescence than the tormented, repressive American one.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs you read about Mead and her lovers, you can’t help remarking on a recurrent tragicomic hopelessness about brilliant young women’s efforts to figure out sex. That’s true whether the protagonist is Mary Shelley in the 1820s, Margaret Mead in the 1920s, or a polyamorist today. You also can’t help remarking that the person at the apex of a love triangle—the position Mead found herself in again and again—is rather likely to conclude that polyamory is natural and jealousy is cultural, while the folks at the other two vertices are more likely to argue the opposite view.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMore broadly, the history of feminism has seen a pendulum swing between libertine and puritan impulses. A hundred years earlier, another great feminist anthropologist working closer to home carefully studied how adolescent village girls came of age. But Jane Austen concluded that resisting male pressure and seduction was the route to empowerment, a view that may resonate more nowadays than Mead’s free love under the palm trees.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStill, the back-and-forth doesn’t mean that nothing changes, or that the project of cultural expansion is doomed. (I doubt that my granddaughter will figure out sex entirely either, but she’ll be a lot further along than Shelley or Austen—or Mead.) Neither Mead nor Benedict could fully envision the best example of 20th-century cultural transformation. They pointed out that homosexuality was accepted in other cultures and came under fire for saying it, even from other anthropologists. Edward Sapir was another famous Boas student (and another ex-lover of Mead’s), and he argued that gay sex was not just unnatural but pathological.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBenedict was the most stable and satisfying love of Margaret Mead’s early life, and another anthropologist, Rhoda Métraux, was Mead’s partner for more than 20 years. And yet the fearless, transgressive public intellectual never openly identified herself as bisexual or lesbian. Even in the 1960s, when I was reading \u003ci\u003eComing of Age\u003c/i\u003e, romantic love with a woman was still far outside my personal realm of possibilities—35 years passed before I discovered it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 2019, it’s easy to imagine Benedict and Mead settling into a happy academic marriage with a big house and kids and dogs. In 1919, it was impossible. But the anthropologists who showed how sexual patterns and expectations could vary and change helped make that kind of marriage a reality.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe very word \u003ci\u003eculture\u003c/i\u003e, and the idea that people in one culture can learn from people in others, is taken for granted now. But King shows how revolutionary those concepts were at a time when scientists classified people as savage, barbarian, or civilized, and three-quarters of American universities offered courses in eugenics. In the 1920s, as King vividly conveys, ideas about biologically based racial, ethnic, and gender superiority were considered scientific, modern, and progressive. (In some quarters they still are.) When the Nazis looked for examples of a science that justified racial discrimination, and a government that wrote racial categories into law, they turned to the United States.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/11/what-america-taught-the-nazis/540630/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: What America taught the Nazis\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBoas heroically led the charge against the pseudoscience of race, and his students followed, combining their academic work with public action. Hurston made her mark by her very existence as an African American woman graduate student at Columbia. Boas, Benedict, and Mead also dedicated themselves to fighting the forces of populist xenophobia before and during World War II. Even more striking, after the war, Benedict’s famous book \u003ci\u003eThe Chrysanthemum and the Sword: Patterns of Japanese Culture\u003c/i\u003e (1946) was an explicit attempt to combat anti-Japanese bias.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"dropcap\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"smallcaps\"\u003eAt the end \u003c/span\u003eof the 20th century, anthropology went through an intellectual and moral crisis. The malign influence of postmodernism, which actually did advocate a profound relativism, played a part. Yet the crisis was also an appropriate reaction to a real problem—privileged members of one culture were parachuting in to study the threatened and oppressed members of other cultures. The result was a kind of paralysis. If people from one culture couldn’t say anything about people from another, for both political and philosophical reasons, why do anthropology at all?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother development, from the opposite direction, also made anthropology problematic. The late 20th century saw the rise of sociobiology and evolutionary psychology, which largely rejected the very idea that cultural difference and change were important. \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/31/books/new-samoa-book-challenges-margaret-mead-s-conclusions.html\"\u003eMead’s work was attacked\u003c/a\u003e, in a way that now seems transparently sexist and ideologically motivated, and the unfair charge that she fabricated her data still lingers in the public imagination.

Inspired by evolutionary biology, behavioral ecologists such as Sarah Hrdy of UC Davis study how basic biological imperatives—child care, for example—play out in different societies. Inspired by cognitive science, cognitive anthropologists such as Rita Astuti of the London School of Economics study how intuitive theories of kinship and death develop in different cultures. Stanford’s T. M. Luhrmann, and other anthropologists of religion, study how different cultural models of the mind configure religious experience. (Women are still exceptionally prominent in the field—an important legacy of those early figures.) Psychologists and economists are also starting to appreciate the need to study cultures beyond what are known as the WEIRD (Western-educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic) ones.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur very conceptions of biology and culture are changing, and the new ideas redeem the vision of the anthropological pioneers. The old distinctions between biology and culture, nature and nurture, just don’t work. Today, it’s clear that culture is our nature, and the ability to change is our most important innate trait. Human beings are uniquely, biologically gifted at imagining new ways that people and the world could be, and transmitting those new possibilities to the next generation. Human imagination and cultural transformation go hand in hand. Some of the most important current work in anthropology, biology, and psychology looks at the mechanisms that allow cultural transmission and change across generations. Children’s brains are biologically adapted both to innovate and to learn from their elders, and teenagers, in particular, are often at the cutting edge of cultural change. Mead’s focus on childhood and adolescence was prescient.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe girls of Samoa showed Mead that there was a different way to grow up, a different way to become a woman.

Other protests have moved outward from Hong Kong island, the part of the city known internationally for its tightly packed skyscrapers, into more suburban areas such as Sha Tin and Sheung Shui, where residents have for years complained about the unchecked influx of small-scale Chinese traders. The rallies have continued to shock, perhaps most notably this month, when protesters \u003ca href=\"https://www.hongkongfp.com/2019/07/03/taking-back-legislature-happened-inside-3-hour-occupation-shook-hong-kong/\"\u003ebroke into and briefly occupied\u003c/a\u003e the city’s Legislative Council building. Some feared then that a tipping point had been reached, and that widespread public sympathy for the demonstrations would fizzle: The actions of those who stormed the chamber, the argument went, would turn the broader population against those willing to risk more extreme actions, dividing and crippling the movement.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThose predictions have, however, proved to be largely off-point. A consensus has instead emerged—one that does not necessarily condone actions that include disrupting government work, pelting police headquarters with crates of eggs, and leaving dog food behind for officers, but certainly understands why they are being done.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eA surprisingly large swath of people here have been “very forgiving and accepting,” says Antony Dapiran, author of \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/City-Protest-History-Dissent-Specials/dp/0734399626/\"\u003eCity of Protest: A Recent History of Dissent in Hong Kong\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e, who describes the criticism as “pretty muted.” It has robbed the authorities, he told me, of the public sympathy they had hoped for following the government-building break-in, after which piles of broken glass surrounded the trashed offices.

F. Lee, a journalism professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, found that 83.5 percent of 1,100 people polled during a demonstration this month either agreed or strongly agreed with the notion that it was understandable protesters would resort to radical action if they felt the government wasn’t listening to their concerns.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eOfficials have instead had to adjust to the new reality that protesters are readying for what will likely be a summer of revolt, their expectations, reach, and frustrations growing by the week. “I think the government were originally hoping for this [public-relations] victory, and when they saw it wasn’t coming, they seem to have backed off rather than digging in,” Dapiran said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eBeijing, too, has largely held back from directly intervening. So far, the Chinese government has backed Hong Kong’s response and reverted to the tried tactic of claiming much of the unhappiness has been fomented by foreign forces. “Clearly China’s authority is being challenged,” Ip said, “but they have shown really remarkable restraint.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe anger of the protests has been just one example of the normalization of previously radical positions and efforts here. Calls for all-out independence, rather than simply preserving Hong Kong’s autonomy, have grown louder (though remain very much the minority among protesters); demands for universal suffrage, which largely dissipated after the 2014 Umbrella Movement protests, have been revived; support for Taiwan’s independence among Hong Kong residents has \u003ca href=\"https://www.pori.hk/nationalissues/taiwan-independence\"\u003ejumped\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eAt the same time, issues of democracy have intermingled with more quotidian questions of inequality and affordability. Hong Kong’s housing prices regularly top lists of the world’s most expensive, with recent government figures putting the average cost of a 646-square-foot apartment on Hong Kong island, relatively small by Western standards but family-size here, at $1.45 million. “A lot of people, young people, do not see hope in their future,” says Fernando Cheung, a pro-democracy lawmaker who has been a fixture at protests and who recently joined a hunger strike whose participants have camped out near a busy subway station. “They cannot afford to get married, they cannot afford to have children, they can’t afford to sustain themselves.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eOn the ground, dozens of “Lennon walls,” areas papered with Post-it Notes filled with messages of support for protesters, and others lambasting Lam and the police, have mushroomed across the city, turning the sides of escalators and subway stations into technicolor murals of discontent. At least half a dozen more marches and rallies are scheduled for the coming weeks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e“Hong Kong people have changed quite a lot in the past few years,” Ventus Lau, who organized a demonstration through an area frequented by visitors from mainland China in early July, told me.

The events of the past week illustrate why. For those hoping to ride the global nationalist wave and shift Republicans and conservatism away from the free market, free trading, and internationalist philosophies which have defined it for the past half century, the nationalist-in-chief has proven to be a massive liability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScrupulous avoidance of the president was hardly the confab\u0026rsquo;s only paradox. Take foreign policy. One of the keynote speakers, Fox News host Tucker Carlson, has repeatedly criticized Trump for bombing Syria and reportedly convinced the president not to strike Iran. He has called Trump\u0026rsquo;s hawkish national security advisor John Bolton a \u0026ldquo;bureaucratic tapeworm\u0026rdquo; who \u0026ldquo;seems to live forever in the bowels\u0026rdquo; of Washington. Yet the following day, said tapeworm slithered into the Ritz for his own keynote appearance, which, like Carlson\u0026rsquo;s, was well-received by the audience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis ideological muddle isn\u0026rsquo;t unique to conservatism (witness the Democratic Party) but rather a reflection of how Trump\u0026rsquo;s 2016 election discombobulated the entire American political landscape. Conservative intellectuals who haven\u0026rsquo;t abandoned the Republican Party in disgust now face a difficult task in fashioning an ideology onto a pre-existing political movement that despises elites. Usually it\u0026rsquo;s intellectuals who influence political movements, not the other way around. Franklin Delano Roosevelt recruited teams of academics to Washington to build his New Deal liberalism. A decade later, William F. Buckley Jr.\u0026rsquo;s erudite magazine \u003cem\u003eNational Review \u003c/em\u003ebirthed a conservative movement which brought Ronald Reagan to power and dominated American politics well into the 21\u003csup\u003est\u003c/sup\u003e century. That movement consisted of three constituencies: social conservatives, free marketers, and neoconservative national security hawks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrump\u0026rsquo;s victory upended this coalition. When he announced his presidential candidacy four years ago, Trump approached it as a business proposition. Identifying a huge, untapped market, he offered the Republican electorate a product no one else was selling: the most extreme variety of immigration restriction, a repudiation of Reaganite economic orthodoxy, and a reassessment of America\u0026rsquo;s leading role in the world. Above all, his promises to build a wall along the southern border and harshly enforce immigration laws is what distinguished him from a pack of 16 other Republican candidates and catapulted him to the White House, and it\u0026rsquo;s what keeps his supporters loyal through near-daily scandals and moral outrages that would sink any other politician. The challenge for pro-Trump intellectuals lies in their ability to fashion a coherent political ideology around such an incoherent figure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe primacy of national borders in the Trumpian ethos has emboldened one of the movement\u0026rsquo;s three factions \u0026ndash; the social conservatives \u0026ndash; to leverage that issue and thereby seek dominance over the other two\u003cstrong\u003e.\u003c/strong\u003e The only other group to be attacked more than neoconservatives at last week\u0026rsquo;s conference was libertarians. The conservative writer Mary Eberstadt skewered them for a \u0026ldquo;creed of \u0026lsquo;so what\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; which has \u0026ldquo;no answer to identity politics\u0026rdquo; because of its \u0026ldquo;obsession with the atomized self.\u0026rdquo; National Conservatism, she said, requires four components \u0026#8211; memory, humility, discernment and gravitas. (All estimable qualities, but not those which one associates with Donald Trump.) J.D. Vance, author of the bestselling book \u003cem\u003eHillbilly Elegy\u003c/em\u003e, complained that \u0026ldquo;conservatives have outsourced our economic policy to libertarians\u0026rdquo; and asked why neuroscientists working to create smart-phone apps earn so much more than those trying to cure brain diseases. Carlson lauded Democratic Senator and presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren\u0026rsquo;s \u003cem\u003eThe Two Income Trap \u003c/em\u003eas \u0026ldquo;one of the best books I\u0026rsquo;ve ever read about economics.\u0026rdquo; [[wow]]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike many of their ideological antagonists on the socialist left, the nationalist conservatives are long on apocalyptic language about our allegedly calamitous state but short on practical solutions for alleviating it. On a panel about immigration, one speaker lamented how immigrants bring \u0026ldquo;noise\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;litter\u0026rdquo; and predicted that America was going the way of Venezuela. Yoram Hazony, the Israeli author whose 2018 book \u003cem\u003eThe Virtue of Nationalism \u003c/em\u003einspired the conference, announced that he had \u0026ldquo;Never seen [American] cohesion as frayed as it is today.\u0026rdquo; (Born in 1964, he\u0026rsquo;s too young to remember that decade, rocked by multiple political assassinations, riots, and terrorist bombings.) Hazony lamented how conservatives \u0026ldquo;lost interest in the Bible\u0026rdquo; and credulously believed that the country \u0026ldquo;could privatize religion.\u0026rdquo; But short of amending the U.S. Constitution to explicitly enshrine \u0026ldquo;Judeo-Christian values,\u0026rdquo; much less their enforcement, how could such a supposed flaw be rectified?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;We need to love our fellow citizens,\u0026rdquo; pleaded David Brog.

And none of this could have happened if Captain America and Iron Man were still around or if Thor hadn\u0026#8217;t embraced his funnier side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFiege began the panel by introducing the diverse cast of \u003cem\u003eThe Eternals\u003c/em\u003e, directed by Chloe Zhao. The lineup includes Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, Brian Tyree Henry, Kumail Nanjani and Richard Madden, all playing one family.

Canadian actor Simu Liu will play a master of martial arts who faces off against The Mandarin. No, this won\u0026#8217;t be the same Mandarin from \u003cem\u003eIron Man 3\u003c/em\u003e, whom that film\u0026#8217;s director Shane Black has described as \u0026#8220;a racist stereotype of a Fu Manchu villain just waving his fist.\u0026#8221; Instead, Mandarin will be the \u0026#8220;real deal\u0026#8221; played by veteran actor Tony Leung.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Marvel is updating some of its older characters too. After Fiege announced there would be a fourth Thor movie, \u003cem\u003eThor: Love and Thunder\u003c/em\u003e, Tessa Thompson took the stage to clarify that her character Valkyrie, ruler of Asgard, is indeed queer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;As new King, she needs to find her new queen, so that\u0026#8217;ll be her first order of business,\u0026#8221; Thompson said. Thompson \u003ca href=\"https://time.com/collection-post/5584903/tessa-thompson-next-generation-leaders/\" \u003etold TIME\u003c/a\u003e in May that she had been nudging Marvel in that direction for some time, including fighting to keep a scene in \u003cem\u003eThor: Ragnarok\u003c/em\u003e that showed Valkyrie in bed with a woman. The scene ultimately ended up on the cutting room floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Natalie Portman revealed that her character, Thor\u0026#8217;s onetime love interest Jane Foster, would wield the hammer Mjolnir and become Thor.

Now, it seems a more empowered storyline for her character brought Portman back into the Marvel family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScarlett Johansson also attended Comic-Con to promote the upcoming \u003cem\u003eBlack Widow\u003c/em\u003e movie. After nine years playing sidekick, Natasha will \u003cem\u003efinally\u003c/em\u003e get her own solo film. The character and the MCU has come a long way since Black Widow\u0026#8217;s introduction in 2010\u0026#8217;s \u003cem\u003eIron Man 2\u003c/em\u003e when Pepper catches Tony ogling Natahsa and dubs her \u0026#8220;a very expensive sexual-harassment lawsuit.\u0026#8221; In the following years, the character of Black Widow continued to be portrayed as a sex object, as each movie suggested that she had a flirtation with Hawkeye, then Captain America, then Hulk before she was finally allowed to be on her own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, Feige announced that Oscar-winner Mahershala Ali will reboot \u003cem\u003eBlade, \u003c/em\u003eonce made immortal by Wesley Snipes. When \u003cem\u003eBlack Panther\u003c/em\u003e premiered in 2018, many fans \u003ca href=\"https://slate.com/culture/2018/02/wesley-snipes-on-blade-black-panther-and-black-culture-in-hollywood.html\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003ecited \u003cem\u003eBlade\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e as the movie that laid the groundwork for a black superhero movie to break box office records.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese aren\u0026#8217;t radical changes to the Marvel canon. In the comics, Shang-Chi was introduced in 1973, a female Thor has been the Goddess of Thunder \u003ca href=\"https://time.com/2987940/thor-female/\" \u003esince 2014\u003c/a\u003e and Valkyrie has had relationships with women. But the movies have been slow to catch-up. In the last few years, Marvel has introduced a more diverse array of comics characters to the Avengers crew, including Black Panther and Captain Marvel, the first black lead and female lead in an MCU movie, respectively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow they\u0026#8217;re offering correctives: Giving Black Widow her own movie, evolving Thompson and Portman\u0026#8217;s characters into leads instead of supporting players, retconning the Mandarin character.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWould it be possible for Jane Foster to take over as Thor if Chris Hemsworth had not already put his stamp on the character in six different movies? Probably not. Would Black Widow be permitted to come into her own in a world where every man flirted with her or outright harassed her? Doubtful. Would Shang-Chi evolve into a major player in the MCU if he had to debut into the cluttered fray of superheroes taking on Thanos at the end of \u003cem\u003eEndgame\u003c/em\u003e? It surely would have been less impactful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt will surely take time for fans to grow to love these new characters as much as they adored Iron Man, Thor and Captain America by the events of \u003cem\u003eEndgame\u003c/em\u003e. And Marvel Studios looks to wisely be laying the groundwork for these new characters to earn that fandom before they try to throw another major event like the Infinity Wars at us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/time/topstories/~4/-MHSP8B27jc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/-MHSP8B27jc/","published":"2019-07-21T16:20:19Z","guid":"http://time.com/?p=5631075"},{"title":"How Neil and Buzz Almost Were Stranded on the Moon in 1969","content":"\u003caside class=\"right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad\" id=\"right-rail__ad-5630838\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module\" data-src=\"https://time.com/5630838/how-neil-and-buzz-almost-were-stranded-on-the-moon-in-1969/\" data-widget-id=\"SB_2\" data-ob-template=\"timemag\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven after half a century, people still don\u0026rsquo;t know much about the little broken switch that nearly stranded Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on the lunar surface in July of 1969.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one will ever be certain how the switch broke, but Aldrin is pretty sure it happened after he and Armstrong reentered the lunar module following their two-and-a-half hour moonwalk. The flight plan called for them to seal the hatch, repressurize the cabin, disconnect their backpacks and connect their suit hoses to the spacecraft\u0026rsquo;s life support systems. Then they would vent the cabin once more, open up the hatch and chuck the backpacks and other unneeded equipment onto the moon\u0026rsquo;s surface, reducing the weight of the ship for liftoff.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0026rsquo;d practiced the routine uncounted times, but in all of the shifting and moving and garbage-tossing this time, one of the astronauts banged something or other against Aldrin\u0026rsquo;s side of the instrument panel, snapping off the switch that sent power to the ascent engine. Without power, the engine wouldn\u0026rsquo;t light and the crew would go nowhere, leaving Michael Collins, orbiting overhead in the Apollo command module, to fly home alone. Aldrin spotted the problem after they had shut the hatch once more and he looked out the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;I saw something that didn\u0026rsquo;t belong, in the dust,\u0026rdquo; he told TIME in a conversation last year. \u0026ldquo;And it was this thing that looked like a circuit breaker. We got up on my side and looked and it was the engine arm circuit breaker.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Houston, engineers scrambled to find a workaround that would reroute power to the engine without the switch, but after several hours, they had nothing. In the end, the solution was wonderfully simple, wonderfully crude. The stem of the switch was still visible, recessed inside the small hole remaining in the instrument panel. It was far too small a hole for a finger. But a pen\u0026mdash;a felt tip to prevent the risk of a metal-on-metal short\u0026mdash;might do just fine. Aldrin had one and he used it, and on the pivot point of a fifty-cent bit of plastic nothing, history turned and the lunar module lifted off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0026#8217;re \u003ca href=\"https://time.com/collection/apollo-11-50/\" \u003econtemplating that history a lot this week\u003c/a\u003e, as the world celebrates the half-century anniversary of Apollo 11\u0026mdash;and there\u0026#8217;s nothing wrong with that.

That’s the work that we have to do,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Q3dOWC\"\u003eThe Trump administration was ordered by a judge to stop separating families at the border in 2018; however, \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/2/21/18234767/parents-separated-children-families-border-trump-jails\"\u003eseparations continued\u003c/a\u003e well after that order was handed down.

Lifelong trauma for which we, the United States, are responsible.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"HqAiyG\"\u003eThe freshman lawmaker did not outline how exactly the government would take this responsibility, but here too, 9/11 could prove to be a model.

Conservative intellectuals who haven\u0026rsquo;t abandoned the Republican Party in disgust now face a difficult task in fashioning an ideology onto a pre-existing political movement that despises elites. Usually it\u0026rsquo;s intellectuals who influence political movements, not the other way around. Franklin Delano Roosevelt recruited teams of academics to Washington to build his New Deal liberalism. A decade later, William F. Buckley Jr.\u0026rsquo;s erudite magazine \u003cem\u003eNational Review \u003c/em\u003ebirthed a conservative movement which brought Ronald Reagan to power and dominated American politics well into the 21\u003csup\u003est\u003c/sup\u003e century. That movement consisted of three constituencies: social conservatives, free marketers, and neoconservative national security hawks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrump\u0026rsquo;s victory upended this coalition. When he announced his presidential candidacy four years ago, Trump approached it as a business proposition. Identifying a huge, untapped market, he offered the Republican electorate a product no one else was selling: the most extreme variety of immigration restriction, a repudiation of Reaganite economic orthodoxy, and a reassessment of America\u0026rsquo;s leading role in the world. Above all, his promises to build a wall along the southern border and harshly enforce immigration laws is what distinguished him from a pack of 16 other Republican candidates and catapulted him to the White House, and it\u0026rsquo;s what keeps his supporters loyal through near-daily scandals and moral outrages that would sink any other politician. The challenge for pro-Trump intellectuals lies in their ability to fashion a coherent political ideology around such an incoherent figure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe primacy of national borders in the Trumpian ethos has emboldened one of the movement\u0026rsquo;s three factions \u0026ndash; the social conservatives \u0026ndash; to leverage that issue and thereby seek dominance over the other two\u003cstrong\u003e.\u003c/strong\u003e The only other group to be attacked more than neoconservatives at last week\u0026rsquo;s conference was libertarians. The conservative writer Mary Eberstadt skewered them for a \u0026ldquo;creed of \u0026lsquo;so what\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; which has \u0026ldquo;no answer to identity politics\u0026rdquo; because of its \u0026ldquo;obsession with the atomized self.\u0026rdquo; National Conservatism, she said, requires four components \u0026#8211; memory, humility, discernment and gravitas. (All estimable qualities, but not those which one associates with Donald Trump.) J.D. Vance, author of the bestselling book \u003cem\u003eHillbilly Elegy\u003c/em\u003e, complained that \u0026ldquo;conservatives have outsourced our economic policy to libertarians\u0026rdquo; and asked why neuroscientists working to create smart-phone apps earn so much more than those trying to cure brain diseases. Carlson lauded Democratic Senator and presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren\u0026rsquo;s \u003cem\u003eThe Two Income Trap \u003c/em\u003eas \u0026ldquo;one of the best books I\u0026rsquo;ve ever read about economics.\u0026rdquo; [[wow]]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike many of their ideological antagonists on the socialist left, the nationalist conservatives are long on apocalyptic language about our allegedly calamitous state but short on practical solutions for alleviating it. On a panel about immigration, one speaker lamented how immigrants bring \u0026ldquo;noise\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;litter\u0026rdquo; and predicted that America was going the way of Venezuela. Yoram Hazony, the Israeli author whose 2018 book \u003cem\u003eThe Virtue of Nationalism \u003c/em\u003einspired the conference, announced that he had \u0026ldquo;Never seen [American] cohesion as frayed as it is today.\u0026rdquo; (Born in 1964, he\u0026rsquo;s too young to remember that decade, rocked by multiple political assassinations, riots, and terrorist bombings.) Hazony lamented how conservatives \u0026ldquo;lost interest in the Bible\u0026rdquo; and credulously believed that the country \u0026ldquo;could privatize religion.\u0026rdquo; But short of amending the U.S. Constitution to explicitly enshrine \u0026ldquo;Judeo-Christian values,\u0026rdquo; much less their enforcement, how could such a supposed flaw be rectified?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;We need to love our fellow citizens,\u0026rdquo; pleaded David Brog. Like much of what I heard last week, this is a worthy appeal. But achieving the social cohesion these national conservatives claim to want will prove impossible so long as they venerate a president so keen on destroying it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/time/topstories/~4/1AKzXjLagG8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/1AKzXjLagG8/","published":"2019-07-21T12:00:36Z","guid":"http://time.com/?p=5630848"},{"title":"British Airways and Lufthansa Suspend Flights to Cairo for Unspecified Reasons","content":"\u003caside class=\"right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module ad-300-250\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad\" id=\"right-rail__ad-5631074\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(LONDON) \u0026mdash; British Airways and Lufthansa both said Saturday they were suspending flights to Cairo for unspecified reasons related to safety and security.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe British carrier said it was canceling flights to the Egyptian capital for a week.

But the movies have been slow to catch-up. In the last few years, Marvel has introduced a more diverse array of comics characters to the Avengers crew, including Black Panther and Captain Marvel, the first black lead and female lead in an MCU movie, respectively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow they\u0026#8217;re offering correctives: Giving Black Widow her own movie, evolving Thompson and Portman\u0026#8217;s characters into leads instead of supporting players, retconning the Mandarin character.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWould it be possible for Jane Foster to take over as Thor if Chris Hemsworth had not already put his stamp on the character in six different movies? Probably not. Would Black Widow be permitted to come into her own in a world where every man flirted with her or outright harassed her? Doubtful. Would Shang-Chi evolve into a major player in the MCU if he had to debut into the cluttered fray of superheroes taking on Thanos at the end of \u003cem\u003eEndgame\u003c/em\u003e? It surely would have been less impactful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt will surely take time for fans to grow to love these new characters as much as they adored Iron Man, Thor and Captain America by the events of \u003cem\u003eEndgame\u003c/em\u003e.

The flight plan called for them to seal the hatch, repressurize the cabin, disconnect their backpacks and connect their suit hoses to the spacecraft\u0026rsquo;s life support systems. Then they would vent the cabin once more, open up the hatch and chuck the backpacks and other unneeded equipment onto the moon\u0026rsquo;s surface, reducing the weight of the ship for liftoff.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0026rsquo;d practiced the routine uncounted times, but in all of the shifting and moving and garbage-tossing this time, one of the astronauts banged something or other against Aldrin\u0026rsquo;s side of the instrument panel, snapping off the switch that sent power to the ascent engine. Without power, the engine wouldn\u0026rsquo;t light and the crew would go nowhere, leaving Michael Collins, orbiting overhead in the Apollo command module, to fly home alone. Aldrin spotted the problem after they had shut the hatch once more and he looked out the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;I saw something that didn\u0026rsquo;t belong, in the dust,\u0026rdquo; he told TIME in a conversation last year. \u0026ldquo;And it was this thing that looked like a circuit breaker.

For example, the now apocryphal $14,000 toilet seats (from decades ago) or more recently, expensive coffee cups purchased by the Air Force.  But one or two examples of over-spending does not meet the burden of proof for “utter mismanagement.”  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eZakaria further references an essay recently written by self-described peace activist Jessica Matthews, who is critical of one way the defense budget is assessed, unsurprisingly finding fault with the data that shows our defense \u003ca href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/217581/outlays-for-defense-and-forecast-in-the-us-as-a-percentage-of-the-gdp/\"\u003espending\u003c/a\u003e as a percentage of our nation’s gross domestic product is at a historic low.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eZakaria goes on to repeat the tired chestnut that the United States spends more than the next 10 highest spending countries together.

In 2019, we've got the Big Data chops for that, but a larger problem has cropped up—end-to-end encryption. The HTTPS standard treats everything in between the website itself and the device you're viewing it on as potentially hostile. It keeps those potential hostiles from seeing or altering what you're doing. So while your router (or any other device in the middle) might be able to tell—or at least effectively guess—what website you're visiting, it has no idea what you're actually doing there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat means filtering based on the actual content you're looking at isn't possible, and family filtering is a semi-blind guessing game.

In the drinks world, such recipes have stood the test of time and grown into industry icons over decades. But unlike similar cultural colossuses elsewhere—from \u003ca href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/01/a-whole-years-worth-of-works-just-fell-into-the-public-domain/\"\u003eMickey Mouse on screen\u003c/a\u003e or \"Hey Jude\" in the stereo—you can find the Negroni being deployed freely at virtually every bar in America. What gives?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you copyright and own a recipe? A recipe in the eyes of the law doesn't have that creative spark,\" says attorney Andrea Mealey, an intellectual property expert who's done legal work for beverage companies like Gosling's Rum. During a panel on IP in the bar industry at the 2019 \u003ca href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2015/07/better-drinking-through-science/\"\u003eTales of the Cocktail (TOTC) conference\u003c/a\u003e, she next points at the ceiling in this conference room. \"The design of that chandelier—someone had to come up with it. It's creative, and you can own copyright on that design. I can do a slightly different design and own that as well. But a recipe is like a phone book in the eyes of the law—you can't own something so factual.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the modern drinks world, Mealey not-so-subtly implies copyright may be the most useless legal tool for enterprising bartenders. (You could at least patent some amazing new tool, in theory.) It's a not-so-dirty secret that many have increasingly become aware of in this modern cocktail renaissance, where a killer recipe at an influential bar can suddenly show up on menus worldwide with little more than a written credit.

Each stitch represents six minutes of time spent awake (gray) or asleep (blue), so the blanket is ‘read’ left to right, with the leftmost stitch marking 12:00AM and rightmost stitch ending at 11:54PM. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"n9D1op\"\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"\u003e\n\u003cp lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThere's nothing quite like the feeling of someone loving the thing you made for them \u003ca href=\"https://t.co/4U1VBCcKNm\"\u003epic.twitter.com/4U1VBCcKNm\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e— Seung Lee (@Lagomorpho) \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/Lagomorpho/status/1150615166838382592?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"\u003eJuly 15, 2019\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cscript async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"WWmWEL\"\u003eThe shift in sleep pattern towards the end of the blanket can be attributed to a cross-country trip the family took to celebrate the baby’s birthday.

Others, like the art in \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/16/17959372/simon-stalenhag-whats-in-your-bag-sci-fi-art\"\u003eSimon Stålenhag\u003c/a\u003e’s \u003cem\u003eTales from the Loop\u003c/em\u003e or the film \u003cem\u003eIt Follows\u003c/em\u003e, play on this nostalgia to twist it into something else. \u003cem\u003e198X\u003c/em\u003e is more the latter than the former.

Kid sees themselves as something of an outcast, and somewhat stuck and purposeless at this point in their life. It is then that they stumble on an arcade in the basement of an abandoned factory that is full of the coolest of the uncool: Geeks, nerds, skids, wannabe rappers, and burnouts. The games there become a form of escapism for Kid, a way to immerse themselves in something where they don’t feel so trapped in their life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"98YT7p\"\u003eThe story is conveyed in gorgeous pixel art vignettes of Kid’s life at home, at school, and walking around Suburbia. The pixel art used in these scenes doesn’t look like what games looked like in the ‘80s, but rather matches more with the animation of the attract screens an arcade machine would show to entice someone to come play it. These scenes are narrated by Kid as they try to explain their world view and express their feelings as best a teenager can. The voice acting and writing both perfectly walk the line of a disaffected philosophical teen without it becoming too much of an annoying shtick or making them feel like a 1980s edgelord. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"KFBFxe\"\u003eBetween these story scenes are the times when you, as Kid, play various games in the basement arcade. None of these are real games, but they are all homages to classics like \u003cem\u003eStreets of Rage\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eOutrun\u003c/em\u003e, and \u003cem\u003eR-Type\u003c/em\u003e. Much like the pixel art of the vignettes, the art and animation in these games is phenomenal. There’s a higher fidelity to the art and animation then actual ‘80s arcade games, though it isn’t jarringly obvious. The games look the way you remember them, not the way they really were.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IaT36BT956sBjnRK_x6ITO30LCY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18313876/198X_Beat.jpg\"\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"on1VOP\"\u003eWhat’s particularly interesting about these games is how they are deployed narratively. They work thematically to bridge the story between the non-interactive scenes. Going into each game, you have a sense of why Kid chose to play \u003cem\u003ethis\u003c/em\u003e game at this particular moment, and beating a game sets the tone for the scene to follow. It’s this aspect of \u003cem\u003e198X\u003c/em\u003e that I find utterly fascinating, because it has you engaged and immersed with these games in just the same way that Kid is. It uses them as a way to connect you to this character interactively through a shared experience, even if you didn’t grow up in the ‘80s, which in turn makes it easier to sympathize with Kid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"QDMBci\"\u003eIt almost feels like it shouldn’t work, that there should be more dissonance between the moments when it jumps from watching the story unfold for Kid to when you are playing these arcade games. Nothing in their life lines up with them beating up street thugs or blasting away space aliens in asteroid fields. And yet it works. I think much of that is because the games thematically fit into the narrative, but also that the games themselves are actually fun and fairly challenging. Not so hard as to be frustrating (thanks in part to Kid’s seemingly infinite number of quarters), but just enough that an average player will need to focus their attention. And however long or short it takes to finish them, or whatever the outcome, it further informs your understanding of Kid and immerses you in how they feel when playing these games.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IVrA975g16fR9DvGmLV0W-iWOIs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18313877/198X_Racing.jpg\"\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"S8pbc3\"\u003eThere are many video games that have taken storytelling techniques from other mediums, \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/27/17386550/thirty-flights-of-loving-gravity-bone-short-play\"\u003eespecially film\u003c/a\u003e, so I found it surprising as I made my way through \u003cem\u003e198X\u003c/em\u003e that it’s more of a movie than a game. \u003cem\u003e198X \u003c/em\u003efinds a way to add interactivity to a linear narrative, interactivity that not only helps the audience better understand the story and characters, but also creates a meaningful difference in the experience between someone playing it versus watching it.

For this guide, \u003ca href=\"https://www.elgato.com/en/video-capture\"\u003eI used Elgato’s Video Capture\u003c/a\u003e, which costs around $80, not the cheapest option. I chose it because I’ve enjoyed using the company’s game capture hardware in the past, and this model has good reviews on Amazon from people who praise its easy setup, good build quality, and solid software.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli id=\"sZR2K8\"\u003eA computer with an available USB port\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"0FxZbT\"\u003eKeep in mind that each digitizer has its own requirements. To use Elgato’s converter and its companion application, you’ll need a device running at least Mac OS X 10.6.8 or Windows 7. (Since you most likely own something more modern, don’t sweat it.) \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli id=\"Fx7z7S\"\u003eSeveral hours to spare (fewer depending on how many tapes you want to convert)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"Tjdb0I\"\u003ePrepare to digitize your VHS tapes\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"GbKMTZ\"\u003eOnce you have all of those things, it’s time to start getting things connected. The first step is to make sure that you download and install the converter’s software to your computer. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"p6JJVY\"\u003eAfter that, connect your computer to your VCR using the USB video converter. Most consumer USB-based digitizers have a similar selection of plugs on one end to use with the VCR; a set of composite (red, white, yellow) cables and S-Video. If your VCR has an S-Video port, it’s a good idea to opt for that instead of the yellow composite jack for better video quality in the conversion process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"SIjELg\"\u003eElgato’s software was simple to use. Its interface walked me through naming the file, and ensuring that the video and audio feeds were coming through correctly before I started the converting process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"i1gcgk\"\u003eStart the process\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"568nhH\"\u003eUp until this point, the instructions have been specific to Elgato’s converter. The rest of the process should be the same no matter what converter you use. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"19ojSK\"\u003eRewind the VHS tape to where you’d like to start the converting process to begin, then hit record. The conversion process runs in real-time, so you can leave and do something else while you wait for the tape to reach its end. Personally, I’d recommend watching it to make sure that the tracking and audio don’t mess up during converting. If you don’t remember what tracking is, or weren’t alive during the VHS heyday, some VCRs allow you to adjust the tracking (in other words, the calibration) of a tape during playback to fix a wobbly, unclear picture.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bSOounP_L1YtptniXB3eYAz-d_w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18322140/elgatovideocapture.jpg\"\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003eYou can, and probably should, trim your video file once it converts.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"5HIDZk\"\u003eIt might be tempting, once the conversion is finished, to leave the file as it is. But it might be better to do a bit of trimming. (For example, giving someone a tape of their actual birth could be, well, uncomfortable.) Elgato’s converter software lets you trim the video to your liking. When you’re finished, it automatically exports an .MP4 video file to your movie folder. It also allows you to upload it directly to YouTube, or export it to the QuickTime Player or iTunes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ap0u9I\"\u003eAfter that, you’re all done. You have the peace of mind knowing that your family videos are now safely stored on your computer. It’s worth noting that you should make a backup of these converted files — either to an external drive or \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/31/17796884/cloud-storage-service-google-drive-apple-icloud-microsoft-onedrive-dropbox-box-amazon\"\u003eto a cloud service\u003c/a\u003e —so that they don’t get deleted by accident, or disappear in an unfortunate hard drive crash. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"u5G4cu\"\u003e\u003csmall\u003e\u003cem\u003eVox Media has affiliate partnerships.

What does it look like, how would it work, and how would it change our society? Irrelevant!

Savage and Nancy Scola exemplifies the mix of maximum alarm and minimum meaning that’s become so typical in our national (and nationalist) discussion around artificial intelligence. “Is America ceding the future of AI to China?” the article asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’re meant to take this possibility as not only very real but as an unquestionably bad thing. One only needs to tell the public that the country risks “ceding” control of something — literally anything — to the great foreign unknown for our national eyes to grow wide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The last time a rival power tried to out-innovate the U.S. and marshaled a whole-of-government approach to doing it, the Soviet Union startled Americans by deploying the first man-made satellite into orbit,” the article says. “The Sputnik surprise in 1957 shook American confidence, galvanized its government and set off a space race culminating with the creation of NASA and the moon landing 50 years ago this month.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur new national dread, the article continues, is “whether another Sputnik moment is around the corner” — in the form of an AI-breakthrough from the keyboards of Red China instead of Palo Alto.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForget that Sputnik was \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/06/science/sputnik-launch-cia.html\"\u003enot actually a “surprise”\u003c/a\u003e for the powers that be, or that Sputnik itself was basically a beeping aluminum beach ball — “barely more than a radio transmitter with batteries,” the magazine Air \u0026amp; Space once \u003ca href=\"https://www.airspacemag.com/space/60-years-sputnik-180965102/\"\u003esaid\u003c/a\u003e. There’s a bigger problem here: Framing the Cold War as a battle of innovators conveniently avoids mentioning that the chief innovation in question wasn’t Sputnik or the Space Shuttle or any peacetime venture, but the creation of an arsenal for instant global nuclear holocaust at the press of a button.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSure, yes, it’s doubtful we could have “marshaled a whole-of-government approach” to space travel without having first “marshaled a whole-of-government approach” to rocket-borne atomic genocide, but to highlight the eventual accomplishments of NASA without acknowledging that it entailed a very close dance with a worldwide apocalypse is ahistoric and absurd. To use this comparison to goad us into another nationalist tech race with a global military power is outright dangerous — if only because the victory remains completely undefined. How would we “beat” China, exactly? Beat them at what, exactly? Which specific problems do we hope to use AI to fix? At a point in history when cities are beginning to scrutinize and outright ban “AI” technologies like \u003ca href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Oakland-bans-use-of-facial-recognition-14101253.php\"\u003efacial recognition\u003c/a\u003e, are we sure the fixes aren\u0026#8217;t even worse than the problems? Nationalists caught in an arms race have no time to answer questions like these or any others; they’ve got a race to win!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll anyone can manage to do is bark that we need more, more, more AI, more investments, more R\u0026amp;D, more collaborations, more ventures, more breakthroughs, simply more AI. Maybe we’ll worry about what we needed all of this for in the first place once we’ve beaten China there. Or maybe an algorithm will explain it to us, along with the locations of all our family members and a corresponding score that quantifies their social utility and biometric trustworthiness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cu\u003eThe Politico piece\u003c/u\u003e is full of worried voices cautioning that we can’t let Americans fall behind in the global invasive-surveillance race, completely unable to explain why this would be a bad thing. “The city of Tianjin alone plans to spend $16 billion on AI — and the U.S. government investment still totals several billion and counting,” despairs Elsa Kania of the technology and national security program at the Center for a New American Security. “That’s still lower by an order of magnitude.” Amy Webb, a New York University business school professor, told Politico, “We are being outspent. We are being out-researched. We are being outpaced. We are being out-staffed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, it’s not just these researchers, nor is it just Politico: The necessity of absolute American dominance in an extremely unpredictable, deeply hazardous, and altogether hard to comprehend field has made the great leap from think-tank anxiety nightmare to political talking point.

Ou alguém ainda tem dúvidas de que nos tornamos uma república de bananas?

The scandal became even more serious when Queiroz\u0026#8217;s substantial connections to the country\u0026#8217;s most violent and dangerous para-military gangs were revealed, and even worse, when it was revealed that Flávio himself \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/03/18/jair-bolsonaro-family-militias-gangs-brazil/\"\u003eemployed in his cabinet\u003c/a\u003e while he was a state representative both the mother and wife of one of Rio de Janeiro\u0026#8217;s most wanted para-military leaders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"promote-embed\" data-promo=\"secret-brazil-archive\" data-crop=\"promo\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat meant that the cloud of scandal around Jair Bolsonaro\u0026#8217;s son, a newly elected Senator, was not just about allegations of \u0026#8220;mere\u0026#8221; stealing of public funds. Instead, it suggested something much darker: deep links between the Bolsonaro family and the organized crime rings that rule and terrorize much of Brazil (and which Sergio Moro was purportedly appointed to combat).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn today\u0026#8217;s new secret chats reported by the Intercept, federal prosecutors, while talking in secret to one another after Bolsonaro\u0026#8217;s victory, are emphatic that these unexplained deposits by Flávio\u0026#8217;s driver perfectly match other corruption schemes they prosecuted in which political officials hire \u0026#8220;phantom employees\u0026#8221; who do no work, but collect their salary and then pay back the vast bulk of that money to the political official for his own personal enrichment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite how clear-cut these prosecutors believe Flávio\u0026#8217;s corruption to be, they expressed in these newly published chats deep worry that, while the investigation of the money movements is in the hands of local investigators, the broader and more serious allegations against Flávio might not be investigated because Justice Minister Moro is concerned about angering President Bolsonaro. This is considered likely not only because the corruption case has the President\u0026#8217;s son as its prime target but also because it already involves his own wife and could — given his long-time close friendship with Queiroz — end up implicating the President himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven more stunning in these chats is that Moro\u0026#8217;s most loyal defender and ally over the last five years, the chief Car Wash prosecutor Deltan Dallagnol, himself expressed concerns that Moro would refuse to pursue an investigation of Flávio out of fear that it would jeopardize Moro\u0026#8217;s own chance to be named to the Supreme Court. In May, Bolsonaro surprised the nation when \u003ca href=\"https://g1.globo.com/politica/noticia/2019/05/12/bolsonaro-diz-que-vai-indicar-sergio-moro-para-vaga-no-stf.ghtml\"\u003ehe admitted that\u003c/a\u003e he had promised Moro — who, as a judge, was responsible for removing Bolsonaro\u0026#8217;s primary adversary (Lula) by finding him guilty on corruption charges — not only his current position as the nation\u0026#8217;s Justice Minister but also the next vacancy on the Supreme Court, a life-time appointment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo this day, consistent with Dallagnol\u0026#8217;s predictions, there is no evidence that Moro — who at the time of these private chats had already left his position as judge and accepted Bolsonaro\u0026#8217;s offer to take over the Ministry of Justice — has taken any measures to investigate the scheme of \u0026#8220;phantom employees\u0026#8221; that Flávio is accused of maintaining, nor, more importantly, Flávio\u0026#8217;s connections with powerful militias in Rio de Janeiro.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe corruption scandal involving Flávio, which had been dominating the headlines, had virtually disappeared from media coverage in recent months due to apparent inaction. The investigation regarding the \u0026#8220;unusual movement\u0026#8221; of funds is now in the hands of the local Rio de Janeiro prosecutor, and appears to have entered a much slower-than-expected pace for a case of this seriousness. Moro, meanwhile, has given no indication of investigating the federal ramifications of the case, such as Queiroz\u0026#8217;s alleged loan to First Lady Michelle Bolsonaro or his ties to militias.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the few occasions Moro answered questions from the media about the Senator-son of the president, he has repeated that \u0026#8220;there is nothing conclusive about the Queiroz case\u0026#8221; and that the government does not intend to interfere with the work of the prosecutors. The case returned to the news only this week when, on Monday, July 15, Supreme Court President Dias Toffoli responded to Flávio Bolsonaro\u0026#8217;s request to \u003ca href=\"https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/internacional/en/brazil/2019/07/brazils-supreme-court-president-suspends-investigations-into-bolsonaros-son-flavio.shtml\"\u003esuspend investigations\u003c/a\u003e into his personal finances and those of his associates; the judge accepted the request by ruling as improper investigations initiated without judicial approval involving the use of financial information from the the agency that monitors politicians\u0026#8217; financial transactions: the agency whose reporting of suspicious deposits from Queiroz triggered the Flávio scandal in the first place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn December 8, 2018 — just five weeks after Bolsonaro\u0026#8217;s victory but three weeks before he was inaugurated — Dallagnol initiated the discussion of these concerns regarding Moro with a message posted in a Telegram chat group composed of other Car Wash prosecutors.

to his position or, even more delicate, how to investigate corruption that could involve the President himself and his wife — caused Dallagnol himself to consider avoiding all interviews about corruption debates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the same day that his group discussed Moro\u0026#8217;s posture in the Queiroz and Flávio case, Dallagnol used a private chat to discuss the same topic with another Car Wash prosecutor, Roberson Pozzobon. In that conversation, Dallagnol expressed deep concerns about granting media interviews about corruption issues given the possibility that questions about Flávio Bolsonaro might be raised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn stark contrast to his usual eagerness to speak publicly about other cases of corruption — Dellagnol had famously used the media far more aggressively than is typical for prosecutors — he suggested that he was now reluctant to issue a more severe condemnation of Flávio for fear of the political consequences of displeasing the new President, motives similar to the ones he had, just hours earlier on that day, accusatorily suggested could cause Moro not to investigate Flávio.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv

The prosecutor was excited to be interviewed to the extent the questions focused on the case the program\u0026#8217;s produces had specified: namely, corruption allegations against federal Congressman Paulo Pimenta, a member of the center-left Workers Party, the same party as Lula\u0026#8217;s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDallagnol was particularly happy to speak critically about the Workers Party Congressman\u0026#8217;s invocation of a special legal \u0026#8220;privilege\u0026#8221; that has effectively shielded many lawmakers from investigation because it stipulates that federal lawmakers can be tried on criminal charges only by the Supreme Court. The law in question was enacted upon Brazil\u0026#8217;s re-democratization as a protection against dictatorship-era abuses in which military regime leaders would simply concoct corruption charges against dissident Congress members and remove them from office; however, the sheer number of corruption cases pending against Congress members has produced a huge backlog in the Supreme Court, thus meaning that lawmakers who invoke this right have a high likelihood that their cases will never be brought to justice, or at least not for many years. In the past, Car Wash prosecutors were never shy about forcefully denouncing the invocation of this Congressional privilege when it came to other politicians charged with corruption.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut in the case of this Fantastico interview, Dallagnol, who has been severely critical of lawmakers who invoke this right, was suddenly reluctant to accept the invitation to speak on such an important national media stage due to his fear that he would have to talk not only about the Workers Party but also about Bolsonaro\u0026#8217;s son, Flávio, who had invoked the same privilege in an attempt — ultimately unsuccessful — to shield himself from investigation. Indeed, Flávio\u0026#8217;s invocation of this privilege — preserved for federal lawmakers — was far more dubious than the Congress members whom the Car Wash prosecutors had previously criticized, because the corrupt acts of which Flávio is accused occurred prior to his being elected a federal Senator. If any case of a politician abusing this privilege merited condemnation by the anti-corruption crusaders, it would be Flávio\u0026#8217;s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut in this private chat about the TV offer, Dallagnol expressed his reluctance to speak about the case involving Flávio, calculating that the risks of having to discuss the case were greater than the eventual benefits of the investigation: \u0026#8220;I don\u0026#8217;t see that we have anything to gain because this question [of the privilege] is already settled.\u0026#8221; His Car Wash colleagues agreed that while an interview about the Workers Party case would present no problem, the best option was to reject Fantastico\u0026#8217;s invitation in order to avoid what they described, invoking soccer imagery, as a \u0026#8220;divided ball\u0026#8221;\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003earound Flávio Bolsonaro (the Globo news program declined to comment on this story).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv

series titled the Secret Brazil Archive (in Brazil, the scandal has become widely known by the Twitter hashtag the Intercept Brasil coined on the day of the first series of articles: #VazaJato: a play on the word \u0026#8220;leak\u0026#8221; in Portuguese (\u0026#8220;vazamento\u0026#8221;) and the name of the Car Wash investigation, Lava Jato).

This chat was prompted by Dallagnol\u0026#8217;s finally making a public statement about the corruption allegations against Flávio Bolsonaro. He did so in response to pressure and questions from Intercept reporter (now Intercept editor) Rafael Moro Martins, who pressed the task force on why they had said nothing about Flávio\u0026#8217;s case even though they had often publicly expressed views on similar corruption cases by other politicians.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"shortcode\" data-shortcode=\"newsletter\" data-campaign=\"\" data-cta=\"\" data-headline=\"\" data-layout=\"\" data-subhead=\"\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter Dallagnol posted a public statement about the Flávio case in response to the Intercept\u0026#8217;s pressure, his press aide, in a private chat, praised him for doing so, writing to him: \u0026#8220;this reinforces our non-partisanship.\u0026#8221; After praising Dallagnol\u0026#8217;s denunciation of Flávio, the press advisor then criticized Moro\u0026#8217;s far less assertive statements whenever the Justice Minister was asked about Flávio\u0026#8217;s scandal involving Queiroz: “they say his comments on Queiroz were very \u0026#8216;neutral,\u0026#8217; that they had no firmness, you know?

In response, Moro generally claims that he has no control over the Federal Police, even though it reports to him, because, he says, they maintain investigative autonomy.

convite por receio de que tivesse que falar também das tentativas de Flávio Bolsonaro de usar o foro privilegiado para barrar as investigações, mesmo que o caso tenha ocorrido quando ainda era

assessores de imprensa de Dallagnol, num grupo de chat privado entre o procurador e os profissionais, trataram de uma solicitação enviada pelo então repórter do Intercept Rafael Moro Martins (hoje editor em Brasília), que cobrava um posicionamento oficial de Dallagnol sobre o caso envolvendo Flávio Bolsonaro e Queiroz. Na mensagem, o repórter observou que o procurador vinha sendo “ativo nas redes sociais em assuntos que não dizem respeito à atuação da FT e do MPF.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDallagnol comentou as repetidas cobranças nas redes sociais por um posicionamento mais contundente sobre o caso Queiroz: “vi mta cobança na rede social, mas achava que eram mais robos”. Sua assessoria, no entanto, disse que a cobrança era orgânica e previsível: “era previsível, sim”, “essa cobnrança não é só de robôs”, “os jornalistas tb estão atentos”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFoi então que a assessoria elogiou Dallagnol por seu posicionamento firme em relação ao caso de Flávio. \u0026#8220;isso reforça o apartidarismo\u0026#8221;, escreveu um assessor em um chat. O assessor também criticou a posição de Moro: “saem contar que a fala de Moro sobre Queiroz foi muito \u0026#8216;neutra\u0026#8217;. não teve firmeza, sabe? para muita gente, pareceu que Moro quis sair pela tangente”. Ele, a assessoria disse, \u0026#8220;ficou em cima do muro\u0026#8221;.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA preocupação do assessor de Dallagnol sobre as motivações de Moro no caso envolvendo Flávio foi enviada no chat em janeiro, pouco mais de um mês depois do próprio procurador debater o caso com os colegas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo chat, Dallagnol não disse nada em resposta às críticas e à aparente disposição de Moro – famoso por sua severidade contra corrupção – de proteger Flávio. Essa conversa, entretanto, ocorreu cerca de dois meses depois que o coordenador da força-tarefa da Lava Jato, \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/06/29/chats-violacoes-moro-credibilidade-bolsonaro/\"\u003ecomo demonstrado previamente pelo Intercept\u003c/a\u003e, ter dito à procuradora Janice Ascari, num chat privado: \u0026#8220;sobre a saída do Moro pro MJ, mas temos uma preocupação sobre alegações de parcialidade que virão . . . tenho medo do corpo que isso possa tomar na opiniã pública.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoro já foi questionado diversas vezes sobre sua aparente apatia diante não somente da investigação sobre a corrupção de Flávio, mas também de outros escândalos envolvendo o governo Bolsonaro, como as denúncias de que o PSL teria utilizado um esquema de laranjas nas eleições de 2018. Quando perguntado, Moro em geral alega não ter controle sobre a Polícia Federal, como fez novamente \u003ca href=\"https://www.correiobraziliense.com.br/app/noticia/politica/2019/07/07/interna_politica,768776/falsos-escandalos-nao-me-farao-desistir-diz-sergio-moro-ao-correio.shtml\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eem entrevista concedida ao Correio Brasiliense\u003c/a\u003e no começo de julho: “A PF está apurando os fatos e deve chegar a conclusões. E à medida que estão sendo feitas as diligências, (elas) estão sendo informadas ao presidente”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA afirmação de Moro de que ele não tem controle sobre a Polícia Federal – em resposta às críticas de que ele protegeu Bolsonaro e PSL – deveria ser vista com muito ceticismo.

The U.S. reimposed the sanctions that had hobbled the Iranian economy and has been pressuring European allies to respect the sanctions and curtail their trade with Iran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIran\u0026rsquo;s Revolutionary Guards said on Saturday that the ship entered the strait from the wrong direction, wasn\u0026rsquo;t paying heed to maritime regulations and could potentially have collided with other vessels. State television said the ship will be held until judicial assessments are complete.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStena Bulk, the ship\u0026rsquo;s owner, said on Sunday that a request to the authorities at the port of Bandar Abbas \u0026#8212; where the vessel is anchored \u0026#8212; to visit the 23 crew members had been acknowledged. The company hasn\u0026rsquo;t yet received a formal response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe firm said on Saturday it had been told that the crew members are in good health. It has been given no instructions about the fate of the ship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIran has also suggested its actions are in retaliation for the British seizure of the Grace 1 tanker off Gibraltar. A court in Gibraltar ordered the continued detention of the vessel for another 30 days, after it was held on suspicion of taking oil to Syria. Iran denies that was the destination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn recent weeks the U.K. Navy has escorted some tankers out of the region, while the U.S. said it downed an Iranian drone just days ago. The latest incident cooled hopes that the U.S. and Iran would soothe tensions by entering into negotiations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Washington, Trump said he will be \u0026ldquo;working with the U.K.\u0026rdquo; and suggested the latest developments justify his harsher approach toward Tehran. \u0026ldquo;This only goes to show what I\u0026rsquo;m saying about Iran: trouble, nothing but trouble.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/time/world/~4/-A_5W8HMhK0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/world/~3/-A_5W8HMhK0/","published":"2019-07-21T16:33:32Z","guid":"http://time.com/?p=5631169"}]},{"url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/latest/rss/world","items":[{"title":"North Carolina woman and Australian man found dead in Canada","content":"","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/chynna-deese-lucas-fowler-dead-north-carolina-woman-and-australian-man-found-dead-in-canada/","published":"2019-07-21T00:47:42Z","guid":"1d6213cf-5a17-40dd-8010-2c0738adef76"},{"title":"Crew heads to International Space Station on Apollo 11 anniversary","content":"","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/apollo-11-anniversary-sees-nasa-astronaut-aboard-russian-rocket-today-2019-07-20/","published":"2019-07-21T00:30:26Z","guid":"2825cccf-839c-460f-b01c-c8c9a1bcef63"},{"title":"Nature: Cuba's Isle of Youth","content":"","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/video/nature-cubas-isle-of-youth/","published":"2019-07-21T14:45:18Z","guid":"52a7eb48-655d-4f93-8a7d-bfc7fb4840ee"}]},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/worldnews/feed","items":[{"title":"Who is Michael Collins and did the Apollo 11 astronaut walk on the moon?","content":"\u003cp\u003eYESTERDAY was 50 years since the Apollo 11 mission, when three brave astronauts flew to the moon \u0026#8211; Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut who was the least famous of the trio, and did he walk on the moon?

Number of Requests for Adoption of Children in Iran’","content":"\u003cp\u003eMontazer Shabar says the high number of requests has prolonged the process of adoption.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe development comes after single women over 30 years of age were authorized to adopt children.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Under the Adoption Law approved in 1974, single individuals were not permitted to adopt a child; the law was amended in 2013 whereby single women were allowed to adopt children, which has increased the number of requests for adoption,” said Shabar, the director general of the Office for Children and Young Adults of the Iranian Rehabilitation Organization.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Single men are still an exception to the rule,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“According to the law, single women can only assume the guardianship of girls, and not boys,” he added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Single men can adopt neither girls nor boys,” said the official.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said single women over 30 years old are eligible to adopt children.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe official underlined that there are no legal restrictions in that regard for women who get married after adopting a child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“However, one should note that there are priorities when it comes to adoption, and families who can never have children take precedence over single ladies,” he added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe official said in addition to the minimum age limit, single women demanding to adopt a child should be in good physical and mental condition, should be able to afford to adopt a child, and should have a clean criminal record as well as a clean record with regards to social maladies.\u003cbr /\u003e\n“The Rehabilitation Organization’s regulations on granting guardianship are not strict; moreover, our criterion is, by no means, how well-off families are. What is important for adopting a child is the economic situation of the applicant family. The family should be able to afford to provide the necessities of themselves and those of the child, and should be healthy enough in order to take care of a child,” he
