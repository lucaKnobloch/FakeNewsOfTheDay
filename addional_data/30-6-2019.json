During the month, the list increased by three to 76 institutions after a removal and three additions.  Assets changed by a nominal $322 million to $55 billion.  A year ago, the list held 92 institutions with assets of $60 billion.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThis month, the action against First Southern Bank (f/k/a The Patterson Bank), Patterson, GA ($123 million) was terminated.  Additions this month included The Farmers Bank, Carnegie, OK ($121 million); Home Bank of Arkansas, Portland, AR ($76 million); and State Bank, Green River, WY ($29 million).  Also, thanks to a reader that identified an institution not included within the list – CornerstoneBank, Atlanta, GA ($219 million), that has been operating under a Consent Order since 2012.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWith the conclusion of the second quarter, we bring an updated transition matrix to detail how banks are transitioning off the Unofficial Problem Bank List.  Since the Unofficial Problem Bank List was first published on August 7, 2009 with 389 institutions, 1,747 institutions have appeared on a weekly or monthly list since the start of publication.  Only 4.2 percent of the banks that have appeared on a list remain today as 1,671 institutions have transitioned through the list.  Departure methods include 984 action terminations, 406 failures, 262 mergers, and 19 voluntary liquidations.  Of the 389 institutions on the first published list, only 6 or 1.5 percent, are still designated as being in a troubled status more than nine years later.  The 406 failures represent 23.3 percent of the 1,747 institutions that have made an appearance on the list.  This failure rate is well above the 10-12 percent rate frequently cited in media reports on the failure rate of banks on the FDIC's official list.\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003ccenter\u003e\u003ctable border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" style=\"width: 550px;\"\u003e\u003ccolgroup align=\"center\"\u003e\u003c/colgroup\u003e\u003ccolgroup align=\"center\"\u003e\u003c/colgroup\u003e\u003ccolgroup align=\"center\"\u003e\u003c/colgroup\u003e\u003ccolgroup align=\"center\"\u003e\u003c/colgroup\u003e\u003ctbody\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003cth colspan=\"4\"\u003eUnofficial Problem Bank List\u003c/th\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003cth colspan=\"4\"\u003eChange Summary\u003c/th\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd colspan=\"2\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;

Petronzio turns to smokier Islay Scotches to pair with U.S. East Coast oysters and their saltier flavor profile but will often look inland to Speyside or the Highlands--Glenmorangie Nectar d'Or and Dalwhinnie are favorites--to complement the subtler fruity and vegetal notes associated with West Coast oysters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor O'Reilly, it's tough to beat a smoky 10-year-old Ardbeg whisky with a good, briny East Coast oyster like a Pemaquid from Maine, though he'll look as far away as Ireland for an unpeated Teeling Small Batch as well if the oyster (or consumer) requires something unpeated.

The second season of Kansas City starts Season 4. It\u0026#8217;s confusing because we also have Japan season. (It\u0026#8217;s not really a season, but it kind of is.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0026#8217;re going to be starting in Philly very soon, and it\u0026#8217;s just going to be great to be back with the boys and doing the thing that we love to do, and just meeting new people. I love meeting people. I\u0026#8217;m such a people-person, and getting to know their stories, getting as much information as I can, and then figuring out, \"Okay, I have a limited amount of time with you, and what are we going to do that I hope you\u0026#8217;re going to remember for the rest of your life? No pressure!\" But that\u0026#8217;s always a fun, stressful, but emotional and exciting challenge. And it\u0026#8217;s different every single time because every person is different in their own way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think with everybody, it\u0026#8217;s just being excited about the individual. I had never been in Tokyo before. I had never been to Missouri before. I\u0026#8217;d been to Philly a few times, but really for weekends with friends and just have dinner at their homes. I don\u0026#8217;t know too much about the city. I like that it\u0026#8217;s close to New York. So it is going to be really nice because I\u0026#8217;m hoping to sleep in my own bed. I\u0026#8217;ve had an apartment for seven months, and I\u0026#8217;ve slept like a month-and-a-half in it! So, selfishly, that\u0026#8217;s very exciting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut also, multiculturalism means something different wherever you are. And it exists in Kansas City as much as it does in New York. There may be more diversity in New York. Even statistically--it\u0026#8217;s not even a subjective thing. But I\u0026#8217;m always curious to see what does that mean here. With a city as historical as Philadelphia, it feels very old-world America, with the cobblestoned streets and the architecture. I want to see like, \"What\u0026#8217;s the immigrant story there?\" Like who immigrated there, and when. Who stayed, and which food stayed? And that\u0026#8217;s something that\u0026#8217;s so fascinating to me because I think it feels so much of how we behave and the type of people we\u0026#8217;ve become, the people that we\u0026#8217;re surrounded by, even if they\u0026#8217;re a different culture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow did you get involved with Saeco? What is your thought process about which brand collaborations and sponsored ads you should run? Have you ever turned down sponsored content? If so, why?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn\u0026#8217;t take too much investigative journalism to find out that I\u0026#8217;m obsessed with coffee. I mention it in almost every single interview that we\u0026#8217;ve been in. I talk about it, ad nauseam. I post it on Instagram Stories, supporting all kinds of different coffee from like the big guys to the smaller little roasteries. Whoever it is. I just frickin\u0026#8217; love coffee. It brings me so much joy. One of my favorite writers and poets and musicians--like Patti Smith talks about her cup of black coffee. \u003cem\u003eCoffee and Cigarettes\u003c/em\u003e is one of my favorite little vignette films of all time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo when the team at Saeco came up, we just started having a conversation and trying to figure out like how are we going to develop meaningful content. I think we were on the same page from the get-go: It has to be personal. They didn\u0026#8217;t come with guidelines like, \"So this is what we want you to do.\" It was a very open-ended question: Tell us about coffee in your life. And it feels like that\u0026#8217;s so general.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then when I started thinking about it, and I started breaking it down, I was like, \"Oh, I get what you\u0026#8217;re saying.\" It literally wakes me up in the morning. It gets me going. It allows me to function in front of other people because I work a lot. But also, it\u0026#8217;s my way of having a little moment of self-care on a Saturday, when I want to take the time and adjust it, and customize it, and make my beautiful cappuccino with the foam that reminds of the way that it was in Italy when I was there. And at night, if I\u0026#8217;m making an espresso glaze for my braised beef short ribs, it\u0026#8217;s there for me. It\u0026#8217;s like my best freakin\u0026#8217; friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I just love the ritual of it. I love the smell. There are two different smells that come out of this machine. That\u0026#8217;s a weird sentence. One is when the coffee, when the espresso beans are being ground. There\u0026#8217;s this freshness of it. And then there\u0026#8217;s a second whenever it\u0026#8217;s brewing, and it comes out. Then there\u0026#8217;s just that light purring-kitten sound, when the machine gets activated, that\u0026#8217;s very sensory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"inline-image-default-width alignnone\"  \u003e\u003ca href=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/saeco_coffee.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg data-attachment-id=\"2656491\" data-permalink=\"http://fortune.com/2019/06/30/queer-eye-antoni-porowski-netflix/saeco_coffee/\" data-orig-file=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/saeco_coffee.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"3556,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{\u0026quot;aperture\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;2\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;credit\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;camera\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;NIKON D800\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;created_timestamp\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;1493723759\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;copyright\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;focal_length\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;35\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;iso\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;80\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;shutter_speed\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0.005\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;title\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;orientation\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;1\u0026quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Saeco_coffee\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/saeco_coffee.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/saeco_coffee.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-2656491\" src=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/saeco_coffee.jpg?w=1024\u0026#038;h=576\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/saeco_coffee.jpg?w=1024\u0026amp;h=576 1024w, https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/saeco_coffee.jpg?w=2048\u0026amp;h=1152 2048w, https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/saeco_coffee.jpg?w=150\u0026amp;h=84 150w, https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/saeco_coffee.jpg?w=300\u0026amp;h=169 300w, https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/saeco_coffee.jpg?w=768\u0026amp;h=432 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"image-caption\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"credit\"\u003eSaeco\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow is the restaurant business treating you? What advice would you give to other culinary entrepreneurs looking to open their own restaurants and small businesses?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#8217;s doing great. I had no idea how powerful catering is. And at first I was like, \"No, I want single plates.\" But businesses love to have fresh food. But they don\u0026#8217;t have the premises or basically the setup to create their own food, and they want to have things catered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo that\u0026#8217;s been amazing. We\u0026#8217;ve been doing delivery for SNL to Instagram. It's a really fun part of the business because it\u0026#8217;s self-sufficient.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026#8217;m not there every day because I\u0026#8217;m traveling all the time, but food, obviously, is a super-important element, and the number one word for me is consistency. Every dish has to taste exactly the same every single time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf somebody comes in and gets that Thai chicken bowl, when they come back, I want them to have that experience re-created. Whatever it is. Whether it\u0026#8217;s their coffee drink, whether it\u0026#8217;s their smoothie. It has to be the same every time. And successful restaurants have mastered it, from Jean-Georges with ABC Kitchen to Mercer Kitchen. Like that tuna pizza and that spring roll have been exactly identical--every single time I go. They never waver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo that's my goal. And by being on Instagram, people always tag me when they\u0026#8217;re there with photos of the food. So when I don\u0026#8217;t see micro-cilantro and crushed peanuts on my Thai chicken bowl, I text my business partners right away, and be like, \"Guys, let\u0026#8217;s do better. Please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor entrepreneurs, just make sure that you have consistency and know what your strong suits are. And just make sure that it\u0026#8217;s done the same every single time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does social media play into all of your different projects and businesses?

But with some things, I think it\u0026#8217;s as important as it is to be creative and to plant seeds for birth and growth. It\u0026#8217;s very important to be perceptive and to know when to be reactive and to respond to something that\u0026#8217;s already there. Whether you love it or you hate it, Instagram is there for now. So let\u0026#8217;s use it as a tool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd in the position that I\u0026#8217;m in, everyone\u0026#8217;s following what I do organically, and it\u0026#8217;s bringing it back to your initial question of why it\u0026#8217;s important for me to collaborate with brands like Saeco. Like for me, I\u0026#8217;ve been familiar with the brand since I was a kid, and that was the brand that people had in their homes. It was very familiar to me. I didn\u0026#8217;t have a fantasy as a kid of representing an espresso machine brand company. But still, to be attached to something that you really love, even other brands, like Boursin cheese that I ate as a child, it makes me proud and excited to sort of like talk about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Instagram is a perfect medium where you get to express yourself in that way because not everyone does it. I know influencers and personalities have other people manage their accounts, and that\u0026#8217;s fine. Zero judgment. But I need to be fully in control because I know that fans of the show are smart. They know who we are. They know what\u0026#8217;s real and they know what\u0026#8217;s fake. And the stuff that I do that is most organic is the stuff that I get the best feedback from. On the show and with endorsements alike.

What should it entail, and how can the rest of us ever hope to achieve it?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbsolutely! I had the perfect dinner party about a week ago. There were two people that I\u0026#8217;d never met before, and one like a good acquaintance and one of my best friends. And I didn\u0026#8217;t know what the hell I was going to make!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes it's a mistake, but I made a dish that I had never prepared before, and thank goodness it was successful. But make something that you\u0026#8217;re comfortable with. The thing with me is when I cook on the show and when I\u0026#8217;m working on the cookbook, I make so much food. So when I go to someone\u0026#8217;s house, I always get uncomfortable when they\u0026#8217;re like, \"Oh, I didn\u0026#8217;t want to make anything for you because I\u0026#8217;m like afraid you\u0026#8217;re going to judge it.\" And it\u0026#8217;s like, \"If you make me burnt toast, with butter, I\u0026#8217;m going to be thrilled because I just know that you made it for me, and that brings me joy. Not too burnt, but medium-burned, you know?\" Just the thought, the effort that somebody puts into making something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can do simple things. I don\u0026#8217;t pay attention to tablescapes, but I love flowers. I live very close to the floral market. So I love my peonies and my parrot tulips, and just fill a vase up. Get some nice linens that you buy on sale somewhere, Williams-Sonoma or Ikea, or wherever it is. Get some cutlery on the nice little farm table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeep it simple, and always have a board when everyone comes in, so they have something to nosh on--whether it\u0026#8217;s charcuterie, cheese, or make a nice gooey cheese. Just have food, have alcohol. Play music, dim the lights. You don\u0026#8217;t need bright lights at dinner. I like it to be moody. Play some Miles Davis, and just do things that are important to you. Whenever I keep it specific to what my interests are, I get to create an experience for somebody. And people always leave remembering that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe joke with me is at my dinner parties, everyone\u0026#8217;s like, \u0026#8220;I\u0026#8217;m always passing out at the end of your dinner parties because I get drunk, and I fall, and the lights are always so dim.\u0026#8221; But that\u0026#8217;s exactly what I want! I want your tummy to hurt. Listen to good music. Be a little tipsy, so you take an Uber home. And be full.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat, for me, is the making of a perfect dinner party. Yes, there\u0026#8217;s a perfect way of roasting a chicken, filleting fish, of doing all these things. But it really doesn\u0026#8217;t have to be complicated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eMore must-read stories from \u003c/span\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eFortune\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003e:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003e--\u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/2019/06/23/big-gay-ice-cream-business-advice/\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eBig Gay Ice Cream cofounder\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003e on growing a small business from coast to coast\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003e--\u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/longform/israeli-bakery-new-york-les/\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eIsraeli pastries get a New York City makeover\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003e at this six-seat bakery\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003e--To combat food waste, these Brooklyn businesses teamed up to brew \u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/2019/06/01/bagel-beer-brooklyn-food-waste/\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003ebagel beer\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003e--One of Mexico City's hottest restaurant groups fuzes \u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/2019/06/29/mexico-city-cabo%E2%80%A6aurants-japanese/\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eMexican and Japanese influences\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003e--Listen to our new audio briefing, \u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/radio/\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eFortune\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003e 500 Daily\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://flipboard.com/@fortune\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eFollow \u003c/span\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eFortune\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003e on Flipboard\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eto stay up-to-date on the latest news and analysis.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"http://fortune.com/2019/06/30/queer-eye-antoni-porowski-netflix/","published":"2019-06-30T11:00:36Z","guid":"http://fortune.com/?p=2645637"},{"title":"Why Charleston’s Food Scene Is Stronger Than Ever Right Now","content":"\u003cp\u003eWhen a city falls for a chef's cooking, it's easy to forget the dining experience is a temporary sensation.

The summit, organized by the U.S. government and hosted by Bahrain's crown prince, showcased different voices with new ideas and the economic resources to bring to life dreams of progress in Palestine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver 300 top delegates came from 30 countries, from Australia and Argentina; Dubai and Delhi; Nigeria and Norway; and even such unlikely pairings as Saudi Arabia and Qatar or Greece and Turkey. The explicit purpose was to reverse the sequence of the past 50 years of peace efforts (e.g. Oslo, Paris, Annapolis) - that is, to share an economic vision before delving into divisive political real estate battles. (I served as a volunteer moderator at one panel during the summit.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhite House Senior Advisor Jared Kushner unveiled a $50 billion economic plan, one whose implementation would be predicated on a future political peace agreement. His plan gives the opposing parties a chance to visualize what the quality of life could be like when tensions subside. Drawing on the remarkable economic-development successes in other countries that have been torn by past political violence, including Bangladesh and South Korea, the proposal details highly specific uses of grants, low-interest loans, and private investment intended to double the size of the Palestinian economy, create one million new jobs, reduce Palestinian unemployment from 30% to single digits, and reduce Palestinian poverty by 50%.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoughly 190 specific projects in the Bahrain plan would aim to increase export revenue from 17% to 40% of Palestinian GDP; ensure reliable electricity; double the drinkable water supply; connect more schools to high-speed data services; increase women's participation in the work force; and generate a 500% increase in foreign direct investment. The plan would boost investment in key industries such as tourism, agriculture, digital services, housing, and manufacturing; it would also provide for infrastructure enhancements such as a $5 billion high-speed highway connecting Gaza to the West Bank. While many of these projects echo goals of earlier development plans from the World Bank and other organizations, this is the first plan that aims to comprehensively integrate these efforts--and to adequately fund them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eU.S. business leaders, including Blackstone Group CEO Stephen Schwarzman and \u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/att/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAT\u0026amp;T\u003c/a\u003e CEO Randall Stephenson, were present to give these plans their endorsement. They and dozens of other executives cited the proposals as attractive investment opportunities, with very reasonable financial targets, in an environment where the rule of law could help them thrive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hush fell over the Four Seasons banquet hall in Manama during Wednesday\u0026#8217;s closing panel, led by U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.

Hamas, which effectively rules the Gaza Strip, condemned it. And due to Israeli political turmoil, the administration of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not send a delegation. But if anything, this event demonstrated that \"absence makes the heart grow fonder.\" In the absence of Palestinian and Israeli politicians who have been frustrating each other for decades, and with no risk of the event being packaged as a campaign rally for Netanyahu, who faces upcoming elections, dialogue and comity could grow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo cynics, the absences provided ammunition to condemn the conference. Opponents allied with both the Palestinians and Israeli sides have argued that diplomatic agreements must precede economic ones. More specifically, many oppose the Bahrain approach because it doesn't provide for a so-called two-state solution that creates a sovereign Palestinian nation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJared Kushner addressed this mindset in his opening comments on Wednesday, saying, \"Enough of the old broken record\" of handwringing over how things cannot change. Schwarzman told the attendees that \"it is important to think big and to have a dream.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a discussion facilitator, I attended virtually every second of the formal and informal elements of this event. I did not hear even passing anti-Zionist comments, as much as I would have expected them in an atmosphere where Israel's historic critics outnumbered its allies. Instead, Arab leaders echoed comments like Kushner's and Schwarzman's. Negotiation experts talk of the importance of separating the emotions of people from the positions they take, and then separating divisive positions from issues where there may be common ground. The Bahrain summit seemed to accomplish that, and spirits soared over what was said and who said it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver many centuries, relations between Jews and Palestinians have fluctuated between long periods of violent conflict and peaceful coexistence. At this conference, prominent Palestinian business leader Ashraf Jabari, who heads a large clan in Hebron on the West Bank, explained how he has advanced bonds with Jewish settlers--even creating a business association for Palestinian and settlement businesses to work collaboratively. As he said on Wednesday, \"I have no problem working with Israel. It is time to move on.\" Smiling and nodding as he spoke were not only a dozen fellow Palestinian leaders but also the dozen Israeli business leaders present, including shipping magnate Shlomi Fogel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite the well air-conditioned ballroom, Jabari's brow glistened with sweat as he addressed the group. I went to shake his hand after he spoke and he gave me a bear hug. Since then, I've learned what he put at risk by being there and speaking out. Sadly, another member of the Palestinian delegation was arrested by the Palestinian Authority at a family event upon returning home; other delegation members saw their homes raided. \"The Palestinian Authority does not want peace. They told the families of the businessmen that they are wanted for participating in the Bahrain workshop,\" \u003ca href=\"https://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Palestinian-Authority-arrests-Hebron-businessman-who-attended-Bahrain-workshop-594084\"\u003eJabari told the \u003cem\u003eJerusalem Post\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e,\u003c/em\u003e adding that the workshop was \"a big success and that's why [PA President Mahmoud] Abbas is very worried.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eReviving hopes\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Bahrain summit's projection of a spirit of hope, from Palestinian and Israeli business leaders and their peers around the globe, provides \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/04/eight-steps-shrink-israeli-palestinian-conflict/585964/\"\u003ea welcome response to the growing dismay among younger people in the region\u003c/a\u003e--and a counter to growing cynicism about the failures of \u003ca href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/more-palestinians-begin-to-accept-idea-of-one-state-with-israel-11559991600\"\u003eIsraeli\u003c/a\u003e and Palestinian political leadership. Weary of decades of violence, younger people are demanding change and are open to direct appeal from their Arab neighbors. The plans discussed in Bahrain offer younger people a path to become relevant and effective.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat's especially true of the Palestinians, whose communal identity has been trapped for too long in the default position of \"refugee.\" \u003ca href=\"https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-saudi-diplomat-palestinians-must-shed-image-of-victim-1001290619\"\u003eA senior Saudi diplomat recently said Palestinian should stop thinking of themselves as victims\u003c/a\u003e, the better to empower themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMohamed Allabar of the United Arab Emirates, founder of Emmar Properties and one of the world's biggest commercial builders, told the conference, \"The younger generation will not let us continue trapped by our past. Palestinian people are our people. We get up every morning positive, and we want to do more...By generating jobs, income opportunities and filling gaps in delivering basic services, the private sector can help build momentum behind a fragile economy and instill hope in the people of the region.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConflict management experts, including Kurt Lewin and \u003ca href=\"https://scholar.harvard.edu/hckelman/publications/looking-back-my-work-conflict-resolution-middle-east\"\u003eHerbert Kelman\u003c/a\u003e, have cautioned that the diversionary details of plan execution are less valuable than a shared vision of how life could be after a transformation. Before a political solution can be sold, all parties have to imagine a highly desirable scenario far better than the status quo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps unschooled in this research, \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/28/opinion/editorials/jared-kushner-middle-east-palestinian.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share\"\u003ethe \u003cem\u003eNew York Times \u003c/em\u003ein an editorial on Friday\u003c/a\u003e dismissed the Bahrain initiative as \"big-dream plans divorced from reality,\" echoing the historically unfounded clich? that diplomatic solutions must precede economic plans. What the \u003cem\u003eTimes\u003c/em\u003e overlooks is the failed history of \"political solution first,\" which so far has usually meant there will be no solution. There are myriad self-interested advocacy groups, international bodies, and politicians, unfortunately, who read from the same script.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople who witnessed the spirit of Bahrain feel otherwise. As former Obama administration Mideast peace envoy David Makovsky said to me at the event, \"My hope is that after Bahrain...we're not just saying we've put forth a compelling vision of an endgame, but we're starting down that road to make it more tangible in the short term. Israeli-Arab cooperation has been going on for years under the table, but the table seems to be levitating, because it's very crowded under there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was under that levitating table that Palestinian business leaders joined with Arab leaders from around the Gulf Coast, along with Israeli, African, European and American sponsors. The self-interest of these leaders has been put on alert as confusion in the region gives way to pragmatism. Let's hope leaders embrace the opportunities for regional vitality with economic resources and investments across the boundaries of religions and ethnicities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eJeffrey Sonnenfeld is Senior Associate Dean and Lester Crown Professor of Management Practice at the Yale School of Management.

During the month, the list increased by three to 76 institutions after a removal and three additions.  Assets changed by a nominal $322 million to $55 billion.  A year ago, the list held 92 institutions with assets of $60 billion.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThis month, the action against First Southern Bank (f/k/a The Patterson Bank), Patterson, GA ($123 million) was terminated.  Additions this month included The Farmers Bank, Carnegie, OK ($121 million); Home Bank of Arkansas, Portland, AR ($76 million); and State Bank, Green River, WY ($29 million).  Also, thanks to a reader that identified an institution not included within the list – CornerstoneBank, Atlanta, GA ($219 million), that has been operating under a Consent Order since 2012.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWith the conclusion of the second quarter, we bring an updated transition matrix to detail how banks are transitioning off the Unofficial Problem Bank List.  Since the Unofficial Problem Bank List was first published on August 7, 2009 with 389 institutions, 1,747 institutions have appeared on a weekly or monthly list since the start of publication.  Only 4.2 percent of the banks that have appeared on a list remain today as 1,671 institutions have transitioned through the list.  Departure methods include 984 action terminations, 406 failures, 262 mergers, and 19 voluntary liquidations.  Of the 389 institutions on the first published list, only 6 or 1.5 percent, are still designated as being in a troubled status more than nine years later.  The 406 failures represent 23.3 percent of the 1,747 institutions that have made an appearance on the list.  This failure rate is well above the 10-12 percent rate frequently cited in media reports on the failure rate of banks on the FDIC's official list.\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003ccenter\u003e\u003ctable

the other site, if only to remove ads.  The Premium plan would even be within my means for this site, if I had any use for most of the features.  Therein lies the problem.  I don\u0026#8217;t even want a custom domain name.  After more than a dozen years as tagn.wordpress.com, why would I want to mess with that.  All I really want is ads removed and enough storage space for my many screen shots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, WordPress.com pushed a new version of their mobile app last week that not only shows less information, but insists on showing stats based on the time zone you happen to be in as opposed to the time zone to blog is set to.  My attempts to engage with WP.com have been met with the usual blank looks and unhelpful replies.  This does not make me want to give them more money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn another front, I got sick of the Blog Roll Feed in the side bar failing to load.  It was always a bit problematic, but of late it seemed to be failing to load almost all the time.  So I dug into my Rube Golberg setup and found a problem that should have prevented it from loading ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis comes up more often in software than you might hope in software.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, I redid how everything connects and it seems to be much more reliable now.  So op success for what is now v.7 of the sidebar feed.  It isn\u0026#8217;t bullet proof\u0026#8230; it is still a hack\u0026#8230; but it shows data now more often than it did previously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOne

find relaxing.  Having won the original scenario a couple of times, I wanted to do the next more difficult scenario.  You start with five colonists and almost no technology.  That led to a some

last  week, the Steam Summer Sale is not the same old thing.  No, they have some new ideas, and some old ones, and they have had odd results.  First, you have to choose a team and nearly everybody decided to go with Team Corgi because corgis are cute.  So Team Corgi wins a lot.  I went with Team Tortise, which won a day after Valve gave us a way to sabotage other teams effectively and everybody hit Team Corgi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen there was the chance to win something from your wish list.  They did this years back, and it got people to add games to their wish list.  Now we all have so much crap on our lists that Valve threatening to give us a random game from it for free triggered a mass wish list purge, much to the horror of devs, who get stats on that.  That was amended so that you will now win the first game on your wish list, so you don\u0026#8217;t have to banish all the five dollar indy crap from your sight.  I did so anyway, paring my wish list from 71 to 11 games.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, to earn points and such in the event you have to buy games (duh), play some specific games and complete special tasks within them, or play a game that has Steam achievements.  I did the latter, which is how \u003cem\u003eCivilization V\u003c/em\u003e made it onto my ManicTime list this month.   I would have just played \u003cem\u003eRimWorld\u003c/em\u003e, but it does not have Steam achievements.  Oh well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eComing Up\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe have another week or so to run with the Steam Summer Sale, so we shall see if I end up buying anything.  My daughter is pestering me about a couple of titles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn World of Warcraft I have the whole \u003cem\u003eRise of Azshara\u003c/em\u003e update to explore.  With almost two months to go before \u003cem\u003eWoW Classic\u003c/em\u003e I should have enough time to unlock flying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith null sec wars in \u003cem\u003eEVE Online\u003c/em\u003e called off on account of CCP, there will likely be a return to SIGs and Squads being the place to actually play the game.  We\u0026#8217;ll see what CCP has planned for this Drifter invasion, but it isn\u0026#8217;t making people in null sec happy.  The Drifters aren\u0026#8217;t actually killing structures and don\u0026#8217;t even drop loot.  They are just a plague sent to afflict us.  We\u0026#8217;ll survive, but there had better be a point to this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd, otherwise, it is July.  People used to say August was the dead month for video games, but then Blizz started launching things in August, so now July is it I

the other site, if only to remove ads.  The Premium plan would even be within my means for this site, if I had any use for most of the features.  Therein lies the problem.  I don\u0026#8217;t even want a custom domain name.  After more than a dozen years as tagn.wordpress.com, why would I want to mess with that.  All I really want is ads removed and enough storage space for my many screen shots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, WordPress.com pushed a new version of their mobile app last week that not only shows less information, but insists on showing stats based on the time zone you happen to be in as opposed to the time zone to blog is set to.  My attempts to engage with WP.com have been met with the usual blank looks and unhelpful replies.  This does not make me want to give them more money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn another front, I got sick of the Blog Roll Feed in the side bar failing to load.  It was always a bit problematic, but of late it seemed to be failing to load almost all the time.  So I dug into my Rube Golberg setup and found a problem that should have prevented it from loading ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis comes up more often in software than you might hope in software.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, I redid how everything connects and it seems to be much more reliable now.  So op success for what is now v.7 of the sidebar feed.  It isn\u0026#8217;t bullet proof\u0026#8230; it is still a hack\u0026#8230; but it shows data now more often than it did previously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOne

in New Eden in June, what with EVE North, CSM14 elections, selling skill points, and the war in Tribute and Vale, I had lots to write about.  And then the Drifters started hitting our structures, future war plans were suspended, and we all went back to Delve to PvE.  Oh well.  The 64-bit client seems to work though.  I used that all month.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLord of

didn\u0026#8217;t take too long, relatively speaking.  \u003cem\u003eLOTRO\u003c/em\u003e updates always take longer than they should because the patcher is archaic.  But I managed it.  Then I logged in and was in Bree and had to remember how to get back to Moria.  And then Mirkwood opened up a few days later on the Legendary server and my interest waned

villages, improved them, fought pillagers, did a bunch more exploring, and then came to the usual \u0026#8220;now what?\u0026#8221; part of the game, at which point I tend to stop logging in so much.

\u003cem\u003eMinecraft\u003c/em\u003e faded, \u003cem\u003eRimWorld\u003c/em\u003e came back into the picture.  Both are games you can sit and play while listening to podcasts or audio books, which I find relaxing.  Having won the original scenario a couple of times, I wanted to do the next more difficult scenario.  You start with five colonists and almost no technology.  That led to a some restarts as all my colonists died again and again.  But I got past that finally.  There is a blog post in the works as to where that led.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWorld of

same as the live client.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eActually, something big did happen.  We got the 8.2 update and more content and the chance to unlock flying.  Due to \u003cem\u003eEVE Online\u003c/em\u003e, I haven\u0026#8217;t even started on any of that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSteam Summer Sale\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite my guess last  week, the Steam Summer Sale is not the same old thing.  No, they have some new ideas, and some old ones, and they have had odd results.  First, you have to choose a team and nearly everybody decided to go with Team Corgi because corgis are cute.  So Team Corgi wins a lot.  I went with Team Tortise, which won a day after Valve gave us a way to sabotage other teams effectively and everybody hit Team Corgi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen there was the chance to win something from your wish list.  They did this years back, and it got people to add games to their wish list.  Now we all have so much crap on our lists that Valve threatening to give us a random game from it for free triggered a mass wish list purge, much to the horror of devs, who get stats on that.  That was amended so that you will now win the first game on your wish list, so you don\u0026#8217;t have to banish all the five dollar indy crap from your sight.  I did so anyway, paring my wish list from 71 to 11 games.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, to earn points and such in the event you have to buy games (duh), play some specific games and complete special tasks within them, or play a game that has Steam achievements.  I did the latter, which is how \u003cem\u003eCivilization V\u003c/em\u003e made it onto my ManicTime list this month.   I would have just played \u003cem\u003eRimWorld\u003c/em\u003e, but it does not have Steam achievements.  Oh well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eComing Up\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe have

Warcraft I have the whole \u003cem\u003eRise of Azshara\u003c/em\u003e update to explore.  With almost two months to go before \u003cem\u003eWoW Classic\u003c/em\u003e I should have enough time to unlock flying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith null sec wars in \u003cem\u003eEVE Online\u003c/em\u003e called off on account of CCP, there will likely be a return to SIGs and Squads being the place to actually play the game.  We\u0026#8217;ll see what CCP has planned for this Drifter invasion, but it isn\u0026#8217;t making people in null sec happy.  The Drifters aren\u0026#8217;t actually killing structures and don\u0026#8217;t even drop loot.  They are just a plague sent to afflict us.  We\u0026#8217;ll survive, but there had better be a point to this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd, otherwise, it is July.  People used to say August was the dead month for video games, but then Blizz started launching things in August, so now July is it I

Need to Talk About Their Faith","content":"\u003cp\u003eJust over a year ago, before the frenzy of the midterm elections hit full swing, I traveled to Ohio to campaign with Senator Sherrod Brown, who was running for reelection. I told the crowds about the Sherrod I know from the weekly prayer breakfast he hosts in the Capitol, every Wednesday when the Senate is in session.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen I brought up his faith at our first campaign stop, though, a funny thing happened: As I told the folks in the room about how inspiring and passionate Sherrod is when talking about his faith, many faces showed surprise. They knew him as a passionate advocate for the middle class and a brilliant, hardworking senator, but not everyone knew him as man of faith. It wasn’t part of his stump speech.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt our second stop, the same thing happened. By our third stop, Sherrod had changed his stump speech. He still emphasized manufacturing, health care, and education, but he also talked about how his faith inspires him to fight for the dignity of every person he represents. He talked about how all of us are called to care for, support, and lift up our neighbors. He was arguing for the same progressive policies he’d discussed before, but rooting his perspective and values in the Gospels. In the room, heads were nodding; people understood exactly where he was coming from. It reminded me of the famous Christian edict: “Preach the Gospel at all times. When necessary, use words.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, choosing not to talk much—or even at all—about faith and religion has become common in today’s Democratic Party. That choice, I believe, is the wrong one for two important reasons.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirst, it hides away the deep, passionate, and formative faith backgrounds of so many Democrats who are seeking or serving in office. At our weekly Senate prayer breakfasts, for example, I’m consistently inspired and moved by the words of my colleagues whose faith is fundamental to their life and their work, but who rarely talk about it publicly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSecond, choosing not to talk about our faith as Democrats ignores the clear fact that America is still an overwhelmingly religious country, and that the Democratic Party, too, \u003ca href=\"https://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/party-affiliation/democrat-lean-dem/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eremains a coalition largely made up of people of faith\u003c/a\u003e—including tens of millions who identify as deeply religious.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are good reasons—and some bad ones—that explain how we’ve gotten to this point.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor starters, we simply haven’t done enough to counter the decades-long effort by Republicans to claim that the most important, pressing political issues for Christians are opposition to abortion access and LGBTQ rights. Many Democrats of my generation remember all too well the “Moral Majority” of the late 1970s and early ’80s that intertwined the Christian right with the Republican Party, blurring the lines of politics and religion in ways we can still see today.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMake no mistake—those GOP efforts have made a difference, and slowly but surely, Democrats have allowed conventional wisdom to correlate public displays of Christian religiosity with anti-abortion and anti-LGBTQ policies.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDemocrats today spend less time showing how our faith and religious backgrounds drive and inform our positions on all kinds of things—immigration, climate change, taxes, health care—out of a largely unspoken concern that publicly connecting faith with politics doesn’t quite fit.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSome argue that Democrats’ de-emphasis of faith makes sense in a country that’s becoming less religious, but that vastly overstates the decline of religious affiliation in America. For all the talk of American secularization, only 17 percent of the people who voted in 2018 identified their religion to pollsters as “none.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOthers argue that while America might remain a religious country overall, the Democratic Party is notably less so. But about half of Democratic voters were considered highly religious, and more than a quarter fairly religious, on the Pew Research Center’s 2014 Religious Landscape Study.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhy, then, does conventional wisdom argue that Democrats are becoming dramatically less religious or even anti-religious? It’s true that fewer Democrats today identify as highly religious—but observers have placed more emphasis on the direction of that shift than on its actual magnitude. To explain that, one has to give some credit to the sustained, though plainly inaccurate, arguments to that effect made by Republicans over the years, but Democrats are also sometimes guilty of misreading the country and our own voters on this issue.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTake for example, the inaccurate stereotype of the Democratic base as Millennial and secular. First, Millennial voters still make up only a relatively small percentage of Democrats. \u003ca href=\"https://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/generational-cohort/#religious-group-by-generational-group\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAnd second, while Millennial voters identify, more than any generation before them, as religiously unaffiliated\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/generational-cohort/#importance-of-religion-in-ones-life-trend\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ea majority of them still identify as at least somewhat religious\u003c/a\u003e. Those that don’t are an even smaller (albeit increasing) slice of the country and the party.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe perception of Democratic voters as being less religious also comes from an excessive focus on white Democrats. In the 2014 Pew survey, fully 78 percent of African-American Democrats were highly religious, 17 percent were fairly religious, and only 5 percent were not religious at all. Among Hispanic Democrats, the numbers were similarly clear: 57 percent were highly religious, 29 percent were fairly religious, and only 15 percent were not religious. The point is that while white Millennial voters might receive the most attention from the national media and some strategists, their changing religious identity is only a small part of the story for the party overall.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat’s why Democratic officials and candidates need to lose their reluctance to talk publicly about how faith informs our work, our values, and our lives. I’ve been encouraged by the ways that many of the Democrats running for president have done just that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSenator Cory Booker \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/02/cory-booker-running-president-2020/581797/?utm_source=feed\" target=\"_blank\"\u003etold his congregation\u003c/a\u003e, the Metropolitan Baptist Church in Newark, that he was going to run for president before he publicly announced his candidacy, and said in a CNN town hall that “Christ is the center of my life.” Senator Elizabeth Warren, a former Sunday-school teacher, \u003ca href=\"https://www.christianpost.com/news/elizabeth-warren-says-words-of-jesus-judgement-of-sheep-and-goats-is-driving-force-in-her-life.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003erecently quoted the Gospel of Matthew\u003c/a\u003e while speaking to an audience in Mississippi about her own faith, and spoke eloquently about feeling called to action. Mayor Pete Buttigieg \u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/04/10/faith-not-sexual-orientation-is-what-makes-buttigieg-interesting/?utm_term=.49d413d096c0\"\u003etold a town-hall audience\u003c/a\u003e that “scripture is about protecting the stranger, and the prisoner, and the poor person, and that idea of welcome.” Former Vice President Joe Biden (whose candidacy I have endorsed) has for decades spoken about how his faith has sustained him through tragedy and inspired him to serve others.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThose examples reflect an important point: \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/08/progressive-secular-religious/536559/?utm_source=feed\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDemocrats can fight for our progressive values\u003c/a\u003e while also identifying with the religious backgrounds that are so important to tens of millions of Americans. It’s not about citing one scripture verse or another to argue for a certain policy; it’s about letting those Americans for whom religion is central to their lives know that we understand them, respect them, and in many cases share their religious backgrounds.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere is, of course, a wrong way to do this. We must be careful to never weaponize or politicize faith, religion, or scripture, nor should we claim some sort of divine endorsement for our policies.

Donald Trump disdains, more than anything else, the limitations of checks and balances on his power. Witness his assertion of a right to flout all congressional subpoenas; his continuing refusal to disclose his tax returns, notwithstanding Congress’s statutory right to secure them; his specific actions to bar congressional testimony by government officials; and his personal attacks on judges who dare to subject the acts of his administration to judicial review. More blatant yet are his recent assertion of a right to accept dirt on political opponents from foreign governments,  and his declaration of a national emergency, when he himself said “he did not need to do this,” he just preferred to “do it much faster.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAttorney General William Barr has not had the lead public role in advancing the president’s claims to these unprecedented powers, which have come to us, like most everything about this president, as spontaneous assertions of Trump’s own will. To the contrary, in securing his confirmation as attorney general, Barr successfully used his prior service as attorney general in the by-the-book, norm-following administration of George H. W. Bush to present himself as a mature adult dedicated to the rule of law who could be expected hold the Trump administration to established legal rules. Having known Barr for four decades, including preceding him as deputy attorney general in the Bush Administration, I knew him to be a fierce advocate of unchecked presidential power, so my own hopes were outweighed by skepticism that this would come true. But the first few months of his current tenure, and in particular, and his handling of the Mueller report suggest something very different—that he is using the office he holds to advance his extraordinary lifetime project of assigning unchecked power to the president.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn March 24, just two days after he received the Mueller report, Barr issued a terse four-page letter purporting to summarize the report’s major conclusions—and drawing one more that was critical—while offering virtually no facts. It was not until 25 days later, on April 18, that the redacted report itself appeared, after a stage-setting press conference by Barr the same morning. Its 448 pages raised severe doubts about the accuracy of some of Barr’s characterizations, and his ensuing testimony on Capitol Hill was an exercise in curmudgeonly obfuscation, as he held his ground while explaining almost nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/05/barr-misled-the-publicand-it-worked/588463/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eDavid A.

He has since repeatedly misstated this conclusion as a finding of “no collusion,” which it is not. Mueller documented plenty of collusion between Russians and Trump’s agents, even as it failed to find evidence beyond a reasonable doubt of a conspiracy (meaning agreement) to disrupt the election.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs to the investigation of possible obstruction of justice, while noting the report’s explicit statement that it could not “exonerate” the President, Barr’s letter said that Mueller’s approach was just to“describe the facts of his obstruction investigation without reaching any legal conclusions and leave it to the Attorney General to determine whether the conduct described … constitutes a crime.” In fulfillment of this self-assigned duty, the letter reports that “Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and I have concluded that the evidence developed … is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe attorney general’s release of a redacted copy of the Mueller report on April 18, including the extensive facts recited in Volume II on the topic of obstruction of justice, produced great consternation. Many people who had supported Barr’s nomination because they thought he could be counted on to play straight were perplexed. He was sharply criticized for misleading the public about the findings of the investigation, which plainly chronicled numerous acts aimed at impairing the investigation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMueller himself had noted in a letter to the attorney general on March 27 (but not released until much later) that the March 24 letter “did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance of this Office’s work and conclusions.” Following the release of the report, more than a thousand former prosecutors (including me) signed a letter stating that under conventional understandings of what constitutes obstruction, the report made a very strong case. It would have been an easy call to indict Trump, were it not for the categorical Office of Legal Counsel opinion foreclosing federal criminal charges against any sitting president.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/03/barr-mueller/585628/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eKen White: Barr’s startling and unseemly haste\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMany people also scratched their heads in wonder that Rod Rosenstein—the dogged deputy attorney general who had appointed Mueller in the first place, then oversaw his investigation for two years while Sessions was recused, and tolerated all manner of personal public abuse from the president—could have agreed to a finding of legally insufficient evidence when the report itself said that it could not exonerate the president.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen asked to respond to allegations that he was “protecting or enabling the president,” Barr’s grumbled \u003ca href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2019/05/30/attorney_general_barr_responds_to_criticism_that_he_is_protecting_president_trump.html\"\u003eresponse\u003c/a\u003e was characteristically uninformative, noting that he was acting on “the law, the facts, and the substance,” and that the criticism just “goes with the territory of being the attorney general in a hyper-partisan time.” So what are we to make of Barr’s conclusion that the overwhelming evidence of presidential interference uncovered by the Mueller investigation would not support an obstruction charge, even if OLC had not said that a sitting president can never be charged?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne possible answer is that Barr’s goal has simply been to mislead the public about the facts at issue, and thus back up the president’s claim that he did not willfully interfere with the investigation. That would make Barr part of a very large group of people who, for reasons known only to themselves, have seen fit to support Trump in his lies and abuses. Their reward, in most cases, has been to be mercilessly trashed by their master and dismissed for being weak or stupid.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThose who were most hopeful that Barr would restore some regularity to our government are among those most puzzled by recent events, since there is no imaginable reason for Barr to seek such a disreputable role for himself. At his stage of life, after a successful legal career and distinguished government service, why would he accept the job of lying to defend the president? And especially why would he go to such extraordinary and unconventional lengths to pursue the position by submitting, on June 8, 2018, a lengthy and apparently unsolicited memorandum attacking the Mueller investigation?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere can be no doubt that the primary effect of Barr’s conduct to date has indeed been to befuddle and mislead, and create a public misimpression, for those who have not read Mueller’s report, that the president may not have interfered with the investigation. But Barr never said that the president did not in fact interfere, only that there is no basis in fact and law to support a finding of criminal obstruction. Indeed, a careful review of Barr’s conduct suggests that his mission is far more grandiose that just misleading people about the facts.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/06/bill-barr-calls-intelligence-investigation-spying/591223/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eApril Doss: Bill Barr’s dangerous claims\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor many decades, Barr has had a vision of the president as possessing nearly unchecked powers. That vision is reflected in many OLC opinions, and in arguments advanced and positions taken since the 1970s. But the most compelling source for present purposes is the Barr’s memorandum submitted just a year ago. Notable near its beginning is his statement that he was “in the dark about many facts,” followed immediately and repeatedly by vehement assertions that “Mueller’s obstruction theory is fatally misconceived,” and if accepted “would have grave consequences far beyond the immediate confines of this case and … do lasting damage to the Presidency.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs this introduction suggested, Barr’s memo rested not on facts, but on a much more sweeping claim that as a matter of law, the obstruction of justice statute, 18 U.S.C. Section 1512, cannot possibly apply to any conduct by the president that is arguably at issue. In a five-page section, Barr’s memo advanced arguments based on interpreting the words of the statute. Then in a much longer second section, he got to the meat of the matter. He claimed that, regardless of whether the statute is correctly understood to have been intended to apply to actions by the president to interfere with an investigation of himself—as the Mueller report concluded it was—it would be an unconstitutional infringement on the president’s Article II powers to apply that law to the president.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe vehemence of Barr’s memo is breathtaking and the italics are all his: “Constitutionally, it is wrong to conceive of the President as simply the highest officer within the Executive branch hierarchy. He alone \u003cem\u003eis \u003c/em\u003ethe Executive branch. As such he is the sole repository of \u003cem\u003eall Executive powers\u003c/em\u003e conferred by the Constitution.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThus, “the Constitution vests \u003cem\u003eall Federal law enforcement power, \u003c/em\u003eand hence prosecutorial discretion, in the President.” That authority is “necessarily all-encompassing,” and there can be “no limit on the President’s authority to act [even] on matters which concern him or his own conduct.” Because it would infringe upon the total and utterly unchecked discretion that Barr believes Article II confers on the president, “Congress could not make it a crime for the President to exercise supervisory authority over cases in which his own conduct might be at issue.” Indeed, according to Barr, “because the President alone constitutes the Executive branch, the President cannot ‘recuse’ himself.” Thus, in Barr’s view, the only check on gross misconduct by the president is impeachment, and the very idea of an independent or special counsel investigating the president is a constitutional anathema.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/05/bill-barr-is-a-fanatic/588580/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eAdam Serwer: The dangerous ideas of Bill Barr\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt is not at all surprising that Bill Barr, with this vision of the law in mind, could reach his ultimate conclusion on obstruction in just a few days, or that in subsequent public appearances he has never offered to explain his conclusions by referencing what Trump actually did. The facts simply don’t matter, under Barr’s understanding of the Constitution, in which “the President alone \u003cem\u003eis \u003c/em\u003ethe Executive branch …. the sole repository of \u003cem\u003eall Executive powers\u003c/em\u003e conferred by the Constitution,”and Congress may not restrict his exercise of discretion in using those powers. Why worry about facts if, as Trump has claimed repeatedly, the president has unlimited power to direct or terminate any investigation, including of himself?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis understanding of recent events also may explain how Rosenstein could sign on to a conclusion of that the president had not provably committed obstruction of justice, despite the interference in the investigation that Mueller documented, and despite slaving in the vineyards of Justice for two years to preserve the integrity of Mueller’s fact-finding process. The answer may be that facts are facts, and not to be messed with—but that law, especially constitutional law, is often subject to interpretation. And if Rosenstein believed that Barr’s extreme view of the president’s constitutional powers passed the red-face test, he could have rationalized that he had a legal duty to defer to his superior. Rosenstein’s struggle to maintain the factual integrity of the Mueller investigation could thus be brought to a close by his own deference to a legal judgment that an obstruction case against the president is legally impossible, regardless of the facts.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFinally, this view of Barr’s conduct sheds a new light on why he not only accepted but sought out—indeed, may have craved—the opportunity to serve as attorney general under Donald Trump. Eighteen months serving under the sedate George H. W. Bush afforded him little opportunity to seriously contend that the president is the executive branch, or otherwise argue for almost unlimited presidential powers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTrump and his endless assertions of power offer countless opportunities to pick and choose those executive power claims with the best chance to succeed in court. Thus, in the Trump administration, Barr may have found the ideal setting in which to pursue his life’s work of creating an all-powerful president and frustrating the Founders’ vision of a government of checks and balances. His strange pursuit of an investigation of the investigators—on the supposition that the FBI may have been improperly “spying” on the Trump campaign when they investigated Trump associates who were found to have met with various Russians—may be the opening public chapter in that endeavor.    \u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/wyIBB_0sEVw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/wyIBB_0sEVw/","published":"2019-06-30T10:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-592951"},{"title":"An Unlikely Solution to Germany's East-West Divide","content":"\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eMASSEN, Germany—On a mild spring evening, Frauke Hildebrandt maneuvered through choked highways and accelerated down county roads, driving straight across her home state of Brandenburg deep into coal country.

As she has taken her campaign to national media and talk shows, she has encountered support, but also scorn and skepticism from those who fundamentally oppose quotas and those who reject the premise that East Germans are systematically disadvantaged when it comes to representation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHildebrandt’s campaign underscores the simmering resentments that have returned to the forefront of political debate here. Thirty years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, what were  formerly East and West Germany are drifting apart politically and socially.

Yet with three key state elections in the east this fall, the region’s political disaffection has sparked a growing discussion on both sides of the divide to understand why the fault lines appear to be deepening. The quota is part of that debate. A study by the German Center for Integration and Migration Research in April showed that more than 50 percent of East Germans\u003ca href=\"https://www.dezim-institut.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Projekte/Ost-Migrantische_Analogien/OstMig_Booklet_A4.pdf\"\u003e polled\u003c/a\u003e said they backed the proposal.

They described their frustration in finding out that their training and specializations no longer counted in a newly unified Germany, or that the certificates needed for some jobs hadn’t even existed in the east. It wasn’t just the rules that changed; the entire game was different.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe years just after reunification, a period referred to as the Nachwendezeit, were a violent rupture for many East Germans. When tens of thousands took to the streets in the 1989 peaceful revolution, they called for democratic change and reunification. The west meant freedom, opportunity, and, quite literally, new horizons.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen it happened, however, a socialist, state-run system was supplanted by a democratic, capitalist one almost overnight, overwriting economic, political, and social structures. The East German Ostmark was replaced by the Deutsche Mark in a 1-to-1, leading to a dramatic appreciation of the former. The agency given the task of privatizing and restructuring ailing state-owned companies often shut them down. Social networks vanished with them. A vast number of East Germans suffered sustained bouts of unemployment, and some never recovered. The fall from euphoria to disappointment was precipitous.

Spontaneously and collectively, they refused to be herded into a paddy wagon for their umpteenth arrest. Their resistance spilled out of the Stonewall Inn on Christopher Street and into the neighboring blocks, not only sparking six days of rioting but also inadvertently launching a worldwide movement for LGBTQ equality.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 1969, these drag queens, male sex workers, butch lesbians, and androgynous youth—many of them people of color—lived so far outside of the cultural zeitgeist that they barely registered on the broader American public’s radar. The riots were deemed so insignificant that neither \u003cem\u003eTime\u003c/em\u003e magazine nor \u003cem\u003eLife \u003c/em\u003emagazine covered them; not even the three main TV channels that existed back then bothered to send a cameraman.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf zero newsreel or TV coverage and scant photographs were taken during the riots—the most public display of queer life thus far in U.S. history—then how excluded from the cultural record were LGBTQ people on an ordinary, \u003cem\u003enon\u003c/em\u003e-newsworthy day? This shroud of invisibility hanging over queer Americans ahead of Stonewall made it a challenge to find even faint visual traces of this subculture’s existence. Yet that’s exactly what I set out to do back in 1982, when I embarked on two years of intensive research in film and photo archives for \u003ca href=\"https://www.firstrunfeatures.com/beforestonewall.html\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eBefore Stonewall\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, a groundbreaking documentary about queer life  in America before 1969.

I hadn’t worked on a movie before or stepped foot in an archive. While I had a passion for film and history, my main qualification for the job of archival research director for \u003cem\u003eBefore Stonewall\u003c/em\u003e was that I was having an affair with the director, \u003ca href=\"https://jezebelproductions.org/greta-schiller/\"\u003eGreta Schiller\u003c/a\u003e.

My work, which involved locating just about all of the film’s imagery apart from the interviews, was carried out well before the internet existed. Gay or lesbian images were not yet identified or categorized as such in the card catalogs of libraries. While the word \u003cem\u003elesbian\u003c/em\u003e hardly surfaced in mainstream conversation at all and \u003cem\u003egay\u003c/em\u003e was still a slang word, even the more proper and well-known term \u003cem\u003ehomosexual\u003c/em\u003e was nowhere to be found. Whenever I told an archivist the topic of my research, I received this reaction: an uncomfortable pause, then closer scrutiny of my persona for signs of deviance, then a response like, \u003cem\u003eUh, we don’t, um, I’m sure we don’t have anything like that\u003c/em\u003e.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOld-fashioned homophobia may have provoked this answer, but there was a new reason why many people feared and despised gay people: The year 1982 marked the beginning of the AIDS crisis in New York, although it wasn’t known yet as the AIDS crisis. \u003cem\u003eThe New York Times\u003c/em\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://nyti.ms/2GoFmEp\"\u003efirst reported\u003c/a\u003e in May on the existence of something called GRID, or Gay-Related Immune Deficiency, which became known colloquially as “the gay plague.” For many, the liberating post-Stonewall decade of the 1970s came to a halt and was replaced by a more somber mood. No one knew how HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, was transmitted, so you’d frequently find yourself asking such questions as, \u003cem\u003eDo I dare to dip my tortilla chip into a shared bowl of guacamole, or is that a life-threatening mistake?\u003c/em\u003e My father, to whom I hadn’t yet come out, told me to be vigilant about physical contact with my coworkers on the film; no one would want to watch a film about “those people” anyway, he said. It was against this backdrop of anonymity and hostility that I worked to find visual evidence of a subculture that had largely colluded in its own invisibility in order to survive.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne asset I did have was a friend who lived nearby, Vito Russo, who was working on a book he jokingly referred to as “Spot the Homo.” Later published as \u003cem\u003eThe Celluloid Closet\u003c/em\u003e, it’s now considered the bedrock resource on gay and lesbian scenes in Hollywood films. (Vito was one of several friends and colleagues who helped with the documentary and who fell victim to AIDS; \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/09/obituaries/vito-russo-44-a-historian-of-film-and-a-gay-advocate.html\"\u003ehe died in 1990\u003c/a\u003e.) He’d call me up with suggestions for movies to see, and clips from several of these titles made it into \u003cem\u003eBefore Stonewall\u003c/em\u003e. But Hollywood films mostly offered up a litany of lesbian and gay stereotypes—perhaps useful for illustrating the contempt with which mainstream society viewed homosexuality, but not exactly how we hoped to present the lived experiences of real people.              \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTurning my attention to newsreel films—the precursor to TV news—I took the train to Washington, D.C. and ensconced myself in the National Archives’ motion-picture division. Each day, I roamed the card catalogs, unsure of which drawers to open. Direct search terms (\u003cem\u003ehomosexuality\u003c/em\u003e, for instance) yielded nothing, so I got inventive. I looked under such vague headings as “street scenes,” “vice crimes,” or my favorite, “oddities”—a catchall label for random, socially unexpected events. It was here I might find, for example, a group of women playing sports, or engaged in other activities considered the domain of men. The titles I pulled were delivered to me the next day on a cart: big, bulky, and sometimes brittle 35mm film reels I’d handle with white gloves and watch on an old Steenbeck editing machine.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you weren’t careful threading the machine, or if you tried to fast forward, you risked tearing the sprockets, so it was safer to watch in real time. I viewed newsreel after newsreel until my eyes glazed over, and still I didn’t catch sight of anything that outwardly hinted at the existence of a queer community. For that matter, I didn’t see many women or people of color; not surprisingly, the newsreel genre is biased in favor of the “great white man” approach to history. When I finished at the National Archives, I moved on to the Library of Congress, the Kinsey Institute, the UCLA Film and Television Archive, and countless other collections. I spent far more time in archives than in my apartment during those two years. For me, the shelves weren’t full of musty documents, photographs, and film reels, but mysterious keys that held some vague promise, if I could only decipher their secrets.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" height=\"502\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/06/Audre_Lorde_and_friend/021ffec4b.png\" width=\"672\"\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"caption\"\u003eThe writer, feminist, and activist Audre Lorde (right) and a friend. (First Run Features)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eEventually, I had to broaden my approach. I figured that any time I saw a group of people congregated on film—in the army, on a street corner, at the golf course—some percentage of those people could be gay. In some cases, I gave myself license to assume they were, for the purposes of building a visual history that rewrote queerness back into the broader tapestry of American life, however imperfectly. \u003cem\u003eWhat does a gay person look like, anyway, \u003c/em\u003eI wondered, \u003cem\u003eespecially one who has lived a life in the closet?\u003c/em\u003e In 1985, I wrote in the \u003cem\u003eNew York Native\u003c/em\u003e, the city’s biweekly gay rag: “It became even more a question of \u003cem\u003ehow\u003c/em\u003e than it was of \u003cem\u003ewhere\u003c/em\u003e to look ... The process of unearthing a gay iconography involves seeing with double vision. Absence as image. Erasure as image.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eToday I find that quote and its reference to “double vision” and “absence as image” astonishing. My younger self hadn’t yet heard of W. E. B. DuBois’s “double-consciousness,” \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1897/08/strivings-of-the-negro-people/305446/?utm_source=feed\"\u003ea term he coined in 1897\u003c/a\u003e to describe the way Black Americans felt compelled to view themselves both through their own eyes and through the eyes of mainstream white society. At the time, I also didn’t know people were questioning the authority of the archive, or examining it for signs of what had been suppressed. I wrote those words a decade before Michel-Rolph Trouillot would publish his influential book on the subject, \u003cem\u003eSilencing the Past: Power and the Production of History\u003c/em\u003e, and three decades before I’d read it. I was attempting to read the silences in the archives out of frustration and a lack of alternatives. I didn’t realize that, by doing so, I was playing a small role in a revolution in Western culture that was quietly brewing, one that would soon transform what is generally understood to be “history.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOccasionally, I stumbled on surprises in the newsreels that challenged the archivists’ insistence that they had no images of “homosexuals.” I saw these rare finds as transgressions, where the archive as an institution momentarily lost its power to control which images would be recorded and which would be forgotten. Once, searching under “vice crimes,” I came across footage of a 1959 police raid of a bar packed with drag queens, who played to the camera and strutted, as if on a catwalk, into the back of a paddy wagon. In another archive, searching under “street scenes,” I was watching random film footage of Greenwich Village in the ’50s and ’60s when I spotted a bespectacled young man, tall, thin, and vivacious. I recognized him as the Beat poet Allen Ginsberg, chatting away with his friend Jack Kerouac. By coincidence, the \u003cem\u003eBefore Stonewall\u003c/em\u003e team was scheduled to interview Ginsberg the following week—he was no longer young or thin but just as vivacious.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter exhausting official sources, I turned to unofficial ones. By long-distance telephone (thankfully, the push-button was just overtaking the rotary dial at that time), I oversaw a team of 12 researchers spread out across the country who were charged with finding queer elders in their communities and charming those elders into handing over photo scrapbooks and home movies. My team found it relatively easy to convince white, gay men that their personal memorabilia had historical value, while women—especially women of color—tended to be far more reluctant. Lesbians were more financially vulnerable and culturally invisible; many had lived so long in the closet that coming out in a movie was akin to taking a trip to the moon. Finally, one day, Greta announced: \u003cem\u003eNo more white men, no matter how interesting. We have enough.\u003c/em\u003e The challenges of my job seemed to quadruple in that moment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe faced other challenges, too: For every snapshot or home-movie reel we got, we had to track down everyone in it to sign a clearance form. The risk of someone’s image appearing in a context that implied that they were gay, even in an old photograph, was too great to take without their approval. \u003cem\u003eBefore Stonewall\u003c/em\u003e’s production office began to resemble a missing-persons bureau. We had to restrain ourselves from jumping for joy when, after hitting many dead ends, we discovered the person we were trying to locate had already passed away—meaning he or she no longer had a legal right to privacy. Slowly but surely, out of the trust we established and the materials we amassed, the \u003cem\u003eBefore Stonewall \u003c/em\u003eteam quilted together the first visual history of queer America.\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr class=\"c-section-divider\"\u003e\u003cp class=\"dropcap\"\u003eThe film was released in 1985, premiering in the U.S. at Sundance (before it was called Sundance) and screening at international festivals where it won numerous awards. It opened in American cinemas, which was rare for a documentary in those days, and broke box-office records at New York’s Waverly Theater. When \u003cem\u003eBefore Stonewall\u003c/em\u003e was broadcast via PBS in 1987, earning me the first Emmy ever awarded for Research, we received letters from people around the country saying what a lifeline the film was for them, how it publicly validated their lives and helped them to see for the first time that they were part of a larger history.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt the time, I never imagined that I would go on to have a long and successful career as a documentary filmmaker, producing movies about little known chapters in the history of women, LGBTQ people, African Americans, and progressive movements. I had no inkling that, several years later, I’d return to school to earn a Ph.D. in American history. And it was unthinkable to me that my affair with \u003cem\u003eBefore Stonewall\u003c/em\u003e’s director would turn into a 37-year personal relationship and professional partnership, or that one day we’d go down to City Hall to get married.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith \u003cem\u003eBefore Stonewall\u003c/em\u003e back in cinemas this month, I’ve had the opportunity to see it on the big screen several times. I’m now the age of the people we interviewed for the film, who seemed so old and wise to me back then. Over the last few decades, the field of LGBTQ history has emerged and solidified, and many documentaries have been made. These films, such as Paris Poirier’s \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://lastcallatmauds.com/\"\u003eLast Call At Maud’s\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/em\u003e(1993)\u003cem\u003e,\u003c/em\u003e about the history of lesbian bar culture, or Arthur Dong’s documentary \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.deepfocusproductions.com/films/coming-out-under-fire/\"\u003eComing Out Under Fire\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/em\u003e(1994), about military policy regarding homosexuals during World War II, have homed in on aspects of queer life that we couldn’t spend much time on.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf course, the internet has changed just about everything. Today, researchers can skip the experience of rummaging through card catalogs, or wearing white gloves while staring at delicate 35mm film. Despite the obvious benefits of the world wide web, for me it can’t replace the physical archive, a place where I’ve chosen to spend huge chunks of my professional life. My filmmaking since \u003cem\u003eBefore Stonewall\u003c/em\u003e has involved digging into its treasures, searching for the historically invisible. Sometimes the task feels impossible, and I’m full of self-doubt.

So when U.S. and South Korean officials in the area needed to send a message to North Korea, they would place a call to their counterparts even though they knew it was a lost cause, walk up to the border and kindly request to no one in particular that they answer the phone, call again without success, and then return to the border, where this time they would encounter a few North Korean soldiers with a handheld camera to record the message as it was read aloud. This happened dozens of times a year. Quite recently. “It’s very convoluted,” one UN official admitted to me as I headed to the Demilitarized Zone in 2018.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow the president of the United States simply \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1144740178948493314\"\u003etweets\u003c/a\u003e at Kim (who “\u003ca href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-conference-osaka-japan/\"\u003efollows\u003c/a\u003e” him on Twitter, naturally) that, hey, he’s swinging through town and would love to meet up!

Pyongyang’s arsenal remains as formidable today as it was when Trump and Kim held their first summit one year ago, despite North Korea’s suspension of nuclear and long-range missile tests. But that doesn’t mean Trump has accomplished nothing. What Sunday’s meeting in the Demilitarized Zone highlighted is that the president has shattered the American taboo of meeting with the head of the Kim regime and established a top-level channel of communication between decades-old enemies—to the point where such a dialogue doesn’t only have ample precedent but is commonplace, even casual.

Much of elite conservative culture, especially in the world of essays and journalism, is focused on critiquing, mocking, and warning about identity-focused left-wing views. But Reno has lately been reflecting on the political project he would like to build, beyond what he feels bound to oppose. “We play so much defense that we don’t often discipline ourselves to say, ‘What are we for? What kind of society do we want?’” he told me. “It’s easy to know what you’re against, but harder to know what you’re for.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eFirst Things\u003c/em\u003e is the intellectual home for bookish religious conservatives in search of a counterargument to the consensus of progressive culture.

Reno, along with his team of editors and motley band of conservative friends and writers, believe that the tenuous coalition between free-market business types and socially conservative religious types is effectively over. He argues that the massive corporate influence on American politics and culture is pernicious, and wishes to reorganize the economy to promote the well-being of families. He maintains that a society without any belief in a higher power inevitably becomes cynical and consumerist, and he aims to build a collective sense of what he calls a transcendent horizon. Above all, he believes that Americans yearn for civic unity, and that nationalism should be viewed as a fact and an asset, rather than a swear word.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs a whole, the \u003cem\u003eFirst Things\u003c/em\u003e project is an argument against cultural retreat: Religious conservatives should offer an alternative vision of the rightly ordered life, its writers argue, rather than publicly complying with progressive norms while privately seething with rage. In fighting for this vision, however, the magazine sometimes suffers from the moral hazards of opposition politics: writing with derision about its perceived enemies; using conspiratorial terms like “LGBT agenda”; and defending sweeping principles, like limiting immigration for the sake of national unity, while ignoring the particulars of how they have played out under Trump.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the great questions posed by the Trump era is how religious conservatives’ alignment with the president will affect the Christian witness in America—the faith’s reputation, and Christians’ ability to reach and persuade people with what they see as the good news of Christ. Among all but Trump’s most ardent admirers, the widely held perception is that full-throated support of the president has required moral and civic compromise. The \u003cem\u003eFirst Things\u003c/em\u003e compatriots have made a slightly different bet: Rather than fighting against the current political moment, the magazine has evolved along with the GOP base toward a positive vision of nationalist politics. They hope that Trump’s popularity is the sign of an opening—for conservative orthodoxy, and for a nationalist movement to replace today’s progressive, globalized world order.\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr class=\"c-section-divider\"\u003e\u003cp class=\"dropcap\"\u003eF\u003cspan class=\"smallcaps\"\u003eirst Things’ place in the conservative firmament\u003c/span\u003e is immediately clear from its office’s interior decorating.

And yet his personal beliefs and political project are dedicated to the pursuit of settled-ness and unity. “People say, ‘Oh, it must be great, children growing up in two different traditions,’” he told me. “No, it’s not great. It makes it hard for them. They do strongly identify as Jewish. But one of the things we want is … to have a home in the world.

Conservative writers at mainstream outlets range in their sympathies for the\u003cem\u003e First Things\u003c/em\u003e project, but mostly stop short of alignment.

Reno argues that the progressive gospel of diversity mistakenly elevates difference as a good unto itself, missing the shared qualities of American identity that actually bring the country together. “Pluralism—it all sounds great on paper,” he told me. “But in fact, especially in times of crisis or tension—and I think we live in a time very polarized and divided—the imperative is unity.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“The big question is: ‘What is the problem that we face in the 21st-century West?’” he said. “Is the problem one of insufficient solicitude for people on the margins? Or is the problem one of lack of consolidating and unifying forces?” He and his cohort come down firmly in favor of the latter. Reno wants to assure his readers that “they’re not crazy, and in fact, this theologically informed, socially conservative view of the world makes sense, and there are other people who share it.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr class=\"c-section-divider\"\u003e\u003cp class=\"dropcap\"\u003eThis condensed summary of the \u003cem\u003eFirst Things\u003c/em\u003e project is too simplified—the magazine’s writers gamely argue among themselves about the right direction for the country—and perhaps too generous. “You’ve been pressing me on this, and precisely showing how sketchy this vision is,” Reno told me. “It’s not altogether clear.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt might also be too sanitized. Alongside calls for unity and transcendence, \u003cem\u003eFirst Things\u003c/em\u003e is prone to harsh barbs about the people its writers perceive to be working against its project. The magazine devotes significant space to bemoaning same-sex marriage, homosexuality, and what its writers refer to as “transgender ideology”; Reno recently wrote that American society has been fragmented by identity politics, including the forces of “LGBT jihadism.” This single-minded focus on LGBTQ issues is necessary, Reno says, because men and women and their ability to bear children together is the central story of creation; in a society where gender and sexuality are unsettled, everything else becomes disordered. “We live in a society of inclusion, and the strategy of inclusion is to make people feel better by being celebrated,” Reno told me. “In celebrating [transgender people] we wind up disrupting—and, in some cases, dismantling—these inherited mechanisms for young people … to be at peace with who they are.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe magazine has weathered some embarrassing gaffes—most notably\u003ca href=\"https://www.firstthings.com/article/2018/02/non-possumus\"\u003e a 2018 article\u003c/a\u003e defending the Vatican’s notorious 1858 kidnapping of a Jewish 6-year-old, Edgardo Mortara, who had been secretly baptized by his nanny.\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/McCormickProf/status/951105220670558213\"\u003e Conservatives\u003c/a\u003e and\u003ca href=\"https://forward.com/fast-forward/391967/catholic-magazine-justifies-kidnapping-converting-jewish-baby/\"\u003e liberals\u003c/a\u003e alike\u003ca href=\"https://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/the-edgardo-mortara-case/comment-page-2/\"\u003e expressed shock\u003c/a\u003e that \u003cem\u003eFirst Things \u003c/em\u003ehad published the piece.

When I asked him whether he would be as concerned if there were a surge of migrants at America’s northern border, he admitted that this would be less worrying: “Canadians are so similar,” he said. “Part of it has to do with the cultural fit.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRoom for dissent exists among \u003cem\u003eFirst Things\u003c/em\u003e’ ranks: Shortly after Trump’s inauguration, an online columnist, Pete Spiliakos, wrote that the president was “insufficiently nationalist” because his vision of making America great again “leaves out African Americans for whom America was not noticeably greater in the past” and the “huge number of first- and second-generation Americans who are part of the post-1965 immigration wave.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis frank treatment of conservative blind spots on race is an exception to most \u003cem\u003eFirst Things\u003c/em\u003e coverage, which—when it deals with race at all—tends to promote a view of color-blind unity in God over what it sees as racialized identity politics. The magazine’s editors have worked to disassociate themselves from the white-identity wing of Trump’s nationalist coalition—Schmitz once wrote a trollishly titled piece, \u003ca href=\"https://www.firstthings.com/web-exclusives/2017/09/christianity-is-for-cucks\"\u003e“Christianity Is for Cucks,”\u003c/a\u003e basically as a literary middle finger to the so-called alt-right—but Reno, at least, does not think white-identity politics are much of a threat. “People in America are very anxious that they’re going to lose their country,” he said. “People want to interpret that as a coming minority status of whites, and it’s a nostalgia for white America, and okay, maybe there are people who think that way. I certainly don’t, and the people I talk to don’t. They’re worried that the people who lead this country have no interest in being a country where we’re all together.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe writers and editors at \u003cem\u003eFirst Things\u003c/em\u003e are part of a group attempting to create scaffolding for a nationalist movement that will outlast Trump’s presidency: Later this summer, Reno will join figures including Tucker Carlson, the libertarian entrepreneur Peter Thiel, and the freshman senator from Missouri, Josh Hawley, in speaking at a summit on nationalism in Washington, D.C. In the event’s promotional materials, the organizers explicitly state their desire to develop a conservative, nationalist movement  “in stark opposition to political theories grounded in race.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd yet, this remains the greatest challenge to the nascent conservative-nationalist revival. The reality remains that Trump’s movement, and the discontent behind it, cannot easily be untangled from racism. “It’s very easy for intellectuals in general, and the ones we’re talking about in particular, to sort of live in castles in their minds that are very elegant and beautiful, and not fully grasp that the real-world analog to what you’re talking about is actually a kind of white-supremacist political order,” Linker said. “You have to bridge that, somehow, and face the consequences.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"dropcap\"\u003eW\u003cspan class=\"smallcaps\"\u003ehile some conservative subcultures\u003c/span\u003e can become hermetically sealed, purposefully isolated from the liberal enemies they oppose, the compatriots of \u003cem\u003eFirst Things\u003c/em\u003e lean into the tensions of their beliefs, surrounding themselves with friends and family whose lives are open challenges to their first principles. Reno told me he has a gay brother-in-law who adopted a child with his partner, and a sister who supports abortion rights. The day I visited the \u003cem\u003eFirst Things\u003c/em\u003e office, I accompanied Yost, Schmitz, and baby Hugh to a nearby restaurant for lunch. A rainbow sandwich-board sign promoting LGBTQ Pride month sat propped in the entryway.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEveryone I met, from the interns up to the top editors, seemed untroubled by their secular, progressive surroundings. “I’ve never felt embattled,” Yost told me.

Their main objection to elite culture, left and right, is what they see as snobbishness.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis has become a major line of contention among conservatives: whether those who oppose Trump on the grounds of his uncouthness are really just looking down at uncivilized America. This was one question raised during the recent \u003cem\u003eFirst Things\u003c/em\u003e fight over “Frenchism” (a truly clunky and unfortunate coinage referring to David French, the \u003cem\u003eNational Review\u003c/em\u003e writer): whether conservatives should prize civility in discourse and continue playing by gentlemen’s rules of politics, or whether they should embrace the kind of no-holds-barred rhetoric that won over Trump voters. “When niceness … is elevated in this way, I don’t really like the result,” Yost said. “It becomes a way of stigmatizing the contributions of people who don’t have elite manners.

They are frustrated by the president’s penchant for pitting Americans against one another, and don’t necessarily see their preferred political agenda being enacted by his administration. They are discontent with the state of American politics generally: “We need leaders who see themselves as leaders of all of America,” Schmitz said. “Not everyone in America feels that Trump is their leader, obviously. He’s a very polarizing figure. We need someone who at least aspires to lead the country. I don’t think our liberal elites aspire to that at all.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat they do see is an opening for new arguments, especially among conservatives. “What Trump has shown is that the people who thought they were leading the conservative intellectual movement … were generals without armies,” Schmitz said. The kinds of arguments \u003cem\u003eFirst Things\u003c/em\u003e is interested in line up with the sensibilities of most Americans, he said: family oriented, generally patriotic, at least vaguely religious, and supportive of moderate government social-welfare spending.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYet for all this talk of unity and sticking up for the trampled underclasses, there are still flashes of fear close to the surface of the \u003cem\u003eFirst Things\u003c/em\u003e project. Reno, in what I hope was a joking moment during our conversation, told me his wife would claw my eyes out if I came after him in this article.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd so the challenge stands, for \u003cem\u003eFirst Things\u003c/em\u003e as for post-Trump America: whether those who decry the politics of grievance can get beyond grievance-churning themselves. \u003cem\u003eFirst Things\u003c/em\u003e fashions itself as a defender of the common good against a vindictive elite that wishes to erase its kind from society. But power, as it happens, often serves as a mirror. “We’re not going to get out of our current situation just by being nice to each other,” Reno told me as he leaned back in his chair, regarding me with equal parts amusement and skepticism. “Some people are going to have to lose.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/Ey9FmlIM-7Y\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/Ey9FmlIM-7Y/","published":"2019-06-30T12:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-592996"},{"title":"Energy-Drink Makers Say They’re Not Targeting Teens","content":"\u003cp\u003eEarlier this year, a half-dozen students from City Hill Middle School, in Naugatuck, Connecticut, traveled with their science teacher, Katrina Spina, to the state capital to testify in support of a \u003ca href=\"https://www.cga.ct.gov/asp/cgabillstatus/cgabillstatus.asp?selBillType=Bill\u0026amp;which_year=2019\u0026amp;bill_num=7007\"\u003ebill\u003c/a\u003e that would ban sales of energy drinks to children under the age of 16.

All three major energy-drink makers now have most of their products regulated as foods, rather than dietary supplements—though that wasn’t always the case.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eResearchers from the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, in a 2008 \u003ca href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2735818/\"\u003ereview\u003c/a\u003e published in the journal \u003cem\u003eDrug and Alcohol Dependence\u003c/em\u003e, note that that lack of consistency is partly due to our long love affair with drinks in which caffeine is naturally occurring, including coffee and tea. In 1980, citing health concerns, the FDA proposed to eliminate caffeine from soft drinks, which are regulated as foods. The manufacturers, however, claimed the caffeine was a flavor enhancer. The FDA approved caffeine, but limited the maximum content of cola-type soft drinks to .02 percent, or roughly 71 milligrams per 12-ounce serving.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“If caffeine had not been accepted as a flavor enhancer, but had been regarded as a psychoactive ingredient,” write the Johns Hopkins researchers, “soft drinks might have been regulated by the FDA as drugs”—which are subject to additional regulations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen energy drinks first appeared on the American market in the late 1990s and early 2000s, some manufacturers claimed the products were neither drugs nor conventional foods, but dietary supplements. Drugs with caffeine require warning labels, but dietary supplements don’t. “It is a striking inconsistency that, in the U.S. an [over-the-counter] stimulant medication containing 100 mg of caffeine per tablet (e.g. NoDoz) must include [a series of] warnings,” write the Johns Hopkins researchers, “whereas a 500 mg energy drink can be marketed with no such warnings and no information on caffeine dose amount in the product.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs early as 2009, sports and medical organizations began issuing position statements discouraging energy-drink consumption by young people.

Three Democratic senators launched an investigation into the marketing practices of energy-drink companies. They found that adolescents between the ages of 13 and 17 are frequent targets of energy-drink marketing, and stated in a written report that “this population is also at risk for the detrimental impacts of energy-drink consumption.” The report also noted a range of claims not evaluated or substantiated by the FDA. For example, the makers of AMP Energy marketed the drinks as helping to “energize and hydrate the body,” while advertisements for Red Bull promised “increased concentration and reaction speed.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e(As it happens, a few months before the senate hearing, Monster Beverage Corporation and Rockstar announced their intention to follow in the footsteps of Red Bull by declaring their products to be foods, rather than dietary supplements.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAmong those providing testimony at a committee hearing was Jennifer L. Harris, a researcher at the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity, currently housed at the University of Connecticut. She and her team had conducted an earlier study of how sugary beverages are marketed to children. “What we learned about energy drinks stunned us,” she said at the \u003ca href=\"https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-113shrg88760/pdf/CHRG-113shrg88760.pdf\"\u003ehearing\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEnergy-drink companies had been pioneers in using social media to market their products, said Harris. At the time of her study, Red Bull and Monster Energy were the fifth and 12th most popular brands on Facebook—a platform that was, at the time, particularly popular among college students and adolescents. Further, said Harris, “energy-drink brands often promote teen athletes and musicians and sponsor local events, where they provide free samples, including to minors.” The marketing is effective, she noted. Sales of most other beverage categories were declining, but energy-drink sales had increased by 19 percent the previous year, reaching $8 billion in 2012.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe energy-beverage industry vigorously defended its products and marketing practices. In his congressional statement, Rodney Sacks, the CEO of Monster Beverage, noted that a 16-ounce can of Monster Energy contains 160 mg of caffeine. In contrast, the equivalent amount of Starbucks coffee contains 330 mg—more than twice as much. Further, Monster cans include a label recommending against consumption by children. (According to \u003ca href=\"https://www.ameribev.org/files/resources/2014-energy-drinks-guidance-approved-by-bod-43020c.pdf\"\u003eguidelines\u003c/a\u003e put forth by the American Beverage Association, a trade group, energy drinks should not be marketed to children under 12, and other leading brands such as Red Bull and Rockstar carry similar labels recommending against consumption by children.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFurther, Sacks and representatives from Rockstar and Red Bull North America denied that their companies advertise to young teenagers. Doing this, said Sacks, “would undermine the credibility of the brand image in the eyes of young adults,”—nominally their target consumer demographic.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNot everyone buys this. A 2017 \u003ca href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29151382\"\u003estudy\u003c/a\u003e published in the journal \u003cem\u003ePublic Health Nutrition\u003c/em\u003e, for example, tested whether young consumers perceived energy-drink advertising as being targeted at people their age and younger. Researchers at the University of Waterloo randomly assigned over 2,000 Canadians aged 12 to 24 to view one of four online ads for Red Bull. Among the youngest subjects—those aged 12 to 14—nearly 72 percent of participants who viewed an advertisement featuring the company’s sponsorship of the X Games, an extreme-sports event, perceived the ad to be targeted to people their age and younger.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe University of Waterloo researchers compare energy-drink marketing practices with those of 20th-century cigarette companies. “While tobacco advertising was ostensibly targeted only at adults,” they write, “it nevertheless achieved very high levels of reach and appeal among young people.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2019/06/juul-big-tobacco-marketing/592174/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: Juul’s new marketing is straight out of Big Tobacco’s playbook\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFurther, and perhaps not surprisingly, across all age groups, 71 percent of those who were shown a Red Bull ad with a sports theme—the X Games, for example, or an image of an airborne snowboarder with accompanying text reading “RED BULL GIVES YOU WIIINGS”—thought the ad they viewed promoted the use of energy drinks during sports.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is a problem, says Matt Fedoruk, the chief science officer at the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA). Though his organization is perhaps best known for its role in testing Olympic athletes for banned substances, it also promotes a positive youth-sports culture. Fedoruk says they field questions about energy drinks from athletes of all ages.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Caffeine is the most studied ergogenic aid on the planet,” says Fedoruk, and its use is widespread among elite athletes. Research has even produced recommended guidelines for ingestion prior to exercise. But these guidelines were developed for adults. Young people who try to follow them could quickly surpass the American Academy of Pediatrics’ guidelines for adolescents: no more than 100 mg of caffeine per day, or roughly the amount in a typical cup of coffee. Further, because energy drinks are manufactured in adult serving sizes, says Fedoruk, it’s easy for a child to get too much. “Depending on the product you choose, you could definitely be dosing your young child or youth athlete in doses that far exceed what may be safe for their body weight and size.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen it comes to youth athletes, “our experts recommend both water and sports drinks as the best options for hydration,” writes Danielle Eurich, a USADA spokesperson. Athletes exercising less than an hour probably don’t even need sports drinks, she adds. “Water would be best.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr class=\"c-section-divider\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eLast year, John Higgins, the sports cardiologist, ran a small study in which healthy medical students downed a 24-ounce can of Monster Energy. Ninety minutes later, the students’ arteries were measured to test their ability to bounce back—or dilate—after being compressed by a blood pressure cuff. Dilation helps control blood flow, increasing circulation when necessary, including during exercise. In this study, the medical students’ blood flow was “significantly and adversely affected,” says Higgins.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHiggins suspects that the combination of ingredients—the caffeine and other stimulants such as guarana, taurine, L-carnitine, along with added vitamins and minerals—interferes with the endothelium, a thin layer of cells that control dilation. But he can’t say for certain because there hasn’t been enough research. Higgins’s own study was preliminary and lacked a control group. Further, a recent \u003ca href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5583516/\"\u003ereview\u003c/a\u003e by a group of Harvard researchers noted considerable limitations to the existing energy-drink literature. Most studies, the authors found, used small sample sizes or employed a cross-sectional design, which isn’t able to determine causation. Large longitudinal studies, meanwhile, require time and money.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHiggins says the main reason there is no evidence of safety is that energy drinks are not classified by most countries as drugs. “They are classified as supplements, additives, or whatever.” Until more data are available, Higgins’s opinion is that energy drinks should be avoided before, during, and after exercise. Anyone under 18 should avoid them entirely, he says. This recommendation has been endorsed by the American College of Sports Medicine.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYet at the Connecticut hearing, Red Bull’s Joseph Luppino insisted that there is ample evidence of safety. He referenced the European Food Safety Authority, which conducts food-chain risk assessments for the European Union: “They have unequivocally concluded there are no synergistic effects between the various ingredients that are contained in energy drinks.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen asked for a comment, the European agency pointed to its 2015 \u003ca href=\"https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.2903/j.efsa.2015.4102\"\u003ereport\u003c/a\u003e, and a spokesperson explained the findings: In general, the combination of substances typically found in energy drinks “would not affect the safety of single doses of caffeine up to 200 mg.” Individuals who might drink a 16-oz can of Rockstar or a 24-oz can of Monster containing 240 mg of caffeine plus other stimulants were not considered by the analysis. The E.U. agency spokesperson also issued a caveat: There wasn’t enough data to determine whether other common energy-drink ingredients like guarana and taurine influence the acute effects of caffeine on blood pressure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMonster and Rockstar did not respond to repeated requests for comment. When asked about the discrepancy between Luppino’s characterization of the European report and the agency’s own characterization of its findings, Erin Mand, a spokesperson for Red Bull, pointed to particular passages in the report that suggest the safety of particular ingredient combinations up to 200 mg of caffeine. She additionally noted that “its single-serving products fall under 200 mg of caffeine.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe American Beverage Association also did not respond to specific interview questions, but did provide this statement: “Energy drinks have been enjoyed by millions of people around the world for more than 30 years, and are recognized by government health agencies worldwide as safe for consumption. The amount of caffeine in energy drinks is typically half the amount found in a coffeehouse coffee and is no different from the caffeine found in other foods and beverages. Further, America’s mainstream energy drink companies have taken voluntary steps to ensure their products are not marketed to children.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr class=\"c-section-divider\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the spring of 2017, Gary Watts, the coroner for South Carolina’s Richland County, released the autopsy results for Davis Cripe, the teenager whose death spurred the state’s bill to ban sales of energy drinks to minors. The cause of death: a caffeine-induced cardiac event causing a probable arrythmia. “Typically you don’t see the results of an arrythmia in an actual autopsy because there’s no real damage to the heart,” Watts said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter Cripe \u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2017/05/16/a-teen-chugged-a-latte-a-mountain-dew-and-an-energy-drink-the-caffeine-binge-led-to-his-death/?utm_term=.ada10d7e1884\"\u003ecollapsed\u003c/a\u003e at school, a staff member who had previously worked as a nurse in a cardiac unit diagnosed a cardiac arrhythmia.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Who’s to say that this hasn’t happened before?” says Watts, whose office has performed autopsies on other young adults who died of sudden death. “It probably has—it’s just that we’ve not been able to document [the cause] with someone on the scene at the time who says, ‘Okay, this is an arrhythmia.’” Watts believes there are too many uncertainties about energy drinks to say that they are safe for adolescents. “I’m not trying to get rid of energy drinks,” he said. “I know a lot of people use them. But I do think that the age is a concern that everybody needs to be really serious about.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs for the Connecticut bill, it has not moved out of committee, but in mid-May, the City Hill Middle School students and their teacher returned to the state capital to lobby lawmakers. They shared informational brochures created by the students, as well as informal results from a survey of students and parents, indicating widespread support for their bill among the latter. In the meantime, the students say, their siblings and peers continue to consume energy drinks—on soccer fields, in dugouts, and in front of video-game consoles.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“It’s so interesting,” a City Hill student, Emily Fine, said of energy-drink makers and their products, “how they still put them on the market.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" src=\"https://logs-01.loggly.com/inputs/4a05953f-1607-4284-825e-7df393822342.gif?postid=52405\u0026amp;title=In-the-Energy-Drink-Market,-Advertising-and-Science-Collide\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/lVJuUtBwWbE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/lVJuUtBwWbE/","published":"2019-06-30T12:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-592657"}]},{"url":"https://feeds.feedburner.com/time/topstories?format=xml","items":[{"title":"President Trump Set for 3rd Meeting With Kim Jong Un at Korean DMZ Sunday","content":"\u003caside class=\"right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad\" id=\"right-rail__ad-5617876\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module\" data-src=\"https://time.com/5617876/donald-trump-kim-jong-un-meeting-dmz/\" data-widget-id=\"SB_2\" data-ob-template=\"timemag\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(SEOUL, South Korea) \u0026mdash; President Donald Trump will meet Sunday with North Korea\u0026#8217;s Kim Jong Un at the \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/a70c1c608e07478597aa1ffdfa900ea9\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003eDemilitarized Zone\u003c/a\u003e separating the North and South, a day after he issued an unprecedented invitation and expressed willingness to cross the border for what would be a history-making photo op.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in announced that Kim accepted Trump\u0026#8217;s invitation to meet when the U.S. president visits the heavily fortified site at the Korean border village of Panmunjom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoon praised the two leaders for \u0026#8220;being so brave\u0026#8221; to hold the meeting and said, \u0026#8220;I hope President Trump will go down in history as the president who achieves peace on Korean Peninsula.\u0026#8221;\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrump said he looked forward to meeting with Kim, but sought to tamp down expectations, predicting it would be \u0026#8220;very short,\u0026#8221; he said. \u0026#8220;Virtually a handshake, but that\u0026#8217;s OK.

And that pattern has, in turn, made the show as predictable as any of the movie or comic book franchises its young characters treasure. The same predictability makes these properties a safe bet for those who stand to profit off them as well as those who consume them like so much audiovisual comfort food. For those who\u0026#8217;d prefer our entertainment to challenge us a bit, at least season 3 improves upon the recycled plots and warmed-over Upside Down mythology of season 2.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEleven (Millie Bobby Brown) and Mike (Finn Wolfhard, better every season) are now an item, terrifying her surrogate dad Hopper (David Harbour) with their hilariously chaste kissing. With Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin) still seeing Max (Sadie Sink) and Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo) pining for his nerd-camp girlfriend Suzie, who may or may not be real, only Will (Noah Schnapp) would rather play D\u0026amp;D than go on dates.

Steve (Joe Keery, still a very good sport) has a gig scooping ice cream\u0026mdash;in an extremely silly sailor suit\u0026mdash;at the mall; his inevitable love interest is mouthy co-worker Robin (Maya Hawke). Max\u0026rsquo;s hot, cruel stepbrother Billy (Dacre Montgomery) is a lifeguard at the local pool, obviously.

Battling supernatural forces turns out to be the perfect catalyst for various adolescent rites of passage. Teamwork is paramount. Kids (particularly Lucas\u0026rsquo; flamboyantly pro-capitalist 10-year-old sister Erica, played by Priah Ferguson) say adorable things. The finale is bittersweet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough it still doesn\u0026rsquo;t have the freshness of the first installment \u003cem\u003eStranger Things\u003c/em\u003e, the new season marks an improvement over its predecessor, which essentially rehashed the original plot with a bigger budget and an absurd episode that sent El to Chicago. Hawkins National Laboratory is a ruin. Creators the Duffer Brothers wisely sidestep the narratively exhausted Upside Down. An ever-growing cast gives them the bandwidth to establish roughly five simultaneous storylines that feel novel for the show, if not for \u0026rsquo;80s-nostalgia culture at large.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat complexity does create some problems for the show. Especially in the first few episodes, there\u0026rsquo;s just too much happening. Lots of excessively long action sequences not only get repetitive, but also push most character beats to the beginning and end of the season.

What\u0026rsquo;s notable is that it makes \u003cem\u003eStranger Things\u003c/em\u003e more than just a TV show. It\u0026rsquo;s a franchise. And franchises thrive on consistency. Before you buy tickets for a \u003ca href=\"https://time.com/5572834/marvel-movies-ranked/\" \u003eMarvel movie\u003c/a\u003e, you have a pretty good sense of how it will unfold; before you walk into a Burger King, you have a pretty good idea of how your burger will taste.

Along with consistency\u0026mdash;seasons that keep scaling up the original concept, like sequels, instead of broadening and deepening the ongoing story, like good TV\u0026mdash;it offers the salve of nostalgia. Even more than the callbacks to Spielberg and \u003cem\u003eStar Wars\u003c/em\u003e, it\u0026rsquo;s the way the Duffers enshrine the community spaces of the recent past, ugly and commercial though they often were, that resonates. As a \u003cem\u003eStranger Things\u003c/em\u003e skeptic, season 3 brought me the most pleasure in its many scenes set amid the harshly lit mall corridors, sticky multiplexes, public pools and country fairs where I was among the last micro-generation of tweens to run wild in the mid-\u0026rsquo;90s. Some of these places still exist, sure, but they\u0026rsquo;re no longer the bustling hotspots they were in the 20th century. Too many of us would prefer to shop, socialize and watch online. (Will the ironies of Netflix never cease?)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo it\u0026rsquo;s those imperfect, de facto public squares (which, as the show also notes this season, themselves replaced postwar America\u0026rsquo;s literal town squares) that have started to resemble the Chernobyl evacuation zone. \u003cem\u003eStranger Things\u003c/em\u003e allows us to escape that desolation, into an idealized \u0026rsquo;80s that isn\u0026rsquo;t too much different from the retro virtual fantasia of the beloved \u003cem\u003eBlack Mirror \u003c/em\u003eepisode \u0026ldquo;San Junipero.\u0026rdquo; It\u0026rsquo;s a thin imitation of what we used to have, who could blame anyone for clinging to it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/time/topstories/~4/0mveE0tKUtc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/0mveE0tKUtc/","published":"2019-06-30T07:01:59Z","guid":"http://time.com/?p=5617328"},{"title":"President Trump and Kim Jong Un Shake Hands at Korean DMZ at Impromptu Meeting","content":"\u003caside class=\"right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad\" id=\"right-rail__ad-5617892\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module\" data-src=\"https://time.com/5617892/donald-trump-kim-jong-un-shake-hands-dmz/\" data-widget-id=\"SB_2\" data-ob-template=\"timemag\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(PANMUNJOM, Korea) \u0026mdash; With wide grins and a historic handshake, President Donald Trump and North Korea\u0026#8217;s Kim Jong Un met at the heavily fortified \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/a70c1c608e07478597aa1ffdfa900ea9\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003eDemilitarized Zone\u003c/a\u003e on Sunday and agreed to \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/16ab358edc8e44c88438a3735a8b7168\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003erevive talks\u003c/a\u003e on the pariah nation\u0026#8217;s nuclear program.

And yet, as my colleague Emily VanDerWerff noted in her \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/10/27/16548566/stranger-things-season-2-review-spoilers\"\u003eseason two review\u003c/a\u003e, “when it works, it works.

I enjoyed \u003cem\u003eStranger Things 3\u003c/em\u003e much more than \u003cem\u003eStranger Things 2\u003c/em\u003e, and for the most part, I feel like the series’ creators, the Duffer brothers, were paying sharp attention to their critics. Most of season two’s flaws and frustrations have been ironed out in satisfying and interesting ways in season three. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-float-right\"\u003e\u003caside id=\"iCd57s\"\u003e\u003cdiv data-anthem-component=\"ratingcard\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"rating\":3.5,\"title\":\"Stranger Things season 3\"}'\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"59Acz9\"\u003eThis time around, however, a new set of problems arises — and weirdly enough, a lot of them don’t concern the story itself, but the show’s aesthetic and technical choices. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"cKIRgP\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eStranger Things\u003c/em\u003e doesn’t usually struggle with those elements; more often, its aesthetics help smooth over the moments when the narrative gets stuck and starts spinning its wheels. But season three’s plot journey is actually pretty engaging — except when it’s handwaving the larger questions it raises and relying on technical tricks to distract us. As a result, the story feels more stuck in place than it really is. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"FYUrfS\"\u003eDon’t get me wrong, \u003cem\u003eStranger Things\u003c/em\u003e is still as slick and stylish as ever; season three really feels like the cover of an ‘80s pulp horror novel, in the best way. But I sure didn’t expect to be criticizing the show for suddenly developing a cinematic tic that makes it seem more narratively discombobulated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"gd6d6S\"\u003eThe positive side is that for viewers whose main concern is hanging out with the kids of Hawkins and enjoying the quirky, nostalgia-laced humor and fun that \u003cem\u003eStranger Things\u003c/em\u003e excels at, season three is pretty much on top of its game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"N5CnRy\"\u003eHere’s a spoiler-free rundown of what’s good, what’s bad, and what’s somewhere in between about season three.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"XvYD96\"\u003eGood: the main cast is divided into smaller groups again — but this time, it’s engaging and makes emotional sense\u003c/h3\u003e\n  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5UMz_3eY3UhB7ghBGN2sOZ7KH-c=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16684589/st1.jpg\"\u003e\n      \u003ccite\u003eNetflix\u003c/cite\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003eWeekly D\u0026amp;D campaigns are getting more difficult.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"sowMxL\"\u003eOne of reasons \u003cem\u003eStranger Things 2\u003c/em\u003e was frustrating was that for most of the season, characters were siloed away from each other, pretty inexplicably. Eleven went on a random quest while Hopper was incapacitated, with no larger plot ramifications; her adventure gave us interesting character backstory, but mainly seemed designed to delay the inevitable showdown between El and the season’s Big Bad, a giant spider-thing known as the Mind Flayer. Meanwhile, Nancy and Jonathan were off in their own totally separate subplot, and it felt largely tangential and inessential relative to the main action.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ntcMMS\"\u003eBut \u003cem\u003eStranger Things\u003c/em\u003e has figured out how to fix this issue in season three! The show once again takes a creative risk by splitting up its main cast, but this time, the separate groupings are clearly grounded in emotional logic: Characters are growing, changing, exploring new relationships, and embarking on new phases of their lives, and it’s all good. We get to see our faves interacting with new characters and each other in interesting new ways. It’s fun, and it generally feels like forward momentum for everyone in a way that season two couldn’t offer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"7ZbRLS\"\u003eMostly good: season 3’s plot actually feels like a plot, and its various strands are far more integrated than season 2’s\u003c/h3\u003e\n  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5nD6-xIe-otUHWo_YVo6MzOaAS0=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16684596/st5.jpg\"\u003e\n      \u003ccite\u003eNetflix\u003c/cite\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003eSteve and Dustin have spotted a plot point!\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"jsOty7\"\u003eThe narrative of season three is still split between different subplots, but they’re all obviously connected to each other from the start. This creates a level of urgency around the fact that no one is able to communicate with each other due to a mix of technical issues and/or frequent states of peril, or aware that they \u003cem\u003eshould\u003c/em\u003e be communicating, since they don’t know their various dilemmas are all connected. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"b2PVPT\"\u003eAnd the subplots are fun! Although the writing in season three feels heavier and less breezy than before, its narrative feels more substantive and interesting. The cheesy, \u003cem\u003eRed Dawn\u003c/em\u003e-influenced plot is instantly more memorable than whatever the hell happened in season two, and while it’s imperfect, it’s also entertaining. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"tMR4bC\"\u003eThere \u003cem\u003eis\u003c/em\u003e one major flaw with the plot, in that the show mostly neglects to provide any larger reasoning for it. But that’s mostly fine — because by the final moments, we realize that it serves as scaffolding for ongoing plot developments in future seasons. Granted, it’s a toss-up as to whether \u003cem\u003eStranger Things\u003c/em\u003e will be able to successfully expand its story; the show might ultimately choose to just ignore any loose threads from this season, the way it seems to have largely jettisoned the US military’s covert interest in Hawkins from last season. But let’s be real: If you’re into \u003cem\u003eStranger Things\u003c/em\u003e for the vast military cover-ups, you’re probably watching it wrong. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"puiZ6V\"\u003eBad: the pacing frequently lags, and WHAT IS UP WITH THE EDITING?\u003c/h3\u003e\n  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3srJw8UKwXeuxJzgBe4LnxlpOFs=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16684623/st7.jpg\"\u003e\n      \u003ccite\u003eCourtesy of Netflix\u003c/cite\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003eYeah, we’re confused, too, kids.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"TeH2PE\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eStranger Things\u003c/em\u003e’ season three editing is erratic at best. It relies so much on flashbacks — either to scenes from season two, or to scenes that literally just happened in the previous episode — that I felt not only condescended to as a viewer, but slightly confused about why so much time was devoted to showing us things we’d already seen. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"nWVKLo\"\u003eOn top of the flashbacks, the editing frequently jumps confusingly between cross-current action sequences in different locations, in ways that create avoidable narrative confusion rather than suspense. At times, the cross-cutting is used to gloss over how characters got from point A to point B, and while a certain amount of this is acceptable, there are a couple of instances where it jolted me out of the story completely and I actually wound up rewinding to make sure I hadn’t missed anything. When your edits confuse your audience instead of moving the story along, that’s a problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"nKb1Rv\"\u003eAnd I’m not done! In addition to the flashbacks and the narratively confusing cross-cuts, the editing also deliberately suspends our temporal location. It occasionally jumps \u003cem\u003ebackwards \u003c/em\u003ein time by a few minutes to pick back up with scenes we just saw, returning to characters who are still exactly where we last saw them, even though the narrative has jumped to simultaneous action occurring somewhere else and carried \u003cem\u003ethat\u003c/em\u003e action forward. In other words, when the cross-cutting isn’t skipping over several narrative steps in an action sequence, it’s keeping characters in place without \u003cem\u003eany\u003c/em\u003e action. The effect is disorienting, but to no greater emotional or narrative purpose. It just feels lazy, confusing, uninspired, and inexplicable. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Tk74Pq\"\u003eThe consequence of all these edits is that the pacing frequently stutters, and in fact sometimes grinds to a halt. Since the flashbacks and cross-cuts carry zero emotional weight — even when they’re meant to — the whole project occasionally feels like a tedious cinematic experiment. But it also doesn’t help that the season’s writing frequently cycles back through things we’ve seen before, to no apparent point. There’s only so many times, for example, that Will can slap the back of his neck and feel the sensation of the Mind Flayer still being around before it starts to feel like \u003cem\u003eStranger Things\u003c/em\u003e is just having him do this out of narrative laziness rather than putting in work to build dramatic tension. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"6QsQKx\"\u003eGreat: the cast is as sparkling and fun as ever...\u003c/h3\u003e\n  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Za-1bxW6FbsbDdUns7mMjYkgI4E=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16684648/st12.jpg\"\u003e\n      \u003ccite\u003eNetflix\u003c/cite\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003eRobin!

At times Wolfhard doesn’t quite seem to know what to do with himself, perhaps because the writing asks Mike to take on whole new levels of cluelessness regarding the state of his new, hot-and-steamy relationship with El. But Brown remains astoundingly good at everything she’s asked to do. Given how blatantly pain-filled Eleven’s life has been and continues to be, it’s a testament to what a tremendous actor she is that \u003cem\u003eStranger Things\u003c/em\u003e doesn’t feel more melodramatic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"AiuIQB\"\u003eMeanwhile, Gaten Matarazzo’s Dustin and Joe Keery’s \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/10/30/16569330/dad-steve-harrington-stranger-things-2-memes\"\u003eSteve Harrington, everyone’s favorite babysitter\u003c/a\u003e, are two of the show’s strongest comedic weapons, and the decision to keep them together at all times this season is a smart one. And the upbeat energy between the cast helps compensate for the season’s editing issues. One of the great things about \u003cem\u003eStranger Things\u003c/em\u003e is that it’s especially good at treating new characters like they’ve always been around. In season two, that mostly worked with new arrivals Max and Billy, though the show ultimately suffers in both season two \u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e season three by referencing but then glancing over their abusive home life without a lot of deeper scrutiny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"XIH7Nd\"\u003eWhere it \u003cem\u003ereally\u003c/em\u003e works in season three is with the arrival of new character Robin (\u003ca href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1638321/\"\u003eMaya Hawke\u003c/a\u003e), who finds herself mixed up with Hawkins’ zaniest friends group and proceeds to steal every scene she’s in. Deadpan and lowkey, she fits in effortlessly with her designated troop of mallrats: Steve, Dustin, and Lucas’s little sister Erica, whose own role is beefed up this season. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"wtqDzC\"\u003eBad: ...but most of the new side characters are kinda eh, whatever\u003c/h3\u003e\n  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/22mf00E9-Fx6spz3Bt3K2vx6Q6E=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16684605/st3.jpg\"\u003e\n      \u003ccite\u003eCourtesy of Netflix\u003c/cite\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003eRemember when Billy was a potentially interesting deconstruction of vaguely homoerotic masculine stereotypes of the ‘80s?

One character exists solely as a running Arnold Schwarzenegger joke, which is... fine? On the one hand, this is just what \u003cem\u003eStranger Things\u003c/em\u003e does, but on the other, between throwaway gags and disposable characters, the show spends a whole lot of time glancing over characterization and backstory that could have deepened the drama and our connection to the characters. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Vefhul\"\u003eAs I hinted above, this is especially notable in the case of Max and Billy, because they, for all intents and purposes, are still new characters, and Billy’s motivations and backstory in particular are largely still unknown to us. When we’re asked to accept parts of the plot that revolve around him in season three, we know so little about him that it seems like an unfair tradeoff. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"EpfS0P\"\u003eAnd the lack of emotional connection is especially obvious toward the end of the season, when narrative subthreads that should be moving us most seem to fizzle and resolve without much intensity at all. I found myself ‘eh, whatevering’ a couple of major plot spoilers, because \u003cem\u003eStranger Things\u003c/em\u003e just didn’t make me care enough even when I wanted to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"R7Y0b3\"\u003eBad: the jokes often feel forced — and the Starcourt Mall, season 3’s biggest comic backdrop, doesn’t fulfill its narrative potential\u003c/h3\u003e\n  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5__Veqdm9DGpQ2Q-ZtYCGW5esjo=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16684603/st10.jpg\"\u003e\n      \u003ccite\u003eCourtesy of Netflix\u003c/cite\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003eYep, they sure are in the mall!\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"vEJBmQ\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eStranger Things\u003c/em\u003e has definitely moved away from parroting familiar ‘80s tropes as closely as it once did, and while that’s a good thing, it seems to be relying even more on belaboring the ‘80s in-jokes it \u003cem\u003edoes\u003c/em\u003e include. It just doesn’t always work. While there’s still plenty of charm and amusement to be had, there are a few running jokes in season three that aren’t nearly as funny as \u003cem\u003eStranger Things\u003c/em\u003e would like them to be, and a couple of moments where the show’s patented throwbacks to ‘80s esoterica are downright cringeworthy. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"4xDpBQ\"\u003eThe biggest of these is Hawkins’ new mall, Starcourt, in all its colorful, funky detail. The mall functions as both a giant ‘80s throwback and a blatantly unsubtle commentary on corporate greed wreaking havoc on small-town America — season three’s anticapitalist undertones being an unexpectedly woke new addition to the show.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"BKuEYt\"\u003eBut what it isn’t is innovative. Although the setting of the mall food court and the retro logos of stores like the Gap and Sam Goody’s are fun to look at, after a while they’re just kinda there, and the mall starts to feel like a wasted opportunity. Even though a few climactic scenes that take place \u003cem\u003ein\u003c/em\u003e the mall, the show doesn’t really \u003cem\u003euse\u003c/em\u003e the mall. It’s the mall!

This still happens in season three, but the Duffers finally seem to have accepted that if they want to keep evolving and keep expanding \u003cem\u003eStranger Things\u003c/em\u003e’ cast, they can’t keep using El’s powers as the ultimate trump card. Plus, if you’re anything like me, you have spent far too much time thinking about how El’s nosebleeds can’t be great for her permanent neurological health, so the less she has to use her special abilities, the better!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"HxmK69\"\u003eThankfully, \u003cem\u003eStranger Things\u003c/em\u003e has well-established that its teen characters aren’t just any group of adolescents; they have tons of talent and smarts and resourcefulness to go around, even without El handy.

In season three, \u003cem\u003eStranger Things\u003c/em\u003e seems to have made a concerted effort to address many of those concerns — with caveats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"VyKoV7\"\u003eThe show finally has more than one female character per generation, and season three finally offers scenes where these characters bond over something other than a boy. The women on the show also have deeper relationships with each other in season three — though they also seem a little phoned-in. In particular, Nancy has a heart-to-heart with her mom that \u003cem\u003efeels\u003c/em\u003e like a stab at mother-daughter bonding, but is also the only scene they’ve had together, maybe ever? Shrugsies! It’s easy to feel the same way about the “girls bonding over Madonna and the local Claire’s” vibe that season three applies to Max and El’s new friendship — like \u003cem\u003eStranger Things\u003c/em\u003e couldn’t figure out what to do with two teen girls except send them to the mall. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"daEIJh\"\u003eMeanwhile, after two seasons in which her main role was to fret and be erratic, Joyce finally gets a chance to take charge of \u003cem\u003eher \u003c/em\u003eown subplot — though said subplot also kinda paints her as being as kooky and erratic as ever. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"O3fLo7\"\u003eStill, in one of the season’s more interesting arcs, Nancy gets her own ‘80s trope in the form of a \u003cem\u003eWorking Girl\u003c/em\u003e story that sees her tackling sexism at the local newspaper where she’s interning alongside Jonathan. The storyline lets \u003cem\u003eStranger Things\u003c/em\u003e pay lip service to a few progressive ideas about intersectionality and class and gender privileges. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"LHQxND\"\u003eAnd while it may sound like these themes and storylines are a bit shoehorned in — yeah, they are, but they represent far more effort than \u003cem\u003eStranger Things\u003c/em\u003e has bothered to expend on its women characters in the past. This effort is also applied to characters we’ve known for three seasons now, and \u003cem\u003eStranger Things\u003c/em\u003e is better than just about any other show at always caring about its characters and their happiness first and foremost. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"HhRNVn\"\u003eThat said, season three oddly loses sight of some of its best characters and their relationships. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"yBC5tZ\"\u003eBad: \u003cem\u003eStranger Things\u003c/em\u003e winds up undercutting some of its most crucial relationships\u003c/h3\u003e\n  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fmy7mLJu5cF4_MlmHGHXGih8mCo=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16684688/st14.jpg\"\u003e\n      \u003ccite\u003eCourtesy of Netflix\u003c/cite\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003eWe stan an ace king, Will Byers!\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"5c1dcU\"\u003eThe Duffer Brothers have said in the past that they \u003ca href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/stranger-things-creators-break-down-season-2s-eleven-story-1053344\"\u003erecognized how good\u003c/a\u003e the chemistry is between Eleven and Chief Hopper, so it’s strange that they deliberately keep the two apart for most of season three. It’s not as if the storyline really demands this; instead, it frequently feels like the show just didn’t know what to do with Hopper, in particular, or with El and Hopper together, so it separated them instead. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"EuTRuj\"\u003eIn fact, season three seems to shrug at multiple character relationships; it’s forgivable, for example, if you’ve forgotten which siblings were related and whose parents the season is following around, because the main families don’t spend any time reinforcing their family bonds. Granted, the show has always been more focused on its main group of teens and their friendships, and some of the show’s best emotional moments this season revolve around watching the kids clash and deal with the reality that they’re growing up and, in some cases, growing apart.

Issues that had formerly been decided behind closed doors were discussed openly; matters that had once been determined by experts were made subject to the popular will.

It was an historic moment, as no sitting US president had ever been in North Korea before. However, it was also additional evidence that Trump is the consummate reality TV star, more entertainer than diplomat, an orchestrator of seemingly spontaneous moments that make for a great show but are likely scripted and offer little in the way of substance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe meeting allegedly arose as a result of \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1144740178948493314\"\u003ea Trump tweet\u003c/a\u003e on June 28, while he was in Japan at the G20 conference.

Ahead of the meeting, Trump told reporters about Kim, \u0026#8220;We’ve developed a very good relationship and we understand each other very well. I do believe he understands me, and I think I maybe understand him, and sometimes that can lead to very good things.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut experts are highly skeptical of the claim that the meeting really was spontaneous or that it will yield \u0026#8220;good things,\u0026#8221; specifically North Korean denuclearization.

I make no judgements about his personal commitment to neo-Pentecostal values. Nevertheless, my research shows that members of these churches recognised in Zuma’s reckless spending behaviour, his uncompromising fight against dark “enemies” and his political invincibility, the marks of a “blessed” man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA very specific neo-Pentecostal religious ethic can be recognised in Zuma’s unapologetic conspicuous consumption and how he and his supporters have reacted to his travails. Unlike the Puritan (productionist) ethic that often informs critiques of conspicuous consumption, the neo-Pentecostal ethic is consumerist in its focus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s an ethic that demands of its subscribers that they consume conspicuously and without “shame” as \u003ca href=\"https://witspress.co.za/catalogue/a-church-of-strangers/\"\u003e“blessed” Christians\u003c/a\u003e. At the same time, they have to wage spiritual war on those who undermine their “good fortune”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeo-Pentecostalism found enormous traction in many African countries from the late 1970s onwards.

For example, you\u0026#8217;ll discover that in Canada in the past year, folks have most wanted to know whether they can marry themselves, which raises some follow-up questions, like, \u0026#8220;What the hell?!\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe software service company SEM Rush, based in Boston, compiled data on what people in the US, the UK, and Canada were asking Google between May 2018 and May 2019. The compilation is focused on questions that begin with the phrase, \u0026#8220;is it legal to\u0026#8230;\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt turns out that there is some overlap in concern among people in the three regions, but also some interesting differences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Canada, an average of 190 people per month asked if it was legal to marry yourself. Indeed, this was the most common legal query in the nation, whereas in the US and the UK, this question never comes up. But the Brits are most interested in a related question, asking—more than 1,800 times a month on average—whether it\u0026#8217;s legal to marry a cousin, a query that Americans ask on average more than 1,100 times a month when combining questions about first cousins and cousins generally. Canadians ask about wedding a cousin—first and otherwise—on average 253 times a month.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the US, the most common question was, \u0026#8220;Is it legal to buy edibles online?\u0026#8221; The question about food products made with marijuana was posed an average of 1,800 times a month. Given the variations between state laws and the federal prohibition on cannabis, the query is reasonable. In Canada, where cannabis is legal, that question comes up an average of 252 times per month. In the UK, weed is illegal and edibles aren\u0026#8217;t as much of a concern apparently. The question ranks 29 on the list of most common queries, asked about 105 times per month.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInterestingly, in both the US and UK, people really want to know if they can drive barefoot legally. This was the second most common query in both countries, with Americans posing the question about 800 times a month and Brits asking about 400 times in the same period. Canadians are much less concerned with the legality of driving barefoot, however—the question ranked 20th on their list and was posed only about 50 times per month.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps telling is the fact that Americans also asked a lot about whether it is legal to sleep in a car, an option some homeless people are forced to resort to. It was the third most asked US question, averaging about 780 queries a month. In the UK, this question was the 11th most common query, asked about 200 times a month, while the third most asked question was whether it\u0026#8217;s legal to stop a father from seeing their children. In Canada, the legality of sleeping in a car was 22nd on the national list, asked about 50 times a month.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone seems to be interested in whether they can record conversations legally. In Canada, questions related to recording conversations and phone calls without consent were the fifth, sixth, and seventh most common queries, amounting to an average of 385 questions per month. In the UK, the fourth most common query, posed an average of about 350 times a month, was whether it\u0026#8217;s legal to record a conversation. And in the US, this was the sixth most common query, asked about 675 times per month, with an additional 400 or so queries monthly asking about recording phone calls specifically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso notable, hundreds of Americans and dozens of Canadians every month inquire into the legality of owning a wolf. In Britain, about 100 people per month want to know if it\u0026#8217;s legal to own a pet fox.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://qz.com/1655758/legal-questions-americans-canadians-and-brits-ask-google-most/","published":"2019-06-30T15:04:32Z","guid":"https://qz.com/1655758//"},{"title":"Facebook’s Libra is spurring central banks’ interest in issuing cryptocurrency","content":"\u003cimg width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/libra.jpeg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;w=1024\" class=\"attachment-medium_10 size-medium_10 wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/libra.jpeg 3877w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/libra.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/libra.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/libra.jpeg?resize=160,90 160w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/libra.jpeg?resize=320,180 320w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/libra.jpeg?resize=640,360 640w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/libra.jpeg?resize=940,529 940w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/libra.jpeg?resize=1600,900 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Bank for International Settlements (BIS) in Basel, Switzerland is the bank for global central bankers. It\u0026#8217;s the stodgiest of stodgy institutions, in other words, and it\u0026#8217;s been slow-moving when it comes to cryptocurrency. Now it appears to be picking up the pace, however, spurred by \u003ca href=\"https://qz.com/1655319/the-winners-and-losers-of-facebooks-libra/\"\u003eFacebook\u0026#8217;s announcement this month\u003c/a\u003e that it plans to issue a digital currency called Libra.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn March, BIS chief Agustín Carstens said that central banks were “\u003ca href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/central-banks-see-no-value-in-issuing-digital-currency-bis-chief\"\u003enot seeing the value\u003c/a\u003e” in creating a central bank digital currency. Now, Carstens is doing an about face.

Carstens also told the \u003ca href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/428a0b20-99b0-11e9-9573-ee5cbb98ed36\"\u003eFinancial Times\u003c/a\u003e (paywall) that the BIS is working with central banks that are developing digital currencies. “Many central banks are working on it; we are working on it, supporting them. And it might be that it is sooner than we think that there is a market and we need to be able to provide central bank digital currencies.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe BIS report expresses concerns about big tech\u0026#8217;s entrance into finance in recent years, noting that the amount of data that giants like Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Alibaba amass pose a threat to privacy and disadvantage big banks, thereby also potentially globally undermining economic stability. Given the companies\u0026#8217; increased interest in finance—tech firms are involved in everything from offering credit to lending money to issuing currencies—they are a force to contend with, it adds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn light of this, the BIS is planning to start an innovation hub for financial technology. Switzerland, Hong Kong, and Singapore, in collaboration with their respective monetary policy officials, will all set up fintech innovation hubs to explore the territory, \u003ca href=\"https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/bis-starts-fintech-hub-as-central-banks-look-into-crypto/45066928\"\u003eSwissInfo reports\u003c/a\u003e.

The most consistent and promising approach to tackling this huge obstacle to development has come with the off-grid pay-as-you-go solar power model, now called PayGo. The sector started out in East Africa built around combining the improving and increasingly cost-effective solar technology with the region\u0026#8217;s mobile money advantage, thanks to the successful reach of Safaricom\u0026#8217;s M-Pesa in Kenya.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCompanies like Nairobi-based M-Kopa, who we \u003ca href=\"https://vimeo.com/343640023\"\u003espoke with recently\u003c/a\u003e at the Collision conference in Toronto, have signed up 750,000 homes in the region on the back of that payment platform which has been key for also enabling users to obtain credit and manage their payments. \u0026#8220;The energy is kind of the easy part,\u0026#8221; acknowledged chief executive Jesse Moore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso on the \u003ca href=\"https://vimeo.com/343640023\"\u003epanel\u003c/a\u003e with Moore in Toronto was the musician Akon, who has famously been building a solar power business for a few years in several African countries.

The Sekishoin Shukubo guesthouse lets visitors stay at the temple and experience conditions similar to those of the monks.

Cancer season is a quiet time of year for you, a period of resting up before your season begins, but as macho Mars enters your sign, you're feeling revived, ready to pick a fight, and get things done. Being that you're the sign of royalty, you occasionally intimidate people—expect others to be even more struck by your presence when Mars is in your sign! \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDon't rush to take action—patience is the best thing for you this month, Leo, especially considering the solar eclipse in Cancer on July 2. This is an emotionally charged moment for you, and you will want plenty of rest. You have a huge heart and aren't the sort of person who's afraid of big emotions, but you'll want a minute to sit and soothe yourself. Eclipses are emotionally turbulent times when reveals take place and our paths fork. Big decisions are made, and changes we couldn’t expect—or that we didn’t ask for—take place, too. This eclipse stirs up hidden and secret things for you, Leo, revealing parts of yourself that you haven’t been able to look at for a long time.

When Mercury reenters Cancer on July 19, you may find yourself especially forgetful, so keep track of your to-do lists and double check your work.

If you've overloaded your schedule, something will have to go. You may be wrapping up a project at this time, or finding that you're being removed from one. Either way, something you've been building is finally wrapping up, and considering the eclipses and Mercury retrograde, you'd be wise to keep the empty space in your calendar empty should unexpected tasks and responsibilities fall on your lap (and they probably will—both the eclipses and Mercury retrograde are famous for surprises!).\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe sun connects with Neptune in Pisces and Mars squares off with Uranus on July 11, bringing surprises at work and finding you eager to tackle a goal you're excited about—or end a journey you're no longer interested in pursuing. You're in a creative mood and certainly benefiting from any time off—being able to stay flexible and play things by ear is the best way to work this month's energy. Watch out for drama at work or feeling especially overwhelmed by your duties as the sun opposes Pluto on July 14. Power struggles take place! Watch out for manipulators and bring in a third party to help mediate tricky situations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSecrets are exposed on July 16, thanks to the lunar eclipse in Capricorn, which will also bring a major shift in your day job.

As the light of the full moon shines down on the sector of your chart that rules your daily routines and rituals, you'll see things in a whole new way! Big shifts in power occur at this time. This eclipse is in Capricorn, a sign that works hard for what it's got—if someone hasn't been keeping up with their responsibilities, this won't be an easy eclipse for them, and you may find yourself sitting next to someone new in the office.

Make time to rest between chores and don't put too much pressure on yourself. Easier energy flows as Venus connects with Neptune on July 18—magic is in the air and it's a lovely occasion to lose track of time with a lover, or if you're in a more private mood, to go within and connect with your inner voice through meditation or journaling. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYour intuition kicks up a notch as Mercury reenters Cancer during its retrograde journey on July 19, so watch out for the messages that arrive in your dreams, and in the real world, for confusing issues that may resurface.

As the sun enters your sign, you're feeling reinvigorated. It's a great time to asses your goals and reflect on all you've accomplished in the last year and where you want to be this time next year. Mercury retrograde meets Venus on July 24, creating a gentle energy for communication—however, you're in a very private mood and you'll likely find yourself wanting to connect with people on a smaller scale, like an intimate dinner. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is, until the energy picks up when action planet Mars connects with Jupiter in Sagittarius on July 25—you'll have plenty of stamina to party all night then!

The new moon in your sign starts a new cycle in your life, and it's a wonderful time to reconnect with your heart's desires and focus on nourishing yourself. What you want today is so different from what you wanted last year, or even a few months ago. Use the new moon energy to play around with ideas of what you want for yourself in the future, because this is a potent time for manifestation.

Good luck this month, Leo, and see you in August! \u003c/p\u003e","url":"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/zmpwde/monthly-horoscope-leo-july-2019","published":"2019-06-30T18:51:37Z","guid":"zmpwde"},{"title":"Monthly Horoscope: Cancer, July 2019","content":"\u003cp\u003e \u003cb\u003e Download the \u003ca href=\"https://c.singular.net/api/v1/ad?st=349017103682\u0026h=20846e7439206e6ddc7283e0832ec907cd2b45bc\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAstro Guide app\u003c/a\u003e by VICE on an iOS device to read daily horoscopes personalized for your sun, moon, and rising signs, and learn how to apply cosmic events to self care, your friendships, and relationships.\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cdiv class=\"article__media--image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1558478940580-Articles-970x250.jpeg\" alt=\"Astro Guide app banner\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp class=\"article__text--dropcap\"\u003eHappy solar return, Cancer! I hope you're celebrating another year around the sun by spending time with your favorite people, eating your favorite foods, and enjoying yourself! Unless, of course, you're more in the mood to hide in your shell and rest quietly away from the crowd. You're entitled to do whatever you like on your birthday and don't need to party a certain way just because that's what's expected of you! \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou're a nurturing water sign, and the fact is, many things you do, you do for the good of everyone—you care deeply about your family, and I don't just mean your blood relatives, but your chosen friends and partners, too. Whatever you do for your birthday this year, make sure it's in celebration of you, not just what you think would appease the many people in your life. I also want you to be borderline demanding about gifts this year. Let your friends know exactly which blender you expect to see sitting pretty with a bow on your kitchen counter this year. And be demanding when it comes to asking for a raise, too! You deserve great things, dear Cancer, and action planet Mars agrees as it enters proud, regal Leo on July 1, adorning you with a crown and urging you to fight for what you deserve. This isn't about being greedy—it's about knowing your worth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eIt’s a great time to reconnect with your people.

No one is immune to the power of eclipses, which are critical turning points that interrupt our lives and redirect us toward our destiny—the harder you cling to what's not working, the worse things will be! But because you are ruled by the moon, eclipses (which are basically super-charged new and full moons) are especially potent for you, dear crab. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe first eclipse this month is in Cancer on July 2. The last time there were solar eclipses in your sign were 2009, 2010, and 2011, and now, nearly a decade later, you're looking at all you have accomplished and likely reconnecting with parts of yourself from those times, as you realize that a new cycle is beginning for you. This is a turbulent and emotional period, and you're being asked to look at yourself in deep and profound ways that may feel unusual or even uncomfortable. A major fresh start is coming, but it will require letting go of the past, and letting go of versions of yourself that you've outgrown.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYou're feeling especially sexy and creative as Venus enters your sign on July 3. In addition to feeling much more flirtatious than you have been recently, this is also a fantastic time to update your wardrobe. Venus is all about harmony, and while it's certainly the planet of beauty, it isn't a superficial planet. Venus also rules our values, and as it moves through your sign, you'll find yourself reconnecting with your own values and realizing new things that are important to you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eTake some advice from these founders and executives on \u003ca href=\"http://astroguide.link/ydu\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehow to ask for a raise\u003c/a\u003e—and actually get one.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e Reuniting with old friends?

This will be especially true for topics in the realm of finance. Mercury retrograde is famous for delays and technical difficulties, so this isn't an ideal time to sign a contract or work on something new. Be especially careful of where you place your wallet and valuable belongings. That said, something that's been missing may turn up now! \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMercury is retrograde in Leo until July 19, when it will reenter your sign, finding you reconsidering some of the ideas and decisions you've made. Mercury retrograde finally ends on July 30, but until then, take it slow and don't overcommit yourself. My advice? Resting and work on projects that you've put on the back burner instead of starting new ones. During this retrograde, running into people from your past is also likely. This can be pretty exciting as you have so much ground to cover in a catching-up session!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eVenus connects with Uranus in Taurus and Mercury retrograde meets Mars in Leo on July 8, bringing you exciting social connections and finding you sorting out your budget. You're itching for freedom, and financial security will help you take risks without stressing out too much. Mercury's meeting with Mars urges you to ask for what you need—especially if you missed your last opportunity to do so! Mercury retrogrades are annoying, but they also give us another chance! Just watch out for obstacles, especially in your relationships, as the sun opposes Saturn on July 9—a grumpy energy is in the air. Do your best to be responsible and mature on this day. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe mood is especially impulsive as the sun connects with Neptune and Mars squares off with Uranus on July 11—keep your spending in check, and be mindful of unexpected tempers. The sun opposes Pluto in Capricorn on July 14, which is a sensitive day for power struggles and control issues, especially within relationships. However, an amazing transformation may take place if you and your partners are open to confronting the truth about something rather than sticking your heads in the sand.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eGain clarity by documenting your thoughts and desires in this beautiful, \u003ca href=\"https://fave.co/2RmF3j3\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eastrology-themed journal\u003c/a\u003e—then decide how they fit into your transformation.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e Letting go of the past isn’t easy for you, but this adorable book by Marie Kondo (\u003ca href=\"https://fave.co/2x1MtiA\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ein Manga form\u003c/a\u003e!) can be your guide.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e Feel good about refreshing your wardrobe with some pieces from a \u003ca href=\"https://fave.co/2WM4ADz\" target=\"_blank\"\u003econscious, curated fashion\u003c/a\u003e retailer that sources sustainable pieces from local artisans.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBrush up on the basics of how to do \u003ca href=\"https://fave.co/2WRiRTm\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emore than just scrape by\u003c/a\u003e in your personal finances. Cancers are fantastic at saving once they have a plan in place!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe second eclipse of the month is the lunar eclipse in your opposite sign Capricorn, which arrives on July 16 and brings a critical turning point in your relationships. You're seeing things in a way, and the perspective offered now is unlike any you've witnessed before. This is a profound period for release, especially when it comes to your expectations of others and your partnerships. During this time, you'll see who you can rely on and may be let down by others. This eclipse asks you to get real about your needs and boundaries because that's the only way you'll get the kinds of partnerships—romantic or otherwise—that are healthy and happy. The energy is highly emotional, so make space for yourself to feel your feelings. Don't overbook or overwork yourself, Cancer! \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou might be ending an important relationship at this time, but with each closing door, a new one opens, and what you release during this eclipse will make room for something new. Things are changing now, and resisting the transformation will leave you depleted. This doesn't mean you have to go through this alone—it's an especially potent time for any sort of therapy, and a great time to call on the wisdom of elders and help from friends who've been through what you're going through now. Even if a relationship isn't ending, a major climax will be reached that forever transforms how you hold space and care for each other.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eVenus opposes Saturn in Capricorn on July 17 and connects with Neptune in Pisces on July 18, and conflicting energy abounds. On one hand, you're eager to know what the heck is going on in your relationships and sort out commitments, but on the other, you know that at this time, it's best to go with the flow, explore your feelings, and see what's out there. The energy could feel quite cold at this time. Don't force any conversations just yet, especially as Mercury retrograde reenters Cancer on July 19—just let yourself think and feel. If you can be patient, you will discover who shares your values (again, an important theme as Cancer moves through your sign) and who you should explore the world with. On July 21, an especially intense climax in your relationship is reached as Venus opposes Pluto (watch out for jealousy and possessiveness!), and critical information is shared as the sun meets Mercury retrograde.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eTap into your sexy, flirtatious side with \u003ca href=\"https://fave.co/2x1o2Sn\" target=\"_blank\"\u003elingerie or swimwear\u003c/a\u003e from an inclusive brand with fashion-forward designs that aim to flatter every shape.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e Prepare for more frazzled days by \u003ca href=\"https://fave.co/2RvtdDz\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eputting locators on your keys\u003c/a\u003e, wallet and other easily lost things, especially during Mercury retrograde.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e If you need to talk to someone but aren’t ready or able to try therapy, \u003ca href=\"https://fave.co/2RlQAPC\" target=\"_blank\"\u003etalking to someone online\u003c/a\u003e might help.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eLike your ruling planet, the Moon, you have phases, and pacing yourself is the key to success.

Mercury retrograde meets with Venus on July 24, making this an especially social and flirtatious time. However, as always with Mercury retrograde, be mindful of delays, miscommunications, rescheduling, and chance encounters with people from your past. Mars connects with Jupiter in Sagittarius on July 25, creating an especially productive energy for finances and your day job, and it's a fantastic time to power through your to-do list—especially the items that have been waiting a long time to grab your attention! \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEven more blessings arrive in the financial sector of your chart as Venus enters Leo on July 27. The sun squares off with Uranus on July 29, bringing big surprises, especially in your social life. You'll be shocked to discover what's important to you at this time—your vision of the future is evolving. You're also intensely craving freedom, so expect to need some space at this time. The month wraps up with a new moon in Leo and the end of Mercury retrograde on July 31, igniting a new cycle of growth and abundance and pushing conversations forward. Good luck this month, Cancer, and see you in August!\u003c/p\u003e","url":"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ywyqe7/monthly-horoscope-cancer-july-2019","published":"2019-06-30T18:20:31Z","guid":"ywyqe7"}]},{"url":"https://feeds.gothamistllc.com/gothamist05","items":[{"title":"Photos: 27th Annual Dyke March Brings Tens Of Thousands To Fifth Avenue","content":"","url":"http://gothamist.com/2019/06/30/photos_dyke_march_2019.php","published":"2019-06-30T08:52:33-05:00","guid":"http://gothamist.com/2019/06/30/photos_dyke_march_2019.php"}]},{"url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/rssfeedsdefault.cms","items":[{"title":"India aim to maintain winning run against England","content":"","url":"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-world-cup/india-vs-england-preview-icc-world-cup-2019-india-seek-to-maintain-winning-run-against-england/articleshow/70007402.cms","published":"2019-06-30T02:41:36Z","guid":"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-world-cup/india-vs-england-preview-icc-world-cup-2019-india-seek-to-maintain-winning-run-against-england/articleshow/70007402.cms"},{"title":"Modi back with first Mann Ki Baat of 2nd term","content":"","url":"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/first-mann-ki-baat-after-modis-return-to-power-to-air-today/articleshow/70007448.cms","published":"2019-06-30T02:42:15Z","guid":"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/first-mann-ki-baat-after-modis-return-to-power-to-air-today/articleshow/70007448.cms"},{"title":"Blog: How BJP handles power will decide future of opposition","content":"","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/right-and-wrong/how-bjp-handles-power-will-decide-future-of-opposition/","published":"2019-06-30T02:36:30Z","guid":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/right-and-wrong/how-bjp-handles-power-will-decide-future-of-opposition/"},{"title":"World Cup: Pak and Afghan fans come to blows","content":"","url":"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-world-cup/icc-world-cup-2019-as-their-teams-fight-it-out-pakistan-and-afghanistan-fans-come-to-blows/articleshow/70007626.cms","published":"2019-06-30T03:25:00Z","guid":"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-world-cup/icc-world-cup-2019-as-their-teams-fight-it-out-pakistan-and-afghanistan-fans-come-to-blows/articleshow/70007626.cms"},{"title":"36 countries where iPhone XS is cheaper","content":"","url":"https://www.gadgetsnow.com/slideshows/36-countries-where-iphone-xs-is-cheaper-than-in-india/photolist/70006584.cms","published":"2019-06-30T03:03:35Z","guid":"https://www.gadgetsnow.com/slideshows/36-countries-where-iphone-xs-is-cheaper-than-in-india/photolist/70006584.cms"},{"title":"Buying an iPhone online?

Hawkins National Laboratory is a ruin. Creators the Duffer Brothers wisely sidestep the narratively exhausted Upside Down.

Along with consistency\u0026mdash;seasons that keep scaling up the original concept, like sequels, instead of broadening and deepening the ongoing story, like good TV\u0026mdash;it offers the salve of nostalgia. Even more than the callbacks to Spielberg and \u003cem\u003eStar Wars\u003c/em\u003e, it\u0026rsquo;s the way the Duffers enshrine the community spaces of the recent past, ugly and commercial though they often were, that resonates. As a \u003cem\u003eStranger Things\u003c/em\u003e skeptic, season 3 brought me the most pleasure in its many scenes set amid the harshly lit mall corridors, sticky multiplexes, public pools and country fairs where I was among the last micro-generation of tweens to run wild in the mid-\u0026rsquo;90s. Some of these places still exist, sure, but they\u0026rsquo;re no longer the bustling hotspots they were in the 20th century. Too many of us would prefer to shop, socialize and watch online.

The chameleon is most famous for its ability to blend with its surroundings (I'm just as impressed with the acrobatic tongue), something we'd often like to do ourselves. Doing something similar with heat would be exciting. Imagine a camouflage suit that blended in with its background in both the visible and the infrared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree researchers suggest they've done exactly that in a recent paper on a \u003ca href=\"https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevApplied.11.054071\"\u003ethermal cloaking demonstration\u003c/a\u003e.

Let's imagine that I have a long cylinder. At one end, I heat the cylinder to 50°; and at the other end, I cool it to 10°. If I measure the temperature along the length of the cylinder, it will decrease steadily between the hot end and the cold end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1527731#p3\"\u003eRead 8 remaining paragraphs\u003c/a\u003e | \u003ca href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1527731\u0026comments=1\"\u003eComments\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"feedflare\"\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=uPT4v3tBMAg:_S6tlDPd44w:V_sGLiPBpWU\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=uPT4v3tBMAg:_S6tlDPd44w:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=uPT4v3tBMAg:_S6tlDPd44w:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=uPT4v3tBMAg:_S6tlDPd44w:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=uPT4v3tBMAg:_S6tlDPd44w:qj6IDK7rITs\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=uPT4v3tBMAg:_S6tlDPd44w:yIl2AUoC8zA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","url":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1527731","published":"2019-06-30T13:00:49Z","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1527731"},{"title":"Who will wake up from a coma?

The device, which designed to charge your iPhone, AirPods and Apple Watch simultaneously, was beautiful, but Apple\u0026#8217;s aggressive design left physics in the rearview mirror. Ambition is one thing but letting function drive form to the point that you publicly announce a product that wasn\u0026#8217;t physically possible showcases where Apple\u0026#8217;s marketing showmanship butt heads with actual device capabilities.

The company\u0026#8217;s 2019 line is a total rejection of the 2013 trash can which showcased some major design hubris.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese missteps don\u0026#8217;t fundamentally complicate the legacy of Ive or Apple. The past decade has also seen thoughtful designs take shape from the Apple Watch to the iPhone X to the iPad Pro, but industrial design is a means to an end and the manner in which Apple has determined where the customer fits into its design ethos could perhaps use some rethinking as the company enters a new design era.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eSend me feedback\u003cbr /\u003e\non Twitter \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/lucasmtny?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\"\u003e@lucasmtny\u003c/a\u003e or email\u003cbr /\u003e\nlucas@techcrunch.com\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn to the rest of the week’s news.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"attachment_1829158\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1850363\" title=\"space-starship-4\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/space-starship-4.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"space starship 4\" width=\"680\" height=\"383\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/space-starship-4.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/space-starship-4.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/space-starship-4.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/space-starship-4.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/space-starship-4.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/space-starship-4.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eTrends of the week\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere are a few big news items from big companies, with green links to all the sweet, sweet added context.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eSpaceX preps for a Starship payday\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\nElon Musk is still trying to get SpaceX\u0026#8217;s Starship off the ground, but the company\u0026#8217;s leadership is already planning for the reusable rocket\u0026#8217;s commercial heyday.

For most of the last 25 years, the cost to launch a groundbreaking, potentially world-shaking startup has decreased \u0026#8212; though that \u003ca href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/22/ask-not-for-whom-the-deadpool-tolls/\"\u003emay well be changing\u003c/a\u003e \u0026#8212; whereas the total cost to \u003ca href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/2019/06/christopher-nolans-tenet-budget-most-expensive-estonia-1202151273/\"\u003emake\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/200-million-rising-hollywood-struggles-721818\"\u003emarket\u003c/a\u003e, and distribute a theatrical release has decidedly \u003ca href=\"https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/budgets/all\"\u003enot\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, movie theaters, built around repeat screening of 90-to-180-minute self-contained films, face new direct-to-streaming-services competition with far more range, from bingewatching 22-episode series to short clips on YouTube. Even in the arena of \u0026#8220;movies\u0026#8221; as we know them, this competition seems exponentially more intense every year \u0026#8212; there\u0026#8217;s no way \u0026#8220;Bright\u0026#8221; and \u0026#8220;Bird Box\u0026#8221; would have been direct-to-Netflix as little as five years ago \u0026#8212; and will hit a whole new fervor with the launch of the Disney Plus launch date later this year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe can analogize that, maybe, to some extent, to downloadable software vs. software-as-a-service. There can be only one winner, right? Right? And note that, despite the runaway successes of Avengers: Endgame and Captain Marvel, 2019\u0026#8217;s US box office is still tracking \u003ca href=\"https://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/?view2=ytdcompare\u0026#038;view=releasedate\u0026#038;p=.htm\"\u003ea full 10% behind last year\u003c/a\u003e\u0026#8216;s. There may be a trend here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seems that Hollywood is finally aware of the change. Some striking quotes from that NYT piece: “This is the biggest shift in the content business in the history of Hollywood” \u0026#8212; Jason Blum. “For a long time, people have been saying the business is changing, but that’s undeniable now” \u0026#8212; JJ Abrams. “I don’t feel particularly optimistic about the traditional theatrical experience” \u0026#8212; Jordan Horowitz, producer of La La Land. “There’s a lot more work, but it’s a lot harder to make money on anything.” \u0026#8212; Elizabeth Banks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8230;But with risk comes opportunity, especially for people who haven\u0026#8217;t had much before.\u003cbr /\u003e\n“I’ve seen a lot of female filmmakers get opportunities at Netflix and Amazon that they haven’t gotten through the studio system. So I’m very, very happy about the new shape our industry is taking” \u0026#8212; Jessica Chastain. \u0026#8216;A really huge studio told us, “Hey, a woman of color should be the lead of this movie.” And we went, “Great!” I don’t think we would have heard that five years ago from a major studio\u0026#8217; \u0026#8212; Kumail Nanjiani\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps \u0026#8220;Hollywood,\u0026#8221; as the maker and purveyor of huge-budget, huge-footprint, in-theaters-everywhere entertainment, is indeed a dinosaur finally starting to diminish \u0026#8230; but if streaming services are allowing more and more people to create scripted entertainment of every kind, on every budget, then their success is no bad thing. I don\u0026#8217;t think movies are going to die. I think there will long be people like me, who so prefer the immersive experience of a theater to the in-passing one of streaming at home that we\u0026#8217;re willing to pay for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I can envision a future in which a Hollywood Movie is no longer the alpha king of cultural experiences \u0026#8212; where, instead, \u003ca href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/29/branded-worlds-how-technology-recentralized-entertainment/\"\u003eshared worlds\u003c/a\u003e spread across many entertainment form-factors, including lower-cost ones, made by a diverse crowd of contributors, take prime position in our collective mindshare. In that future, theatrical releases become a relatively niche market compared to streaming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn such future \u003ca href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/2019/06/movie-exhibition-distribution-future-1202152832/\"\u003ethe theatrical business model will change, too\u003c/a\u003e, and rightly so. I\u0026#8217;m still baffled why I couldn\u0026#8217;t see the last season of Game of Thrones in any nearby theater, for instance. But there will be far more \u003ci\u003ekinds\u003c/i\u003e of entertainment to choose from, undercutting the century-long dominance of \u0026#8220;three acts in two hours,\u0026#8221; from far more kinds of people. Even to a hardcore cinemaphile like me, the more I think about such a future, the more it seems better to me than the status quo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"feedflare\"\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=0ELJzFr5Q0Q:ftih-gkZyh0:2mJPEYqXBVI\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=0ELJzFr5Q0Q:ftih-gkZyh0:7Q72WNTAKBA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=0ELJzFr5Q0Q:ftih-gkZyh0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=0ELJzFr5Q0Q:ftih-gkZyh0:-BTjWOF_DHI\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=0ELJzFr5Q0Q:ftih-gkZyh0:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=0ELJzFr5Q0Q:ftih-gkZyh0:D7DqB2pKExk\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=0ELJzFr5Q0Q:ftih-gkZyh0:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=0ELJzFr5Q0Q:ftih-gkZyh0:qj6IDK7rITs\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/0ELJzFr5Q0Q\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/0ELJzFr5Q0Q/","published":"2019-06-30T13:00:55Z","guid":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=1850533"}]},{"url":"https://www.theverge.com/rss/full.xml","items":[{"title":"Gato Roboto is a streamlined Metroid starring a cat in a mech","content":"\u003cimg alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gL8A_-7FNkXd_NhGoe-KVmn1Mq0=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/64490577/gatoroboto2.0.jpg\" /\u003e\n\n\n  \u003cp id=\"gjGO3Y\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eIt can be difficult to find time to finish a video game, especially if you only have a few hours a week to play.

For players, though, it’s a \u003cem\u003egreat\u003c/em\u003e outcome, because you get to play a streamlined \u003cem\u003eMetroid\u003c/em\u003e game as a cat in a mech suit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"YFLu1S\"\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"\u003e\u003ciframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mhTGdWIAvWY?rel=0\" style=\"border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"S1p6iq\"\u003eAfter crashing, Kiki the cat’s owner and partner Gary is pinned down on their ship. Unable to do anything except communicate with Kiki, he sends her off to find a way for them to get off the planet. What Kiki finds is a dilapidated, abandoned lab full of both normal creatures like frogs and squids, but also strange ones like flamethrower robots and carnivorous plants that all seem determined to stop her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"0t2CL4\"\u003eInside the mech, Kiki has access to a blaster weapon that can only fire in three directions (forward, up and down) and whose shots only travel a short distance before disappearing. This forces you to get fairly close to enemies in order to destroy them. Luckily, the mech also provides Kiki with some amount of protection, letting her take a number of hits before she is killed. Meanwhile, if she’s outside the suit, she’ll get killed with only a single hit from anything. She also can’t attack anything outside the mech, but is faster, more nimble, and able to climb up walls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Jf61X6\"\u003eMuch of the game comes from playing with this discrepancy between Kiki in the suit versus out of it. After the opening section, which acts as a tutorial for both the cat and mech forms of Kiki, the game opens up into three different sections that can be tackled in any order. Each is geared around exploring specific aspects of this dynamic: one is predominantly focused on using only the mech, another on Kiki out of the mech, and the other has a little of both with the addition of a cat-sized submarine she can also pilot.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qZuKX3rbqMShp2Lg5WHFIBggcw0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16684196/gatoroboto5.jpg\"\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"lyOSUQ\"\u003eThese sections are incredibly well-designed, with each area feeling purposeful. A very subtle and clever thing the game does is introduce new enemies in a sort of controlled environment. There are a number of places where you are locked into a room until you defeat all the enemies, and in a lot of them, they’ll put an enemy you are seeing for the first time either alone or with a few very basic baddies. This lets you learn the new enemy’s behavior in such a way that they can quickly include it in tricky room layouts or enemy combinations without confusing you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"MEOwxB\"\u003eThere is an efficiency in the game design that makes \u003cem\u003eGato Roboto\u003c/em\u003e feel concentrated. The lab feels big, but not just for the sake of being big; none of the rooms are without purpose. You always feel like you’re progressing, always getting stronger and better at the game, yet still always being challenged in new ways. \u003cem\u003eGato Roboto\u003c/em\u003e could have just been a \u003cem\u003eMetroid\u003c/em\u003e clone — from the screenshots it certainly looks like one.

Lobbyists and Insiders Could Override Voters to Choose the Democratic Presidential Nominee","content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cu\u003eThe era of\u003c/u\u003e smoky backroom deals and political power brokers in charge of the Democratic Party could come roaring back in Milwaukee next year, when thousands of party faithful convene to formally select the party’s presidential nominee at the Democratic National Convention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe party’s delegate allocation rules, combined with the large number of candidates and an early election calendar for key states, have laid the groundwork for a small group of lobbyists and party officials to potentially play a deciding role in choosing the nominee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf no single candidate receives a majority of pledged delegates in the initial vote of the convention, called the first ballot, the nomination goes to what is known as a brokered convention, in which so-called superdelegates participate in subsequent rounds of nomination votes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven that there are more than 25 candidates, including four to five with significant support in the polls, it’s possible that there will be no clear frontrunner by the convention in July next year. In that scenario, around 764 superdelegates — a group comprised of elected officials, party elders, and prominent consultants unbound by the will of voters — could dramatically remake the path to the nomination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe superdelegates were added to the Democratic Party in the early 1980s as a sort of \u003ca href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/superdelegates-democratic-party-voters-wishes-465947\"\u003einsurance policy\u003c/a\u003e, giving establishment figures a permanent share of delegates to guard against nominating a candidate they viewed as a political liability. The superdelegates include elected officials; former “distinguished party leaders,” including Howard Dean and Dick Gephardt; prominent party consultants; and state party officials, most of whom are chosen by the Democratic National Committee or the state parties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast year, after superdelegates fueled controversy over the party tilting the scales during the 2016 presidential primary, the Democratic National Committee \u003ca href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/08/25/641725402/dnc-set-to-reduce-role-of-superdelegates-in-presidential-nominating-process\"\u003eshot down\u003c/a\u003e a proposal to remove superdelegates.

Many superdelegates also work as professional influence peddlers seeking to shape policy debates around heated issues such as taxation, finance, technology, health care, and defense contracting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Intercept has reviewed lobbying records and identified at least eight superdelegates who are currently working with health care clients lobbying against Medicare for All. Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase each have lobbyists who double as superdelegates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd a growing number of superdelegates are currently employed by presidential candidates, an arrangement that means some will enter the convention with less than neutral standing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast month, the Bernie Sanders campaign hired Susie Shannon, an anti-poverty activist and superdelegate, as its California state political director. DNC member and superdelegate Laphonza Butler is a senior consultant working with Kamala Harris’s campaign. Joe Biden’s staff includes two superdelegates, Simone Sanders and Cristobal Alex. Cory Booker, meanwhile, hired Clay Middleton, a superdelegate from South Carolina. And the Beto O’Rourke campaign retained the services of superdelegate Jeff Berman to help his campaign court other superdelegates. The campaigns either did not respond to inquiries or declined to comment for this story.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Democratic National Committee did not respond to a request for comment. Marcus Mason, a lobbyist and former superdelegate, told The Intercept in an email that he saw no conflict with delegates serving also serving as consultants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;I don’t see any conflict of interest with lobbyists being DNC delegates,\u0026#8221; wrote Mason. \u0026#8220;Before they are lobbyists they are citizens and Democrats.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cu\u003eThe high drama\u003c/u\u003e of brokered conventions — in which delegates are traded or switch loyalties until a majority is achieved — was once common. In 1932, Franklin D. Roosevelt secured the nomination in the fourth ballot, only after John Nance Garner traded his delegates for a spot as Roosevelt\u0026#8217;s running mate. The last time the Democratic Party went to a brokered convention to select a nominee was in 1952 when it took three ballots to nominate Adlai Stevenson.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003e\u003cblockquote class='stylized pull-left'data-shortcode-type='pullquote' data-pull='left'\u003eSuperdelegates exist as a bulwark against populist insurgents.\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scandal-plagued 1968 convention, when Hubert Humphrey won the nomination without running in the primaries, led to populist reforms that largely removed the power of the party bosses, added transparency, and centered the nomination on the will of voters. The following presidential cycle, voters ushered in George McGovern as the party candidate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcGovern’s landslide loss followed by the chaotic challenge by Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass., to President Jimmy Carter in 1980 sparked the so-called Hunt Commission. Led by North Carolina Gov. James Hunt, the commission again reformed the nomination process, this time returning power to the party establishment by creating the superdelegates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Democratic rules differ dramatically from the Republican Party’s, which allocate delegates on a winner-takes-all basis for many states, allowing a single candidate to quickly dominate the field even if they do not win a majority of votes. In 2016, for instance, Donald Trump only won 32.51 percent of the vote in the South Carolina GOP primary, but won all 50 South Carolina delegates, given the state\u0026#8217;s winner-takes-all system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Democrats’ proportional allocation rules provide a far more equal playing field over the Republican Party nomination system, yet the superdelegates exist as a bulwark against populist insurgents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRhodes Cook, a veteran election observer, \u003ca href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/not-so-superdelegates/\"\u003enoted\u003c/a\u003e that the superdelegates were designed as a “firewall to blunt any party outsider that built up a head of steam in the primaries.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cu\u003eIn recent election years,\u003c/u\u003e candidates often performed well enough in one of the early states or a cluster of them, and the ensuing media attention and campaign donations to the perceived frontrunner helped clear a path to the nomination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext year could be different. Texas and California will vote earlier than usual, with a dozen other states, on March 3, Super Tuesday. That might occur before a single candidate has emerged as the clear leader. If multiple candidates maintain solid support over the first two months of the primaries, the field could remain fractured until the convention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRay Buckley, chair of the New Hampshire Democratic Party, who also serves as a superdelegate, rejected the possibility of a brokered convention. He told The Intercept that he believes that contest next year will be over by Easter. He cited current rules that allocate delegates either on a proportional basis for every candidate who earns at least 15 percent of the votes in each state, or based on the percentage received by the candidate with the most votes if no candidate reaches the 15 percent threshold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;The large number of candidates divide the vote in such a manner that it is doubtful that anymore than two or three would attain the 15 percent threshold to be awarded delegates,\u0026#8221; said Buckley. \u0026#8220;The math simply isn\u0026#8217;t there for a second ballot, in my opinion.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"shortcode\" data-shortcode=\"newsletter\" data-campaign=\"\" data-cta=\"\" data-headline=\"\" data-layout=\"\" data-subhead=\"\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the possibility of a brokered convention, with party insiders and superdelegates potentially canceling out the will of voters, has many activists worried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In the event of a brokered convention, the donors and lobbyists will insist that the party nominate the establishment candidate,” warns Nick Brana, founder of the Movement for a People\u0026#8217;s Party. Brana previously worked with Sanders on delegate outreach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Others are party officials and members of Congress who are personally close with the donors, dependent on them, or plan on seeking high-paying corporate and consulting jobs in the future,” Brana said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;Superdelegates are a reinvention of the party boss system,” Brana added. “They were created to give party insiders veto power over a progressive nominee and they would fulfill that mission.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the last presidential primary, the use of superdelegates fueled widespread confusion and anger.

Now, he worries that the current system could lead to dysfunction and a small number of powerful insiders effectively hijacking the nomination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There\u0026#8217;s a serious likelihood that we end up in a convention where there\u0026#8217;s no candidate with a clear majority of pledged delegates, or even a substantial plurality,” Segal said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;There\u0026#8217;s reason to be concerned that in general, superdelegates would skew the outcome in a less progressive-populist direction, and it\u0026#8217;s more generally possible that the process could be particularly contentious and lead to unusual outcomes,\u0026#8221; he continued.

Mas é importante reforçar: para eles, o grave não foi usar máscara, mas tê-la deixado cair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoa parte dos procuradores — e não apenas Dallagnol — tinha consciência de que Sergio Moro extrapolava suas funções, atuava de acordo com uma agenda política-partidária e era movido por um projeto político pessoal. Mas se calou publicamente e se tornou cúmplice do ex-juiz.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutro trecho revelador sobre os meandros da Lava Jato é do procurador Angelo Augusto Costa: \u0026#8220;[Sergio Moro] Fez umas tabelinhas lá, absolvendo ali pra gente recorrer aqui\u0026#8221;. Esse trecho confirma que a procuradoria e o juiz combinaram um jogo de cena jurídico apenas para manter a fachada de imparcialidade. É grave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA vaidade de Moro começou a prejudicar a imagem do conluio lavajatista. Mas, apesar das reclamações internas, publicamente os procuradores eram só elogios ao ex-juiz. Deltan Dallagnol, o coordenador da força-tarefa, reconheceu haver problemas na nomeação de Moro como ministro de Bolsonaro, mas tentou conter a indignação dos seus pares lembrando que apoiá-lo era uma questão de sobrevivência. Segundo ele, apoiar Moro era o mesmo que apoiar a Lava Jato, o que confirma, mais uma vez, que acusação e juiz eram uma coisa só. A preocupação de Dallagnol era essencialmente política.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgora, com veículos da grande mídia, como Folha de S. Paulo e Veja, atestando que o arquivo não foi adulterado não há mais para onde correr. Insistir na estratégia esfarrapada de não reconhecer a autenticidade e, ao mesmo tempo, não negar nada do que tem sido publicado, é cavar o fundo do poço do ridículo. A opção menos indigna para os procuradores seria reconhecer a autenticidade dos diálogos e pedir afastamento dos seus cargos. Mas como esperar isso de quem viu a Constituição sendo violada reiteradamente e, mesmo assim, tomou a decisão política de apoiar o violador a virar ministro da Justiça?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDallagnol calculava os efeitos das ações da Lava Jato nas eleições\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNa primeira publicação da Vaza Jato, ficou claro que os procuradores se mobilizaram para evitar que Lula desse entrevista, já que isso poderia “eleger o Haddad” ou permitir a “volta do PT” ao poder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOntem, a Folha de S. Paulo \u003ca href=\"https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/monicabergamo/2019/06/deltan-queria-acelerar-acoes-contra-jacques-wagner-em-2018-mostram-mensagens.shtml\" target=\"_blank\"\u003epublicou\u003c/a\u003e novos trechos do arquivo obtido pelo \u003cstrong\u003eIntercept\u003c/strong\u003e que confirmam a intenção da Lava Jato em influenciar o jogo eleitoral. Ele tentou acelerar ações contra o petista Jaques Wagner para que elas acontecessem antes do fim do segundo turno das eleições presidenciais. Dallagnol queria um mandado de busca e apreensão na casa do senador antes da posse. \u0026#8220;Isso é urgentíssimo. Tipo agora ou nunca kkkk\u0026#8221;, falou Dallagnol para um dos procuradores. A pressa tinha como objetivo pegar o petista ainda sem foro privilegiado e arranhar a campanha de Haddad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUma procuradora lembrou que Jaques Wagner já havia sofrido uma busca e apreensão e ponderou que uma nova talvez não valesse a pena. Deltan respondeu que valeria por uma \u0026#8220;questão simbólica\u0026#8221;. O simbolismo de uma nova ação contra o petista não seria outro senão o político. Não há outra interpretação possível.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Bahia é um do principais redutos eleitorais do PT, se não for o principal. Jaques Wagner, ex-governador do estado por duas vezes, chegou a ser cotado para ser o candidato do PT nas eleições presidenciais e se tornou o coordenador da campanha de Haddad no segundo turno. Bolsonaro\u003ca href=\"https://veja.abril.com.br/blog/bahia/na-bahia-reduto-petista-bolsonaro-vence-em-so-quatro-cidades/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e levou uma surra\u003c/a\u003e de Haddad nas urnas baianas no primeiro turno, tendo uma votação menor do que a de Aécio Neves em 2014. Não é difícil imaginar qual seria o valor simbólico de uma busca e apreensão na casa do senador baiano em plena campanha do segundo turno.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNão restam dúvidas de que algumas ações da Lava Jato foram sincronizadas com uma agenda eleitoral. Todas elas visando prejudicar Haddad e beneficiar Bolsonaro. O caráter antidemocrático da força-tarefa é inegável. A operação trabalhou em pelos menos duas oportunidades para prejudicar a campanha presidencial do PT. Pior: o seu coordenador atuou nos bastidores para articular um apoio dos procuradores à ida de Sergio Moro para o governo de Bolsonaro — que foi o principal beneficiário de toda essa operação. Se isso não é um ataque orquestrado contra a democracia, o que mais seria?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe post \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/06/30/vaza-jato-moro-dallagnol-monique-cheker-procuradores/\"\u003eOs novos diálogos mostram que a aparência de imparcialidade de Moro era só o que importava\u003c/a\u003e appeared first on \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com\"\u003eThe Intercept\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://theintercept.com/2019/06/30/vaza-jato-moro-dallagnol-monique-cheker-procuradores/","published":"2019-06-30T11:29:30Z","guid":"https://theintercept.com/?p=257018"}]},{"url":"https://off-guardian.org/feed/","items":[{"title":"Antisemitism: what does that even mean?","content":"","url":"https://off-guardian.org/2019/06/30/antisemitism-what-does-that-even-mean/","published":"2019-06-30T07:47:35Z","guid":"https://off-guardian.org/?p=60701"},{"title":"REVIEW: “Modified” – A Film About GMOs \u0026 Corruption of the Food Supply for Profit","content":"","url":"https://off-guardian.org/2019/06/30/review-modified-a-film-about-gmos-corruption-of-the-food-supply-for-profit/","published":"2019-06-30T17:21:25Z","guid":"https://off-guardian.org/?p=60705"}]},{"url":"https://www.eff.org/rss/updates.xml","items":[]},{"url":"https://www.wsws.org/en/rss.xml","items":[]},{"url":"https://blog.abaenglish.com/feed/","items":[]},{"url":"https://www.english.com/blog/feed/","items":[]},{"url":"http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition.rss","items":[{"title":"The North Korea issue a diplomatic triangle of Trump, Xi and Kim","content":"","url":"https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/29/politics/trump-kim-xi-diplomatic-triangle-intl-hnk/index.html","published":"2019-06-30T00:39:33Z","guid":"https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/29/politics/trump-kim-xi-diplomatic-triangle-intl-hnk/index.html"},{"title":"K-pop star power kicks off Trump's visit to South Korea","content":"","url":"https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/29/us/trump-met-kpop-group-in-south-korea-trip-trnd/index.html","published":"2019-06-30T00:37:52Z","guid":"https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/29/us/trump-met-kpop-group-in-south-korea-trip-trnd/index.html"},{"title":"Trump to visit the DMZ in hopes of meeting Kim","content":"","url":"https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-dmz-kim-live-intl-hnk/index.html","published":"2019-06-30T01:00:56Z","guid":"https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-dmz-kim-live-intl-hnk/index.html"},{"title":"Trump reversed course on Huawei.

information from contractors about their ability to produce companion trailer (JLTV-T), towable by all JLTV variants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe JLTV family of vehicles is a material solution intended to provide ground transport to mounted Infantry, Combat Arms, and Combat Service Support Forces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe intent of the JLTV program is to provide a mobile, lightweight tactical vehicle that fills capability gaps, regains transportability, and restores balance in the \u0026#8220;iron triangle\u0026#8221; of protection, payload, and performance. The JLTV provides protected, sustained, networked light tactical mobility to enhance the effectiveness of ground combat and supporting forces. It is also capable of moving over long distances within a theater of operations using a variety of lift assets, including sealift, amphibious ships and airlift capabilities both fixed and rotary wing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe JLTV\u0026#8217;s family is comprised of two variants, a four-seat and a two-seat variant, a companion trailer (JLTV-T), and associated kits. The four-seat variant has two Base Vehicle Platforms: the General Purpose (GP) and the Close Combat Weapons Carrier (CCWC). The GP platform has two Mission Package Configurations, the GP and the Heavy Guns Carrier (HGC). The CCWC platform has only the CCWC Mission Package Configuration. The two-seat variant has one Base Vehicle Platform: the Utility (UTL). Each base vehicle platform will be configured as a Mission Package Configuration through the installation of various kits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to media reports in recent weeks, Dr. Bruce Jette, Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics and Technology, approved the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) program’s transition into Full-Rate Production.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to a statement released by the Program Executive Office for Combat Support \u0026amp; Combat Service Support, the approval follows an Army decision in December 2018 to begin fielding the new platform with the Army’s 1st Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division, Fort Stewart, Georgia, in April.

ترامب الاقتصادي فرصةٌ متخفيّة","content":"\u003cp\u003eBy Omar Rahman\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"rtl\"\u003eلقد منحت إدارة ترامب القيادة الفلسطينية فرصة نادرة. ففي التحضيرات المؤدّية إلى ورشة \u0026#8220;السلام من أجل الازدهار\u0026#8221; التي أقيمت في البحرين يومي 25 و26 يونيو، طرح البيت الأبيض اقتراحه للتنمية الاقتصادية في الضفة الغربية وقطاع غزة حيث يحظى الفلسطينيون بحكم ذاتي محدود. ويتميّز المستند، المؤلّف من 40 صفحة مع ملحقٍ بقائمة بالمشاريع، بالكثير من التطلّعات والقليل من التفاصيل وانفصال كامل عن الواقع على الأرض. لكنّه في المقابل يقدّم فرصة لإثبات صحّة ادّعاءات الفلسطينيين بأنّ الإدارة الأمريكية عازمة على انتزاع حقوقهم السياسية والسير في وجهة جديدة عبر اقتراح بديلهم الواقعي المقبول الخاص بهم. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"rtl\"\u003eولدى الفلسطينيين جميع التبريرات للتشكيك في إدارة ترامب. فعلى مدى السنتين ونصف السنة الماضية، اتّخذ البيت الأبيض سلسلة من الخطوات التي تهدف مباشرة إلى إضعاف المؤسّسات الفلسطينية والضغط على القيادة الفلسطينية. فعلاوة على وقف تمويل السلطة الفلسطينية، أوقفت الإدارة تمويل المشاريع التنموية والإنسانية في الوقت ذاته الذي ألحّت فيه على الحاجة إلى تنمية اقتصادية وحلول إنسانية. وابتعد الفريق المسؤول عن الوصول إلى خطّة سلام، أي كبير مستشاري البيت الأبيض جاريد كوشنر والسفير الأمريكي في إسرائيل دافيد فريدمان ومبعوث الشرق الأوسط جايسون غرينبلات، عن عقودٍ من السياسات الأمريكية حيال وضع الأراضي المحتلة، من بينها القدس الشرقية ومرتفعات الجولان، وهدف الوصول إلى حلّ الدولتَين.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"rtl\"\u003eوفي خضمّ الكثير من التشكيك حيال ما يعرف بـ\u0026#8221;صفقة القرن\u0026#8221; التي طرحها ترامب، فضلاً عن الاضطراب في السياسة الإسرائيلية، قرّر الفريق بقيادة كوشنر وضع المكوّن السياسي في خطتهم جانباً حتّى وقت آخر وطرح القسم الاقتصادي بشكل مستقلّ. وفيما يُعتبر الفصل بين الاقتصاد والسياسة بحدّ ذاته عملاً مريباً، زادت هذه الخطوة من شكوك الفلسطينيين في أنّ نوايا إدارة ترامب عاطلة حيال مستقبلهم السياسي.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"rtl\"\u003eوبالفعل وبشكل فاضح، لا ذكر أبداً للكيان الوطني الفلسطيني في المستند. ولا تظهر كلمة \u0026#8220;دولة\u0026#8221; سوى في عبارة \u0026#8220;الدول المجاورة\u0026#8221;، وحتى كلمة \u0026#8220;وطني\u0026#8221; لا تظهر سوى مرّة واحدة لوصف مصر ولبنان والأردن. وفيما قد لا يرغب كوشنر أن يحكم مسبقاً على النتيجة السياسة، يبيّن هذا الأمر المدى الذي وصلت إليه الإدارة لحذف كلّ ما له علاقة بالسياسة من المستند. ولا تهدف التنمية الاقتصادية المقترحة سوى الوصول إلى \u0026#8220;مجتمع حيوي\u0026#8221;، مجتمع على ما يبدو أنّه خالٍ من التطلّعات الوطنية.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"rtl\"\u003eفعلاوة على افتقار المستند إلى مستقبل سياسي، هو يفتقر إلى حاضر سياسي حتّى، وكأنّ التنمية الاقتصادية ستجري في فراغ. مثلاً، ما من أيّ ذكر للاحتلال العسكري الإسرائيلي، ولا أيّ إشارة مباشرة للسلطة الفلسطينية أو حماس. ولا تُذكر إسرائيل سوى كجزء من الدول المجاورة، على الرغم من أنّه من خلال القراءة بين السطور من الجليّ أنّ إسرائيل ستبقى مُتحكّمة بحياة الفلسطينيين والاقتصاد الفلسطيني. فكيف يمكن تطبيق خطّة كهذه بينما لا يتمّ الاعتراف بالوقائع السياسية الأساسية حتى؟\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"rtl\"\u003eيرحّب الفلسطينيون كلّهم بالتنمية الاقتصادية، بمن فيهم السلطة الفلسطينية. لكنّهم يدركون أنّ هذه التنمية لا يمكنها أن تحصل بمعزل عن تراجع متزامن للاحتلال ولعمليات الاستيطان الإسرائيلية. وحتّى فكرة أنّ التقدّم في إحدى الناحيتين سيؤمّن زخماً للناحية الأخرى ليست في موضعها الصحيح. ففي العام 2009، طرح رئيس وزراء السلطة الفلسطينية سلام فياض مشروع بناء دولة مدته سنتان بهدف دعم مؤسّسات الحوكمة تحضيراً لإنشاء دولة. وفشل هذا المشروع لهذا السبب بالضبط، ليس لأنّ الجهود لم تتكلّل بالنجاح، بل لأنّه لم يترافق بأيّ تغيير في وضع الاحتلال. فمن دون أيّ خطوة ملموسة نحو إنشاء الدولة، أصبحت المحافظة على التقدّم في بناء المؤسسات مستحيلة. فبدا وكأنّ السلطة الفلسطينية تعمل لصالح الاحتلال عوضاً عن ضدّه.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"rtl\"\u003eوعلى مدى السنوات الخمسة والعشرين الماضية، أُغدقت مليارات الدولارات على الأراضي المحتلة بشكل مساعدات تنموية وإنسانية، لكنّ الاقتصاد في الواقع يتحرّك بالاتجاه المعاكس. ويُعزى ذلك إلى أنّ الاحتلال لا يعيق التنمية الاقتصادية الفلسطينية ببساطة فحسب، بل يقوّضها بنشاط ويوجّه النمو نحو الاقتصاد الإسرائيلي. وبحسب الاقتصادي الإسرائيلي شير هيفر، يُقدَّر أنّ 72 في المئة من المساعدات الدولية للفلسطينيين ينتهي بها المطاف في الاقتصاد الإسرائيلي. والالتفاف حول الاحتلال بغية تقديم المساعدة التنموية مهمة مستحيلة.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"rtl\"\u003eوردّاً على المستند الاقتصادي الذي طرحه البيت الأبيض، رفضه محمود عباس على الفور قائلاً: \u0026#8220;طالما الحلّ السياسي غائب لا نتعاطى مع أيّ حلّ اقتصادي\u0026#8221;. ويشعر عباّس أنّه يتعرّض لهجوم لذا من الواضح أن كلامه دفاعي، لكن لا استراتيجية واضحة له سوى أن يرفض ما يُعرض عليه.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"rtl\"\u003eلا شكّ في أنّ الفلسطينيين في وضع صعب. فقد أنهى عبّاس العلاقات مع الولايات المتحدة منذ 18 شهراً بعد صدور القرار بنقل السفارة الأمريكية في إسرائيل إلى القدس والاعتراف بالمدينة عاصمة لإسرائيل. وليس قطْع العلاقات مع الولايات المتحدة في أي يوم من الأيام فكرةً سديدة. فما زال للإدارة الأمريكية الكثير من الأدوات المتاحة لمعاقبة الفلسطينيين. بيد أنّ ذلك لا يعني أن عليهم الوقوف مكتوفي الأيدي تجاه مبادرات السياسات التي تطرحها واشنطن.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"rtl\"\u003eعلى الرغم من الضرر الذي يحدثه ترامب فهو يحدث تغييرات في الأوضاع. وهذا يولّد الفرص حتّى لو لم تكن المعطيات في صالح الفلسطينيين. ويمكن أن تبدأ هذه الفرص من الاقتراح الاقتصادي. فعوضاً عن رفضه فوراً، ينبغي على القيادة الفلسطينية أن تكرّر بكثافة في الإعلام أنها تودّ أن تقبل بهذه الرؤية الاقتصادية في سياق الحصول على حقوق سياسية كاملة، سواء أفي دولة خاصة بالفلسطينيين أم ضمن دولة علمانية مزدوجة القومية. لكن على غرار المواطنين في الولايات المتحدة وإسرائيل، يريد الفلسطينيون حقّ التصويت وانتخاب القادة الذين يحكمون

مع هذه الإدارة، لا ينبغي عليها أن تعترض على حضور الآخرين المؤتمرَ، لا بل فليتعهّدوا بالتبرّع بالمال، فما من ضرر في ذلك، لأنّ تلقّي تنمية اقتصادية ليس مشترطاً ضمنياً بإبطال حقوق الفلسطينيين. لكن إن حاولت الإدارة الأمريكية أن تشرطها بهذا الأمر بعد تلقّي التنمية، بعد أن تُطرح الأموال على الطاولة، فستكشف بذلك عن نفاق هذا العمل وطابعه الاستغلالي. وبعدها يمكن أن يقول كوشنر: \u0026#8220;عذراً، لا يمكنكم الحصول على هذا المال من أجل التنمية الاقتصادية ما لم تخسروا حقوقكم السياسية\u0026#8221;.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"rtl\"\u003eوتبرز فرص أخرى أيضاً. فالإدارة تقوّض مصداقية الولايات المتحدة لدى الكثير من حلفائها، ولا سيما في أوروبا، وتقضي على ما تبقّى من عملية السلام. وينبغي أن يعطي ذلك الفلسطينيين شعوراً بالتحرّر.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"rtl\"\u003eفقد حدّت عملية السلام من قدرة الفلسطينيين على المناورة، على الرغم من جميع محاسنها. فكلّ مرّة حاولوا الاستفادة من مواردهم المحدودة للضغط على إسرائيل، أعيد وضعهم عند حدّهم وقيل لهم إنّ طاولة المفاوضات هي المكان المناسب لمعالجة الشكاوى.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"rtl\"\u003eوالآن قد يكون بإمكانهم إقناع الأوروبيين أنّه ينبغي وضع ضغط أكبر على إسرائيل. وينبغي عليهم إطلاق حملة عالمية تعتمد خطاباً يتمحور حول الحقوق. فالناس حول العالم قادرون على فهم المطالب بنيل الحقوق الإنسانية والسياسية الأساسية أكثر بكثير من قدرتهم على فهم تعقيدات مسائل الوضع النهائي وتبادلات الأراضي وحدود العام 1967 وتفاصيل سيادة الدولة.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"rtl\"\u003eوفي وسع الفلسطينيين الذهاب أبعد من ذلك واستغلال هذه اللحظة لعرض خطّة سلام فلسطينية تجمع التنمية الاقتصادية مع أهداف سياسية واضحة قابلة للتطبيق. فيرى العالم عندئذ أنّ الفلسطينيين ليسوا مجرّد رفضيّين، بل لديهم مطالب محقّة ولن يتخلّوا عنها بالمال.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2019/06/30/%d8%a7%d9%82%d8%aa%d8%b1%d8%a7%d8%ad-%d8%aa%d8%b1%d8%a7%d9%85%d8%a8-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%a7%d9%82%d8%aa%d8%b5%d8%a7%d8%af%d9%8a-%d9%81%d8%b1%d8%b5%d8%a9%d9%8c-%d9%85%d8%aa%d8%ae%d9%81%d9%8a%d9%91%d8%a9/","published":"2019-06-30T18:38:15Z","guid":"https://www.brookings.edu/?p=595965"}]},{"url":"https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/world/rss","items":[]},{"url":"https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/world/feed","items":[]},{"url":"https://www.pri.org/stories/feed/everything","items":[]},{"url":"https://rss.csmonitor.com/feeds/world","items":[]},{"url":"https://www.rand.org/topics/international-affairs.xml/feed","items":[]},{"url":"https://www.thelocal.es/feeds/rss.php","items":[{"title":"France,

Calls INSTEX ‘Nice Car without Gasoline’","content":"\u003cp\u003eThe United States’ withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and the Europeans’ failure to ensure Tehran’s economic interests under the deal prompted the Islamic Republic of Iran to decide to scale back its commitments under the JCPOA back on May 8. Iran’s decision was based on the provisions stipulated in this very agreement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other hand, Washington’s provocative moves in the Persian Gulf region, which resulted in the downing of a US drone in Iran’s airspace, fueled concerns over the outbreak of another conflict in the Middle East.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese issues prompted journalists who always received biased accounts from the Americans to sit down with Majid Takht-Ravanchi, Iran’s ambassador and permanent representative to the United Nations and a key negotiator to the talks over the JCPOA, to listen to a different account that they had rarely heard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the hour-long meeting held at the Iranian mission, numerous questions were raised about the JCPOA, the downing of the American spy drone, Russia and China’s relations with Iran, the security of the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz, and US presidential elections.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Iran is committed to rendering the necessary cooperation in order to keep the JCPOA alive, but the other parties to the agreement, too, should allow Iran to benefit from the interests of the deal and should make efforts to make it survive,” Iran’s UN ambassador noted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In our opinion, the United States’ anti-Iran policies are to blame for the chaos in the Persian Gulf ,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The US pulled out of the JCPOA and, after that, imposed sanctions and took actions against Iran,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sanctions, failure to renew wavers on Iran’s oil sales, the dispatch of a flotilla [ to the Persian Gulf] and other recent moves by the US in the region are among the actions aimed at provoking Iran, but we have exercised restraint, so far,” said Takht-Ravanchi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The American drone approached Iranian borders. We warned it four times not to enter our airspace. However, when the aircraft ignored our warnings and violated the country’s airspace, we had to shoot it down for self-defense in accordance with Note 51 of the UN Charter,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe also touched upon Iran’s proposal to hold a regional dialogue as well as the letter he has written to the UN secretary general in that regard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In the meeting I had with the [UN] secretary general, I talked about his mission with regards to Resolution 598.

In response, the official said Tehran’s decision was in conformity with the nuclear deal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Iran’s decision to increase its stockpiles of enriched uranium to more than 300kg was within the framework of the JCPOA. A mechanism is envisaged in the JCPOA for the export of enriched uranium,” the Iranian UN ambassador said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What kept us from exceeding the designated ceiling was that it was possible to export it and receive yellow cake in return, but the US government banned that mechanism,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now the US should be asked why it has imposed such a ban. From our viewpoint, Iran’s move to increase its stockpiles is not a violation of the JCPOA; rather, it is in conformity with Article 26 and 36 of the nuclear deal.

Mining with Industrial Electricity Is Illegal: Iranian Speaker","content":"\u003cp\u003eSpeaking to reporters on Sunday, Larijani said the bitcoin miners using cheaper electricity for Iranian industries are breaking the law, as the heavy power consumption for producing digital currencies reduces the efficiency of local production.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStressing the need for serious action against the law-breakers, the Parliament speaker said he will be negotiating with the Energy Ministry officials to address the problems faced by the local manufacturers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast week, Iranian authorities seized around 1,000 bitcoin mining machines from two abandoned factories in Yazd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA spokesman for the Energy Ministry has said cryptocurrency mining operations were destabilizing the power grid and affecting electrical access for households and businesses in Iran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn comments on June 23, the spokesperson for Tavanir, an Iranian state-run company in charge of power supply and distribution, said the country’s consumption in the previous Iranian month had risen by 7 percent compared to the corresponding period last year, mainly because of the Bitcoin miners’ outsize thirst for electricity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe also warned that the electricity users producing digital currencies, like Biotcoin, will be detected and their power will be cut off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery Bitcoin mining machine that is powered by the same cheap source of electricity available to houses consumes the equivalent of 24 dwellings, the spokesman added, saying the administration has not still set a tariff on the power consumption of digital currency miners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith electricity so reasonably subsidized that many Iranian occupants buy modern air conditioners with powerful compressors, the number of digital currency miners using power in the residential areas has been growing in recent years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBitcoin is a cryptocurrency and a form of electronic cash which many computer geeks believe will form the future of the global economy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a report released this month, Iranian economic daily Financial Tribune quoted the deputy energy minister of Iran as saying that electricity bills for digital currency miners should be calculated in accordance to real prices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHomayoun Haeri has insisted that electricity bills for cryptocurrency mining activities should be priced according to the same rates established for power exports.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe administration reportedly pays nearly $1 billion in subsidies per annum to bridge the gap in real electricity costs and what consumers are billed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe post \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\"
