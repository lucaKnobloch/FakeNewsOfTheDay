And you\u0026#8217;ve got to play by show business rules.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShow business is all about preparation, getting the act, song, movie, TV show, ready and then marketing it so people will be aware of it and buy it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd you always want to be first, and you want to eliminate all chance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou want an upward curve, even if you start low and slow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou want no lulls. You want to keep people interested, by teasing them with new information on a regular basis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou want to control the narrative.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd what is the narrative the Democrats are trying to sell?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamned if I know. The only thing they can agree on is they hate Trump. I hate KISS, but that doesn\u0026#8217;t keep them off the road, playing to empty arenas, their fans support them. And speaking of KISS, Gene Simmons is one of the greatest marketers of all time, a complete blowhard, but he\u0026#8217;s making it work for himself and the band. Maybe he learned it all from Neil Bogart, who changed his name from \u0026#8220;Bogatz,\u0026#8221; to give the right \u0026#8220;impression.\u0026#8221; Bogart failed on his first attempt, trying to sell a record of Johnny Carson routines, it went instantly into the cut-out bin, but then he pivoted to disco and Donna Summer and KISS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Bogart was a showman, full of crap. Seemingly everything he said was inflated and wrong. Remember when there were four simultaneous KISS solo albums and Neil said they were instantly gold? The press bought it, even though all of them but Peter Criss\u0026#8217;s came back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou see it\u0026#8217;s all about perception. Sell the myth, not the facts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#8217;s more important that Elizabeth Warren be seen as a fighter against the man than any specific policy position. People don\u0026#8217;t go that deep. CONGRESS doesn’t go that deep! Did you read the \u0026#8220;New Yorker\u0026#8221; story on Al Franken? His accuser told boldfaced lies, there was history disputing her account, but she got out there first and what she said ruled, even though she was working for a pro-Trump radio station. Once again, the Democrats reacted, and now they\u0026#8217;re doubling-down, can\u0026#8217;t see why they were wrong. Kirsten Gillibrand, YOU\u0026#8217;RE HISTORY!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe press said Trump was losing because he brought up the \u0026#8220;i\u0026#8221; word before the Democrats. But Trump knows you get ahead of the blowback, you make the first punch, and you load the media with so much b.s. that it can\u0026#8217;t keep up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, the public doesn\u0026#8217;t know the difference between impeachment and conviction and Pelosi seems as old as she really is. She\u0026#8217;s Perry Como after the Beatles. Doesn\u0026#8217;t she realize THE RULES HAVE CHANGED?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHappens in entertainment all the time. Suddenly you can\u0026#8217;t sell hair bands. Suddenly hip-hop is burgeoning. And if you fight the tide, you drown. Oh, little fish can still swim in their own private backwaters, but if you\u0026#8217;re playing for everything, if you want to run the table, you\u0026#8217;ve got to be looking to the future, not the past!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrump speaks to the public. Pelosi speaks to insiders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026#8217;s why AOC gets so much traction, she speaks to the public-at-large, it\u0026#8217;s less about legislation than attitude, which is move over you old farts and let the younger generation take the reins, you oldsters have no idea what is going on anymore!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Team Pelosi says you\u0026#8217;ve got to run to the center, because you\u0026#8217;ve got to appeal to those districts that flipped for Democrats in 2016. That\u0026#8217;s like making Aerosmith play acoustic, and refusing to let them play new material.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, Aerosmith doesn\u0026#8217;t play new material, and Chris Christie is a big Boss fan. It\u0026#8217;s kinda like long hair. Once upon a time it symbolized something, you were either for us or against us, then it was just a fashion choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyone who plays to the rearguard is always disrupted. Didn\u0026#8217;t you ever read Clayton Christensen? Everybody pooh-poohs the new, saying it\u0026#8217;s not as good as the old, and then it becomes better and the old folds overnight. Christensen says to embrace the new, and then eliminate the old when the new gains traction. The DNC is being disrupted and their answer? Let\u0026#8217;s go back to Good Ol\u0026#8217; Joe. That\u0026#8217;s like asking your grandfather for music advice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo what we\u0026#8217;ve got is candidates who want to throw the baby out with the bathwater and the Democrats are freaking out, they can\u0026#8217;t even get aligned on one position. Criticize the Republicans all you want, but after Trump they all got in line. That\u0026#8217;s how you win, when you play like a team!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd if you try to appeal to everybody, you lose. The road is littered with middle of the road artists, who fail on the chart and play to a dwindling audience in Branson and clubs. You want to get people EXCITED! That\u0026#8217;s what Warren and Harris and Bernie and Buttigieg are doing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd what does the establishment say?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHEY\u0026#8217;RE TOO FAR LEFT!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAC/DC was too heavy until suddenly they weren\u0026#8217;t. \u0026#8220;Back In Black\u0026#8221; is still streaming prodigiously today, \u0026#8220;You Shook Me All Night Long\u0026#8221; is an American anthem! Of course Mutt Lange helped. The right has Karl Rove, who do we have on the left?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo the reason you wanted impeachment is so the whole world would watch, so Trump\u0026#8217;s bad behavior, criminal or not, would infect the public. When the truth outs, it\u0026#8217;s hard to deny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut no, it was never time. Pelosi and her pals are like a Silicon Valley outfit that never releases its product. It\u0026#8217;s so busy getting it right that it can never come out. Meanwhile, Facebook becomes so big by having a motto of \u0026#8220;move fast and break things.\u0026#8221; Forget that Zuckerberg is the enemy now, he\u0026#8217;s on top of the pyramid, he controls the conversation more than not only Congress, but the mainstream media! Furthermore, he just pivoted, saying it was about private conversations, when the Democrats are still looking for that elusive consensus. Everything worth paying attention to starts off the radar, small, and then it blows up and BECOMES THE MAINSTREAM!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo Barr says Trump is innocent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Dems folded their tent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Mueller sends his letter and they think\u0026#8230;wow, maybe there\u0026#8217;s something here. Like a band the label has stopped working that is suddenly selling tickets\u0026#8230;the label is on to something else, it\u0026#8217;s hard to get it restarted on your old product.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then the Democrats placed all their hopes on Mueller testifying. That\u0026#8217;s like taking someone with a great record, who\u0026#8217;s never been on stage, and having them headline Coachella! No one would do that, the odds of failure are too high.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo Mueller didn\u0026#8217;t deliver. Oh, don\u0026#8217;t make it about Russia, the Dems thought Mueller was gonna blow a hole through the curtain, reveal that Trump was culpable and should be charged. Not only did Mueller not do this, he said as much after he delivered his report earlier\u0026#8230;this was his final statement!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the Dems are playing by old rules and crying to the nonexistent refs that the Republicans are cheating. No, Trump and his posse have invented new rules, like no one in the regime needs to testify. When they up the ante, so do you! You don\u0026#8217;t say there\u0026#8217;s no crying in baseball!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo now, on left wing radio, all the talk is about getting the transcripts from the grand jury. God, even in the NFL when you lose, you lose, no matter how heinous the call. Because without rules, you\u0026#8217;ve got no game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that\u0026#8217;s what\u0026#8217;s happening now, WE\u0026#8217;VE GOT NO GAME! Trump and his cronies are running ragged and the Dems and the media are so flummoxed, they do NOTHING!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCome on. Even the most lame influencer knows you\u0026#8217;ve got to deliver product on a regular basis. You\u0026#8217;ve got to hook the audience and deliver. That\u0026#8217;s certainly what Trump has done, and all the left keeps saying is HE SHOULDN’T TWEET!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, these same wankers are posting to Instagram, the national pastime, and despite their constant disparagement of the internet and Twitter, Twitter is where the news happens, and if you\u0026#8217;re not on it, you don\u0026#8217;t know what\u0026#8217;s going on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo impeachment failed in the marketplace. It\u0026#8217;s like Annapurna, Megan Ellison\u0026#8217;s movie company. No matter how great the film, and she\u0026#8217;s put out plenty, they never reach expectations. \u0026#8220;Booksmart,\u0026#8221; one of the best-reviewed movies this year, which appeals to oldsters and youngsters\u0026#8230;dead. Product is only one part of the puzzle, you need the aforementioned marketing. The big studios may put out lame films, but they\u0026#8217;re experts in marketing them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen you fail, you write it off. Just look at the Fortune 500, that\u0026#8217;s what they do. Did Bezos try to improve the Fire phone? No, he deleted it from the catalog. And today, your mistakes don\u0026#8217;t haunt you as long as you continue to play and make noise. Once again, the game has changed, there\u0026#8217;s so much noise that the biggest challenge is just reaching the public. And if you don\u0026#8217;t, people forget what you were selling, they\u0026#8217;re inundated with new messages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I\u0026#8217;ve used a plethora of metaphors here, but now I\u0026#8217;m gonna use one more. Pro football used to be a running game. Now running backs make a fraction of what they used to, all the emphasis is on passing and receiving! You change with the times!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeems like everybody can change with the times but the Democrats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo forget impeachment. This is the gang that can’t shoot straight, even if they have clear evidence that Trump needs to go, the right will spin it otherwise and rule the marketplace, i.e. public opinion. And just like a record, you don\u0026#8217;t have to appeal to everybody to win. How come Trump knows this and the Democrats don\u0026#8217;t?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of clinging to the past, trying to rebuild the old edifice, it\u0026#8217;s time to build a new one. And there are a number of candidates promising this. Safe rarely succeeds. Can you say Romney? Can you say Kerry! One of the reasons Obama won was because he HAD little history. There was little to nail him on and he promised hope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBelieve me, Ol\u0026#8217; Joe is not promising hope. He\u0026#8217;s like a boomer musician waiting for Hilary Rosen to save them from streaming. But Hilary\u0026#8217;s moved on from the RIAA, and streaming has already won, soon there won\u0026#8217;t even be any hardware to play discs! Apple kills the iPod because the innards are no longer manufactured, and the Democrats keep trying to prop up oldsters, held together by baling wire. Bill Clinton had Linda Bloodworth-Thomason and her husband selling him, and despite baggage, he won anyway!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho do the Democrats have?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe it\u0026#8217;s time to hire Bill Belichick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, that\u0026#8217;s right, HE\u0026#8217;S A TRUMPER!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"pf-content\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e~~~\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVisit the archive: http://lefsetz.com/wordpress/\u003cbr /\u003e\n–\u003cbr /\u003e\n@Lefsetz http://www.twitter.com/lefsetz\u003cbr /\u003e\n–\u003cbr /\u003e\nIf you would like to subscribe to the LefsetzLetter\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe post \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ritholtz.com/2019/07/politics-is-show-business-for-ugly-people/\"\u003ePolitics is Show Business for Ugly People\u0026#8230;\u003c/a\u003e appeared first on \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ritholtz.com\"\u003eThe Big Picture\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"feedflare\"\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?a=QmU8jJmOs20:2rs6d5wUzjI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?a=QmU8jJmOs20:2rs6d5wUzjI:7Q72WNTAKBA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?a=QmU8jJmOs20:2rs6d5wUzjI:dnMXMwOfBR0\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?d=dnMXMwOfBR0\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?a=QmU8jJmOs20:2rs6d5wUzjI:V_sGLiPBpWU\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?i=QmU8jJmOs20:2rs6d5wUzjI:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?a=QmU8jJmOs20:2rs6d5wUzjI:qj6IDK7rITs\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?a=QmU8jJmOs20:2rs6d5wUzjI:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?i=QmU8jJmOs20:2rs6d5wUzjI:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?a=QmU8jJmOs20:2rs6d5wUzjI:KwTdNBX3Jqk\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?i=QmU8jJmOs20:2rs6d5wUzjI:KwTdNBX3Jqk\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?a=QmU8jJmOs20:2rs6d5wUzjI:l6gmwiTKsz0\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?d=l6gmwiTKsz0\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?a=QmU8jJmOs20:2rs6d5wUzjI:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?i=QmU8jJmOs20:2rs6d5wUzjI:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?a=QmU8jJmOs20:2rs6d5wUzjI:TzevzKxY174\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?d=TzevzKxY174\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheBigPicture/~4/QmU8jJmOs20\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheBigPicture/~3/QmU8jJmOs20/","published":"2019-07-28T10:00:47Z","guid":"https://ritholtz.com/?p=229532"}]},{"url":"https://feeds.feedburner.com/businessinsider?format=xml","items":[]},{"url":"https://feeds.feedburner.com/businessinsider?format=xml","items":[]},{"url":"https://feeds.feedburner.com/CalculatedRisk","items":[{"title":"July 2019: Unofficial Problem Bank list decreased to 75 Institutions","content":"Note: Surferdude808 compiles an \u003ci\u003eunofficial\u003c/i\u003e list of Problem Banks compiled only from public sources.

And nobody knows why there are so many different varieties here. Over the years, a lot of people have brought mango seeds to Nevis and discovered that they grow well on the island. Some other Caribbean islands have mangoes—a few varieties here and there—but nothing comparable to Nevis, where mangoes take to the land like weeds and have become a way of life for Nevisians.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWaz Allie, a 21-year-old guide for \u003ca href=\"http://funkymonkeytours.com/\"\u003eFunky Monkey Tours\u003c/a\u003e who lives on the island, says if he doesn’t pick the mango himself just moments before, then he won’t eat it. To pick the fruit, he takes an unripe one from the ground and, with practiced aim, hits the ripe fruit from 15 feet below. It drops into his hand, warm from the sun and juicy enough that, instead of slicing it, he can simply tear the skin with his teeth and suck the meat out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you’re intrigued by this wealth of mango varieties—such as the giant yellow Keiths, the appropriately named Teenys, or the beloved Julies—the only way to try them is to go to Nevis during mango season. That’s because Nevis’s mango trees, for all their wonders, can be affected by the mango seed weevil. The pest doesn’t affect mangoes eaten on the island, but quarantines require that all fresh mangoes stay here. Small amounts of mangoes—a few thousand pounds a year—get turned into pulp, which can be exported, and some of that is sent to neighboring islands for use. But there is no industry or infrastructure in place to expand the scope of distribution. Instead, the bulk of the mangoes stay right here on Nevis, reserved only for Nevisians and visitors drawn to the island for its sun, sand, and fruit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Nevis-Island-Mango-Guacamole.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Nevis-Island-Mango-Guacamole\" class=\"wp-image-2674453\" srcset=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Nevis-Island-Mango-Guacamole.jpg 2880w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Nevis-Island-Mango-Guacamole.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Nevis-Island-Mango-Guacamole.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Nevis-Island-Mango-Guacamole.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Nevis-Island-Mango-Guacamole.jpg?resize=1024,683 1024w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Nevis-Island-Mango-Guacamole.jpg?resize=281,187 281w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Nevis-Island-Mango-Guacamole.jpg?resize=755,503 755w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Nevis-Island-Mango-Guacamole.jpg?resize=100,67 100w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Nevis-Island-Mango-Guacamole.jpg?resize=60,40 60w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Nevis-Island-Mango-Guacamole.jpg?resize=154,103 154w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Nevis-Island-Mango-Guacamole.jpg?resize=591,394 591w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Nevis-Island-Mango-Guacamole.jpg?resize=392,261 392w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Nevis-Island-Mango-Guacamole.jpg?resize=252,168 252w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Nevis-Island-Mango-Guacamole.jpg?resize=697,465 697w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Nevis-Island-Mango-Guacamole.jpg?resize=234,156 234w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Nevis-Island-Mango-Guacamole.jpg?resize=500,333 500w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Nevis-Island-Mango-Guacamole.jpg?resize=578,385 578w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Nevis-Island-Mango-Guacamole.jpg?resize=600,400 600w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Nevis-Island-Mango-Guacamole.jpg?resize=90,60 90w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Nevis-Island-Mango-Guacamole.jpg?resize=185,123 185w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Nevis-Island-Mango-Guacamole.jpg?resize=115,77 115w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Nevis-Island-Mango-Guacamole.jpg?resize=738,492 738w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Nevis-Island-Mango-Guacamole.jpg?resize=777,518 777w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2880px) 100vw, 2880px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eMango guacamole at the Nevis Mango and Food Festival.

Instead it offers small inns, home rentals, and collections of villas—nearly all of which will have their own mango trees. Nothing on the island can be built higher than the coconut trees, which means that from afar, the brightly colored houses almost disappear into the green hills. Mount Nevis rises from the center of the island, almost always wearing the beret of clouds that earned it a name derived from the Spanish word for snow—what it apparently looked like to early explorers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut up close, the white clouds can’t hide the vibrant colors of the mango crop when it ripens, once around July and again in the weeks leading up to Christmas. The rest of the year, you’ll find mango products such as hot sauce or jam made from the fruit. Still, most Nevisians are mango purists: Much like Allie, they consider mangoes not plucked directly from the tree to be not worth eating and what’s more, a waste to cook with. That turns the mangoes of Nevis, the wide variety ranging from syrupy-sweet to one that oddly tastes like turpentine (but is somehow still good) into an ephemeral and untransportable treasure that is free—at least to anyone willing to make the journey to Nevis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eMore must-read stories from \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—Where you should eat, visit, and stay on \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/longform/copenhagen-denmark-travel-guide/\"\u003eyour trip to Copenhagen\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—This \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/longform/washington-orcas-island-oprah\"\u003eisland in Washington State\u003c/a\u003e will make you feel like a multimillionaire\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—\u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/07/27/san-juan-puerto-rico-travel-guide/\"\u003eYour next getaway:\u003c/a\u003e Tulum is out, this island is in\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—Inside the “\u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/longform/equinox-hotel-new-york-luxury\"\u003eultimate high-performance luxury lifestyle” experience\u003c/a\u003e at the new Equinox Hotel\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—Listen to our new audio briefing, \u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/radio/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e 500 Daily\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://flipboard.com/@fortune\"\u003eFollow \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e on Flipboard\u003c/a\u003e to stay up-to-date on the latest news and analysis.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://fortune.com/2019/07/28/caribbean-nevis-island-mangoes/","published":"2019-07-28T11:00:17Z","guid":"https://fortune.com/?p=2670369"},{"title":"What You Should Know About Italy’s New Food Capital","content":"\n\u003cp\u003eModena’s food reputation looms far larger than the town of 185,000 residents.

But the statue is more than just a thing of beauty. It tops a fountain that runs with clean, potable water, a small but important part of the indoor market’s mission to improve city life. For those without clean water at home, this fountain\u0026#8217;s fresh water provided a sanitary station at which they can wash their produce. It’s a small gesture, but one that shows that the town wants to welcome all comers to its feast for both the eyes and the stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThroughout the market, this sort of dual purpose of functional beauty stands out, notably at the giant slabs of pink marble carved into tables that serve as fish counters. The stone insulates the ice to keep the fish cold and wipes clean at the end of every day. Atop the great slabs of Verona marble, the fishmongers spill their ice and stack their display with enormous octopuses, freshly shucked scallops, and translucent orange shrimp. Branzino, squid, clams, mackerel, and mussels sit behind glass shields atop the clean ice, kept cold by the marble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Mercato-Albinelli-Modena-Italy-Tortellini.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Mercato Albinelli-Modena Italy-Tortellini\" class=\"wp-image-2674727\" srcset=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Mercato-Albinelli-Modena-Italy-Tortellini.jpg 2000w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Mercato-Albinelli-Modena-Italy-Tortellini.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Mercato-Albinelli-Modena-Italy-Tortellini.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Mercato-Albinelli-Modena-Italy-Tortellini.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Mercato-Albinelli-Modena-Italy-Tortellini.jpg?resize=1024,682 1024w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Mercato-Albinelli-Modena-Italy-Tortellini.jpg?resize=281,187 281w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Mercato-Albinelli-Modena-Italy-Tortellini.jpg?resize=755,503 755w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Mercato-Albinelli-Modena-Italy-Tortellini.jpg?resize=100,67 100w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Mercato-Albinelli-Modena-Italy-Tortellini.jpg?resize=60,40 60w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Mercato-Albinelli-Modena-Italy-Tortellini.jpg?resize=154,103 154w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Mercato-Albinelli-Modena-Italy-Tortellini.jpg?resize=591,394 591w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Mercato-Albinelli-Modena-Italy-Tortellini.jpg?resize=392,261 392w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Mercato-Albinelli-Modena-Italy-Tortellini.jpg?resize=252,168 252w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Mercato-Albinelli-Modena-Italy-Tortellini.jpg?resize=697,465 697w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Mercato-Albinelli-Modena-Italy-Tortellini.jpg?resize=234,156 234w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Mercato-Albinelli-Modena-Italy-Tortellini.jpg?resize=500,333 500w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Mercato-Albinelli-Modena-Italy-Tortellini.jpg?resize=578,385 578w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Mercato-Albinelli-Modena-Italy-Tortellini.jpg?resize=600,400 600w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Mercato-Albinelli-Modena-Italy-Tortellini.jpg?resize=90,60 90w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Mercato-Albinelli-Modena-Italy-Tortellini.jpg?resize=185,123 185w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Mercato-Albinelli-Modena-Italy-Tortellini.jpg?resize=115,77 115w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Mercato-Albinelli-Modena-Italy-Tortellini.jpg?resize=738,492 738w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Mercato-Albinelli-Modena-Italy-Tortellini.jpg?resize=777,518 777w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eFresh tortellini made at Mercato Albinelli.

A recent example was in January, at a congressional hearing where Coats and other intelligence chiefs contradicted the president’s statements on topics from North Korea to Islamic State.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a habit that drew praise from the Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. Amid reports in February that Coats was at risk of losing his job, Representative Adam Schiff of California said in a tweet that Coats “speaks truth to power and gives policy makers the best intelligence possible.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eUndercut on Iran\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the January hearing, Coats countered Trump’s assertion that Islamic State was defeated, testifying that “ISIS is intent on resurging and still commands thousands of fighters in Iraq and Syria.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eDefying the optimism exuded by Trump on North Korea, Coats said the government of Kim Jong Un is “unlikely to completely give up its nuclear weapons and production capabilities.” His assessment came weeks after a second summit between Trump and the North Korean leader, in Vietnam in February, broke up without agreements on denuclearization.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eCoats also undercut the president on Iran, testifying that intelligence agencies believed Iran was continuing to comply with the the 2015 nuclear agreement from which Trump withdrew in 2018. Since then, following U.S. moves to ramp up sanctions on the Islamic Republic, Iran began enriching uranium beyond agreed-upon limits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e‘Down the Middle’\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTrump lashed out at the Iran assessment at the time, writing on Twitter that intelligence officials “seem to be extremely passive and naive when it comes to the dangers of Iran. They are wrong!” Trump added: “Perhaps Intelligence should go back to school!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eCoats’s deputy, Sue Gordon, praised his performance as a non-political intelligence chief in a July podcast with former Deputy CIA Director Michael Morrell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“He has played intelligence straight down the middle,” Gordon said on the “Intelligence Matters” podcast. “The intelligence community is strong in part because of the way Dan has conducted his job. I don’t know that any DNI could have done in this time what Dan Coats has done and I’m proud to be a member of his team.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn selecting Ratcliffe, Trump would be going in the opposite direction, choosing an intelligence chief who has shown a strong partisan leaning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eReverse Engineering\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eInterviewed Sunday on the Fox News Channel, Ratcliffe suggested he thought the special counsel’s probe of Trump sprang from a plot to frame the former New York real estate developer that originated by the administration of former President Barack Obama.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“They accused Donald Trump of a crime, and then they try and reverse-engineer a process to justify that accusation,” Ratcliffe said on “Sunday Morning Futures.” “It does appear that there were crimes committed during the Obama administration.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn July 2018, Coats criticized Trump’s decision to meet alone with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, saying at the Aspen Security Forum in Colorado soon after that, “I would have suggested a different way, but that’s not my role, that’s not my job. So it is what it is.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTold while on stage at the Aspen forum that the White House had tweeted Putin was being invited to Washington \u0026#8212; a trip that never occurred \u0026#8212; Coats said sardonically, “That’s going to be special.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eLow-Profile Chief\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eCoats was a low-profile chief of the intelligence community, often leaving the spotlight to the leaders of the better-known Central Intelligence Agency: Michael Pompeo at the start of Trump’s administration and, after he became secretary of State, Gina Haspel, the CIA’s current director.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eYet when Coats made public comments, they nearly always defended the independence of the intelligence community.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn May, Coats addressed concerns that Trump’s order telling the intelligence community to share classified documents about the start of the Russia probe with the Justice Department could result in national security secrets becoming public. He said he was confident that “long-established procedures” to safeguard the information would be followed, and he vowed to keep providing “apolitical intelligence” to the president.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eCoats’s pending departure comes amid renewed turmoil on Trump’s national security team and broader cabinet. The administration has no confirmed deputy defense secretary, United Nations ambassador or homeland security secretary. Labor Secretary Alex Acosta resigned on July 12 after coming under fire for his handling of a decade-old sex crimes case against investor Jeffrey Epstein, who faces new charges for trafficking girls as young as 14 for sex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eCan’t Be Abolished\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAxios reported this month that Trump isn’t convinced the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, created after the Sept. 11 terror attacks, is even necessary. But the office was created by Congress and can’t be abolished by the president.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eCoats was a well known quantity in Washington long before taking on the role coordinating the work of the federal government’s more than a dozen intelligence agencies. He served as an Indiana congressman and then senator from 1981 to 1999, stepping down because of a term-limits pledge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHe returned to the Senate in 2011 and became a member of the Finance, Intelligence and Joint Economic committees.

King\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePolitics is show business for ugly people. And you\u0026#8217;ve got to play by show business rules.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShow business is all about preparation, getting the act, song, movie, TV show, ready and then marketing it so people will be aware of it and buy it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd you always want to be first, and you want to eliminate all chance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou want an upward curve, even if you start low and slow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou want no lulls. You want to keep people interested, by teasing them with new information on a regular basis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou want to control the narrative.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd what is the narrative the Democrats are trying to sell?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamned if I know. The only thing they can agree on is they hate Trump. I hate KISS, but that doesn\u0026#8217;t keep them off the road, playing to empty arenas, their fans support them. And speaking of KISS, Gene Simmons is one of the greatest marketers of all time, a complete blowhard, but he\u0026#8217;s making it work for himself and the band. Maybe he learned it all from Neil Bogart, who changed his name from \u0026#8220;Bogatz,\u0026#8221; to give the right \u0026#8220;impression.\u0026#8221; Bogart failed on his first attempt, trying to sell a record of Johnny Carson routines, it went instantly into the cut-out bin, but then he pivoted to disco and Donna Summer and KISS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Bogart was a showman, full of crap. Seemingly everything he said was inflated and wrong. Remember when there were four simultaneous KISS solo albums and Neil said they were instantly gold? The press bought it, even though all of them but Peter Criss\u0026#8217;s came back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou see it\u0026#8217;s all about perception. Sell the myth, not the facts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#8217;s more important that Elizabeth Warren be seen as a fighter against the man than any specific policy position. People don\u0026#8217;t go that deep. CONGRESS doesn’t go that deep! Did you read the \u0026#8220;New Yorker\u0026#8221; story on Al Franken? His accuser told boldfaced lies, there was history disputing her account, but she got out there first and what she said ruled, even though she was working for a pro-Trump radio station. Once again, the Democrats reacted, and now they\u0026#8217;re doubling-down, can\u0026#8217;t see why they were wrong. Kirsten Gillibrand, YOU\u0026#8217;RE HISTORY!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe press said Trump was losing because he brought up the \u0026#8220;i\u0026#8221; word before the Democrats. But Trump knows you get ahead of the blowback, you make the first punch, and you load the media with so much b.s. that it can\u0026#8217;t keep up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, the public doesn\u0026#8217;t know the difference between impeachment and conviction and Pelosi seems as old as she really is. She\u0026#8217;s Perry Como after the Beatles. Doesn\u0026#8217;t she realize THE RULES HAVE CHANGED?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHappens in entertainment all the time. Suddenly you can\u0026#8217;t sell hair bands. Suddenly hip-hop is burgeoning. And if you fight the tide, you drown. Oh, little fish can still swim in their own private backwaters, but if you\u0026#8217;re playing for everything, if you want to run the table, you\u0026#8217;ve got to be looking to the future, not the past!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrump speaks to the public. Pelosi speaks to insiders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026#8217;s why AOC gets so much traction, she speaks to the public-at-large, it\u0026#8217;s less about legislation than attitude, which is move over you old farts and let the younger generation take the reins, you oldsters have no idea what is going on anymore!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Team Pelosi says you\u0026#8217;ve got to run to the center, because you\u0026#8217;ve got to appeal to those districts that flipped for Democrats in 2016. That\u0026#8217;s like making Aerosmith play acoustic, and refusing to let them play new material.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, Aerosmith doesn\u0026#8217;t play new material, and Chris Christie is a big Boss fan. It\u0026#8217;s kinda like long hair. Once upon a time it symbolized something, you were either for us or against us, then it was just a fashion choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyone who plays to the rearguard is always disrupted. Didn\u0026#8217;t you ever read Clayton Christensen? Everybody pooh-poohs the new, saying it\u0026#8217;s not as good as the old, and then it becomes better and the old folds overnight. Christensen says to embrace the new, and then eliminate the old when the new gains traction. The DNC is being disrupted and their answer? Let\u0026#8217;s go back to Good Ol\u0026#8217; Joe. That\u0026#8217;s like asking your grandfather for music advice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo what we\u0026#8217;ve got is candidates who want to throw the baby out with the bathwater and the Democrats are freaking out, they can\u0026#8217;t even get aligned on one position. Criticize the Republicans all you want, but after Trump they all got in line. That\u0026#8217;s how you win, when you play like a team!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd if you try to appeal to everybody, you lose. The road is littered with middle of the road artists, who fail on the chart and play to a dwindling audience in Branson and clubs. You want to get people EXCITED! That\u0026#8217;s what Warren and Harris and Bernie and Buttigieg are doing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd what does the establishment say?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHEY\u0026#8217;RE TOO FAR LEFT!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAC/DC was too heavy until suddenly they weren\u0026#8217;t. \u0026#8220;Back In Black\u0026#8221; is still streaming prodigiously today, \u0026#8220;You Shook Me All Night Long\u0026#8221; is an American anthem! Of course Mutt Lange helped. The right has Karl Rove, who do we have on the left?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo the reason you wanted impeachment is so the whole world would watch, so Trump\u0026#8217;s bad behavior, criminal or not, would infect the public. When the truth outs, it\u0026#8217;s hard to deny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut no, it was never time. Pelosi and her pals are like a Silicon Valley outfit that never releases its product. It\u0026#8217;s so busy getting it right that it can never come out. Meanwhile, Facebook becomes so big by having a motto of \u0026#8220;move fast and break things.\u0026#8221; Forget that Zuckerberg is the enemy now, he\u0026#8217;s on top of the pyramid, he controls the conversation more than not only Congress, but the mainstream media! Furthermore, he just pivoted, saying it was about private conversations, when the Democrats are still looking for that elusive consensus. Everything worth paying attention to starts off the radar, small, and then it blows up and BECOMES THE MAINSTREAM!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo Barr says Trump is innocent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Dems folded their tent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Mueller sends his letter and they think\u0026#8230;wow, maybe there\u0026#8217;s something here. Like a band the label has stopped working that is suddenly selling tickets\u0026#8230;the label is on to something else, it\u0026#8217;s hard to get it restarted on your old product.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then the Democrats placed all their hopes on Mueller testifying. That\u0026#8217;s like taking someone with a great record, who\u0026#8217;s never been on stage, and having them headline Coachella! No one would do that, the odds of failure are too high.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo Mueller didn\u0026#8217;t deliver. Oh, don\u0026#8217;t make it about Russia, the Dems thought Mueller was gonna blow a hole through the curtain, reveal that Trump was culpable and should be charged. Not only did Mueller not do this, he said as much after he delivered his report earlier\u0026#8230;this was his final statement!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the Dems are playing by old rules and crying to the nonexistent refs that the Republicans are cheating. No, Trump and his posse have invented new rules, like no one in the regime needs to testify. When they up the ante, so do you! You don\u0026#8217;t say there\u0026#8217;s no crying in baseball!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo now, on left wing radio, all the talk is about getting the transcripts from the grand jury. God, even in the NFL when you lose, you lose, no matter how heinous the call. Because without rules, you\u0026#8217;ve got no game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that\u0026#8217;s what\u0026#8217;s happening now, WE\u0026#8217;VE GOT NO GAME! Trump and his cronies are running ragged and the Dems and the media are so flummoxed, they do NOTHING!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCome on. Even the most lame influencer knows you\u0026#8217;ve got to deliver product on a regular basis. You\u0026#8217;ve got to hook the audience and deliver. That\u0026#8217;s certainly what Trump has done, and all the left keeps saying is HE SHOULDN’T TWEET!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, these same wankers are posting to Instagram, the national pastime, and despite their constant disparagement of the internet and Twitter, Twitter is where the news happens, and if you\u0026#8217;re not on it, you don\u0026#8217;t know what\u0026#8217;s going on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo impeachment failed in the marketplace. It\u0026#8217;s like Annapurna, Megan Ellison\u0026#8217;s movie company. No matter how great the film, and she\u0026#8217;s put out plenty, they never reach expectations. \u0026#8220;Booksmart,\u0026#8221; one of the best-reviewed movies this year, which appeals to oldsters and youngsters\u0026#8230;dead. Product is only one part of the puzzle, you need the aforementioned marketing. The big studios may put out lame films, but they\u0026#8217;re experts in marketing them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen you fail, you write it off. Just look at the Fortune 500, that\u0026#8217;s what they do. Did Bezos try to improve the Fire phone? No, he deleted it from the catalog. And today, your mistakes don\u0026#8217;t haunt you as long as you continue to play and make noise. Once again, the game has changed, there\u0026#8217;s so much noise that the biggest challenge is just reaching the public. And if you don\u0026#8217;t, people forget what you were selling, they\u0026#8217;re inundated with new messages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I\u0026#8217;ve used a plethora of metaphors here, but now I\u0026#8217;m gonna use one more. Pro football used to be a running game. Now running backs make a fraction of what they used to, all the emphasis is on passing and receiving! You change with the times!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeems like everybody can change with the times but the Democrats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo forget impeachment. This is the gang that can’t shoot straight, even if they have clear evidence that Trump needs to go, the right will spin it otherwise and rule the marketplace, i.e. public opinion. And just like a record, you don\u0026#8217;t have to appeal to everybody to win. How come Trump knows this and the Democrats don\u0026#8217;t?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of clinging to the past, trying to rebuild the old edifice, it\u0026#8217;s time to build a new one. And there are a number of candidates promising this. Safe rarely succeeds. Can you say Romney? Can you say Kerry! One of the reasons Obama won was because he HAD little history. There was little to nail him on and he promised hope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBelieve me, Ol\u0026#8217; Joe is not promising hope. He\u0026#8217;s like a boomer musician waiting for Hilary Rosen to save them from streaming. But Hilary\u0026#8217;s moved on from the RIAA, and streaming has already won, soon there won\u0026#8217;t even be any hardware to play discs! Apple kills the iPod because the innards are no longer manufactured, and the Democrats keep trying to prop up oldsters, held together by baling wire. Bill Clinton had Linda Bloodworth-Thomason and her husband selling him, and despite baggage, he won anyway!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho do the Democrats have?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe it\u0026#8217;s time to hire Bill Belichick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, that\u0026#8217;s right, HE\u0026#8217;S A TRUMPER!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"pf-content\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e~~~\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVisit the archive: http://lefsetz.com/wordpress/\u003cbr /\u003e\n–\u003cbr /\u003e\n@Lefsetz http://www.twitter.com/lefsetz\u003cbr /\u003e\n–\u003cbr /\u003e\nIf you would like to subscribe to the LefsetzLetter\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe post \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ritholtz.com/2019/07/politics-is-show-business-for-ugly-people/\"\u003ePolitics is Show Business for Ugly People\u0026#8230;\u003c/a\u003e appeared first on \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ritholtz.com\"\u003eThe Big Picture\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"feedflare\"\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?a=QmU8jJmOs20:2rs6d5wUzjI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?a=QmU8jJmOs20:2rs6d5wUzjI:7Q72WNTAKBA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?a=QmU8jJmOs20:2rs6d5wUzjI:dnMXMwOfBR0\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?d=dnMXMwOfBR0\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?a=QmU8jJmOs20:2rs6d5wUzjI:V_sGLiPBpWU\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?i=QmU8jJmOs20:2rs6d5wUzjI:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?a=QmU8jJmOs20:2rs6d5wUzjI:qj6IDK7rITs\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?a=QmU8jJmOs20:2rs6d5wUzjI:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?i=QmU8jJmOs20:2rs6d5wUzjI:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?a=QmU8jJmOs20:2rs6d5wUzjI:KwTdNBX3Jqk\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?i=QmU8jJmOs20:2rs6d5wUzjI:KwTdNBX3Jqk\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?a=QmU8jJmOs20:2rs6d5wUzjI:l6gmwiTKsz0\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?d=l6gmwiTKsz0\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?a=QmU8jJmOs20:2rs6d5wUzjI:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?i=QmU8jJmOs20:2rs6d5wUzjI:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?a=QmU8jJmOs20:2rs6d5wUzjI:TzevzKxY174\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheBigPicture?d=TzevzKxY174\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheBigPicture/~4/QmU8jJmOs20\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheBigPicture/~3/QmU8jJmOs20/","published":"2019-07-28T10:00:47Z","guid":"https://ritholtz.com/?p=229532"}]},{"url":"https://www.mckinsey.com/Insights/rss.aspx","items":[]},{"url":"https://feeds.feedburner.com/CalculatedRisk","items":[{"title":"July 2019: Unofficial Problem Bank list decreased to 75 Institutions","content":"Note: Surferdude808 compiles an \u003ci\u003eunofficial\u003c/i\u003e list of Problem Banks compiled only from public sources.

During the month, the list decreased by a net of one institution to 75 banks after two removals and one addition.  Aggregate assets fell slightly to $55.4.7 billion from $55.0 billion a month earlier.  A year ago, the list held 89 institutions with assets of $57.3 billion.

and \u0026#8220;Daily Active Users\u0026#8221; and then letting Hilmar carry on as though the blackout was all that went on in July.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI get that this is sort of the style of \u003cem\u003eTiS\u003c/em\u003e.  Matterall is a nice guy and likes to create a space where everybody on the show gets their turn to speak without being interrupted.  (Imagine the same interview on the \u003cem\u003eOpen Comms Show\u003c/em\u003e, where Dirk and Rahne would be shouting over each other to try to respond.)  This is, perhaps, how you get guests like Hilmar, by having a reputation of encouraging your guests to speak by giving them easy questions and letting them go their own way.  But given what was said by Hilmar and Falcon, it made for an unsatisfying listening experience as my brain kept coming up with follow up questions to expand or clarify or nail down what was really being said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd a lot was said on the show, which I am sure people will be digesting and examining and writing or speaking about for weeks to come.   I have things I want to pick apart from the show and, as I noted on Twitter, I could make a months worth of \u0026#8220;Quote of the Day\u0026#8221; posts out of it.  This could be a watershed moment for the game, the announcement of some drastic changes coming to \u003cem\u003eEVE Online.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr it might have been the online equivalent of a late night drunken dorm room discussion in college, a metaphorical circle jerk of \u0026#8220;wouldn\u0026#8217;t it be great\u0026#8230;\u0026#8221; sort of ideas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo my first question out of the gate is how seriously should we take this interview?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0026#8217;t even know who CCP Goodfella is, and that he is the brand manager makes it likely we can discount pretty much any ideas he espouses\u0026#8230; not that I can recall anything he said.  Sorry man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCCP Falcon is the Community Manager, which puts him in the thick of things with the players. But, by his own admission, he is not part of the design and development loop.  I had a post with \u003ca href=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/2019/07/26/quote-of-the-day-death-to-faxes-and-other-capital-ideas/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ea quote from him on Friday\u003c/a\u003e around a reply he put on Reddit about what he would do about capital ships.  He made it clear down the way that he has his own opinions about the game, which he can freely express, but which are not necessarily the official line of CCP.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo when Falcon is on about his dystopian hellscape vision of \u003cem\u003eEVE Online\u003c/em\u003e, he often prefaces it with \u0026#8220;If it were up to me,\u0026#8221; a solid indication that it is not.  The problem is that this tends to blur the line between when he is speaking for the company and when he is speaking for himself, as most people will only remember what he said and not how he prefaced it.  Is it his opinion or CCP\u0026#8217;s that people who don\u0026#8217;t like risk when they mine should go back to high sec?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then there is Hilmar.  He was involved in the development of the game, wrote code and was part of the design team and has been CEO at CCP since 2004.  While Pearl Abyss now owns CCP, he is still the boss on the ground in Iceland, so when he says something it gets some weight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut how much weight does it get\u0026#8230; or should it even get?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had been absent from the game for quite a stretch, making a big deal about returning and trying out Planetary Interaction and finding the UI for it abysmal.  The CEO complains, \u003ca href=\"https://www.eveonline.com/article/p7hle2/changes-coming-to-planetary-interaction-with-into-the-abyss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ea dev blog\u003c/a\u003e appears, and changes go in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe has said that he had been playing in wormhole space lately and now we have the local chat blackout in null sec.  This is a change that has been talked about for years, but the CEO goes and plays in WH space and suddenly it happens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow he says he is playing faction warfare, so I guess that is good news for somebody I hope.  Maybe FW will get some love\u0026#8230; or maybe some FW mechanic will get stuffed into null sec.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, he was also the voice of CCP during the \u003cem\u003eIncarna\u003c/em\u003e fiasco where he manifested some J. Allen Brack level arrogance in telling the players that the company knew better what they wanted when it came to the cash shop while dismissing people who wanted the hangar view of their ship back rather than the resource hungry captain\u0026#8217;s quarter or the metaphorically disastrous locked door, continuing to denigrate it as \u0026#8220;ship spinning\u0026#8221; even as they said they would return the feature in some form.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter that Hilmar declared that \u003ca href=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/2011/12/11/the-era-of-the-jesus-feature-is-over/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ethe era of the Jesus Feature was over\u003c/a\u003e and CCP started updating and iterating on features they had launched then neglected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am also a bit skeptical of Hilmar\u0026#8217;s relationship with how things have worked out in the past.  One of his big talking points during the show was making the game easier for new players but harder for veterans.  Malcanis says that anything you do for new players tends to benefit vets even more so, while we have clearly seen that making things difficult for veterans tends to just lock them into their position, with the changes essentially turning into barriers that keep newer players out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he is talking about a better NPE\u0026#8230; a topic about which I have another post brewing\u0026#8230; that is one thing.  But beyond that how do you help new players?  And does the planned Chaos Era help the \u003ca href=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/2019/06/23/is-new-player-retention-fixable-in-eve-online/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003enew player retention issue that CCP went on about\u003c/a\u003e at EVE North?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, does Hilmar saying something mean it is going to happen?  Not that what he is saying is good or bad, but is he the final word?  Does this represent consensus in the development team or just voicing his own opinions?  Is the Chaos Era about to begin in New Eden?  Will there be a dev blog?  Hilmar said that there are a lot of destabilizing things that will show up in the coming weeks.  So maybe it is already a done deal?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0026#8217;t know.  We\u0026#8217;ll probably have to wait and see and evaluate what we get.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRelated material:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.talkinginstations.com/2019/07/ccp-blackout-interview/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eTalking in Stations interview\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/ci6efy/ccp_hilmar_ccp_falcon_and_ccp_goodfella_reveal/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eReddit Thread with Select Quotes transcribed by Suitonia\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEvehermit \u0026#8211; \u003ca href=\"https://evehermit.wordpress.com/2019/07/27/mindset/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eMindset\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://tagn.wordpress.com/2019/07/28/hilmar-and-the-chaos-era-of-eve-online/","published":"2019-07-28T17:15:07Z","guid":"http://tagn.wordpress.com/?p=71814"}]},{"url":"https://www.eurogamer.net/?format=rss","items":[{"title":"Here's when raids are coming to Fallout 76","content":"","url":"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-07-28-heres-when-raids-are-coming-to-fallout-76","published":"2019-07-28T10:45:00Z","guid":"https://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=2050440"},{"title":"See Glavenus in action in this all-new Monster Hunter World Iceborne gameplay presentation","content":"","url":"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-07-28-see-glavenus-in-action-in-all-new-monster-hunter-world-iceborne-gameplay-presentations","published":"2019-07-28T11:43:00Z","guid":"https://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=2050444"},{"title":"Try out JRPG Oninaki before it releases with this free demo","content":"","url":"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-07-28-try-out-jrpg-oninaki-before-it-releases-with-this-free-demo","published":"2019-07-28T12:07:00Z","guid":"https://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=2050445"},{"title":"Wolfenstein: Cyberpilot -

\u003cem\u003eTiS\u003c/em\u003e staff basically failed to challenge their guests on anything in even the most mild fashion.  The tone is set in the first few minutes when, after Matterall asks about the effect of the blackout of local in null sec, Hilmar says that activity is up in the game, saying that the MAU and DAU numbers for July are at their highest point in the last five years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere is where, in the back of my head, I am yelling, \u0026#8220;Ask if that is because of the Season of Skills event, which required people to login daily to get free skill points!\u0026#8221;  What we got instead was Carnaeros basically holding Hilmar\u0026#8217;s coat, nicely explaining that those terms meant \u0026#8220;Monthly Active Users\u0026#8221; and \u0026#8220;Daily Active Users\u0026#8221; and then letting Hilmar carry on as though the blackout was all that went on in July.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI get that this is sort of the style of \u003cem\u003eTiS\u003c/em\u003e.  Matterall is a nice guy and likes to create a space where everybody on the show gets their turn to speak without being interrupted.  (Imagine the same interview on the \u003cem\u003eOpen Comms Show\u003c/em\u003e, where Dirk and Rahne would be shouting over each other to try to respond.)  This is, perhaps, how you get guests like Hilmar, by having a reputation of encouraging your guests to speak by giving them easy questions and letting them go their own way.  But given what was said by Hilmar and Falcon, it made for an unsatisfying listening experience as my brain kept coming up with follow up questions to expand or clarify or nail down what was really being said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd a lot was said on the show, which I am sure people will be digesting and examining and writing or speaking about for weeks to come.   I have things I want to pick apart from the show and, as I noted on Twitter, I could make a months worth of \u0026#8220;Quote of the Day\u0026#8221; posts out of it.  This could be a watershed moment for the game, the announcement of some drastic changes coming to \u003cem\u003eEVE Online.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr it might have been the online equivalent of a late night drunken dorm room discussion in college, a metaphorical circle jerk of \u0026#8220;wouldn\u0026#8217;t it be great\u0026#8230;\u0026#8221; sort of ideas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo my first question out of the gate is how seriously should we take this interview?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0026#8217;t even know who CCP Goodfella is, and that he is the brand manager makes it likely we can discount pretty much any ideas he espouses\u0026#8230; not that I can recall anything he said.  Sorry man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCCP Falcon is the Community Manager, which puts him in the thick of things with the players. But, by his own admission, he is not part of the design and development loop.  I had a post with \u003ca href=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/2019/07/26/quote-of-the-day-death-to-faxes-and-other-capital-ideas/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ea quote from him on Friday\u003c/a\u003e around a reply he put on Reddit about what he would do about capital ships.  He made it clear down the way that he has his own opinions about the game, which he can freely express, but which are not necessarily the official line of CCP.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo when Falcon is on about his dystopian hellscape vision of \u003cem\u003eEVE Online\u003c/em\u003e, he often prefaces it with \u0026#8220;If it were up to me,\u0026#8221; a solid indication that it is not.  The problem is that this tends to blur the line between when he is speaking for the company and when he is speaking for himself, as most people will only remember what he said and not how he prefaced it.  Is it his opinion or CCP\u0026#8217;s that people who don\u0026#8217;t like risk when they mine should go back to high sec?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then there is Hilmar.  He was involved in the development of the game, wrote code and was part of the design team and has been CEO at CCP since 2004.  While Pearl Abyss now owns CCP, he is still the boss on the ground in Iceland, so when he says something it gets some weight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut how much weight does it get\u0026#8230; or should it even get?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had been absent from the game for quite a stretch, making a big deal about returning and trying out Planetary Interaction and finding the UI for it abysmal.  The CEO complains, \u003ca href=\"https://www.eveonline.com/article/p7hle2/changes-coming-to-planetary-interaction-with-into-the-abyss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ea dev blog\u003c/a\u003e appears, and changes go in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe has said that he had been playing in wormhole space lately and now we have the local chat blackout in null sec.  This is a change that has been talked about for years, but the CEO goes and plays in WH space and suddenly it happens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow he says he is playing faction warfare, so I guess that is good news for somebody I hope.  Maybe FW will get some love\u0026#8230; or maybe some FW mechanic will get stuffed into null sec.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, he was also the voice of CCP during the \u003cem\u003eIncarna\u003c/em\u003e fiasco where he manifested some J. Allen Brack level arrogance in telling the players that the company knew better what they wanted when it came to the cash shop while dismissing people who wanted the hangar view of their ship back rather than the resource hungry captain\u0026#8217;s quarter or the metaphorically disastrous locked door, continuing to denigrate it as \u0026#8220;ship spinning\u0026#8221; even as they said they would return the feature in some form.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter that Hilmar declared that \u003ca href=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/2011/12/11/the-era-of-the-jesus-feature-is-over/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ethe era of the Jesus Feature was over\u003c/a\u003e and CCP started updating and iterating on features they had launched then neglected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am also a bit skeptical of Hilmar\u0026#8217;s relationship with how things have worked out in the past.  One of his big talking points during the show was making the game easier for new players but harder for veterans.  Malcanis says that anything you do for new players tends to benefit vets even more so, while we have clearly seen that making things difficult for veterans tends to just lock them into their position, with the changes essentially turning into barriers that keep newer players out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he is talking about a better NPE\u0026#8230; a topic about which I have another post brewing\u0026#8230; that is one thing.  But beyond that how do you help new players?  And does the planned Chaos Era help the \u003ca href=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/2019/06/23/is-new-player-retention-fixable-in-eve-online/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003enew player retention issue that CCP went on about\u003c/a\u003e at EVE North?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, does Hilmar saying something mean it is going to happen?  Not that what he is saying is good or bad, but is he the final word?  Does this represent consensus in the development team or just voicing his own opinions?  Is the Chaos Era about to begin in New Eden?  Will there be a dev blog?  Hilmar said that there are a lot of destabilizing things that will show up in the coming weeks.  So maybe it is already a done deal?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0026#8217;t know.  We\u0026#8217;ll probably have to wait and see and evaluate what we get.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRelated material:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.talkinginstations.com/2019/07/ccp-blackout-interview/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eTalking in Stations interview\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/ci6efy/ccp_hilmar_ccp_falcon_and_ccp_goodfella_reveal/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eReddit Thread with Select Quotes transcribed by Suitonia\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEvehermit \u0026#8211; \u003ca href=\"https://evehermit.wordpress.com/2019/07/27/mindset/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eMindset\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://tagn.wordpress.com/2019/07/28/hilmar-and-the-chaos-era-of-eve-online/","published":"2019-07-28T17:15:07Z","guid":"http://tagn.wordpress.com/?p=71814"}]},{"url":"http://feeds.foxnews.com/foxnews/scitech?format=xml","items":[]},{"url":"https://feeds.feedburner.com/TheAtlantic?format=xml","items":[{"title":"Searching for Beto","content":"\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eFLINT, Mich.—“Do you need me to check the sturdiness of the noodle?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eBeto O’Rourke leaned over a pot of boiling water. Mae and David Collins and their 17-year-old twins had invited him over for dinner. (A nonprofit group had connected them before the candidate’s visit to Michigan last week.) The former Texas representative and not-so-long-ago Democratic sensation sat around the Collinses’ dining-room table, talking about what had gone wrong since lead poisoned their water and a generation of the city’s children—a crisis that, five years later, still hasn’t been entirely resolved. Of course, this was O’Rourke having a searching conversation, so a staffer was squeezed into the corner livestreaming the exchange almost from the moment he’d walked in the door carrying groceries. Wally, the family dog, barked in the other room—“He’s damaged from the water,” Mae Collins explained. Wally was still drinking out of a bowl filled from the faucet long after the Collins parents realized they needed to keep their children away from the taps. The dog’s hair went white, and, according to his owners, he’s now angry and on edge all the time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIt’s one thing to talk about government failure. It’s another, O’Rourke believes, to speak directly to potential Michigan voters about what the Flint water crisis has meant for their homes and their lives and their communities—to hold up for the camera the jugs of water they have to buy just to make pasta. At home in Texas, the candidate is the cook, but his wife, Amy O’Rourke, took the lead in Flint on Wednesday night. (He did chop the onions and came back to add all the pieces to the sauce.) He joked about throwing a piece of spaghetti against the wall to see whether it would stick. Instead, he grabbed a piece and sucked it in over a few bites: approved. “We got it just in time!” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThey took their time cooking dinner; no one was in a rush to eat. His team brought pie and a chocolate cake for dessert. They said he wanted time to really get to know the Collins family. Other candidates were in debate prep, but this was how O’Rourke spent a long night six days before a debate, just 70 miles away in Detroit, that his biggest supporters agree is crucial for turning around what might prove to be the most drastic drop in a Democratic presidential campaign since Howard Dean screamed his way into political history in 2004.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eMedia coverage has gone from “Betomania”—the national excitement over his tight Senate race against Ted Cruz last year, the one that led Barack Obama to say he saw himself in O’Rourke—to how he’s going to \u003ca href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/o-rourke-s-campaign-cratering-he-s-got-plan-bring-n1031921\"\u003e“bring back Betomania.”\u003c/a\u003e On Wednesday, I was the only reporter with him in this Flint family’s kitchen as he drained the boiled water and added butter to the noodles. (“That’s the secret,” he told the livestream audience.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eOut on the trail, O’Rourke has talked up how he was counted out in 2005, during his first city-council race in El Paso, Texas, or when he won his House seat in a primary against an incumbent in 2012. “The biggest misconception about me, given where we are in the polls right now, is that our chances have narrowed and diminished in this race,” he insisted earlier Wednesday in Detroit at the NAACP convention, which had invited him and seven other candidates to the state.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eO’Rourke’s second-quarter fundraising total, announced two weeks ago, started to cement the sense of flop from polls that had him down to 1 or 2 percent, after being in third place when he announced in March he was running. He raised $3.6 million from April through June, meaning that after raising a blowout $6.1 million in his first 24 hours in the race, he picked up just $6.9 million in the three and a half months that followed. O’Rourke and his aides know how much is riding on the second debate next week, but they’re also struggling with what to do: He became a national name partly based on a \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGWmh-maevk\"\u003eviral video\u003c/a\u003e of him defending Colin Kaepernick’s kneeling during the national anthem. Re-creating that in a rapid-fire, multi-podium debate is pretty much impossible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003ePlus, he has to compete directly with South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, whom he’ll share the stage with for the first time on Tuesday night. Both candidates are young white guys (O’Rourke is 46, Buttigieg 37), branding themselves as the bright, shiny future of the Democratic Party. Buttigieg’s explosion tracks with O’Rourke’s implosion. Any hopes O’Rourke has of rising again may depend on Buttigieg collapsing, which he shows no signs of doing; his polling has remained decent, and he raised $24.8 million for the second quarter, more than anyone else running.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2019/07/pete-buttigieg-ready-talk-about-racial-inequality/593773/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: Pete Buttigieg is ready to talk about racial inequality\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThey’re not that similar—it’s heart versus head. O’Rourke is the inspired storyteller, Buttigieg the precision analyst. O’Rourke nannied and chased dreams of being in a band after graduating from college; Buttigieg was a Rhodes scholar and went on to work at McKinsey. O’Rourke sees the future of America in the cross-border swirl of El Paso and new Democrats in Texas; Buttigieg sees it in the Rust Belt turnaround of South Bend and forgotten Democrats in Indiana. Nevertheless, many people watching the race closely—including on each campaign—do not see room for both candidates.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThey have different styles on the trail. O’Rourke drove to the Homestead detention facility the morning after the first debate in Miami. Surrounded by a clump of reporters, he mounted a stepladder and waved a large paper heart, calling out to the detainees in Spanish. Buttigieg went the next morning with four other presidential candidates and spoke about how Americans deserved to know what horrors their tax dollars are going toward. Afterward, he stopped for a long CNN appearance with the camp as the backdrop, and was rushed into his car for the next campaign stop without realizing that the frustrated advocates had wanted him to climb the ladder too.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eLast week, as O’Rourke dug into his plate of spaghetti, I asked him what he made of Buttigieg. “He comes across to me as a very thoughtful, very smart person. And that’s—that’s definitely my superficial takeaway,” he said. When I asked Buttigieg to talk about O’Rourke, he declined through an aide.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eOf course, Buttigieg isn’t the only one in O’Rourke’s way in the scramble to get in the mix with the leading candidates. Among the most obvious others is Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, who is also talking up human connections and the need to come together. Booker was in Flint on Wednesday afternoon too, though without any public events—he was meeting with Mayor Karen Weaver and local state Representative Sheldon Neeley (who’s also the head of the black legislative caucus). He walked through the farmers’ market and an arcade with Little Miss Flint. (Booker beat her at Street Fighter; she beat him at Ms. Pac-Man.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/06/cory-booker-iowa-2020/592246/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: Cory Booker’s one-state plan\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eO’Rourke is sensitive to the criticism that he is superficial and his campaign is thin on policy plans. He has released several big proposals—on immigration reform, on a caregiver tax credit, on tackling structural inequity in education. “I talk about a $500 billion permanent education fund and $20 to $25 billion that spins off every year that’s invested in addressing the gap in equity funding for majority-minority schools. Does that connect with you? I don’t know—maybe it does, maybe it doesn’t. Maybe those are all abstractions and numbers.” He began to trail off. The most succinct explanation I’ve heard O’Rourke give of what he thinks his campaign is about came at the beginning of June, in South Carolina, when he had just a few minutes onstage to make his case at Representative Jim Clyburn’s fish fry. O’Rourke told the crowd he was “making sure that the full story of the United States of America is told to the people of the United States of America—because we know that when everyone’s story is included in our national story, it is only then that we can right the wrongs and set this country on the right path.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eAs he sat in a folding chair under a tent on the Collinses’ driveway in Flint, O’Rourke brought up the civil-rights movement, and how laws changed only when people saw the protests in carefully captured encounters on TV. “I want to do everything I can to bring those stories forward and also tell them. I think that’s how we connect as humans,” O’Rourke told me.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThis is both philosophical and practical to him.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e“I can only say that personal connection is fundamental. I just don’t know enough about the other candidates to dish on them and say they’re all numbers and policies, because I just don’t know,” O’Rourke told me. “That’s how I’ve always connected, when people have shared, or other policy makers have shared a story—even just reading history, [Lyndon Johnson] talking about the class he taught in Cotulla, Texas. You can tell there’s an emotional connection. Those Mexican American children he knew really didn’t have the same shot that he did as a white kid in that state, and he knew civil rights was the way to begin to address that. That’s powerful stuff for me.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eA couple of hours earlier, at the NAACP convention in Detroit, O’Rourke told the story of a black man, Lawrence Nixon, who had shown up at an El Paso firehouse in 1924 with his poll-tax receipt and was turned away. He finished by talking about Thelma White, also from El Paso, who attempted to integrate Western Texas College. Thurgood Marshall was one of her lawyers when she sued the state to be admitted.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eButtigieg spoke right after O’Rourke at the NAACP event. He talked about the “journey of South Bend,” how there had been no “recognizable promotion or accountability information” for the police department when he’d come in as mayor, and how he’d worked to create that system, starting by hiring the first African American person as corporation counsel. He touched on his extensive “Douglass Plan” for black economic empowerment. Twice he mentioned that he thinks racial divisions could unravel America, a line \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/06/buttigieg-interview-mayor-responds-police-shooting/592384/?utm_source=feed\"\u003ehe’s repeated since a white police officer killed a black man in South Bend last month, setting off weeks of community protests and outrage.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eAfterward, Buttigieg flew to California for fundraising events and to tour Vector90, a co-working space in Los Angeles founded by the late rapper Nipsey Hussle, who was \u003ca href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/05/22/725664658/suspect-in-nipsey-hussle-killing-indicted\"\u003eshot on the street in March.\u003c/a\u003e O’Rourke drove to an event in Flint at 100K Ideas, a business incubator with a hipster vibe. Aleah Glory Phillips, a 20-year-old aspiring musician, told him that she wanted to be in a punk band, too, and tour the country. “Do it!” O’Rourke told her. “Put everything in the car and drive.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e“I’ll settle for Bernie, I’ll settle for Biden—but he seems dope, he seems cool,” Phillips told me afterward. He seems relatable, she said, loving that he loves The Clash.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eTwo older women, Claire McClinton and Laura Macintyre, stood behind Phillips in line for photos.

Facebook and Google are biased, but in a way that has nothing to do with American political ideologies or parties. Instead, both of these global systems favor content that generates strong emotional reactions from users—clicks, shares, “likes,” and comments. There is a clear commercial reason for this design choice. It keeps users hooked, ready to click on more advertisements and thus generate more revenue for the platform.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eMedia scholar Zeynep Tufecki has explained how YouTube’s recommendation engine \u003ca href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/youtubes-recommendation-algorithm-has-a-dark-side/\"\u003esends viewers down rabbit holes of extremism\u003c/a\u003e because passive people like to be prodded to feel something, whether that’s anger, humor, joy, fear, or hatred.

It’s a terrible platform for deliberation. Democratic citizenship demands both motivation of the like-minded and deliberation among those with different ideas and agendas.

The algorithms are designed to work that way. We change YouTube and Facebook, so YouTube and Facebook change us—and not for the better.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eMany conservatives are hip to these criticisms. “Big tech companies like Google, Facebook, and Twitter exercise enormous influence on speech,” Hawley and Cruz wrote in \u003ca href=\"https://www.hawley.senate.gov/sites/default/files/2019-07/2019-07-15_FTC-Letter-Content-Moderation-Practices.pdf\"\u003ea letter to the FTC\u003c/a\u003e. “The vast majority of internet traffic flows through just a handful of these companies. They control the ads we see, the news we read, and the information we digest. And they actively censor some content and amplify other content based on algorithms and intentional decisions that are completely nontransparent.” I could not have described the situation more clearly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eYet rather than helping to forge a careful policy response, these two senators—and others on the right—leap from a description of a real set of problems to a mythical one. How and why do they mask the clear conclusions that Google and Facebook have helped mold the environment that gave us Donald Trump? The campaign to label these platforms “anti-conservative” serves two main purposes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eFirst, conservatives are \u003ca href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/what-liberal-media/\"\u003eworking the refs\u003c/a\u003e. If conservatives put media executives on their heels, constantly defending themselves or excusing themselves or apologizing for misunderstandings, then these companies are likely to bend toward conservatives out of fear or just exhaustion. This strategy has succeeded before. The liberal media critic Eric Alterman \u003ca href=\"https://www.basicbooks.com/titles/eric-alterman/what-liberal-media/9780786740932/\"\u003ehas documented\u003c/a\u003e campaigns in the 1990s and early 2000s that resulted in mainstream outlets like The New York Times pushing unjustified right-wing causes like the Whitewater investigation and the invasion of Iraq.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWorking the refs is still effective. \u003ca href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/04/why-mark-zuckerberg-is-cozying-up-to-conservatives\"\u003eMark Zuckerberg of Facebook\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/04/23/trump-meets-with-twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey-white-house/?utm_term=.2c262e53fd3e\"\u003eJack Dorsey of Twitter\u003c/a\u003e are not wise enough to understand what’s happening. So both Facebook and Twitter have allowed themselves to be worked. Platforms do make some intentional decisions to moderate the content that appears on their websites. But Facebook, Twitter, and Google staff try to do so based on principles and standards that they agonize over. Calls to violence or gender-based harassment should not be considered expressions of political ideology. More often than not, these companies under-filter hate speech because they have such strong concern for free speech. Far from rushing to suspend even conspiracy slingers and hatemongers like Alex Jones and Milo Yiannopoulos, executives at Facebook and Twitter \u003ca href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-bans-alex-jones-extremists/\"\u003ehemmed and hawed for years about whether to enforce their own terms of service\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eSurely Cruz and Hawley don’t mean to make Alex Jones’s cause their cause, right? If they did, they’d be equating American conservatism with ethno-nationalist trolling and loony fantasies like Pizzagate.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe campaign to convince people that the problem with Facebook and Google is that they lean left serves a second, more dangerous purpose. Fundamentally, it is an attempt to undermine seriousness—that is, to make any productive discussion impossible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eDeep, measured, scholarly critiques of the most powerful elements of our information ecosystem get drowned out when Cruz, Hawley, or Trump crow about bias. That’s an easy talking point for politicians to push, an easy story for distractible news organizations to report, and an easy idea for a gullible public to digest. The concept that billions of aggregated human decisions mold the actions of complex machine-learning systems—which in-turn guide human behavior, ultimately rendering us shallow, exhausted, angered, and willing to believe just about anything—is not such a pithy story.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eCruz and Hawley know perfectly well they can’t legislate or regulate the editorial choices that private companies make in America. They are not making serious proposals nor introducing any evidence for their complaints.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThat is the real story of Facebook and Google and their effects on our collective minds. We have been rendered unable to take serious things seriously. One reason we can’t face that horrible conclusion is that—well, we can’t take serious things seriously. Cruz, Hawley, and Trump benefit greatly from that vicious circle in the short term, but democracy and the pursuit of a decent society suffer greatly over time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/KHQa0NeMCs8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/KHQa0NeMCs8/","published":"2019-07-28T10:30:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-594916"},{"title":"George Will Changes His Mind—But Stays True to His Convictions","content":"\u003cp class=\"dropcap\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWhen I arrived in Washington, D.C., as an intern in the 1980s, there were two columnists I read with intentionality, with the goal of becoming a better and more thoughtful writer. One was Charles Krauthammer; the other was George Will.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWill—who began his twice-weekly column for \u003cem\u003eThe Washington Post\u003c/em\u003e in 1974, and won the Pulitzer Prize for commentary in 1977—has just published \u003cem\u003eThe Conservative Sensibility\u003c/em\u003e, a thoughtful, elegant reflection on American conservatism and the Founders’ political thought. By “sensibility,” Will has in mind less than an agenda but more than an attitude. A sensibility is, he argues, a way of seeing. His aim is less to tell people what to think rather than how to think through complex social problems.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWill’s 1983 book, \u003cem\u003eStatecraft as Soulcraft\u003c/em\u003e, had a significant intellectual impact on me. He questioned the Founders’ faith that moral balance and national cohesiveness will be supplied by the government’s doing little more than encouraging the free operation of “opposite and rival interests.” America was “ill-founded,” he wrote, because there was not enough attention to what he termed “the sociology of virtue.” Government needed to take a greater role in shaping the moral character of its citizens.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Conservative Sensibility\u003c/em\u003e suggests something else: that we should be attending more to the machinery of government and that government should be far less concerned about inculcating virtue in the citizenry. George Will circa 2019 seems a good deal less enamored with soulcraft as a goal of statecraft.

But he added, laughing, “It turns out that Madison was smarter than I am.” When he argued that America was ill-founded because insufficient attention was given to soulcraft, he explained, he hadn’t fully appreciated that the Founders were indeed arguing about statecraft as soulcraft—that a government really can inculcate virtue.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e“They understood that when a political regime establishes, through laws and courts and customs and other matters, a particular political economy, it is establishing, it is choosing the kind of people that would live under that regime,” Will said. He argues in\u003cem\u003e The Conservative Sensibility\u003c/em\u003e that capitalism doesn't just make us better off; it makes us better by enforcing such virtues as thrift, industriousness, and the deferral of gratification.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e“There's a wonderful passage that I quote from Tocqueville, in the 1830s floating down the Ohio River. On his left is slave-holding Kentucky. On his right is free soil of Ohio. And the difference Tocqueville says is one is crackling with energy and high spiritedness and optimism and the other is torpid and frozen like a fly in amber. And there's the difference,” Will told me. “So, long story short: I did not appreciate the extent to which Madisonian liberty with Hamiltonian energy is soulcraft.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"dropcap\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWhen I probed Will on what has gone wrong with the American right, he mentioned the anti-intellectualism that inevitably comes with populism, which he called “the obverse of conservatism.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e“Populism is the belief in the direct translation of public impulses, public passions. Passion was the great problem for the American Founders,” Will points out. “Populism is a direct translation of popular passions into governments through a strong executive. Someone who might say something like, ‘Only I can fix it.’ Which of course is what the current president said to the convention that nominated him in 2016.” Will argued that Madison understood the need to “filter and refine and deflect and slow public opinion through institutions. To make it more refined, to produce what Madison called, in one of his phrases that I’m particularly fond of, ‘mitigated democracy.’\"\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e“The principle of representative government, which is at the heart of conservatism, is that the people do not decide, the people choose who will decide. And that’s why populism inevitably becomes anti-intellectual.” I asked Will what would most concern the Founders about contemporary politics. “Political leaders today seem to feel that their vocation is to arouse passions,” he told me, “not to temper and deflect and moderate them.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur conversation moved from James Madison to Donald Trump, who, Will says, is not mentioned in his book for the same reason Doris Day isn’t: Neither has made a contribution to our understanding of conservatism.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eOf course, President Trump matters in a way that Doris Day does not, since it is Trump, by his takeover of the Republican Party, who has fundamentally redefined the GOP, and in so doing, left conservatism politically homeless.

What Mr. Trump has done is make acceptable, make normal, a form of behavior that would get a third grader sent to the principal's office or to bed without dessert.” Will argues that Trump’s agenda, to the degree it pleases conservatives, is what any Republican president would have done. “So the question is what does Trump bring that's distinctive?” Will said. “And it's all vulgarity, coarsening, semi-criminality.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eI pressed the point, asking about the concrete, tangible harm of Trump’s conduct.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e“The answer is in the terms themselves,” Will replied. “The norms, that is, what are normal and what are normative, cease to be normal.

In fact, he was ultimately done in by them.

Which brings us back to Statecraft as Soulcraft.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e“The American nation’s finest political career derived from Lincoln’s refusal to allow his country to be seduced into thinking of itself in an unworthy way,” Will wrote 35 years ago.

It is folly to will an end but neglect to will the means to the end. The presuppositions of our polity must be supplied, politically.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eHe added, “To revitalize politics and strengthen government, we need to talk about talk. We need a new, respectful rhetoric—respectful, that is, of the better angels of mankind’s nature.” The reason, he said, is because “mankind is not just matter, not just a machine with an appetitive ghost in it.

Today it's 17 percent—and that 60-point evaporation of government prestige has accompanied a 60-fold increase in government pretensions. I would think my progressive friends would be alarmed by this, because their entire agenda depends on strong government and strong government depends on public confidence in the government.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e“What I'd like conservatives to take away from this book,” Will added, “is the sense of the enormous intellectual pedigree behind conservatism from Madison to Lincoln to Hayek and the rest.” Will said conservatives need to answer the question: What does conservatism want to conservative?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eFor Will, the answer is the American founding, by which he has in mind three things: the doctrine of natural rights, understood as rights essential to the flourishing of creatures with our natures; a belief in human nature, meaning we are more than creatures who absorb whatever culture we're situated in; and a government architecture, principally the separation of powers, that is essential to making good on what he refers to as the most crucial verb in the Declaration of Independence. “In the second paragraph it says that governments are instituted to secure our rights,” he said. “And they are secured by the separation of powers.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/01/donald-trump-brawls-james-robart-and-judiciary/580000/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: The President learns about separation of powers\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe most important of all revolutions, Edmund Burke said, is a “revolution in sentiment, manners and moral opinion.” What conservatives like Will and I believe, and what we think Trump supporters either don’t understand or deny, is the destructive revolution in manners and mores that Donald Trump is ushering in, the enormous cultural and social blast radius of his presidency. Through his promiscuous lying and assault on demonstrable truths, his cruelty and crudity, his coarseness, bullying and dehumanization of his opponents, and his lawlessness and conspiracy-mongering—the whole corrupt, packaged deal—he has brought us into dark new realms.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThere was a time when Republicans and conservatives more generally insisted that culture was upstream of politics and in many respects more important than politics; that leaders needed to take great care in cultivating and validating standards of decency, honor and integrity; and that a president who destroyed rather than defended cultural norms and high standards would do grave injury to America. But now Republicans are willing to sacrifice soul and culture for the sake of promised policy victories.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"dropcap\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWill took, as his own intellectual model, a figure very different from Trump. He dedicated Statecraft as Soulcraft, to his father—Frederick L. Will, a professor of philosophy—and he refers to him briefly in The Conservative Sensibility. “I had breakfast and dinner with my father for 18 years,” Will told me. “And he was not didactic; he was not a moralist. I can remember very few times when he made a point of telling me things.” (In a provocative chapter on religion, Will says that like his father, he is an “amiable, low-voltage atheist.”)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nWill, who earned his Ph.D. in politics at Princeton and later taught political philosophy, added this: “I remember it used to be a big deal when the new automobiles came out. The model year. And we went down to look at the Ford dealership and it was the first year they had a Crown Victoria. And the Crown Victoria had a big swoop of chrome right over the roof. And my father looked at this thing and said they ought to have called it the Mozart Wagon. And I said why? And he said, ‘Because Mozart proved that you could be a genius without being ostentatious.’ And that always struck me. Not that my father had any illusions that his son was a genius, but it was just a way of looking at the world. I mean, my father obviously was crucial. He was articulate, we had a house full of books, and he was a measured philosopher. So he made distinctions, which is what philosophers do.” It’s what some of our best columnists do, too.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eNear the end of our interview I reminded Will that it was said that Clare Boothe Luce told President Kennedy that a great man gets a single sentence in the history books: Lincoln preserved the union and freed the slaves. Franklin Roosevelt lifted us out of the Great Depression and helped us win a world war.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e“If the great columnists got a single sentence in the history books,” I asked Will, “what would you want to say about your contribution?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e“It would be to convince people that politics is both fun and dignifies – that it has a great and stately jurisdiction, because and to the extent that it is a politics of ideas.

Most of them had one thing in common: They sucked.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI could write a whole book about the panels that have gone wrong in particularly strange or hilarious fashion: the one where the moderator fell asleep. The one where the opening statements lasted longer than the time allotted for the whole event. The one, high up on the 10th floor, when the acrobatic window washer stole the show.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese exotic horrors notwithstanding, I disagree with Leo Tolstoy: Every unhappy panel is unhappy in some of the same ways.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou know the scene. First come the long introductions. Then five people give opening statements of steadily increasing length. After that is a “conversation” in which the panelists talk past one another, sticking to the same old points they have made dozens of times before. This is followed by a few incoherent rants from the angriest members of the audience (question mark optional). Finally, a polite round of applause, which is anticipated with the same resigned longing as the saving bell on the last day of school.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt doesn’t have to be like that. At their rare best, panels can actually be fun and informative.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you are ever in charge of organizing a panel, it is your professional responsibility—nay, your sacred moral duty—to avoid some of the tortures daily visited upon suspecting conference-goers. In that spirit, here are my six rules for (panel) life.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1. Don’t have more than four people onstage.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s really hard to have a conversation among lots of people—especially when time is short. Yes, I know that you’re under pressure from marketing to include a member of that team. And, yes, I get that the sponsors of the conference need to be featured at some point. And, absolutely, it would be a shame to sacrifice the one speaker who actually, you know, has something interesting to say. But if you put more than four people onstage, you’re giving up on the prospect of a lively conversation from the very start. Don’t.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2. Keep introductions to a minimum.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMost panels have a captive audience. But even if bored members of the audience can’t leave, they can—and often do—go into internal exile. As the head of the organization introduces the conference organizer, and the conference organizer introduces the moderator, and the moderator reads a detailed list of the panelists’ achievements, half of the audience shifts its attention to shopping, snoozing, or engaging in fantasies of murder.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo never take more than 20 seconds for any single introduction. After all, much of the audience will already know who’s onstage. And everyone else can consult the program, or the internet.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e(Need more motivation to cut your introduction in half?

Asked to speak for five minutes, the first panelist will speak for seven, and the second panelist for 10. Quickly adopting to the rate of inflation, the third panelist will take up 15 minutes. Even if you avoided the temptation of putting more than four people onstage, half of your time has now been taken up by disconnected monologues.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAn even deeper problem with opening statements is that they make it much harder to put the ideas and perspectives of the speakers into genuine conversation with one another. Having set out their own tent, most speakers will stick to their turf. Most likely they will never emerge to meet one another on common (or contested) ground.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e4.

If a panelist drones on and on about a boring topic, don’t switch off; pass the baton to another speaker. And if the panelists are talking past one another, don’t cue up the next monologue; make sure they actually engage with one another’s ideas.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e5. Cut off the cranks.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI have a confession: I love rambling statements from the cranks in the audience.

And you definitely get to see how good everyone is at concealing their most uncharitable thoughts. What’s not to like?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut if you do want to stop the cranks from taking over—and despite my strange predilections, you probably should—your job is actually quite simple: Set out clear ground rules before you open the floor to the audience. Emphasize that you are looking for concise questions, not long rants. Make clear that you will cut people off if they go on for longer than 20 seconds.

Since his early career working for noted Parisian houses such as Maison Paquin, Elsa Schiaparelli, and Christian Dior in the 1940s, Cardin’s oeuvre has expanded from refined suiting—the memorable red wool ensemble Jacqueline Kennedy wore in 1961 comes to mind—to otherworldly silhouettes and materials. In 1964, the space-obsessed designer presented his landmark Cosmocorps collection, a pinnacle of mod style with its miniskirts and dresses, geometric details, and one-piece jumpsuit designs. Seven years later, Cardin became the first civilian to don Buzz Aldrin’s Apollo 11 spacesuit, and his extraterrestrial fixation continues.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe retrospective exhibition “Pierre Cardin: Future Fashion”\u003cem\u003e \u003c/em\u003eat the Brooklyn Museum—timed to the 50th anniversary of the moon landing—explores the designer’s seven-decade-long career. Cardin’s multifaceted world is on full display: one filled to the brim with oddball space-age fashion, experimental textiles, product collaborations, and licensing opportunities, the latter of which sent his brand globally into homes and closets. Cardin persists today, reifying his vision for newness while predicting a tomorrow in which his designs will serve as a uniform of sorts: “In 2069, we will all walk on the moon or Mars wearing my ‘Cosmocorps’ ensembles. Women will wear Plexiglas cloche hats and tube clothing. Men will wear elliptical pants and kinetic tunics.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" height=\"522\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/07/_Cosmocorps_suits_and_Porthole_dresses_1968._Photograph_by_Yoshi_Takata/8f7dcc7ef.jpg\" width=\"672\"\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"caption\"\u003ePierre Cardin’s Cosmocorps suits and Porthole dresses, 1968 (Yoshi Takata / Courtesy of Archives Pierre Cardin)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Future Fashion”\u003cem\u003e \u003c/em\u003euses Cosmocorps as a prism through which to view Cardin’s explorations of gender, technology, and popular culture via his unorthodox silhouettes. (One section is devoted entirely to “bold shoulders.”) While fairly staid in layout, the show comes alive in the penultimate gallery, a room done up in intergalactic style with twinkling LED lights and a Saturn-like halo installation. It features Cardin’s more recent designs, including a number of “Parabolic” hoop-skirted evening gowns that pack flat for travel.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLiteral references to outer space aside, Cardin also revolutionized what brand licensing has become today, working with industrial designers to extend his namesake label beyond haute couture and the ready-to-wear market. This is evidenced in the show by the pairing of Cardin’s clothing designs with furniture or smaller household items (including a prototype of a pyramidal television). From the late 1960s onward, Pierre Cardin’s designs went mainstream with brand extensions, a difficult narrative that has remained at the forefront of the house’s history. A simple Google search of the designer’s long foray into licensing shows evidence of the harsh judgments directed at Cardin: “Pierre Cardin’s Demise to ‘Licensing King,’” reads one headline. Another touts the story “Pierre Cardin’s Bizarre Back Catalogue of Licensing,” while the \u003cem\u003eHarvard Business Review\u003c/em\u003e offers words of caution with “How Not to Extend Your Luxury Brand.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat articles of this sort tend not to consider is Cardin’s desire to freely develop his own universe beyond fashion, which he accomplished by entering the lexicon of 1970s and ’80s suburbia as a household name. I distinctly remember encountering the Pierre Cardin brand while growing up in suburban Canada, and at the Brooklyn Museum was instantly taken back to my childhood by two outsize cologne bottles on display, one with a space-helmet-like lid (for men), the other taking a dynamic rose, purple, and black form (for women). For any cultural form to truly transform daily life, it must play a role in people’s lives. It also often means, anachronistically, “selling out” (a concept that became a source of deep anxiety for 1990s alternative culture). But making a buck isn’t mutually exclusive to making an art, and the two have always been intertwined, whether hidden or in plain sight.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" height=\"475\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/07/Linen_pants_1972/4ec45949d.jpg\" width=\"672\"\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"caption\"\u003ePierre Cardin linen pants, 1972 (Courtesy of Archives Pierre Cardin)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe avant-garde’s interactions with mass culture and consumerism are surprisingly common. Historically, artists and designers have used mass or industrial means of production and distribution as a way of bringing their ideas to the fore. In 1920, the Italian futurist Thayaht had the pattern for his one-piece \u003cem\u003etuta\u003c/em\u003e work suit, which aimed to democratize fashion by providing a single uniform that anyone could wear, printed in copies of the Florentine newspaper \u003cem\u003eLa Nazione\u003c/em\u003e, hoping readers would replicate the design at home. The modest men’s shirting, tasteful belts, and neckties Cardin sold in chain department stores both represented and funded his forward-thinking ways. These were affordable and wearable alternatives to his other, more experimental designs: wacky men’s linen pants with bulbous knees from 1972, say, or a men’s silver vinyl vest, shaped like an inverted triangle, that exposes much of the torso, from 1994. (This attention to the popular also extends to Cardin’s early designs for the Beatles and his costumes for \u003cem\u003eThe Avengers\u003c/em\u003e television series.) Cardin’s mission of influence doubles as a philosophy to dress all.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe average person may never wear a space helmet, or a black velvet evening dress with a Swarovski-crystal-encrusted, orbit-shaped sleeve, or an LED-lit jumpsuit (all on view in “Future Fashion”), but likely will have seen the Pierre Cardin signature emblazoned on any number of products. In this way, Cardin, working steadily for decades, has made a twofold contribution to style: pursuing his avant-garde work on the high end and making his name known in homes around the world on the other. Either way, he imagines a tomorrow where his designs will be worn and used by all.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/OIkulTWv--g\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/OIkulTWv--g/","published":"2019-07-28T12:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-594577"},{"title":"Candy Land Was Invented for Polio Wards","content":"\u003cp\u003eIf you were a child at some point in the last 70 years, odds are you played the board game Candy Land. \u003ca href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=jftapGDTmYUC\u0026amp;pg=PA83\u0026amp;lpg=PA83\"\u003eAccording to\u003c/a\u003e the toy historian Tim Walsh, a staggering 94 percent of mothers are aware of Candy Land, and over 60 percent of households with a five-year-old child own a set.

What makes it so appealing? The answer may have something to do with the game’s history: It was invented by Eleanor Abbott, a schoolteacher, in a polio ward during the epidemic of the 1940s and 1950s.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/06/how-a-bad-nights-sleep-birthed-the-sound-conditioner/592177/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: How a bad night’s sleep birthed the sound conditioner\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe outbreaks had forced children into extremely restrictive environments. Patients were confined by equipment, and parents kept healthy children inside for fear they might catch the disease. Candy Land offered the kids in Abbott’s ward a welcome distraction—but it also gave immobilized patients a liberating fantasy of movement. That aspect of the game still resonates with children today.\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr class=\"c-section-divider\"\u003e\u003cp\u003ePoliomyelitis—better known as polio—was once a feared disease. It struck suddenly, paralyzing its victims, most of whom were children. The virus targets the nerve cells in the spinal cord, inhibiting the body’s control over its muscles. This leads to muscle weakness, decay, or outright fatality in extreme cases. The leg muscles are the most common sites of polio damage, along with the muscles of the head, neck, and diaphragm. In the last case, the patient would require the aid of an iron lung, a massive, coffin-like enclosure that forced the afflicted body to breathe. For children, whose still-developing bodies are more vulnerable to polio infection, the muscle wastage from polio can result in disfigurement if left untreated. Treatment typically involved physical therapy to stimulate muscle development, followed by braces to ensure the affected parts of the body retained their shape.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eVaccines appeared in the 1950s, and the disease was essentially eradicated by the end of the millennium. But in the mid-century, polio was a medical bogeyman, ushering in a climate of hysteria. “There was no prevention and no cure,” \u003ca href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-history-dept/2015/04/10/398515228/defeating-the-disease-that-paralyzed-america\"\u003ewrites\u003c/a\u003e the historian David M. Oshinsky.“Everyone was at risk, especially children. There was nothing a parent could do to protect the family.” Like the outbreak of AIDS in the 1980s, polio’s eruption caused fear because its vectors of transmission were poorly understood, its virulence uncertain, and its repercussions unlike other illnesses. Initially, polio was called “infantile paralysis” because it struck mostly children, seemingly at random. The evidence of infection was uniquely visible and visceral compared to infectious diseases of the past, too. “It maimed rather than killed,” as Patrick Cockburn \u003ca href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/features/polio-the-deadly-summer-of-1956-2117253.html\"\u003eputs it\u003c/a\u003e. “Its symbol was less the coffin than the wheelchair.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eChildren of the era faced an unenviable lot, whether infected with polio or not.

If you didn’t catch it, you would be stuck indoors for the foreseeable future (which, from a child’s perspective, might as well be forever).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor a child of the 1940s or ’50s, polio meant the same thing whether you contracted it or not: confinement.\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr class=\"c-section-divider\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Milton Bradley executive Mel Taft \u003ca href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=jftapGDTmYUC\u0026amp;pg=PA81\u0026amp;lpg=PA81\"\u003ehas said\u003c/a\u003e Eleanor Abbott, the inventor of Candy Land, was “a real sweetheart,” whom he liked immediately. According to Walsh, the two met when Abbott brought Milton Bradley a Candy Land prototype sketched on butcher paper. “Eleanor was just as sweet as could be,” Taft recalled. “She was a schoolteacher who lived in a very modest home in San Diego.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDetails about her life outside this interaction are scant. Curators at the Strong Museum of Play in Rochester, New York, say that the museum has no holdings in its extensive archives from Abbott’s records; they rely on Walsh’s account. Walsh told me that Taft was his only source; Hasbro, which now owns Milton Bradley, did not respond to a request for records that might verify Abbott as the game’s inventor. Among the few facts researchers have unearthed about her: A phone book containing her number \u003ca href=\"https://www.pacificsandiego.com/misc/pac-sweet-sensation-story.html\"\u003eexists in the collections\u003c/a\u003e of the San Diego Historical Society (the only trace of her in their archives). And according to some accounts, she gave much of the royalties she earned from Candy Land to children’s charities.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere is reason to believe Abbott was ideally suited to consider polio from a child’s perspective. As a schoolteacher, she would have been acquainted with children’s thoughts and needs. And in 1948, when she was in her late 30s, she herself contracted the disease.

Kids are poorly equipped to cope with boredom and separation from their loved ones under normal circumstances. But it would be even more unbearable for a child confined to a bed or an iron lung.

The board game gathers all your children in one place, occupying their time and attentions. Samira Kawash, a Rutgers professor, \u003ca href=\"https://www.journalofplay.org/sites/www.journalofplay.org/files/pdf-articles/3-2-article-polio-comes-home.pdf\"\u003esuggests\u003c/a\u003e that this is the main way polio informed the game’s development: “The point of Candy Land is to pass the time,” she writes, “certainly a virtue when one’s days are spent in the boring confines of the hospital and an appealing feature as well of a game used to pass the time indoors for children confined to the house.” For Kawash, Candy Land justifies and extends the imprisonment of the hospital, becoming another means of restriction.\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr class=\"c-section-divider\"\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eBut the themes of Candy Land tell a different story. Every element of Abbott’s game symbolizes shaking off the polio epidemic’s impositions.

In theme and execution, the game functions as a mobility fantasy. It simulates a leisurely stroll instead of the studied rigor of therapeutic exercise. And unlike the challenges of physical therapy, movement in Candy Land is so effortless, it’s literally all one can do. Every card drawn either compels you forward or whisks you some distance across the board. Each turn promises either the pleasure of unencumbered travel, or the thrill of unexpected flight.

At least part of Candy Land’s appeal is the feeling of independence it provides its young players. In a backstory printed in the game’s \u003ca href=\"https://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/Candyland,50thAnniversaryEditioninenglishandspanish.PDF\"\u003einstruction manual\u003c/a\u003e, the player tokens (in the current edition, four brightly colored plastic gingerbread men) are said to represent the players’ “guides.” It represents their chance to be an active agent, with assistance—an ambulatory adventurer, not a prisoner of the hospital or home. It may even mark the first time they feel like a protagonist.\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr class=\"c-section-divider\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe threat of polio has lessened over time, but Candy Land’s value persists because of what it teaches. This is not to rehash the usual litany of early childhood skills some Candy Land proponents \u003ca href=\"https://www.toyhalloffame.org/toys/candy-land\"\u003etout\u003c/a\u003e. Yes, the game strengthens pattern recognition. Sure, it can teach children to read and follow instructions. In theory, it shows children how to play together—how to win humbly or lose graciously. But any game could teach these skills.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCandy Land’s lessons are not to be found in the game, but in its results. Now that polio is a distant fear and mobility a power taken for granted, most games of Candy Land disappoint. The rules today are the same as they were in 1949, but something about the proceedings simply does not add up. Eventually, children recognize that they don’t have a hand in winning or losing. The deck chooses for them. An ordained victory is an empty one, without the satisfaction of triumph through skills or smarts.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen children want a more challenging experience, they leave Candy Land behind. And that, in the end, is what makes Candy Land priceless: It is designed to be outgrown. Abbott’s game originally taught children to envision a world beyond the polio ward, immobilized and separated from family, where opportunities for growth and adventure could still materialize. Today, that lesson persists more broadly. The game teaches children that all arrangements have their alternatives. It’s the start of learning how to imagine a better world than the one they inherited. As it has done for generations prior, Candy Land continues to send young children on the first steps of that journey.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/lLZMWbraoiA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/lLZMWbraoiA/","published":"2019-07-28T12:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-594424"},{"title":"\u003cem\u003eThe Mountain \u003c/em\u003eIs a Strange and Alienating Satire","content":"\u003cp\u003eRick Alverson’s new film \u003cem\u003eThe Mountain\u003c/em\u003e, which is set sometime in the 1950s, somewhere in the United States, is both an extremely stylized and mordantly accurate portrayal of its time and place. The hero is Andy (played by Tye Sheridan), a glassy-eyed youth who is as passive as a protagonist can get; he spends most of the movie staring into the middle distance while bizarre things happen in front of him. If that description makes \u003cem\u003eThe Mountain \u003c/em\u003esound strange and alienating, it certainly is, but this approach makes sense for the world Alverson is trying to create: It’s one that Andy can only experience by looking on in horror.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs a filmmaker, Alverson largely keeps his audience at arm’s length. His last two movies, \u003cem\u003eThe Comedy \u003c/em\u003eand \u003cem\u003eEntertainment\u003c/em\u003e, each starred an alternative comedian (Tim Heidecker and Gregg Turkington, respectively) playing a misanthrope bumbling his way through life; both films were bleak stories suffused by frosty dread. \u003cem\u003eThe Mountain \u003c/em\u003ehas a similar tone, but a wider scope, following Andy after he meets a celebrity doctor named Wallace Fiennes (Jeff Goldblum), a lobotomist who tours the country advocating for his method of invasive brain surgery as a form of therapy. Andy tails along to take pictures of patients and to escape the drudgery of his life, and from this premise, Alverson spins a surreal yarn about a country at its most self-confident and horrifying.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFiennes is a fictional character somewhat inspired by Walter Jackson Freeman II, the real-life American doctor who participated in the notorious prefrontal lobotomy of \u003ca href=\"https://blogs.uoregon.edu/autismhistoryproject/people/rosemary-kennedy/\"\u003eRosemary Kennedy\u003c/a\u003e. Freeman traveled to mental institutions around the U.S. in the ’50s and ’60s championing the dangerous brain surgery and continuing long after prefrontal lobotomies were widely discredited. To Alverson, who co-wrote \u003cem\u003eThe Mountain \u003c/em\u003ewith Dustin Guy Defa and Colm O’Leary, Freeman’s crusade speaks to the era the movie is satirizing: The 1950s was a time where an entirely unnecessary, invasive medical practice could succeed as a new frontier in science.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe film begins by examining Andy’s life with his imperious father, an ice-skating coach named Frederick (Udo Kier) who arranges epic, choreographed performances and belittles his son whenever he can. Alverson has always had an unsettling approach to dreamlike visuals, and the early section of \u003cem\u003eThe Mountain\u003c/em\u003e is full of them, including a particularly hypnotic shot of a group of skaters doing a fan dance around a picture of Frederick. It’s a low-level form of hero worship—within the skating rink, Frederick is a god—but when he meets an untimely end, Andy finds himself unmoored and in search of new mentorship.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlong comes Fiennes, the man supposedly responsible for the absence of Andy’s mother (he operated on her in an institution), who gathers Andy up and takes him on the road for his lobotomy-advocacy tour. If there’s one reason to see this movie, it’s Goldblum, an actor who has become a pop-culture mascot in recent years but who occasionally reminds viewers that he’s one of the most captivating talents of his generation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYes, Goldblum does perfectly solid, amusing work in blockbusters like\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/11/thor-ragnarok-review/544871/?utm_source=feed\"\u003e \u003cem\u003eThor: Ragnarok\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e (and has turned in more rote appearances in sequels to his ’90s hits \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/06/jurassic-world-fallen-kingdom-review/563501/?utm_source=feed\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eJurassic Park\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e and\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/06/independence-day-resurgence-is-an-embarrassment-to-blockbusters/488606/?utm_source=feed\"\u003e \u003cem\u003eIndependence Day\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e). But his performance in \u003cem\u003eThe Mountain \u003c/em\u003eis a disquieting, electrifying piece of horror-charisma, a perfect balance of allure and sociopathy that never requires Goldblum to turn up his energy to its usual manic proportions. It’s simple to understand how Fiennes lures Andy into his world by becoming a loving surrogate father, but it’s just as easy to recognize the arrogant evil that lies beneath his façade as a caring physician.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs Fiennes and Andy traverse the country, it becomes clear that the doctor’s career is crumbling, and that the counter-cultural movements that will soon sweep the nation are beginning to take shape out west. Andy eventually falls for a rebellious patient named Susan (Hannah Gross) and gets sucked into the orbit of her father, another type of guru, a New Age healer named Jack (Denis Lavant). The back half of \u003cem\u003eThe Mountain \u003c/em\u003etries to reckon with this proto-hippie style of thinking, with the kinetic Lavant dancing and screaming for his audience—a more direct form of proselytizing than Goldblum’s sinuous monologues.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut Alverson’s ever-steady camera, and his caustic outlook, are more suited to puncturing the puffed-up ’50s than the anarchic, approaching ’60s. The sections of \u003cem\u003eThe Mountain \u003c/em\u003ewith Fiennes are genuinely enrapturing, if chilling; they’re engrossing enough that whenever the plot diverged from them, I lost interest. Alverson remains a powerfully scathing voice in American indie filmmaking, and the way he can manipulate the star image of someone like Goldblum is something to behold. Unfortunately, \u003cem\u003eThe Mountain \u003c/em\u003enever quite measures up to the director’s storytelling ambitions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/ciRtDNugDjs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/ciRtDNugDjs/","published":"2019-07-28T13:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-594895"},{"title":"Letters: How to Help Monarch Butterflies","content":"\u003ch2\u003eMonarch Butterflies Reared in Captivity Lack a Crucial Ability\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWild monarchs have faced a steep decline in recent decades, \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/06/hand-reared-monarch-butterflies-dont-migrate/592423/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eEd Yong wrote in June\u003c/a\u003e.

Steven Kruijswijk completed what Tour organizers said was the tightest podium in the 116-year history of the race, with just 1 minute, 31 seconds separating the first and third places after three weeks of racing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe 21st and final stage was won in a sprint finish on the Champs-Elysees by Australian Caleb Ewan, the dominant sprinter of this Tour with three stage wins. Keeping with race tradition on its final day, the 155 riders who survived the Tour rode at a pedestrian pace and in a joyful atmosphere before hitting the Champs-Elysees. Bernal chatted with French rival Julian Alaphilippe and raised a glass of champagne as he rode.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe setting sun turned the avenue golden as Bernal and the pack sped on its cobblestones to the finish, where Bernal fell into the arms of his family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaking in French before the start, Bernal thanked \u0026#8220;France for organizing the most beautiful race in the world, and the most beautiful victory of my life.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Colombia celebrated its new national hero, the millions of French fans who had lined the roads through east, central and southern France, and up into the thinning air of the Pyrenees and Alps, were ruing a bitter-sweet Tour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, their hearts soared with fabulous racing from French riders Alaphilippe, who held the iconic yellow jersey for 14 days, and Thibaut Pinot, who won on the first of seven 2,000-meter-plus (6,500-feet) peaks scaled by the highest Tour in history.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut joy turned to sorrow when Alaphilippe and Pinot\u0026#8217;s prospects of becoming France\u0026#8217;s first winner since 1985 were cruelly dashed just two days before the grand finale in Paris, on an epic Stage 19 where Mother Nature became a party-pooping guest. An almighty dump of torrential rain and hail severed the Tour route just as Bernal was succeeding in ripping the race lead off Alaphilippe, who\u0026#8217;d clung to it like a kid with a favorite toy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;Julian Alaphilippe made us dream,\u0026#8221; said Celestin Simon, a Parisian who cheered his hero on the Champs-Elysees in a pointy hat of French red, white and blue. \u0026#8220;Unfortunately, there\u0026#8217;s no victory at the end.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlaphilippe, more than anyone, first ignited and then stoked what will long be remembered as a Tour of fireworks. With his goatee beard and can\u0026#8217;t-catch-me attacks that rivals couldn\u0026#8217;t match, Alaphilippe embodied \u0026#8220;panache,\u0026#8221; the old-school class so cherished by fans of the 116-year-old Tour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlaphilippe\u0026#8217;s enterprise first put him in yellow in Champagne country on Stage 3 and then, after he lost the lead on Stage 6, got him the jersey back on Stage 8, which he held through the Pyrenees and into the Alps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it was there that Bernal, raised at altitude in Colombia and at home in thinner air, struck and set Colombia into rapture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;When I saw that he won, I said, \u0026#8216;I need to go with my music to support him,'\u0026#8221; said clarinet-playing Colombian fan Sebastian Cortes, who traveled from Strasbourg in eastern France to party Sunday on the Champs-Elysees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBernal flew up the Tour\u0026#8217;s highest climb, the dizzying Iseran pass at 2,770 meters (9,088-feet) above sea level, demolishing what remained of Alaphilippe\u0026#8217;s lead on Stage 19 and building a sizeable one of his own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe watch was then stopped, with Bernal way ahead, when the hailstorm suddenly coated the route with ice, amid fears that riders on tires barely wider than their thumbs could skid off into the rock- and ravine-scarred Alpine d\u0026eacute;cor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCompounding the misery for France, Pinot abandoned the race in tears, hobbled by a left-thigh muscle tear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that was that. The Tour that had been careening to a rock \u0026#8216;n\u0026#8217; roll finish instead had the plug pulled on it. Landslides also truncated the last Alpine Stage 20, which still proved too long for the by-now exhausted Alaphilippe, who slipped off the podium entirely, despite getting words of encouragement in a call the previous night from French President Emmanuel Macron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThomas used the last Alpine climb to secure himself the runner-up spot in Paris, giving the Ineos team a podium 1-2 with Bernal. Third-placed Steven Kruijswijk, a Dutch Mr. Steady, pulled off the feat of being wholly unremarkable during the three weeks, while Alaphilippe, Pinot and Bernal and others rocked. Quite remarkably, none of the top four riders won a stage. Alaphilippe, in fifth, won two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;I left my skin on the road these past weeks,\u0026#8221; Alaphilippe told French sports newspaper L\u0026#8217;Equipe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut instead of a red-white-and-blue celebration, Paris was instead being painted in Colombian red, blue and yellow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEspecially yellow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/time/topstories/~4/9trbyBapFr0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/9trbyBapFr0/","published":"2019-07-28T20:14:56Z","guid":"http://time.com/?p=5637323"}]},{"url":"https://rss.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml","items":[{"title":"Grasshopper Invasion of Las Vegas May Last Weeks, Experts Say","content":"","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/27/us/grasshoppers-vegas.html?emc=rss\u0026partner=rss","published":"2019-07-28T00:07:55Z","guid":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/27/us/grasshoppers-vegas.html"},{"title":"Washington, D.C., Power Failure Affects More Than 30,000 Customers","content":"","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/27/us/dc-power-outage.html?emc=rss\u0026partner=rss","published":"2019-07-28T00:07:55Z","guid":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/27/us/dc-power-outage.html"},{"title":"Twin Infants Found Dead in Car in Bronx After Father Left Them, Police Say","content":"","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/26/nyregion/twins-dead-car.html?emc=rss\u0026partner=rss","published":"2019-07-28T00:07:55Z","guid":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/26/nyregion/twins-dead-car.html"},{"title":"Strippers Are Doing It for Themselves","content":"","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/24/style/strip-clubs.html?emc=rss\u0026partner=rss","published":"2019-07-28T00:09:23Z","guid":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/24/style/strip-clubs.html"},{"title":"Less Trash, More Schools — One Plastic Brick at a Time","content":"","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/27/world/africa/recycled-plastic-school-building-conceptos-plasticos.html?emc=rss\u0026partner=rss","published":"2019-07-28T00:09:21Z","guid":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/27/world/africa/recycled-plastic-school-building-conceptos-plasticos.html"},{"title":"Fifth N.Y.P.D.

It’s a bizarre combination of storytelling by bland rote formula, mixed in with a few ideas that are so blazingly new, they make you sort of squint at the screen and say, “But … how?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"iKANM8\"\u003eMost of \u003cem\u003eThe Rook\u003c/em\u003e is a generic, supernatural-inflected spy thriller; if you have ever seen an ad for \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindspot_(TV_series)\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eBlindspot\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, you pretty much have\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003ethe general gist already: lady with amnesia, powers mysterious even to her, government conspiracies, etc., etc. But part of \u003cem\u003eThe Rook\u003c/em\u003e is built around a love story between our amnesiac heroine and another character — a character named Gestalt, who is a single consciousness in four bodies, played by three actors. And that plot is something that I have never seen on television before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"35HILR\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Rook\u003c/em\u003e’s latest episode, “Chapter 4,” which aired Sunday night on Starz, is a case study in how deeply inconsistent this show can get. Most of what goes down is a\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003estraightforward-enough shadowy conspiracy storyline, with a couple shoot-’em-up scenes just to liven things up a little and a few betrayals that, if you have ever watched TV before, you will see coming from a mile away. But on the other hand, there is Gestalt, and no matter what else is happening onscreen, I never quite see what’s happening with Gestalt coming. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"sBn0mk\"\u003eMost of \u003cem\u003eThe Rook\u003c/em\u003e is a stew of ideas you have already seen play out in more interesting ways elsewhere\u003c/h3\u003e\n  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\"Emma Greenwell as Myfanwy peers around a doorway in The Rook\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9CPvOva1w_seufyNEnRqY_czhn0=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18338473/Rook.jpg\"\u003e\n      \u003ccite\u003eStarz\u003c/cite\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003eMyfanwy (Emma Greenwell) is looking for answers!\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"JcQdpQ\"\u003eThe premise of \u003cem\u003eThe Rook\u003c/em\u003e is as follows: a young woman named Myfanwy (\u003ca href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4563896/?ref_=tt_cl_t1\"\u003eEmma Greenwell\u003c/a\u003e) wakes up covered in blood and surrounded by dead bodies, with no memory of her past life. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"2Ewbpd\"\u003eMyfanwy (“Rhymes with Tiffany,” we are immediately instructed) rapidly learns that she is an operative for the Checquy, a secret branch of the British government devoted to regulating “EVAs,” or people with “Extreme Variant Abilities.” (They’re\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eX-Men mutants, basically.) Myfanwy herself is an EVA with the power to … zap people with electricity, I guess (it has a fancier name in the show, but that’s basically what it does), but because her powers aren’t particularly strong, she works as a paper-pusher in middle management. Her rank at the Checquy is “rook.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"gjqpjS\"\u003eNow, Myfanwy must go back to work at the Checquy without revealing to anyone that her memories have gone, or that her powers have apparently become strong enough to kill a whole bunch of people. Luckily, she seems to have had some notice that she would soon lose her memory, because Myfanwy’s past self has left her a helpful series of letters and video guides that explain exactly who everyone at the Checquy is and how they relate to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"BK9glB\"\u003eWould you be shocked to learn that things at the Checquy may not be entirely on the up and up, and that it may in fact be exploiting the very EVAs it claims to want to protect? Would you be shocked to learn that Myfanwy’s kindly boss Farrier (\u003ca href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000613/?ref_=tt_cl_t2\"\u003eJoely Richardson\u003c/a\u003e) — who Past Myfanwy describes as the only person she can trust, and who is the only one who knows about Myfanwy’s amnesia — is maybe not acting entirely in Myfanwy’s best interests? Too bad, because \u003cem\u003eThe Rook\u003c/em\u003e sure expects you to be shocked by both those revelations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"HpfR0Y\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Rook\u003c/em\u003e is based loosely on a novel of the same title by Daniel O’Malley, but while I haven’t read the book and can’t confirm, \u003ca href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/rook-review-1221592\"\u003ethe Hollywood Reporter argues\u003c/a\u003e that the Starz show has ditched most of O’Malley’s “fits of grotesque whimsy” in favor of the blandness we find onscreen. That blandness extends to most of the characters, whom Past Myfanwy helpfully explains to us with a character chart that lays out everyone’s basic archetype: there’s ice queen PR agent, the sweetly capable assistant, the apparently sinister but ultimately well-meaning second-in-command, and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"IFM1Lr\"\u003eWhere O’Malley’s “fits of whimsy” appear to have been too entrenched to fully weed out, however, is in the character of Gestalt, another rook at the Chequy. Gestalt looks like a set of quadruplet siblings: one set of identical twins who go by Teddy and Alex (both played \u003ca href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4151820/?ref_=tt_cl_t3\"\u003eJon Fletcher\u003c/a\u003e), and one set of fraternal twins who go by Eliza (\u003ca href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2397300/?ref_=tt_cl_t5\"\u003eCatherine Steadman\u003c/a\u003e) and Robert (\u003ca href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3995719/?ref_=tt_cl_t4\"\u003eRonan Raftery\u003c/a\u003e). \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Oh0MpC\"\u003eAll four of those siblings, though, are actually the same person.

But it’s still pretty rare to meet a hive mind character with whom we are asked to empathize who \u003cem\u003edoesn’t\u003c/em\u003e turn out to secretly be a group of individuals cruelly forced into a collective by an oppressive overlord. And that makes sense, because it’s simple to root for an individual person with an easily understood, singular body to break away from a mass of people who talk in unison and use confusing pronouns. That’s a story that we are trained early on\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eto grasp and to look for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"xCXESh\"\u003eBut that’s not the case with Gestalt. Gestalt really is one person, and what oppresses Gestalt is acting like they’re not. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"z2dL2g\"\u003eThe Chequy trained Gestalt to compartmentalize as a child, so that each body can perform different tasks. That means Gestalt has four times the operating power of a normal spy: They can be in four different places doing four different things at once, and they don’t have to communicate with each other because what one of them knows, all of them know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"smEEUy\"\u003eBut when Gestalt is alone, they don’t differentiate between their bodies. When we see them get ready in the morning in “Chapter Three,” they move in unison, their bodies interacting with one another only in the way that your hands interact with each other to do up a zipper. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"CGzYng\"\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"\u003e\u003ciframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4IM0KMqCsQw?rel=0\" style=\"border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"UQg6yo\"\u003eAnd we can tell that Gestalt feels close to Myfanwy because they stop differentiating themselves around her as well. With everyone else, Gestalt refers to themselves as “we,” as though each body is a separate person, but with Myfanwy they revert to the more truthful “I.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"c8B8cY\"\u003eThings are tense between Gestalt and Myfanwy, though. After a series of suggestive conversations Myfanwy has to bluff her way through, she realizes that she and Gestalt drunkenly hooked up shortly before Myfanwy lost her memory, and now Gestalt thinks Myfanwy is blowing them off. Gestalt dismisses the encounter as a mistake, but when Myfanwy kisses one of Gestalt’s bodies, the others momentarily lose their ability to compartmentalize. The one driving a car gets into an accident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"5TvODt\"\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"\u003e\u003ciframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rmJeUfQMPRk?rel=0\" style=\"border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"UUpXep\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://tv.avclub.com/the-rook-s-hive-mind-character-gestalt-is-a-powerful-1836427274\"\u003eAs Jacob Oller wrote for the AV Club\u003c/a\u003e, Gestalt is a fundamentally queer character who by their very presence shakes up the gender binary. And their ability to compartmentalize — to act the way the rest of the world does in an attempt to make other people comfortable — is a potent metaphor for passing in public. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"PTQYOW\"\u003eBut Gestalt isn’t only interesting because they’re pushing back against the heteropatriarchy. They are also the only character on \u003cem\u003eThe Rook\u003c/em\u003e who cannot be easily summed up in Past Myfanwy’s neat little character chart, who is doing something new with their trope. That means that in every episode, they feel like a character from some other, much more interesting show. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"u71zat\"\u003eIn “Chapter Four,” it becomes clear how rote most of \u003cem\u003eThe Rook\u003c/em\u003e is, and how surprising Gestalt’s stuff is in contrast\u003c/h3\u003e\n  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\"Myfanwy (Emma Greenwell) and Monica (Olivia Munn) on The Rook.\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HJ8rWODOKIa-BLRkfknRKu_1rUg=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18338487/Rook_Olivia_Munn.jpg\"\u003e\n      \u003ccite\u003eStarz\u003c/cite\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003eOlivia Munn is in this show too!\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"xNhtgs\"\u003e“Chapter Four” sees \u003cem\u003eThe Rook\u003c/em\u003e moving its various shadowy conspiracies dutifully around.

We get confirmation that Farrier was trying to sell Myfanwy in a similar exchange the night that Myfanwy lost her memory, and we meet the EVA behind said memory loss. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"EMTL6R\"\u003eThere’s even a rare, non-Gestalt bright spot in the form of \u003ca href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0195439/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t60\"\u003eJames D’Arcy\u003c/a\u003e, who shows up to guest star as Myfanwy’s former therapist. D’Arcy is charismatic enough to make a flat role fun to watch, but even he can’t do much with the fact that his whole part revolves around the question of whether this dude who used to be a doctor in a secret government program training super-powered kids did something kind of messed up. (Spoilers: the answer is yes!)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"bPmzjd\"\u003eBut while all of that’s going on in the foreground of “Chapter Four,” Gestalt is hanging out in the background, being quietly more interesting than everyone else. They talk to Myfanwy with two bodies (to “dilute the effect you have on me”), and when Teddy’s body starts biting their fingernails and Myfanwy knocks their hand away, Alex’s body starts biting their fingernails instead. Three of the bodies go off on recon with Monica and get separate coffee orders for each body, which they sip in unison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"z4AmWh\"\u003e“Why do you do that?” Monica demands. “Pretend to have different taste in coffee. I mean, it’s all you, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"uvipY1\"\u003e“The illusion of distinct personalities puts other people at their ease,” Gestalt explains as Eliza, and then switches over to Teddy to add, “Which allows me to hide in plain sight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Pxo4zv\"\u003e“It kinda creeps me out,” Monica says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"jq8BEp\"\u003eWatching Fletcher, Steadman, and Raftery play off each other as Gestalt feels a little like watching Tatiana Maslany do her thing on \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/7/9/15930758/orphan-black-season-5-review-ease-idle-millionaires-recap\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eOrphan Black\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, only in reverse. Instead of watching doppelgängers develop personalities so distinct that you start to forget that they look identical and are played by the same actress, you’re watching three very different-looking actors — united only by their \u003cem\u003eChildren of the Corn\u003c/em\u003e dye job — subsume their differences into one personality. When they’re on, you forget that Gestalt is played by three separate people, because it’s all just Gestalt. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"hUfv2c\"\u003eBut Fletcher, Steadman, and Raftery also have a leg up over the rest of \u003cem\u003eRook\u003c/em\u003e’s cast, because they at least are working with material that the audience hasn’t seen a thousand times before. \u003cem\u003eRook\u003c/em\u003e is a trope-based show, but it is sleepy in its use of tropes; it feels as though it’s relying on a formula not because of any real affection for that formula but because it’s too lazy to do anything else. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"yT5Zgl\"\u003eGestalt, though, is a character who doesn’t follow formula, who is based in tropes but does new things with them.

Tropical grassy biomes were the cradle of humankind – where modern humans first evolved – and they are where important food crops such as millet and sorghum originated, which millions eat today.

Stella was twice charged with theft this year, once in January for allegedly stealing 279 items worth more than $2,300 from a Target store. After she failed to appear in court on that charge on April 4, a warrant was issued for her arrest. That warrant was executed on April 28, when Stella was caught purportedly shoplifting $40 worth of items from a grocery store, including tick spray for cats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am not guilty of these crimes. In this country I am innocent until proven guilty and that is the law,” Stella told \u003ca href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/25/danielle-stella-republican-ilhan-omar-charged-felony-qanon-trump\"\u003ethe Guardian\u003c/a\u003e recently. “If I was guilty of crimes, I would never run for public office, putting myself in the public eye under a microscope to be attacked by all political sides.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStella\u0026#8217;s response is technically correct—she is innocent until proven guilty under American criminal law. But it doesn\u0026#8217;t reflect the full extent of her liberty. Even if she is proven guilty and convicted of a felony, the conviction wouldn\u0026#8217;t bar her from running for or ultimately holding the federal public office she seeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;A felony can\u0026#8217;t prevent someone from being on the ballot for a federal office because the constitution doesn\u0026#8217;t say anything about felonies,\u0026#8221; Minnesota secretary of state spokesperson Peter Bartz-Gallagher tells Quartz.

In theory then, Stella, if she was both convicted of a felony offense and won the congressional seat, could represent Minnesotans in congress even if she couldn\u0026#8217;t vote in her home state.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelon voting rights differ from state to state, and states determine their own qualification rules for local officials.

In 1798, hot-tempered Vermont representative \u003ca href=\"https://history.house.gov/Historical-Highlights/1800-1850/The-life-of-Representative-Matthew-Lyon-of-Vermont-and-Kentucky/\"\u003eMatthew Lyon\u003c/a\u003e—who once brawled on the House floor with Roger Griswold of Connecticut—ran for Congressional reelection from prison and won. He assumed his seat after serving four months for violating the Sedition Act by libeling president John Adams. House members tried to expel Lyon from office but failed and Lyon later represented Kentucky in the House.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Stella\u0026#8217;s case, however, a felony conviction could put a damper on her campaign efforts. She has been critical of Omar for advising immigrants—the Twin Cities is a \u003ca href=\"http://www.startribune.com/how-did-the-twin-cities-become-a-hub-for-somali-immigrants/510139341/\"\u003ehub for Somali immigrants\u003c/a\u003e—on how to avoid Immigrations and Customs Enforcement officers, saying that failure to uphold the rule of law should be a basis for ejecting public officers from their positions.

The method was most recently used by the government of Bangladesh to help 25,000 people in the flood-prone Kurigram district.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVulnerable populations received aid money via their mobile phones ahead of extreme flooding this month, \u003ca href=\"https://af.reuters.com/article/commoditiesNews/idAFL8N24Q6DZ\"\u003eReuters reports\u003c/a\u003e. The assistance allows potential victims to escape danger before disaster strikes and to stock up on supplies while waiting for the extreme weather to pass and their lives to resume.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParvin Begum, who lives on a secluded island in northern Bangladesh, was one of the recipients. Her home was flooded this month, but before the waters rose to dangerous levels, she was able to use the cash she received under the new program to buy food, rent a boat, and escape to a government shelter nearby. “This is one of the worst floods I have seen in many years,” she told Reuters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBegum is among the luckiest victims. Already, \u003ca href=\"https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/bangladesh-114-killed-due-to-excessive-flooding-1574092-2019-07-27\"\u003e114 people have died\u003c/a\u003e due to the flooding. Bangladesh\u0026#8217;s disaster management and relief ministry says that nearly 3 million people are struggling with the impacts of the floods locally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Red Cross \u003ca href=\"https://www.forecast-based-financing.org/about/\"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e explains that \u0026#8220;a key element\u0026#8221; of the predictive aid approach is that \u0026#8220;the allocation of financial resources is agreed in advance, together with the specific forecast threshold that triggers the release of those resources for the implementation of early actions.\u0026#8221; The method allows government agencies, aid groups, and those vulnerable to extreme weather events to prepare for disaster in advance and ensures that all parties can be more organized ahead of and during an emergency. It anticipates problems rather than reacting to them after the fact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are \u003ca href=\"https://www.forecast-based-financing.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/DRK_Broschuere_FUND_Web_ENG.pdf\"\u003ethree components\u003c/a\u003e (pdf) to forecast-based financing—triggers, early actions, and financing mechanisms. In order to implement a predictive program in a given region, \u0026#8220;impact levels\u0026#8221; are identified by doing a risk analysis based on prior natural disasters and hazards, and a trigger model is developed. This helps to determine at what point early aid actions should happen to be most impactful in minimizing the effects of extreme weather. Each region must then also determine what type of aid is called for by a weather event, be it providing veterinary assistance or transferring cash to vulnerable populations, among other options. Finally, aid groups and governments must develop a method for providing timely assistance when forecasts show that a trigger point has been reached.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne concern about the new approach is that aid recipients will use the predictive assistance for something other than disaster relief.

Steven Kruijswijk completed what Tour organizers said was the tightest podium in the 116-year history of the race, with just 1 minute, 31 seconds separating the first and third places after three weeks of racing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe 21st and final stage was won in a sprint finish on the Champs-Elysees by Australian Caleb Ewan, the dominant sprinter of this Tour with three stage wins. Keeping with race tradition on its final day, the 155 riders who survived the Tour rode at a pedestrian pace and in a joyful atmosphere before hitting the Champs-Elysees. Bernal chatted with French rival Julian Alaphilippe and raised a glass of champagne as he rode.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe setting sun turned the avenue golden as Bernal and the pack sped on its cobblestones to the finish, where Bernal fell into the arms of his family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaking in French before the start, Bernal thanked \u0026#8220;France for organizing the most beautiful race in the world, and the most beautiful victory of my life.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Colombia celebrated its new national hero, the millions of French fans who had lined the roads through east, central and southern France, and up into the thinning air of the Pyrenees and Alps, were ruing a bitter-sweet Tour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, their hearts soared with fabulous racing from French riders Alaphilippe, who held the iconic yellow jersey for 14 days, and Thibaut Pinot, who won on the first of seven 2,000-meter-plus (6,500-feet) peaks scaled by the highest Tour in history.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut joy turned to sorrow when Alaphilippe and Pinot\u0026#8217;s prospects of becoming France\u0026#8217;s first winner since 1985 were cruelly dashed just two days before the grand finale in Paris, on an epic Stage 19 where Mother Nature became a party-pooping guest. An almighty dump of torrential rain and hail severed the Tour route just as Bernal was succeeding in ripping the race lead off Alaphilippe, who\u0026#8217;d clung to it like a kid with a favorite toy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;Julian Alaphilippe made us dream,\u0026#8221; said Celestin Simon, a Parisian who cheered his hero on the Champs-Elysees in a pointy hat of French red, white and blue. \u0026#8220;Unfortunately, there\u0026#8217;s no victory at the end.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlaphilippe, more than anyone, first ignited and then stoked what will long be remembered as a Tour of fireworks. With his goatee beard and can\u0026#8217;t-catch-me attacks that rivals couldn\u0026#8217;t match, Alaphilippe embodied \u0026#8220;panache,\u0026#8221; the old-school class so cherished by fans of the 116-year-old Tour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlaphilippe\u0026#8217;s enterprise first put him in yellow in Champagne country on Stage 3 and then, after he lost the lead on Stage 6, got him the jersey back on Stage 8, which he held through the Pyrenees and into the Alps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it was there that Bernal, raised at altitude in Colombia and at home in thinner air, struck and set Colombia into rapture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;When I saw that he won, I said, \u0026#8216;I need to go with my music to support him,'\u0026#8221; said clarinet-playing Colombian fan Sebastian Cortes, who traveled from Strasbourg in eastern France to party Sunday on the Champs-Elysees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBernal flew up the Tour\u0026#8217;s highest climb, the dizzying Iseran pass at 2,770 meters (9,088-feet) above sea level, demolishing what remained of Alaphilippe\u0026#8217;s lead on Stage 19 and building a sizeable one of his own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe watch was then stopped, with Bernal way ahead, when the hailstorm suddenly coated the route with ice, amid fears that riders on tires barely wider than their thumbs could skid off into the rock- and ravine-scarred Alpine d\u0026eacute;cor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCompounding the misery for France, Pinot abandoned the race in tears, hobbled by a left-thigh muscle tear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that was that. The Tour that had been careening to a rock \u0026#8216;n\u0026#8217; roll finish instead had the plug pulled on it. Landslides also truncated the last Alpine Stage 20, which still proved too long for the by-now exhausted Alaphilippe, who slipped off the podium entirely, despite getting words of encouragement in a call the previous night from French President Emmanuel Macron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThomas used the last Alpine climb to secure himself the runner-up spot in Paris, giving the Ineos team a podium 1-2 with Bernal. Third-placed Steven Kruijswijk, a Dutch Mr. Steady, pulled off the feat of being wholly unremarkable during the three weeks, while Alaphilippe, Pinot and Bernal and others rocked. Quite remarkably, none of the top four riders won a stage. Alaphilippe, in fifth, won two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;I left my skin on the road these past weeks,\u0026#8221; Alaphilippe told French sports newspaper L\u0026#8217;Equipe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut instead of a red-white-and-blue celebration, Paris was instead being painted in Colombian red, blue and yellow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEspecially yellow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/time/topstories/~4/9trbyBapFr0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/9trbyBapFr0/","published":"2019-07-28T20:14:56Z","guid":"http://time.com/?p=5637323"}]},{"url":"https://rss.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml","items":[{"title":"Grasshopper Invasion of Las Vegas May Last Weeks, Experts Say","content":"","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/27/us/grasshoppers-vegas.html?emc=rss\u0026partner=rss","published":"2019-07-28T00:07:55Z","guid":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/27/us/grasshoppers-vegas.html"},{"title":"Washington, D.C., Power Failure Affects More Than 30,000 Customers","content":"","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/27/us/dc-power-outage.html?emc=rss\u0026partner=rss","published":"2019-07-28T00:07:55Z","guid":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/27/us/dc-power-outage.html"},{"title":"Twin Infants Found Dead in Car in Bronx After Father Left Them, Police Say","content":"","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/26/nyregion/twins-dead-car.html?emc=rss\u0026partner=rss","published":"2019-07-28T00:07:55Z","guid":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/26/nyregion/twins-dead-car.html"},{"title":"Strippers Are Doing It for Themselves","content":"","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/24/style/strip-clubs.html?emc=rss\u0026partner=rss","published":"2019-07-28T00:09:23Z","guid":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/24/style/strip-clubs.html"},{"title":"Less Trash, More Schools — One Plastic Brick at a Time","content":"","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/27/world/africa/recycled-plastic-school-building-conceptos-plasticos.html?emc=rss\u0026partner=rss","published":"2019-07-28T00:09:21Z","guid":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/27/world/africa/recycled-plastic-school-building-conceptos-plasticos.html"},{"title":"Fifth N.Y.P.D.

All Yazidis aspire to attend the festival at least once in their lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOn this day in late May, Lalish brims with activity. Old men share a bench, speaking with emphatic hand gestures. Children play while their parents lounge in the shade of giant olive trees. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eA few young men work the counter at a snack stand. On the wall behind them is a mural of Noah’s Ark. I notice the image of a black snake painted on the hull. Curious, I ask about the snake. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Yazidi tradition, I learn, a black snake plugged itself into a hole in the ark’s hull, ensuring the future of all living beings. For that reason, the Yazidis treat black snakes with holy reverence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eShoes are forbidden in Lalish, even when outdoors, to preserve the\nsanctuary’s purity. My feet, softened by easy living, suffer at first but soon\nget used to the smooth stone walkways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI gingerly make my way to the mausoleum of Sheikh Adi Ibn Musafir. Supposedly built thousands of years ago, the temple was converted to a mausoleum in 1162.  Today, it is the world’s holiest place for Yazidis. The entry portal is made from marble quarried from Mosul;  a relief depicting a black snake is beside the door. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI am careful not to step on the raised threshold of the doorway as I enter the temple. Yazidi pilgrims stoop and kiss thresholds, but never step on them. I forego the kiss, but watch where I place my bare feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI remark that in Ukraine, according to tradition, some people never shake hands or exchange goods across thresholds. They either go all the way out the doorway or come all the way in. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to old superstitions, evil spirits living under the threshold can steal your financial success, or even your soul. I wonder—could these cultural quirks have some common, ancient provenance?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eInside the Yazidi temple it’s dim and quiet, although the voices of pilgrims echo in the stone space. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eColored cloths are wrapped around some of the\npillars. The cloths are of six colors—one for each of the seven colors of the\nrainbow except for blue, symbolizing the seven holy angels of the Yazidi faith.\n(For reasons unknown to me, Yazidis refrain from wearing the color blue.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThese colorful cloths are tied in many knots. Each knot represents a wish. To make your own wish, you must first untie a knot, allowing someone else’s wish to come true. Then, you make a wish and tie your own knot three times.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/DSC07790-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-547015\" srcset=\"https://www.dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/DSC07790-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/DSC07790-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/DSC07790-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/DSC07790.jpg 1250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eInside the mausoleum of Sheikh Adi Ibn Musafir in Lalish, Iraq. \u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI go through the motions, leaving a knot and\nits attendant wish behind for someone else to untie someday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eDeeper into the temple, I enter a shadowy room and come across a group of young men who intermittently take turns tossing a silken handkerchief toward a small stone shelf. They do this with their eyes closed. If the handkerchief stays on the shelf, according to tradition, the thrower will get married soon. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the young men closes his eyes, exhales at length, and lets the silk cloth fly.

The young man returns the greeting and introduces himself as Barzan Shamdin.

Today, the town has a population of about 15,000, most of whom are Christian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eEvidence of Alqosh’s antiquity is clear. The town is a tangled mess of ancient buildings interwoven with narrow alleyways conceived long before automobiles were ever part of the picture.

As oceans and forests transform and ecosystems go into shock, perhaps a million species \u003ca href=\"https://www.ipbes.net/news/Media-Release-Global-Assessment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eteeter on the edge of extinction\u003c/a\u003e. But there may still be hope for these organisms. Some will change their behaviors in response to soaring global temperatures; they might, say, reproduce earlier in the year, when it’s cooler. Others may even evolve to cope—perhaps by shrinking, because smaller frames lose heat more quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the moment, though, scientists have little idea how these adaptations may be playing out. A \u003ca href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-10924-4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003enew paper\u003c/a\u003e in \u003cem\u003eNature Communications\u003c/em\u003e, coauthored by more than 60 researchers, aims to bring a measure of clarity. By sifting through 10,000 previous studies, the researchers found that the climatic chaos we’ve sowed may just be too intense \u003cem\u003e[Editor's note: The researchers scanned 10,000 abstracts, but their analysis is based on data from 58 studies]\u003c/em\u003e. Some species seem to be adapting, yes, but they aren’t doing so fast enough. That spells, in a word, doom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo determine how a species is adjusting to a climate gone mad, you typically look at two things: morphology and phenology. Morphology refers to physiological changes, like the aforementioned shrinking effect; phenology has to do with the timing of life events such as breeding and migration. The bulk of the existing research concerns phenology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1542205#p3\"\u003eRead 11 remaining paragraphs\u003c/a\u003e | \u003ca href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1542205\u0026comments=1\"\u003eComments\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"feedflare\"\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=8xIZGVKW3lc:Y3T1OB7aKBo:V_sGLiPBpWU\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=8xIZGVKW3lc:Y3T1OB7aKBo:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=8xIZGVKW3lc:Y3T1OB7aKBo:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=8xIZGVKW3lc:Y3T1OB7aKBo:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=8xIZGVKW3lc:Y3T1OB7aKBo:qj6IDK7rITs\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=8xIZGVKW3lc:Y3T1OB7aKBo:yIl2AUoC8zA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","url":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1542205","published":"2019-07-28T11:15:31Z","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1542205"},{"title":"15-inch MacBook Pro mini-review: How much does Apple’s fastest laptop offer?","content":"\u003cdiv id=\"rss-wrap\"\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ca name=\"page-1\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n      \u003cul class=\"gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide\"\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n        \u003cdiv class=\"gallery-item-content\"\u003e  \n        \u003cdiv class=\"gallery-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2019-MacBook-Pro-20-980x618.jpeg\" alt=\"\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n        \u003cp\u003e\n          The 2019 15-inch MacBook Pro—it looks just like last year's model.

But since we published that review, Apple has expanded its configuration options in two very important ways for performance. First, you can configure a new MacBook Pro with an Intel Core i9 CPU \u003ca href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/05/apple-refreshes-macbook-pro-with-updated-keyboard-8-core-9th-gen-intel-cpus/\"\u003ewith eight cores\u003c/a\u003e, not just six. Second, there are now \u003ca href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/10/apple-to-offer-macbook-pros-with-amd-vega-graphics-starting-in-november/\"\u003epricier workstation graphics options\u003c/a\u003e that up the video performance ante over any other recent MacBook Pro.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, selecting both these options when buying means you're spending a minimum of $3,349. So the question now becomes: does the Pro deliver performance that's worth the cost, and who is this for at that price?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca

Even Google is no longer totally reliant on ads, now that it\u0026#8217;s making \u003ca href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/25/google-clouds-run-rate-is-now-over-8b/\"\u003e$8 billion/year from GCP\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe one possible exception is Facebook, which remains the most precarious of the Big Five, given the increasing vitriol it attracts, its relative lack of room to grow in wealthy markets, and, probably most important, the fact it remains a one-trick revenue pony. Could the next recession see Facebook drop from Big Five status? Very possibly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLesser companies, though \u0026#8212; those outside of tech proper, and even the herd of growth-stage unicorns \u0026#8212; will almost certainly be forced into major layoffs. Will the newly-laid-off flock back to school, as happened in 2008? Or will they rush to roll the dice with new startups? Given the rising costs of, and increasing skepticism aimed at, traditional higher education, it seems likely that instead we\u0026#8217;ll suddenly see an enormous bloom of new startups.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the one hand, this means more ideas flung at the proverbial wall, and so more innovation. But on the other, these will presumably mostly be low-cost web / app startups, which \u003ca href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/22/ask-not-for-whom-the-deadpool-tolls/\"\u003eas I\u0026#8217;ve argued before\u003c/a\u003e are increasingly played out, from people who are founding them as a reaction to being laid off rather than because they have a vision they can\u0026#8217;t ignore, in a downturn during which funding will presumably grow ever harder to acquire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026#8217;s a school of thought which says more startups is always better, and another which says that bad startups are like an algal bloom, choking the oxygen (money, attention, talent) from the ambient environment and making things worse for the overall ecosystem. It seems likely that the next downturn will serve as a natural experiment testing these hypotheses. Let\u0026#8217;s hope the former is more true. And if (but only if) you have your own burning startup idea in you, it might be best to beat the eventual recessionary rush.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"feedflare\"\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=fVwMODf6FzM:x9tcsQTKYdc:2mJPEYqXBVI\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=fVwMODf6FzM:x9tcsQTKYdc:7Q72WNTAKBA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=fVwMODf6FzM:x9tcsQTKYdc:yIl2AUoC8zA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=fVwMODf6FzM:x9tcsQTKYdc:-BTjWOF_DHI\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=fVwMODf6FzM:x9tcsQTKYdc:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=fVwMODf6FzM:x9tcsQTKYdc:D7DqB2pKExk\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=fVwMODf6FzM:x9tcsQTKYdc:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=fVwMODf6FzM:x9tcsQTKYdc:qj6IDK7rITs\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/fVwMODf6FzM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/fVwMODf6FzM/","published":"2019-07-28T13:00:32Z","guid":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=1861305"},{"title":"Week in Review: Regulation boogaloo","content":"\u003cp id=\"speakable-summary\"\u003eHello, weekenders.

My friends and I began playing it last summer as it exploded in popularity; we saw the game go from its roots as a goofy add on to Epic’s \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortnite:_Save_the_World\"\u003eplayer-versus-environment shooter\u003c/a\u003e to its current status as a cross-cultural social space that just so happens to have a battle royale mode. And while I’ve certainly gotten better at playing the game, I’m still bad at it. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"MNKszD\"\u003eWhich is fine! Really. For me, the fun of \u003cem\u003eFortnite\u003c/em\u003e is when I’m playing well with my teammates and suddenly I’m fluent — suddenly my builds are solid and my aim is true. It’s a joyful thing for me, because it’s in those moments I realize I’ll never be a professional (or anything close). It’s freeing to know that even if I spent all of my time grinding to be better at the game I’d never be good enough to make any cash playing it. I’m just there to hang out with my friends. I get smoked by teens constantly. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"cKvpdt\"\u003eThe other week, a friend and \u003cem\u003eVerge \u003c/em\u003ecolleague invited me to play \u003cem\u003eFortnite \u003c/em\u003ewith some of his teenage friends. They were playing a free-for-all mode in the custom map section of the game; you spawn with a random assortment of weapons and items and the point was to be the last person standing. I got owned. Just utterly destroyed. These kids were building like they’d grown up doing it, which they had; I have never felt older in my life than I did seeing myself near the bottom of the rankings. (I did not lose \u003cem\u003eevery\u003c/em\u003e time. Sometimes I got lucky.) It was humbling. But it was also fun as hell, because, as a rando, I had nothing to lose. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"31coNu\"\u003eMore often than not, being professionally good at something means that when it’s time to perform — especially for an audience — you sometimes enjoy it less than you would in a vacuum; because odds are, the reason you were drawn to the thing in the first place wasn’t the fact that you might be able to make a living off of it. The second \u003cem\u003eFortnite\u003c/em\u003e World Cup is going on all this weekend, and I can’t help but feel a little pity for how much pressure the pros must be under. Obviously it’s exhilarating to play under the lights on the biggest stage in the world, for a chance at a piece of $30 million. But at the same time you \u003cem\u003edo \u003c/em\u003ehave to perform. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"x3MQJp\"\u003eThere’s a real appeal to being an amateur — at anything, not just \u003cem\u003eFortnite. \u003c/em\u003eIf you want to go back to the etymology, “amateur” comes from the French for “lover of”; pursuing an interest for its own sake is liberating. Amateurs were so highly regarded that the modern Olympic games were explicitly for amateur competitors for most of the 20th century. It wasn’t until the ’90s that professionals were allowed to compete across every sport. (Aside from wrestling, because professional wrestling is a bit of a misnomer.) \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"mwwkCz\"\u003eI was playing \u003cem\u003eFortnite\u003c/em\u003e with some friends after work last week; we were playing squads a player down, with three people instead of the usual four, so we decided to fill the spot with a random person. We happened upon this guy who was I think named Jay, who was incredible. The kind of guy who might, on a good day, take out a full 10 percent of people on the island. With us, he had an eight kill game — which is impressive when you consider that only a hundred people drop onto the island in the first place. I had that realization again; no matter how much I practice, I’ll never be as good as him. But the thing was he was as excited that we had mics and were a decently competent squad as we were when we realized how good he was. We didn’t win any games that day. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"pHqt0u\"\u003eAfterward, Jay added us as friends. We’ll play again, and maybe we’ll even get a victory royale.

consumers will think that 5G is the necessary function in 2H20,” he writes. “Therefore, iPhone models which will be sold at higher prices have to support 5G for winning more subsidies from mobile operators and consumers’ purchase intention.” Essentially, Apple is betting that its customers will want to have the ability to take advantage of the wide range of 5G networks, and that they’ll pay a

They think it’s like the movies, where the cable can break, and you plummet to your death. But elevators are statistically the safest form of transportation in the world. Safer than planes, trains, even less harmless than a child’s tricycle. Some people still harbor this irrational fear because they feel they’re going up when they ride one. That feeling alone deludes them into thinking they can fall—so they panic.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eNow, there are more people afraid of “leveling up” to success than there are of riding elevators. But it’s the same irrational fear at work. As you climb higher and pass each new level, be it risk, criticism, failure, or blind ambition, it can feel uncomfortable to you. It causes panic. It’s why most people quit on their dreams.\u0026#8221;\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can also shop their Instagram canvas art options, featuring specific art that has been featured on this social media channel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eOrdering Process\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir ordering process is easy and straightforward for an online process. Whether I ordered from my laptop or my mobile device, it was quick. Once I knew which canvas I wanted, I could click on one of four sizes and add it to my cart. It also automatically entered the available coupon code for the current promotional discount.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn terms of payment options, there are many to choose from.

Ther are so many options available that it was difficult to choose. However, another thing our company liked was the price point. These are good quality for the cost, which has allowed us to continue adding these canvases throughout our offices and common areas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShipping is fast, and the packaging protected the canvases, so nothing was damaged. It took seconds to hang each canvas on the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, customer service is highly responsive. I left a voice mail and received a call-back in less than 30 minutes. There was nothing to not like about this company or what they offered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eRecommendations\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI recommend that you sign-up and subscribe by giving Inktuitive your email address.

Or, more likely, he’d be nervous about how the story would turn out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI first met Kleiman at a Drug Policy Foundation conference in Washington, D.C., in the early or mid-’90s.  The drug war was at peak popularity; even suggesting the study of alternatives to incarceration was apostasy, and the few of us who saw it as a disaster were a tiny, beleaguered minority everywhere outside this meeting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKleiman was far from a hardcore drug warrior — but he was the only speaker at the conference to defend punitive policies like incarceration. And I have never witnessed someone get so fiercely, personally, and rudely attacked. It almost seemed as though it might get physical.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter his panel, I approached him in a hallway, telling him that I felt terrible about how he’d been treated. Although I strongly disagreed with what he’d said, I thought his perspective was considered and intelligent — unlike nearly any other defense of drug prohibition I’d heard — and it certainly didn’t warrant the response he’d received. He became a source and later, a friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKleiman died on July 21 at the age of 68, from complications following a kidney transplant and cancer treatment. He leaves an important legacy, having much improved public understanding of how to think about drugs and crime. A man of many contradictions, he was what you might call an extremist defender of nuanced policy — as well as a strongly partisan Democrat (hence his lack of love for this publication).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKleiman, who grew up in Baltimore, worked at the Justice Department after college, before getting a doctorate in public policy from Harvard and teaching at UCLA for two decades. In 2015, he became the inaugural director of the Marron Institute’s Crime and Justice Program at New York University. His major books, “Against Excess” and “When Brute Force Fails,” made relentlessly logical and thoughtful arguments that remain relevant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs an opponent of drug war dogma, he was willing to explore alternative approaches to punishment, rather than argue for it to be abolished entirely. That’s a sharp departure from much of the left, which has often been content to firmly oppose the moral stain that is mass incarceration without seriously grappling with what alternative policies might look like. At its best, Kleiman\u0026#8217;s work and teachings made people on all sides think much more deeply about their positions, regardless of where they ultimately came down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKleiman supported going after drug dealers, but selectively targeting only the most violent and disruptive, to avoid, essentially, creating evolutionary pressure in markets that would favor the most ruthless and cause the most harm. He supported making psychedelics accessible — but only after thorough research and in a highly controlled medical or, at least, psychotherapeutic setting. (I will say, however, that he truly blew it in his opposition to clean needle programs — probably as a result of his natural contrarianism.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he studied what made punishment work when it did — and made the case that it is only effective if it is “swift, certain, and fair,” obviously a far cry from lengthy mandatory minimum sentences. These ideas were adopted in Hawaii as part of the HOPE probation program, which decreased recidivism among people addicted to methamphetamine. South Dakota’s \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/2/9/10952842/rand-sobriety-study\"\u003esuccessful\u003c/a\u003e 24/7 Sobriety program for people convicted of drunken driving offenses was also based on his work; it not only cut drunken driving arrests by 12 percent, but was also associated with a 9 percent decline in domestic violence arrests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Kleiman may be best remembered for his work sweating the details of cannabis law reform in states like Washington, while being about as far as you can get from an enthusiastic legalizer.

It was the Car Wash task force, which Moro presided over as a judge, whose prosecution of ex-President Lula da Silva resulted in his removal from the 2018 election, paving the way for the far-right Jair Bolsonaro to become president. The corruption exposed by our reporting was so serious, and so consequential, that even many of Moro\u0026#8217;s most loyal supporters abandoned him and called for his resignation within a week of the publication of our initial stories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the revelations of corruption by Moro and Deltan grew — reported both by us and our journalistic partners in Brazil — those officials resorted to the tactics used by government officials everywhere when their improprieties are revealed in the press: They tried to distract attention away from their own misconduct by fixating on the actions of the source as well as the journalists who revealed their wrongdoing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat is what Sergio Moro, exploiting his position as Bolsonaro\u0026#8217;s minister of justice and public security, has been attempting to do for weeks. He and his defenders in Bolsonaro\u0026#8217;s party constantly speak about the alleged crimes committed by our source and imply that the reporters and editors at The Intercept and other media outlets working with us are criminals and \u0026#8220;accomplices\u0026#8221; for the role we have played in exposing their corruption.

That is what we have been doing since June 9 and will continue to do until all of the material in the public interest is reported. \u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003eThis is also why we opened our newsroom and archive to Brazilian journalistic partners, including the major newspaper Folha, the newsmagazine Veja, and others. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were able to authenticate this material using the same methods that at least six other journalistic outlets used to authenticate it, many of which were the same methods used to authenticate the Snowden archive before reporting on it. They include comparing the contents to non-public material to determine that it was genuine; consulting with sources whose non-public knowledge aligned with its contents; and confirming with legal specialists that the highly intricate, non-public legal material could have been created only by someone with in-depth, inside knowledge of the Car Wash investigations. We were also able to see in the chats the prosecutors\u0026#8217; past conversations with our own reporters, and we found that they were authentic. The other journalists who had access to the material did the same check and came to the same conclusion: The chats are real.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf history is any indication, the attempt by Moro and his defenders to encourage the public to fixate on the actions of the alleged source rather than the content of our journalistic revelations about his misconduct will fail spectacularly. Much of the most important journalism of the last several decades was made possible by sources who illegally obtained vital information and furnished it to journalists. What history remembers is what the reporting revealed, not the actions of the sources who helped reveal it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1971, a former Pentagon official Daniel Ellsberg stole tens of thousands of pages of top-secret documents proving that the U.S. government was lying to the American people about the Vietnam War. He gave those stolen documents to the New York Times and then to the Washington Post, both of which reported them. What people remember are the lies revealed by those stolen documents. To the extent Ellsberg is discussed, he is widely regarded as a hero for enabling this official deceit to be exposed by journalists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThroughout the war on terror waged by the U.S. and its allies since the attacks of September 11, 2001, the largest media outlets in the west — the New York Times, the Washington Post, NBC News, BBC, the Guardian — repeatedly received vital information from sources who risked prosecution to expose grave wrongdoing, such as torture, CIA black sites, and illegal domestic NSA spying. While a few authoritarian voices called for the imprisonment of the journalists who revealed those secrets, most regarded the reporting as vital and necessary, and all of those exposés received the top prizes of journalism, including the Pulitzer Prize.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe same was true of the reporting in 2013 and 2014 about the secret mass spying on the internet and entire populations around the world by the U.S. government and its allies — reporting that was enabled by documents unlawfully disseminated by the NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden. Dozens of media outlets around the world, including Globo in Brazil, were eager to use those illegally obtained documents to report on the secret spying by government officials because journalists understand that what matters is not the acts or motives of the source but the content of what the journalism reveals to the public.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd, of course, what history remembers most about that reporting are not the moral judgments by the U.S. government and its defenders about Edward Snowden\u0026#8217;s actions. What matters — what history has recorded — is what the reporting revealed about the mass and indiscriminate invasions of privacy carried out in secret by security state agencies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe have no doubt that Moro, Dallagnol, and their allies will continue to use the same tactics pioneered by Richard Nixon and his top aides against Daniel Ellsberg and other sources during the Pentagon Papers and Watergate scandals: namely, to focus public attention on the acts of those who revealed their corruption rather than on the corruption they themselves committed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut we also have no doubt that these tactics will be no more successful in this case than they were in all these prior cases of crucial journalism over the last several decades. What matters to the public is what their most powerful leaders have done in secret. And that\u0026#8217;s why a free press is so vital, so indispensable, to a healthy democracy: because only journalism that is independent of the government and unconstrained by corrupt officials can ensure that the public remains informed and aware of what their leaders are doing and that those officials are prevented from carrying out corrupt acts in secret.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose are the principles on which The Intercept was founded in 2013. Those are the principles that have driven the reporting we have done from the inception of our news organization. And those are the principles that — with your help and support — will continue to drive our ongoing reporting on the Secret Brazil Archive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe post \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/07/28/bolsonaro-attacks-show-why-reporting-on-secret-brazil-archive-is-vital/\"\u003eThe Bolsonaro Government’s Aggressive Response Shows Why Our Reporting on the Secret Brazil Archive Is So Vital\u003c/a\u003e appeared first on \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com\"\u003eThe Intercept\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://theintercept.com/2019/07/28/bolsonaro-attacks-show-why-reporting-on-secret-brazil-archive-is-vital/","published":"2019-07-28T18:11:42Z","guid":"https://theintercept.com/?p=261216"}]},{"url":"https://off-guardian.org/feed/","items":[{"title":"When Warriors Become Saints","content":"","url":"https://off-guardian.org/2019/07/28/when-warriors-become-saints/","published":"2019-07-28T08:45:47Z","guid":"https://off-guardian.org/?p=61083"}]},{"url":"https://www.eff.org/rss/updates.xml","items":[]},{"url":"https://www.wsws.org/en/rss.xml","items":[]},{"url":"https://blog.abaenglish.com/feed/","items":[]},{"url":"https://www.english.com/blog/feed/","items":[]},{"url":"http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition.rss","items":[{"title":"Hong Kong split apart by protests","content":"","url":"https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/26/asia/hong-kong-protests-yuen-long-intl-hnk/index.html","published":"2019-07-28T00:10:19Z","guid":"https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/26/asia/hong-kong-protests-yuen-long-intl-hnk/index.html"},{"title":"President says Islam in Indonesia is 'tolerant.'
