The world body said Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s actions earlier this week “will exacerbate the human rights situation.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Indian government has cut off telecommunications to the region of Jammu and Kashmir, driven out tourists and journalists, stationed approximately 35,000 additional troops there, and revoked the section of the Constitution pertaining to the region’s sovereignty over a tangled web of economic development, politics, and religion. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis is just the latest in a decades-long conflict. India and Pakistan have fought multiple times over the region, which also borders China to the east, and this is at least the 51st time India has \u003ca href=\"%22htt\"\u003epulled the plug on mobile and internet communications\u003c/a\u003e—in 2019 alone. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eRupert Colville, spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, said in a video posted to Twitter that India has taken “\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/UNGeneva/status/1159068945565003777?s=20\"\u003ewhat is already a bit of a pattern to a new level\u003c/a\u003e.” In the UN’s estimation, the Indian government has cut off communications as a method to “muzzle dissent” from within the region.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHere are some important points to note about the current situation that has dragged on all week.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eWhat is Article 370?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eArticle 370 is a constitutional provision that gave Jammu and Kashmir its special status. The origins go back to 1947, when India earned independence from the British and subsequently split with what is now Pakistan. Jammu and Kashmir had, effectively, been the only majority-Muslim state to join India at the time. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eA series of presidential orders passed from 1950 onward gave Jammu and Kashmir the ability to have a separate constitution and autonomy over state laws regarding ownership of property, citizenship, and other laws that specifically covered rights under a sub-section referred to commonly as 35A. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe entire article, including 35A, was revoked on August 5, but this is not the first time the government has attempted to curtail the sovereignty of Jammu and Kashmir.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAther Zia, a professor at the University of Northern Colorado who also hails from Kashmir, told \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e “the onslaught to 370 has happened under all governments, so meddling with it is nothing new—but this the vilest of it all” because she considered an attack on democracy from the world’s largest democracy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSuchitra Vijayan, who founded hybrid journalism and research organization The Polis Project, told \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e it was a “well planned and executed” attack on democracy carried out just months after holding an election with 900 million voters. In her estimation, Delhi has taken the democratic rights away of at least 13 million of its citizens by revoking Article 370.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eIs it a matter of economics, political posturing, or religion?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe short answer is, yes. While there are Hindus living in Jammu and Kashmir, it is a Muslim-majority state and Modi is renowned for his Hindu nationalist leanings. In 2005, under the George H.W. Bush administration, Modi was denied a U.S. visa for his support of Hindu extremists during riots in his home state of Gujarat. After his first victory in 2014, Modi tried to assuage critics by waxing poetic on economic development and strides in renewable energy projects. It had worked well enough for a victory in May of this year, but some have said the timing of this is to distract from the current economic downturn. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eModi recently said during an address that Jammu and Kashmir, largely undeveloped and far less densely populated than the rest of India, could be a massive \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/ANI/status/1159478310583328769\"\u003etourist hub\u003c/a\u003e and destination to film Bollywood movies. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSupporters of the decision cite statistics from the Reserve Bank of India on how per capita income for the “average Indian” has increased four-fold in the last decade, but for those within Jammu and Kashmir income has only doubled. Still, they fared better than the far eastern states in India which have been largely ignored by the capital for decades. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eProponents also argue the biggest advantage to revoking Article 370 is to open up property ownership to the rest of India. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;If things improve with time, the Valley might not remain a union territory always and the people will be able to choose their own representatives soon,\u0026#8221; Modi said, suggesting the current status is temporary. However, he did not address why that necessitated cutting off landline, internet, and mobile phone lines in and out of the area.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOthers point to a consistent pattern of anti-Muslim rhetoric from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) as the underlying reason behind the decision, with economics used as a convenient front. Zia said Kashmiris fear this sort of “demographic terrorism” to open Kashmir’s culture, land, and sovereignty in a bid to make it more like the rest of India, the “saffronization” of the state, as she called it. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eRevoking Article 370 has been on the BJP agenda for years and was openly discussed during the May elections. However, Vijayan said part of the problem is a lack of awareness among the Indian electorate about the gravity of this fundamentally undemocratic decision.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eZia explained, Kashmiris “are not attached to article 370 as their means of loyalty to staying with India,” but it had become a legal fixture over time despite various administrations’ attempts to chip away at it and bring the region into the fold of Delhi. Really though, the “movement of self-determination” is an essential part of understanding the relationship between Kashmir and India, said Vijayan. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eIs this even legal? What happens now? \u0026nbsp;\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Ayesha Ray, a political science professor at King’s College in Pennsylvania, told \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e she questioned the legality of it. Technically, it could be removed with the permission of the Jammu and Kashmir Constituent Assembly, which Ray explained had dissolved itself in 1957 and essentially made Article 370 permanent. Treme Court had ruled in 2018 that \u0026#8220;Article 370 had acquired permanent status making its abrogation impossible.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThrough a series of presidential orders and citing this lack of a state government, Delhi decided to change the words “Constituent” to “\u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/experts-question-legality-of-indias-changes-in-kashmir/2019/08/06/a4b7600a-b8b8-11e9-8e83-4e6687e99814_story.html\"\u003eLegislative Assembly\u003c/a\u003e” in 2018. For about a year, Kashmir was run by a governor appointed by the ruling BJP after it broke ties with a local political party.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Legislative Assembly was dissolved last June, opening the door for the current situation. The question now is if changing that term is just semantics and whether the Supreme Court ruling should be upheld.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eCalling Article 370 “the glue” which had essentially bound Kashmir to India and was, at times, used as the justification for conflict with Pakistan, Ray said the decision brings up a series of international law questions. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBecause of the provisions laid out in the article, India only really had issues of foreign affairs, defense, and communications. But Ray asked, “Does the revoking of Article 370 make Jammu and Kashmir an independent state? And if that\u0026#8217;s the case, does it make India an occupier? Because as long as the article was tied to the Indian Constitution, India could still have legitimate claims to Kashmir.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eModi argued in his speech days after the decision that Article 370 “did not give anything except separatism, corruption, terrorism, and family rule. Pakistan used Article 370 as a tool to spread terrorism.” However, Ray explained revoking it may actually just “embolden Pakistan’s claims” on the region. Islamabad just announced it was \u003ca href=\"https://www.w\"\u003edowngrading diplomatic ties\u003c/a\u003e and putting a freeze on trade with Delhi in light of the situation. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSpecifically, she noted it “plays right into the hands of terrorist groups making it easier for them to radicalize disenfranchised Kashmiri youth,” who have grown frustrated from repeatedly being cut off from the rest of the world, constant police and troop presence, and, in part, not being included in the same foreign aid and development schemes as the rest of the country has been. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eA day after the decision was made, a bill came to Parliament proposing that Jammu and Kashmir become Indian territories, legally somewhat akin to Puerto Rico and the U.S., but if thousands of U.S. troops occupied San Juan.

After all, employers are desperately seeking enough people with up-to-the-minute tech skills. Two-thirds of IT decision-makers are adding headcount in 2019, and a whopping 89% of them say it\u0026#8217;s hard to find the right talent, according to\u003ca href=\"http://rh-us.mediaroom.com/2019-06-25-Tech-Leaders-Are-Hiring-But-Challenges-Remain-Security-And-Cloud-Skills-In-high-Demand\"\u003e a new poll by staffing firm Robert Half Technology\u003c/a\u003e of 2,800 tech hiring managers across the U.S. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo why is it still so hard to catch a tech recruiter\u0026#8217;s eye?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOne big reason: Despite the best efforts of campus career centers (not to mention well-meaning advice from anxious parents), most new college grads lack basic job search skills. So do recent alumni of other tech training programs, like boot camps and online courses. \u0026#8220;There\u0026#8217;s a real disconnect between employers and young tech workers,\u0026#8221; notes Caitlin Cooke, \u0026#8220;especially when it comes to people in underrepresented groups, including ethnic minorities and women.\u0026#8221;  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eCooke is a career advisor at an innovative coaching firm called \u003ca href=\"http://www.pathrise.com\"\u003ePathrise\u003c/a\u003e that aims to close that gap by teaching young techies how to get noticed, and hired, by companies\u0026#8217; recruiters. Cooke knows her stuff: Before joining Pathrise, she did recruiting stints at  Disney and Accenture, directed hiring at GitHub, and led Google\u0026#8217;s talent-hunting team in the Boston metro area. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eShe suggests these three ways to impress tech recruiters:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMake your resume stand out.\u003c/strong\u003e  Most CVs now have to run an electronic gauntlet: A digital \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2018/10/04/how-to-make-resume-stand-out-2018/\"\u003eapplicant tracking system\u003c/a\u003e (ATS) programmed to screen out resumes that don\u0026#8217;t contain the right keywords.  So the first step —obvious, maybe, but often overlooked— is to rewrite your resume, if necessary, so it matches precisely the keywords in the job description. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond that, Cooke points out, an actual human will look at your resume for anywhere from 6 to 60 seconds. In her years as a recruiter, \u0026#8220;I must have read 10,000 resumes,\u0026#8221; she says. \u0026#8220;After a while, you look for certain things and, if you don\u0026#8217;t see those right away, the resume gets tossed.\u0026#8221; Gulp. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe most crucial element that\u0026#8217;s usually missing: A concise description of the practical impact of your work in each previous role, with figures if at all possible. \u0026#8220;People often have trouble quantifying what they\u0026#8217;ve accomplished,\u0026#8221; Cooke observes. \u0026#8220;But it\u0026#8217;s really important to try.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStudy up on the interviewer, and the company culture. \u003c/strong\u003eLooking up the person you\u0026#8217;ll be meeting with on LinkedIn and other social media, to see if you have anything in common, can help you connect with an interviewer, and make you more memorable, too. But what if you don\u0026#8217;t know the hiring manager\u0026#8217;s name? \u0026#8220;Call and ask!,\u0026#8221; Cooke says. \u0026#8220;Often people are too shy to do this, but you absolutely can find out ahead of time not only whom you\u0026#8217;ll be meeting but also what the discussion is likely to focus on, so you know how to prepare.\u0026#8221; \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, find out as much as you can about the company and its culture, so you can talk in detail about how you see yourself fitting in there. \u0026#8220;This matters to recruiters,\u0026#8221; notes Cooke, \u0026#8220;because the better the \u0026#8216;cultural fit\u0026#8217;, the longer you\u0026#8217;re likely to stay —and thrive— in the job.\u0026#8221; \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eShe adds that more companies now are spelling out their values on their websites, and that one way to demonstrate fit is to \u0026#8220;pick one that resonates with you and tell why.\u0026#8221; Another approach is to talk about your enthusiasm for \u0026#8220;the tech the company is using, one or more of their products, or what you hope to learn in the job.\u0026#8221; In other words, you want to come across as interested enough in this employer, and this opening, to have put some thought into it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePractice what you\u0026#8217;ll say —but don\u0026#8217;t over-rehearse\u003c/strong\u003e. With all the information available now about the standard questions job interviewers ask, it\u0026#8217;s tempting to memorize clever comebacks. But you don\u0026#8217;t want to come across as following a script, or parroting canned answers. Instead, says Cooke, think about how to frame the work you\u0026#8217;ve done so far to cover three types of experience: \u0026#8220;A time when you made especially good use of your technical skills; an example of a problem you faced and how you solved it; and a situation where you worked effectively with a team to achieve a specific result.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTalking persuasively about those three aspects of your career \u0026#8221; shows, for instance, how self-aware you are, and how well you communicate,\u0026#8221; says Cooke. \u0026#8220;Those three areas cover the main things tech recruiters want to know about you.\u0026#8221;   \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOne encouraging note: As intimidating (not to say nerve-wracking) as job hunting can sometimes be, it might help to know you have at least one person in your corner. That, says Cooke, would be the tech recruiter himself or herself. \u0026#8220;The recruiter\u0026#8217;s job is to hire you,\u0026#8221; she points out. \u0026#8220;Nine times out of ten, by the time you get to the interview stage, he or she is your ally.\u0026#8221; Good to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eMore must-read stories from \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—These are the \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/07/29/the-top-10-u-s-cities-for-tech-jobs/\"\u003etop 10 U.S. cities for tech jobs\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—This woman went \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/07/23/entry-level-blue-apron-recipe-tester/\"\u003efrom Goldman Sachs to Blue Apron\u003c/a\u003e recipe tester\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—\u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/07/18/millennials-old-companies/\"\u003eMillennial workers are thriving\u003c/a\u003e in age-old workplaces\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—How \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e’s 40 Under 40 get stuff done: their \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/07/10/40-under-40-productivity-hacks/\"\u003efavorite productivity hacks\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—There’s a \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/07/25/refugee-pay-gap-costing-trillions/\"\u003erefugee pay gap\u003c/a\u003e—and it’s costing the global economy trillions\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eGet \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e’s\u003cem\u003e \u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://cloud.newsletters.fortune.com/fortune/newsletters/?newsletter_name=RACEAHEAD\u0026amp;source=article\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eRaceAhead\u003c/em\u003e newsletter\u003c/a\u003e for sharp insights on corporate culture and diversity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://fortune.com/2019/08/09/4-ways-to-wow-tech-recruiter/","published":"2019-08-09T15:33:09Z","guid":"https://fortune.com/?p=2666081"},{"title":"5 Years After Fatal Shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Racial Tensions Might Be More Intense","content":"\n\u003cp\u003eMichael Brown\u0026#8217;s death at the hands of a white Missouri police officer stands as a seismic moment in American race relations.

From the march on Charlottesville to President Donald Trump\u0026#8217;s tweets attacking congressional Democrats of color and Colin Kaepernick\u0026#8217;s kneeling at NFL games, the country often seems more divided than ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFerguson \u0026#8220;drew attention to the practices of police violence and a lot of the stereotypes and viewpoints that people had about black Americans,\u0026#8221; said Adia Harvey Wingfield, a Washington University sociologist and expert on race relations. \u0026#8220;I wish I could be a little more optimistic about its overall implications, but I am not sure yet that there is too much reason for optimism. I think that we\u0026#8217;re in a place where we kind of see some progress coupled with some steps backward.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe suburban St. Louis community has changed, though to some, not fast enough. The government for the city of 21,000 is now more reflective of its populace, which is two-thirds black. Four of the six City Council members are black, compared with just one in 2014. The police force that was overwhelmingly white in 2014 is now far more diverse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe town has seen sweeping changes in the way the Police Department and municipal court operate. An ongoing agreement with the Justice Department requires even more reforms, and the monitor overseeing the agreement wants the pace to accelerate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBehind all of that, a\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/66a14a7a5e104a908c10dd4b376bf2bc\"\u003efather still grieves\u003c/a\u003e\u0026nbsp;.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;We share the same name,\u0026#8221; Michael Brown Sr., 41, said of his son. \u0026#8220;We have the same blood.

Wilson told them to use the sidewalk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWords were exchanged, then Wilson noticed a pack of cigarillos in Brown\u0026#8217;s hand. A radio dispatch had just reported the theft of cigarillos from a market. Wilson confronted Brown, who was unarmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe situation escalated in a flash. Brown reached into Wilson\u0026#8217;s SUV, and a fight began. Wilson\u0026#8217;s gun went off. Brown ran. Suddenly, the 6-foot-4, 290-pound teenager turned back toward Wilson, who later told investigators that Brown looked \u0026#8220;psychotic\u0026#8221; and \u0026#8220;hostile.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWilson fired several shots, but Brown kept coming, the officer said, until the final shot to the head felled him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSome people in the Canfield Green apartment complex initially said Brown had his hands up in surrender, stories that quickly spread on social media. Brown\u0026#8217;s bloodied body lay on the street in the August heat for four hours, inciting even more anger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe next night, as thousands attended a prayer vigil on Canfield, a much larger and angrier crowd gathered on nearby West Florissant Avenue. A QuikTrip convenience store was set on fire and soon, dozens of other businesses were looted, damaged or destroyed. Rocks and bottles were hurled at police officers. Police were so outnumbered they could only stand and watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSubsequent protests were met with a far larger police presence. Officers from throughout the St. Louis region showed up in armored vehicles, wearing riot gear and carrying military-style weapons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eChris Phillips, a filmmaker who lived in Canfield Green at the time, was among many whose livestream video captured images of police using pepper spray, tear gas and batons in their clashes with protesters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;I just think that the big presence of heavy artillery, with that kind of response, really upset people,\u0026#8221; said Phillips, now 38.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral months later, on Nov. 24, 2014, St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Bob McCulloch announced that a grand jury had declined to indict Wilson, and the violent protests started anew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe anger in Ferguson went much deeper than Michael Brown\u0026#8217;s death. Racial tension that simmered for decades began to boil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFew metropolitan areas have suffered worse \u0026#8220;white flight\u0026#8221; than St. Louis. As white residents moved farther out, northern suburbs — known locally as North County — became increasingly populated with African Americans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBy 2014, two-thirds of Ferguson\u0026#8217;s 21,000 residents were black, but the city\u0026#8217;s leadership was virtually all white. The police force had just three blacks among 53 officers. Black residents were far more likely to be pulled over and arrested than whites, and far more likely to face burdensome fines and court costs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe following spring, in March 2015, the Justice Department also declined to indict Wilson but issued a report citing racial bias in Ferguson\u0026#8217;s policing. The report also found that the municipal court used ticketing and court fees to generate revenue. Police Chief Tom Jackson was among the top leaders who resigned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eA year later, the city council reached an agreement with the Justice Department requiring massive reforms overseen by a court-appointed monitor. That process is ongoing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAmong the changes: About half of the police force is now made up of black officers, and they\u0026#8217;re led by a black chief, Jason Armstrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe problem is finding enough officers. Ferguson has 13 vacancies. Many departments across the country face similar shortages, but Mayor James Knowles III said the challenge is especially daunting in Ferguson, where police remain under a microscope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;There are a lot of people, especially some of the best and brightest, who might have thought they may want a career in policing,\u0026#8221; Knowles said. \u0026#8220;They\u0026#8217;re going to ask themselves the question, \u0026#8216;Do I want to go through this, put my family through this?'\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFerguson has seen a spike in homicides — nearly 30 in the past five years in a town where killings were once uncommon. Knowles believes criminals have become more brazen knowing police are hesitant to make traffic stops — the so-called \u0026#8220;Ferguson effect.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;When you\u0026#8217;re not pulling people over, you\u0026#8217;re not getting these guns off the street, you\u0026#8217;re not seizing contraband and illegal weapons,\u0026#8221; Knowles said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNot everyone is sure that Ferguson is embracing change. Many black residents were angered when the longtime finance director, Jeffrey Blume, was appointed interim city manager earlier this year. The Justice Department report singled out Blume\u0026#8217;s role in encouraging traffic fines as a revenue source.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;As a community we hear you loud and clear: You don\u0026#8217;t care,\u0026#8221; Felicia Pulliam, 54, told the city council last month.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eKnowles believes the agreement with the Justice Department sometimes hinders, rather than promotes, progress. He said the city has paid out more than $600,000 in monitor fees, and the hundreds of thousands of dollars spent on legal costs would be better spent on improving policing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;Instead of spending money on a $300-an-hour law firm, why shouldn\u0026#8217;t I be spending that money on sending those officers to additional training?\u0026#8221; Knowles asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe city\u0026#8217;s monitor, Boston attorney Natashia Tidwell, gave Ferguson mixed reviews in a June report. She lauded the city for implementing a police use-of-force policy and cited progress in use of body-worn and in-car cameras. The review also gave generally high marks for municipal court reforms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut Tidwell cited \u0026#8220;sluggish\u0026#8221; progress in community policing, officer training and data collection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFerguson is starting to look different. On West Florissant, the burned-out QuikTrip is long gone, replaced with a new $4 million building housing the Urban League of Metropolitan St. Louis. The Boys \u0026amp; Girls Clubs of Greater St. Louis is building a teen center nearby, and a large new health care facility is also planned. Still, vacant lots and empty storefronts abound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSusan Ankenbrand and her husband moved their family to Ferguson 44 years ago, at a time when other whites were heading the other direction, because they wanted to raise their kids in a diverse community. She acknowledged that the events of 2014 drove a racial wedge through the heart of Ferguson, leaving a wound that\u0026#8217;s a long way from healed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;We need to be able to talk to each other,\u0026#8221; said Ankenbrand, 76. \u0026#8220;So tell me how to do that.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eMore must-read stories from \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—Why the U.S. labeled China a \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/06/us-treasury-china-currency-manipulator/\"\u003ecurrency manipulator\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—How \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/06/importing-cheaper-drugs-from-canada-trump/\"\u003eTrump’s plan to import Canadian drugs\u003c/a\u003e would work\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—\u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/05/8chan-el-paso-shooting-extremists/\"\u003eWhat you need to know about 8chan\u003c/a\u003e, the controversial site tied to the El Paso shooting\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—After the El Paso shooting, a \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/06/mexico-extradite-patrick-crusius/\"\u003ecall for stronger protections for Mexicans in America\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—Listen to our audio briefing, \u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/radio/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e 500 Daily\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eGet up to speed on your morning commute with \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e’s \u003ca href=\"https://cloud.newsletters.fortune.com/fortune/nloptin?nl=CEO_DAILY\u0026amp;source=LinkStack\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eCEO Daily\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e newsletter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://fortune.com/2019/08/09/michael-brown-ferguson-race/","published":"2019-08-09T15:00:06Z","guid":"https://fortune.com/?p=2680099"},{"title":"The Global Collapse in Interest Rates May be Setting Investors Up for a Crash","content":"\n\u003cp\u003e“Lower for longer” has been the adage to describe interest rates since the Federal Reserve and other central banks took short rates to near-zero as a remedy during the 2008-09 financial crisis. These past few days confirm beyond doubt that it’s going to be lower a \u003cem\u003elot\u003c/em\u003e longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile that’s good news for consumers with credit card balances and auto loans, perpetually low rates have major downsides. Two of them: Low rates distort the yield curve, which could hasten a recession. And they encourage excessive corporate borrowing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eEasy money tends to blind people to very real perils, in the view of the Jerome Levy Forecasting Center. The research group’s most recent report warns that “economic stress will spoil the illusion of safety in global credit well before 2020.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSuch admonitions haven’t deterred central banks, which are on a rate-slicing kick. The Federal Reserve last week lowered its benchmark federal funds rate by a quarter percentage point to a target band of 2% to 2.25%. A clamor to keep reducing it is coming from some influential Wall Street figures, not to mention President Donald Trump. The Fed’s move, according to Joachim Fels, global economic advisor at bond house Pimco, may be “the beginning of the next major Fed easing cycle.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOn Wednesday, the central banks of Thailand, New Zealand and India cut their rates, and Australia is expected to follow soon. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan are eyeing further rate decreases. Indeed, both Europe and Japan have negative interest rates, where businesses and consumers must pay to deposit cash. Pimco’s Fels argued that the U.S. might end up with negative rates, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAll these rate reductions are meant as stimulus, and indeed much of the world is facing slowing growth, with the ongoing U.S.-China trade war making matters worse. In the U.S., whose economy still seems to be in good shape (although economic growth dipped to 2.1% in the second quarter, from 3.1% in the prior period), the July cut is billed as insurance against a possible downturn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, broad macro forces are pushing rates below their historical levels. Low inflation is the root cause, the consequence of globalization and automation. And quiet inflation has changed the landscape for rate increases. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has found that out the hard way, as little appetite exists for higher rates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHe had been gradually pumping up rates until this year, in hopes of returning them to more normal levels. In a sign of the times, though, even that target was lower than average, which had been around 5%. Until its about-face last month, the Fed was looking at around 3% or so as an end point. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eLow rates mean the Fed has less room to cut, as a recession-fighting tool. What’s more, low rates bring the economy much closer to deflation, should a brutal recession blow in. And deflation, a nemesis in the Great Depression, makes recovery very difficult.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eYield curve inversion\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs many market-watchers have noted, the distorted yield curve (when short term bond yields exceed long term yields) is cause for concern.  The yield curve inverted in May, with the three-month Treasury bill higher than the 10-year Treasury note.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe reason this matters is an inverted curve is the financial equivalent of the tell-tale red-ringed skin lesion of the Black Plague in the Middle Ages: It’s a sure-fire sign of doom. The inversion augurs a coming recession. To Joseph Lavorgna, Nataxis’ chief economist for the Americas, it can be a self-fulfilling prophecy. An inverted curve, he said, “is both a predictor and creator of recessions.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, fixed-income dynamics have shifted these days, and some believe the yield curve’s predictive abilities are off kilter. Short rates have trended lower, but long-term bond yields are suppressed by enormous demand, especially from foreign investors, seeking the safety of Treasury paper and, as their domestic rates are even lower than in America, relatively fatter interest payments. The large demand increases bond prices, and yields move down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo see how this works, let’s plot the rate of decreases. At the year’s start, the three-month yielded 2.42% and the 10-year was 2.66%. Now, the three-year is 2.05% and the 10-year is 1.73%. In other words, the short-term Treasury slid 0.41 percentage point, and the long bond a much more sizable 0.93 point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eExcessive borrowing\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eCorporate America has been on a borrowing binge. In some cases, the objective was to fund stock buybacks, which support share prices. In others, to underwrite acquisitions. And also to pay for capital spending. Borrowing, aptly nicknamed leverage, is a time-honored way to buy big and important things, necessary for building businesses and creating earnings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSome argue, with justice, that low rates have taken leverage too far. In the Levy Forecasting Center’s estimation, “companies in dubious financial positions have been able to roll over loans, fill holes in their cash flow and postpone cutbacks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs of this year’s first quarter, corporate nonfinancial debt of U.S. companies had surged to a record $9 trillion. And that is higher than before the Great Recession, consultancy Deloitte found.

The FCC announced it would hold its radio frequency exposure limits for cell phones, cellular towers, and other wireless gear at current levels. The use of some new frequencies as part of the 5G rollout did not change the situation, the agency said. After a review of the scientific record and consultations with health agencies, \u0026#8220;we find it appropriate to maintain the existing radio frequency limits, which are among the most stringent in the world for cell phones,” Julius Knapp, chief of the FCC’s Office of Engineering and Technology, said. That came backed with excerpted comments from Jeffrey Shuren, director of the Food and Drug Administration’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. The \u0026#8220;available scientific evidence to date does not support adverse health effects in humans due to exposures at or under the current limit” and “[n]o changes to the current standards are warranted at this time,” Shuren explained in a letter cited in part by the FCC.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026#8217;s also the same conclusion that the scientific association the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, or IEEE, came to back in February, when it completed a review of recommended exposure limits and also \u003ca href=\"http:// https://standards.ieee.org/standard/C95_1-2019.html \"\u003eagreed to maintain them at current levels\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut the announcements \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/05/22/health-concerns-5g-cellphones-cancer/\"\u003eare unlikely to end the debate\u003c/a\u003e. Worriers can point to a few studies and the decision by the World Health Organization’s International Agency for Research on Cancer to classify cellular radio waves as a possible carcinogen back in 2011. And countries like Belgium and Switzerland have delayed 5G networks over health concerns. On the other side, research from the American Cancer Society and the National Institutes of Health, among others, have concluded there are no risks. And so round it goes.

Under LBJ, then-chair William McChesney Martin famously said that the role of the Fed was to \u0026#8220;take away the punch bowl [by raising interest rates] just as the party gets going.\u0026#8221; Johnson shoved him into a wall during one discussion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTrump hasn\u0026#8217;t shoved anyone.

I had a slight hope that it would be brought to iOS eventually once the PC version was released on the Epic Games Store but it still felt like something that was never going to happen. That made the shadow drop release even crazier, but here we are in 2019 with \u003cem\u003eJourney\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2019/07/19/toucharcade-game-of-the-week-sky-children-of-the-light/\"\u003eSky: Children of the Light\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e on iOS from thatgamecompany.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/03F21C7F-610A-406F-AFE0-129F083E2BD4.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1536\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-256724\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/03F21C7F-610A-406F-AFE0-129F083E2BD4.png 2048w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/03F21C7F-610A-406F-AFE0-129F083E2BD4-300x225.png 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/03F21C7F-610A-406F-AFE0-129F083E2BD4-768x576.png 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/03F21C7F-610A-406F-AFE0-129F083E2BD4-1024x768.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eJourney\u003c/em\u003e has you playing as a robed figure exploring a massive desert. Your aim seemingly is to reach a mountain that\u0026#8217;s always visible to you initially. \u003cem\u003eJourney\u003c/em\u003e\u0026#8216;s story is told through a few cutscenes spread across the experience without any voices. The gameplay plays a big part in piecing together the narrative and I\u0026#8217;ve found people interpreting things differently. You slowly find more scarf pieces and can jump or fly higher. Your scarf plays a very important part in the game. A lot of people compared \u003cem\u003eABZU\u003c/em\u003e from Giant Squid to \u003cem\u003eJourney\u003c/em\u003e but I feel like even with \u003cem\u003eJourney\u003c/em\u003e\u0026#8216;s vague structure, it handles the overall narrative much better. My main complaint with the core game has always been one of the later segments of the game that feels tacked on and breaks the flow. I don\u0026#8217;t want to spoil things, but you will know when you reach there. The in-game mechanics for that area are really bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs of now, there is no MFi controller support in \u003cem\u003eJourney\u003c/em\u003e on iOS. This is pretty surprising considering the game is originally a PlayStation 3 release that was ported to PlayStation 4 and eventually PC. The touch controls are more or less fine but the camera might be a problem for some. I\u0026#8217;d recommend spending some time trying to not only change the setting but also experimenting with camera movement using the right virtual analogue stick. This will help a lot later on when the game pacing becomes a bit faster or when you find yourself struggling with some of the platforming sections. The movement felt very erratic at first and almost gave me motion sickness just like \u003cem\u003eThe Witness\u003c/em\u003e did when I played it on iOS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/DCFE7ABD-B2BB-4546-92FB-6F41B4A8EC49.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1334\" height=\"750\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-256735\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/DCFE7ABD-B2BB-4546-92FB-6F41B4A8EC49.png 1334w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/DCFE7ABD-B2BB-4546-92FB-6F41B4A8EC49-300x169.png 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/DCFE7ABD-B2BB-4546-92FB-6F41B4A8EC49-768x432.png 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/DCFE7ABD-B2BB-4546-92FB-6F41B4A8EC49-1024x576.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVisually, \u003cem\u003eJourney\u003c/em\u003e is beyond stunning. The art direction really carries the game even on older devices like my iPad Air 2. I played \u003cem\u003eJourney\u003c/em\u003e on iPhone 7, iPad Pro, and iPad Air 2. The iPad Air 2 definitely struggles with it and has instances of freezing, but it was fine on my iPhone 7 and iPad Pro. If you have a newer iPad Pro, it even supports higher refresh rates. One interesting and weird aspect of the game is that the in-game settings just have some control options but the system settings on iOS let you select from various resolution and framerate options for \u003cem\u003eJourney\u003c/em\u003e, supporting even 120 fps if your device is capable of that refresh rate. The iPad Air 2 version at default settings reminds me of many third party ports to Switch that have loads of aliasing but are playable. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the audio side of things, \u003cem\u003eJourney\u003c/em\u003e is flawless in general but the iOS port has issues on some devices. On iPad Air 2, I had the sound cutting out randomly or jerking around. I had none of this happen on iPad Pro or iPhone 7. Austin Wintory\u0026#8217;s score for \u003cem\u003eJourney\u003c/em\u003e is more than worth the price of admission here and it is unbelievably great in the game. I\u0026#8217;m still blown away by when \u003cem\u003eThe Road of Trials\u003c/em\u003e plays in game and this is the sixth time I\u0026#8217;m experiencing \u003cem\u003eJourney\u003c/em\u003e. The sound design outside the music is excellent. You only communicate with others who happen to be paired with you through a single sound or audio signal. It works brilliantly in the game and keeps the sense of mystery alive throughout your experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/E95BDE1A-3C40-43CA-BE15-5099BF7792CF.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1536\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-256729\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/E95BDE1A-3C40-43CA-BE15-5099BF7792CF.png 2048w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/E95BDE1A-3C40-43CA-BE15-5099BF7792CF-300x225.png 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/E95BDE1A-3C40-43CA-BE15-5099BF7792CF-768x576.png 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/E95BDE1A-3C40-43CA-BE15-5099BF7792CF-1024x768.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne interesting aspect of \u003cem\u003eJourney\u003c/em\u003e is the multiplayer component. This isn\u0026#8217;t traditional multiplayer where you invite a friend and play together. You get randomly paired with others seamlessly and don\u0026#8217;t actually know who they are. You can communicate with them through an audio signal and can help each other out in some situations. On iOS, \u003cem\u003eJourney\u003c/em\u003e uses Game Center for matchmaking. I had no trouble having people appear in my games. It worked just as brilliantly as it did when I played it back on PlayStation 3 a long time ago. You usually see a white glow around a part of the screen when someone has joined in or is near you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eJourney\u003c/em\u003e on iOS is a universal game. It even has iCloud save support. On devices that support it, \u003cem\u003eJourney\u003c/em\u003e has interesting haptic feedback for your chime or audio signal. I know iOS games are often cheaper than their console or PC ports but \u003cem\u003eJourney\u003c/em\u003e at $4.99 is a steal. One thing to note is that this is very much a one and done experience for the most part. You can replay it for secrets but I doubt most people will bother because the real magic is the first playthrough that should hopefully be unspoiled because the locations are stunning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ABAD3157-8D9F-41E1-9614-69521AE8DCA3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1536\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-256730\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ABAD3157-8D9F-41E1-9614-69521AE8DCA3.png 2048w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ABAD3157-8D9F-41E1-9614-69521AE8DCA3-300x225.png 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ABAD3157-8D9F-41E1-9614-69521AE8DCA3-768x576.png 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ABAD3157-8D9F-41E1-9614-69521AE8DCA3-1024x768.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight now, I hope Annapurna Interactive is working on fixing the issues with the port. Adding controller support would be amazing but the real big issue is the camera movement that definitely needs tweaking. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverall, \u003cem\u003eJourney\u003c/em\u003e on iOS is a must play if you\u0026#8217;ve never played it before. Hopefully the few issues like the audio bugs on older devices and camera controls are addressed in a future update. The lack of controller support is pretty baffling considering this is originally a console game and I hope \u003ca href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2019/06/03/wwdc-2019-apple-tv-ps4-xbox-controller-support/\"\u003eproper controller support\u003c/a\u003e is added at least when iOS 13 ships. If you\u0026#8217;ve already played \u003cem\u003eJourney\u003c/em\u003e on PlayStation or PC platforms, this is the only portable version and it has been a joy to play on iPad and iPhone years after replaying it on PlayStation 4.

I was super excited to play \u003cem\u003eGRIS\u003c/em\u003e ever since I saw the initial reveal trailer for Nintendo Switch. When I finally played it on Switch, I was blown away by the visuals, music, and storytelling. \u003cem\u003eGRIS\u003c/em\u003e is one of the best indie games in a long time.

It’s one that has dogged the 37-year-old since his long-shot White House bid caught fire earlier this spring, launching him into the top tier of 2020 Democratic candidates: How does he remedy his near-nonexistent support among black voters?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSpeaking onstage at the National Association of Black Journalists’s convention in Miami, Buttigieg made quick mention of his Douglass Plan, a sweeping proposal to address racial inequality through actions such as boosting the funding for historically black colleges and universities and cutting incarceration rates. The forum, moderated by \u003cem\u003eAtlantic \u003c/em\u003estaff writer Vann R. Newkirk II, Craig Melvin of NBC, and Alexi McCammond of Axios, featured three other 2020 hopefuls—Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, and former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld, an old-school New England centrist challenging Donald Trump for the GOP nomination.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eButtigieg didn’t appear prepared for a follow-up question about his Douglass Plan: No matter how much he says systemic racism is a white people problem, how does he get white people to support his ideas on how to fix it?  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eButtigieg has struggled to win over black voters more than many other top-tier candidates.

At NABJ, he spoke of the necessity of reparations and about his awakening that racism wasn’t just something that “happened a long time ago.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter Buttigieg finished it was time for Sanders, whose own inability to win over black voters in 2016 prevented him from posing a bigger threat to Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination. (She trounced him by nearly 50 points in the South Carolina primary and by similarly large margins throughout the South.) Though some of Sanders’s support has slipped this time around, there is less of a gap between white and black voters who appear to be backing him in his 2020 bid.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSanders framed his well-worn talking points, such as Medicare for All and free college, in explicitly racial terms, but the crowd didn’t always appear receptive to his message. When asked by Melvin whether his plan to wipe out student loans was unfair for people like the moderator himself, who said he had just\u003cem\u003e \u003c/em\u003efinished paying off his loans, Sanders didn’t provide a direct answer, and was interrupted by someone in the crowd urging him to “Answer the question!”  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBooker, who along with Senator Kamala Harris of California, is one of the two black candidates in the 2020 field, was far more explicit than the other candidates in talking about race.

Additionally, potential trading partners have to worry about U.S. congressional approval. “Congress is in there for the commercial benefit of their own district, always,” Grozoubinski, the former Australian trade negotiator, said. “The U.S. system isn’t designed to do people favors.” Indeed, Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives, said there will be “no chance” of a trade deal with Britain if its withdrawal from the EU results in the imposition of a hard border between Northern Ireland, which is a part of the U.K., and the Republic of Ireland, an EU member.

And I’d argue that while every branch of American education is always “important,” from pre-school and K-12 to the most intense research universities, community colleges really are the crucial institutions of this economic and political moment. That is because:\u003c/p\u003e\u003col type=\"1\"\u003e\u003cli\u003eThey’re local- or state-based, and thus far freer to experiment, adapt, and innovate than most federally run institutions are at this moment of paralyzed national-level politics.\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\t\u003cli\u003eThey’re increasingly \u003cem\u003ethe\u003c/em\u003e institutions that feel responsible for matching people who need opportunities with the fastest-growing opportunities of this era.

He quickly endorsed the idea of “red-flag” laws that would allow judges to order the removal of guns from people deemed to be a danger to themselves or others. He’s renewed his periodic (though often fleeting) interest in strengthening background checks, a longstanding priority for Democrats and advocates of tighter restrictions on guns.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/08/congress-pass-gun-laws/595534/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: A rare gun-control proposal that could unite Congress\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSpeaking to reporters outside the White House before leaving for fundraising events in the Hamptons, Trump this morning repeatedly said that he wants to impose what he called “meaningful” background checks that would keep guns away from “bad people, dangerous people.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“I think the Republicans are going to lead the charge, along with the Democrats,” Trump said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePerhaps most significantly, Trump’s movement is causing Republicans on Capitol Hill to shift, creating a new window of opportunity for proposals that have stalled in Congress. \u003ca href=\"https://whas.iheart.com/featured/terry-meiners/content/2019-08-08-mcconnell-checks-in-from-twitter-jail-on-gun-reform-home-protests-more/\"\u003eIn an interview with a local radio station in Kentucky\u003c/a\u003e, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a staunch supporter of gun rights, said a debate over red-flag laws and background checks would be “front and center” when lawmakers return from their August recess next month. McConnell rejected calls to bring the Senate back early, and he wouldn’t commit passage or even a vote on either issue. But it was significant that the majority leader acknowledged the overwhelming support in public polling for stronger background checks and signaled a genuine desire to pass legislation out of the Senate. “What we can’t do is fail to pass something. By just locking up and failing to pass, that’s unacceptable,” McConnell said. “What I want to see here is an outcome and not just a bunch of partisan back-and-forths, shots across the bow.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYet the president, in his tweets and in his comments to reporters, is not vowing an all-out fight with the National Rifle Association, the gun-rights lobbying group that has mobilized both legislators and voters against new restrictions for decades. Trump said he hoped to win over the NRA and its CEO, Wayne LaPierre. “I think in the end Wayne and the NRA will either be there or maybe will be a little bit more neutral,” Trump said. “And that would be okay, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThough hobbled by internal strife and multiple state investigations, the NRA has given no indication it plans to stand down. And Trump’s unwillingness to battle the organization in the past has left both Democrats and his own aides skeptical that this time will be different. “Dems have been down this path before with the president only for the NRA and Republicans to rein him back in, so we’re cautious,” said one Democratic congressional aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to offer a candid perspective.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIndeed, Trump has flirted with expanded background checks before, only to pull back in the face of pressure from the gun lobby and conservative voices on Capitol Hill and inside his own White House. In February 2018, after the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, that killed 17 people, Trump invited students and parents to the White House to discuss gun violence. He used the occasion to tout a plan to arm teachers and coaches (a plan favored by the NRA), but he also made a case for expanding background checks on people purchasing guns. He said that “we’re going to be very strong on background checks. We’re going to be doing very strong background checks.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIt never happened.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIf anything, the White House had been moving in the opposite direction prior to last weekend’s massacres in Dayton and El Paso.

It’s unlikely that bill would win over enough Republicans in the Senate, but there is discussion about reviving the compromise proposal from Republican Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia. That bill fell short in the wake of the 2012 massacre in Newtown, Connecticut.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs one senior Republican aide put it yesterday, “I think Trump is serious until he sees that his base will lose their minds over it.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor any significant gun-control measures to pass, the president will need to make a sustained push in private and in public—not just now, but through the lengthy August recess and into September.

Take \u003cem\u003eJimmy Kimmel Live\u003c/em\u003e’s Guillermo Rodriguez knocking back a shot of maple syrup and \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkLBDQ9TXPA\"\u003echeering \u003c/a\u003e“Old Anna!” (He’s actually saying “O Canada!”) Or the influencer Emma Chamberlain \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0wpTx6kUPE\"\u003edeclaring that\u003c/a\u003e once her plane lands, “I’ll be embarrassed.” (She’s saying “I’ll be in Paris.”) One video from Playlist Live \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvT8BzK3m3U\"\u003erendered\u003c/a\u003e “Check out their booth” as “Check out their boobies.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn hundreds of videos, tweets, messages, and handwritten letters, Poynter has urged creators to write their own captions or employ professionals to help get the job done right. She’s hardly a techno-skeptic: Like many people who identify as deaf or Deaf (\u003cem\u003edeaf\u003c/em\u003e describes a medical condition; \u003cem\u003eDeaf\u003c/em\u003e denotes a cultural identity), she has embraced social media to connect with others in her community. But #NoMoreCRAPtions highlights how impressive advances in assistive technologies such as automatic captioning can obscure these technologies’ imperfections. The campaign is Poynter’s way of pushing back against any misguided notion that deaf people live in a technological future that hasn’t yet arrived for everyone else.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/06/why-tv-captions-are-so-terrible/373283/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: The sorry state of closed captioning\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor television broadcasts, the Federal Communications Commission oversees captioning, a legal requirement under the Americans With Disabilities Act; the same legislation requires movie theaters to make closed captioning available for most films. YouTube, however, doesn’t fall under FCC jurisdiction, and has so far eluded regulation under the ADA. While film and television employ fleets of human stenocaptioners and voice writers to ensure that captions meet the required standards, YouTube’s automatic captions (visible when viewers click a button at the bottom of a video) are created by speech-recognition software. Trained on a vast database of language gleaned from the web, the software uses probability to \u003ca href=\"https://ai.googleblog.com/2012/10/large-scale-language-modeling-in.html\"\u003eguide\u003c/a\u003e its selection of words and phrases: If the two previous words were \u003cem\u003edaily exercise\u003c/em\u003e, the next word is more likely to be \u003cem\u003eroutine\u003c/em\u003e than \u003cem\u003eorphan\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePoynter insists that proper captions should not only fit the right words to a video’s audio content—a feat that automation struggles to achieve—but also use correct grammar and punctuation, describe sounds like the eerie creak of a door or the crackle of gunfire, and differentiate between speakers so deaf audiences know who’s talking. Although the term \u003cem\u003ecraptions\u003c/em\u003e predates Poynter’s campaign, her efforts have struck a chord, \u003ca href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/av/magazine-31019335/youtubers-subtitle-your-videos-says-deaf-campaigner\"\u003edrawing\u003c/a\u003e international media attention and setting off waves of advocacy by hearing YouTube stars.

She says that many creators caption for a while before quietly letting it slide. (A representative for Oakley told me that since 2017, all his videos have been manually captioned by a paid transcription service. Lester did not respond to a request for comment.) YouTubers sometimes balk at the time and money it takes to create their own captions or to hire others to do so. Some creators make a healthy living from their videos, but most struggle to churn out content and attract sponsors, often while working other jobs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn a few of her videos, Poynter offers viewers a promo code to get 10 minutes of professional captioning for free from a company called Rev (the service Oakley uses). One of a number of players in the cheap-captions market, Rev \u003ca href=\"https://www.rev.com/\"\u003echarges\u003c/a\u003e consumers a dollar per minute of audio and promises an accuracy rate of 99 percent. Message boards where transcriptionists and captioners gather tend to \u003ca href=\"https://www.transcriptionessentials.com/index.php?topic=26993.0\"\u003epaint\u003c/a\u003e a grim picture of life as a Rev freelancer, however. “A monkey at the zoo gets paid better than you,” someone \u003ca href=\"https://ca.indeed.com/cmp/Rev.com/reviews\"\u003ewrote\u003c/a\u003e on the anonymous employer-review site Indeed.com. (Rev’s CEO and co-founder, Jason Chicola, says that transcriptionists are generally paid 50 cents per minute of finished audio, and defended the pay rate as adequate for someone who can caption quickly and accurately.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYouTubers who can’t or won’t pay for a service like Rev can turn to crowdsourcing. YouTube’s community-contributions feature allows all viewers to submit their own captions for a video, with the permission of the video’s creator. But when the feature first launched, some popular channels quickly \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLQ-85Td2Gs\u0026amp;t=131s\"\u003efilled up\u003c/a\u003e with emoticons, \u003cem\u003eLOL\u003c/em\u003es, and false captions that commented on the action on-screen. Some channels became \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEAha_un74Q\"\u003eknown\u003c/a\u003e for their dissonant captions, like the comedy channel Markiplier. YouTube responded by instituting a vetting process. Before publication, proposed captions can now be \u003ca href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7300578?hl=en\u0026amp;ref_topic=7295414\"\u003eflagged\u003c/a\u003e by other contributors, which triggers a review by YouTube’s human moderators (automated systems also assess the reliability of contributors in order to filter out pranksters). By default, it’s the crowd that performs quality control: When enough votes of approval have piled up, captions go live regardless of whether the creator has reviewed them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo satisfy the demands of #NoMoreCRAPtions, YouTube could, in theory, require that all video creators must add their own captions or hire someone to do so. Liat Kaver, a product manager at Google, which owns YouTube, pointed out that such a rule wouldn’t necessarily ensure that video creators would do a good job. It also might exclude some creators, such as “people who are illiterate, but upload videos to YouTube,” and “citizen journalism or creators that are registering events as they happen (e.g. Arab Spring),” Kaver, who is herself deaf and \u003ca href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/09/208398/the-pipeline-liat-kaver\"\u003euses\u003c/a\u003e a cochlear implant, told me over email.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA second option would be for YouTube itself to hire people to caption videos. When I asked whether Google would consider doing so to voluntarily meet ADA requirements, a spokesperson responded that the company had nothing further to add.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe other—and perhaps most likely—possibility is that technology will simply catch up. Auto-captions, Poynter notes, are actually getting better, pushed forward in part by a growing \u003ca href=\"https://blogs.skype.com/news/2018/12/03/introducing-live-captions-and-subtitles-in-skype/\"\u003edemand\u003c/a\u003e for captioning from businesses with international workforces for whom English is a second language. Rev, the captioning company, now offers its own automatic speech-recognition software on its sister site, Temi, for a lower price than its human-captioner services. The company still extols the superiority of human transcriptionists, but claims that computer-generated transcripts are becoming competitive with those made by people.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis rapid improvement of auto-captions gets at the tensions #NoMoreCRAPtions brings to light. While assistive technologies do end up working wonders for some deaf people, these technologies can overpromise effectiveness and convenience. Hearing aids, for instance, can \u003ca href=\"https://www3.gallaudet.edu/Documents/Clerc/Odyssey/2015_issue/ODYSSEY_SPR2015_Mertes.pdf\"\u003efail\u003c/a\u003e to capture certain frequencies. Cochlear implants, for those who choose to use them, usually \u003ca href=\"https://www3.gallaudet.edu/clerc-center/our-resources/cochlear-implant-education-center/navigating-a-forest-of-information/listening.html\"\u003erequire\u003c/a\u003e years of auditory-verbal training.

The ADA mandates that people with disabilities should have equal access to public goods and services, but regarding captions, it’s difficult to say exactly what that means. How accurate is accurate enough? Rev’s human captioners are held to a standard of 99 percent accuracy, while its automatic captions achieve an accuracy rate of about 85 to 90 percent. Google declined to provide a number, but told me that YouTube’s speech-recognition accuracy improved by 50 percent from 2015 to 2017.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/08/understanding-deafness-not-everyone-wants-to-be-fixed/278527/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: Understanding deafness: Not everyone wants to be ‘fixed’\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe FCC has no real metrics for measuring accuracy. A spokesperson told me that the agency has been stymied by a lack of public consensus on how to set quantitative standards. The National Association of the Deaf, meanwhile, “believes that technology will progress to the point where automated captioning will meet acceptable levels of accuracy, but also believes that it will be many years before such an acceptable accuracy rate is achieved,” the association’s CEO, Howard A. Rosenblum, told me over email. The association is currently \u003ca href=\"https://rootedinrights.org/harvard-and-mit-sued-over-closed-captioning-practices/\"\u003esuing\u003c/a\u003e Harvard and MIT over lack of captioning on their e-learning videos posted on YouTube.

But good enough, of course, isn’t the same as equal. Poynter runs up against this conflict often, even in the real world. In advance of her panel at Playlist Live, she asked the festival to provide a professional transcriber to caption the talk in real time to help her follow along. The day she arrived in Orlando, the captioner canceled. Poynter says that Playlist made a significant effort to find another transcriber, but no one was available. (The festival did not respond to requests for comment.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePoynter ultimately had to rely on American Sign Language interpreters, even though she’s more comfortable following a conversation with transcriptions. “It sucks, but … what can you do?” Poynter tells her audience in a \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F_-ME-A018\"\u003evideo dispatch\u003c/a\u003e from the edge of the bed in her hotel room. “It’s something.

On top of this, a parent’s anxiety fuels or otherwise reinforces his or her kid’s own fears (and vice versa)—an “emotional contagion,” as Fagell put it.

After all, Cavazos had gone through a similar thought process just a few days earlier, after the shooting that took four lives and wounded 13 others at a garlic festival in California, and the other shooting that same day in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, where a gunman \u003ca href=\"https://chippewa.com/news/state-and-regional/dead-injured-in-residential-shootings-in-wisconsin/article_a1efe519-00a2-5212-88b3-995d39bd0f76.html#tracking-source=home-top-story\"\u003eshot eight people\u003c/a\u003e, six of whom died.

The Great Red Spot, one of our solar system’s most famous features, would have appeared to be slowly unraveling. You would have seen the swirling storm system casting off ribbons of rose-colored gas like petals in the wind. It would have been beautiful.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEarlier this year, dozens of die-hard amateur astronomers across the globe began noticing that the Great Red Spot’s ordinarily ovoid figure looked distorted. By April, it seemed to be shedding red flakes. In May, that flaking grew so extreme that the spot looked as though it might disintegrate.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe amateur community, a tight-knit group that regularly communicates and shares photos over social media, was charged with excitement and anxiety. It had never seen anything like this before, and members worried what it might mean. On a warm Australian night in early May, the longtime amateur and software engineer Anthony Wesley was floored when his telescope captured an image of a bright streamer curling away from the spot. \u003cem\u003eThat\u003c/em\u003e, he thought, \u003cem\u003eis not something you see every day\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHumans have been observing the Great Red Spot since the invention of the telescope in the 1600s, and at its peak, the storm was three times wider than the Earth. Since the late 19th century, though, it has been shrinking, slowly but steadily. In 2012, amateur astronomers noticed that its diminution had accelerated. And in May, when they saw it flaking, they feared that it might be on the verge of extinction.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Are we seeing the ‘beginning of the end’? The GRS Death dance?” one astronomer wondered aloud in a Facebook group for Jupiter enthusiasts. “I was scared because if the Great Red Spot disappears … it’s like you go to New York and remove the Statue of Liberty,” another told me.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/04/jupiter-shrinking-great-red-spot/557456/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: Why is Jupiter’s Great Red Spot shrinking?\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs it has shrunk, the storm has also grown darker, redder, and taller; this year, the color palette is more intense than ever, according to a NASA press release accompanying new photos of Jupiter taken by the Hubble Space Telescope. Through all those changes, though, the spot’s position has never shifted: Twin jet streams circle the planet in opposite directions and lock the storm in place. Moving at speeds approaching 400 miles an hour, the jets constantly bombard the spot with clouds and vortices; some incorporate themselves into its body, while others pass through unhindered. The whole system looks something like a wristwatch wrapped around the planet, with the jet streams for a band and the spot for a face.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the months after they first recognized the spot’s unusual behavior, the amateurs around the world monitored it at virtually all hours of the day and sent their images to the scientists at NASA’s Outer Planet Atmospheres Legacy program. The storm looked to have undergone a sudden contraction (though more recent amateur data suggest it has since returned to its former size). But when the scientists analyzed its behavior using the amateur images along with the higher-resolution Hubble photos, they arrived at a very different story.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Great Red Spot was not dying—at least not any faster than it had been before. To the amateurs, it had looked as though strands of the storm were tearing away. But according to Amy Simon, who leads the Outer Planet program, that impression resulted from the fundamental imprecision of visual measurements.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRecently, Simon told me, the program has started measuring the storm using its dynamics instead of its visual features. Tracking the storm’s velocity rather than its color revealed that much of the red gas that had seemed to be flowing \u003cem\u003eout\u003c/em\u003e of the Great Red Spot was actually flowing \u003cem\u003ein\u003c/em\u003e. This, she said, is nothing new.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“It’s always doing this,” Simon told me. The Great Red Spot “is always pulling stuff in and parts of it are flying off. That is not unusual at all.” The difference this time, she said, has to do with both the appearance and the behavior of those mysterious red flakes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor starters, the material flowing into and around the red spot has taken on a reddish color more like the storm’s, creating the illusion of shedding. Simon told me that shift in color occurs before the material ever reaches the storm, while Glenn Orton, a scientist at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, thinks the shift happens later.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEither way, the material’s unusual movements have only enhanced the illusion. Typically, Simon explained, material from the jet streams either integrates into the storm or passes clean through. In recent months, though, it has been noncommittal at times, circling the periphery of the storm a few times before escaping its orbit, as though going for a quick carousel ride. That outer circuit, Orton says, has “gone from a two-lane country road … to a six-lane highway.” The ribbons of gas torn from the storm may never really have been part of it at all, more commuters than inhabitants.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTaken together, these findings offer a clear answer to the mystery of why the Great Red Spot is disintegrating: It isn’t. But with that simple answer comes a new mystery just as perplexing as the first: If it wasn’t disintegrating, why did it look like it was? As is often the case with the workings of the Great Red Spot, scientists don’t yet have an explanation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/06/jupe-spot/484910/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: Solving the mystery of Jupiter’s Great Red Spot\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor now, Simon told me, they must simply accept much of Jupiter’s behavior as random. By investigating the recent changes, though, some scientists hope to find clues to perhaps the planet’s greatest mystery of all: why the Great Red Spot is red in the first place.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTim Dowling, an atmospheric-physics professor at the University of Louisville, views the recent disruptions as a chance to test scientific models explaining the spot’s color. Many of its observers have hypothesized that it may grow redder at higher altitudes, but the specific mechanics of \u003cem\u003ewhat\u003c/em\u003e is turning red and \u003cem\u003ehow\u003c/em\u003e remain open to interpretation. Simon sees a few possible explanations. Dowling favors the crème brûlée model, so called because it posits that the spot’s color comes from a thin coating of solid particles atop a bed of clouds, just as the burnt crust of a crème brûlée sits atop the custard.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen I asked Anthony Wesley about Simon’s account of the Great Red Spot’s behavior, he was skeptical, though he freely acknowledged that, given the ambiguity, I might be better off taking Simon and her colleagues at their word. And yet he knew what he had seen with his own eyes—parts of the spot spinning out and away. Wesley’s way of looking at the cosmos is distinct from NASA’s, and the discrepancy in their accounts reflects that. Judging by the velocities Simon measured in her data, the storm system isn’t contracting any faster than it has been in recent years. And judging by the images Wesley and the other amateurs captured, the red oval we see when we look up at Jupiter through a telescope shrank considerably before returning to its former size.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf, somehow, the Great Red Spot faded from view but the storm spun on, would it still be the Great Red Spot? The underlying system, in Simon’s words, would be the same. But if Wesley awoke in the middle of the night to find that the cosmic phenomenon he’d spent more than 15 years photographing had vanished from sight, that fact might come as little consolation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/JKX1XoEquXs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/JKX1XoEquXs/","published":"2019-08-09T14:37:24Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-595756"},{"title":"The Ukulele Queens of Deerfield, Illinois","content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eEvery week, \u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/projects/friendship-files/?utm_source=feed\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Friendship Files\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e features a conversation between \u003c/em\u003eThe Atlantic\u003cem\u003e’s Julie Beck and two or more friends, exploring the history and significance of their relationship.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis week she talks with a group of women who all picked up the ukulele after they retired.

I was going to miss the nice group of people that I worked with and despaired at finding another group as fun. The Hummers and Strummers, which is a 20-piece ukulele group here in Deerfield, played at my school every year, so I said, “I’m going to come join you,” and seven years ago I did. That’s where I met Dianne and Carol.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDianne Rogal:\u003c/strong\u003e I picked up a ukulele out of the blue one day. I walked into a music store, bought a ukulele and a book on how to teach yourself to play, and I started playing. About a month later, someone said, “Have you ever heard of the Hummers and Strummers in Deerfield?” Of course, I hadn’t. They said, “They play at the senior center, but they’re old, and you’re going to be way too young.” I didn’t care. I wanted someone to play with. I was in my 60s then. Everybody else besides Linda was pushing 80 and going up into their mid-90s. They were just the most wonderful, warm, and friendly bunch of people ever.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCyndi Buckles:\u003c/strong\u003e I sort of fought playing the ukulele.

They handed me a uke, gave me some lessons, and I practiced and fell in love with the ukulele. And the four of us just kind of glued together.

We play at senior residences, farmers’ markets, preschools, and camps. A lot of local places. The reason that the Shenanigans got started is that Dianne and Cyndi have a wonderful friend named Ruby, who was going to [a day care for adults with memory problems]. Dianne asked Carol and I, “Would you be interested in forming a quartet with me and Cyndi, so that we can go and play once a month for our friend Ruby”?

But when we go to places where people are sharper, we do songs from the ’50s and ’60s. We do lots of show tunes. We try and get a laugh. We’ll do a whole series of cowboy songs, and we’ll crack a whip, and wear our cowboy hats. We have a lot of costumes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur “Diamonds Are a Girl’s Best Friend” is always a hit. We drip in diamonds. When we do the song with the Hummers and Strummers, we have the men all waving diamond bracelets at us. And when we do our ’50s-rock-and-roll program, we are dressed to the nines. It really seems to make a difference with the audience.

People say, “Oh my gosh, you still fit into it?” Well, my secret is: I did a little math, and I cut the waistband off, moved the zipper down, found some two-inch elastic, and made a new waistband. My granddaughter had been in \u003cem\u003eGrease\u003c/em\u003e, so she gave me her Pink Ladies pink jacket. Another granddaughter had the pink glasses from the ’50s. They helped Grandma out.

The only reason you’re allowed not to show up for Shenanigans is if you’re in the emergency room or if an immediate family member has died. So two years ago I called up Dianne to say, “I’m in the emergency room, and I can’t come to our concert today.” I had blood clots in my lungs. Through my recovery, I thought very seriously about all the things I was doing in my life. And I knew that I could give up everything [else], but I could not give up the Shenanigans. They’re what keeps me going, and they’re what keeps me happy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDianne: \u003c/strong\u003eLinda gets the most standing ovations.

And every single time we’ve ever played it, the audience jumps to their feet at the end.

Because, at our age, you know how this story is going to end. I didn’t want to go through the broken heart of having to say goodbye to very dear friends. And that was very misguided on my part.

Violence inflicted because of someone’s race or ethnicity is vile, repulsive, and one of the worst evils we face.” Ivanka Trump declared, “White supremacy, like all other forms of terrorism, is an evil that must be destroyed.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Fox News host Tucker Carlson didn’t share any of those statements with viewers of his program on Tuesday, when he \u003ca href=\"https://video.foxnews.com/v/6068806776001/?playlist_id=5528578293001#sp=show-clips\"\u003eportrayed\u003c/a\u003e concerns about white supremacy as “a hoax” by Democrats engaged in a “relentless bid to divide this country.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThose omissions are egregious. Carlson betrayed the trust of his viewers, eliding facts in a way that could stoke the very divisions he accused others of sowing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd apart from the omissions, the segment was riddled with reasoning so inane, one wondered if stupidity or sophistry was the more charitable explanation. White supremacy is “not a real problem in America,” Carlson said, arguing that “the combined membership of every white-supremacist organization in this country, would they be able to fit inside a college football stadium?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe 9/11 terrorists would fit in a locker room. Every MS-13 gang member in America would fit in the Great Western Forum. The worldwide membership of ISIS might well fit in Michigan Stadium. “Fits in a football stadium” is an idiotic proxy for “a real problem,” especially when only official “members” are counted as part of that problem.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI happen to think that the term \u003cem\u003ewhite supremacy\u003c/em\u003e is now used too promiscuously by some intellectuals. It obviously does not follow that white supremacists don’t exist, or that they aren’t a threat worth taking seriously\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDismissing white supremacy as a concern, Carlson reasoned, “I’ve lived here 50 years and I’ve never met anybody, not one person, who ascribes to white supremacy.” While I doubt that, it would be a dumb argument even if it were true. As far as I know, I’ve never met a murderer or a child molester or a perpetrator of elder abuse. Yet I am certain that all three crimes are still problems.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“The whole thing is a lie,” Carlson insisted. “If you were to assemble a list, a hierarchy of concerns or problems this country faces, where would white supremacy be on the list? Right up there with Russia, probably.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRussia is a nuclear-armed autocracy that remains the most significant reason for the continued existence of NATO. The country actively works to undermine U.S. interests around the globe. It pays a troll army to sow discord among American citizens, and successfully stole emails from the Democratic Party to influence the last presidential election. I happen to think that some people overstate its influence. That does not mean Russia doesn’t pose real challenges to the country.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSetting Russia aside, consider that hierarchical list of problems that America faces. As Carlson sees it, white supremacy belongs very low on that list, thus his cable-news rivals at CNN were disgracing themselves by talking about such a nonproblem in a segment he excerpted. What problems do rank high enough to warrant concern?

He ties the experience of the Philadelphia musician to those of the \u003ca href=\"https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/correctionalcontrol2018.html\"\u003e4.5 million people\u003c/a\u003e whose stories of protracted injustice are less readily heard by wide audiences. “I really believe a lot of people don’t really understand what’s going on, or don’t believe it until they really see it,” Jay-Z, who is also one of the show’s executive producers, says. “Meek is not the only one. You tell people these stories—you can’t believe it, until you hear it from a source and [then] it’s like, this is not fantasy. This is fact. These are just things that are so far that I have to say something.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eFree Meek\u003c/em\u003e, which premieres today, follows the ongoing criminal-justice saga of Meek Mill, the rapper born Robert Rihmeek Williams. As its title suggests, the series doesn’t purport to take an ostensibly impartial view of Meek’s original case. It’s more interested in tying the story of the artist’s 12-year legal limbo to that experienced by black people around the country, especially in low-income neighborhoods. Jay-Z’s Roc Nation label, to which Meek is signed, co-produced the series with The Intellectual Property Corporation, and the show’s existence sheds light on the sometimes complicated high-profile efforts to address criminal-justice reform.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe documentary begins by establishing vignettes of Meek’s early life in Philadelphia, where his mother raised him after his “drug-dealer robber” father, as Meek calls him, was killed when Meek was 5—and where he got his start as a young battle rapper. These are some of the show’s most wrenching scenes. Meek speaks matter-of-factly about his life; of his chosen name, for example, he says, “Robert sound like a white guy’s name; Rihmeek sounded more ghetto to me.” But even the lighter moments of this introduction, such as when his aunt recalls the first time she encountered the 11-year-old Meek rapping, carry an ominous tone. The music is sinister, the lighting sometimes quite dark.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eSoon afterward, viewers learn of the incident that first caused Meek’s entanglement with the criminal-justice system: In January 2007, Meek was arrested at his home, where he says officers beat him so severely that he lost consciousness. He subsequently faced 19 drug, gun, and assault charges, including the allegation that he had pointed a gun at a police officer. (He admits to having possessed a gun in an attempt to protect himself and his family, but Meek is most indignant about the allegation of pointing it at an officer, noting that doing so as a young black man is tantamount to a death wish.) Meek was convicted on seven of those counts despite flimsy evidence and \u003ca href=\"https://www.thefader.com/2017/11/06/meek-mill-probation-jail-two\"\u003esentenced\u003c/a\u003e to a minimum of two years in prison—and the Philadelphia judge Genece Brinkley has kept him on probation for 10 years. It’s the latter situation that has most deeply ensnared Meek. Early on, \u003cem\u003eFree Meek\u003c/em\u003e establishes Brinkley as an unrepentant villain, \u003ca href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/philly/news/meek-mill-genece-brinkley-charles-peruto-mistake-tape-recording-20180703.html\"\u003eperhaps fairly so\u003c/a\u003e, and the series repeatedly emphasizes the impact of her punitive rulings on Meek’s career and well-being.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe image of a 19-year-old Meek, bruised and battered in his mug shot, is central to the show’s marketing, but the series recreates the initial incidents of violence with surprising visual restraint; it’s not gory or indulgent in its portrayal. Far more run time is devoted to explications of Meek’s cyclical parole and probation sentences, as well as expert analysis. In addition to periodic interviews with Jay-Z, \u003cem\u003eFree Meek\u003c/em\u003e also features extensive commentary from the \u003cem\u003eRolling Stone\u003c/em\u003e reporter Paul Solotaroff, who chronicled Meek’s saga in a \u003ca href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/freemeekmill-203630/\"\u003estory published last year\u003c/a\u003e; the Black Lives Matter activist Tamika Mallory; the political commentator Van Jones; and several members of Meek’s family. Meek is the most reluctant speaker in the series, noting that he only turned to advocacy because of the audience his rap career affords him. “It gave me a story to tell,” he says somberly of the legal ordeal.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eLike the \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/06/when-they-see-us-and-persistent-language-black-criminality/590695/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eAva DuVernay series \u003cem\u003eWhen They See Us\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, the Amazon documentary is a narrative work that seeks to correct an institutional wrongdoing.

(These new details are revealed by investigators from Quest Research \u0026amp; Investigations, the private firm that was instrumental in \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/03/case-against-adnan-syed-review/584149/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eHBO’s \u003cem\u003eThe Case Against Adnan Syed\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.) The documentary is a natural platform for the two mega-famous rappers, who are charismatic and convincing, even when subdued. They get their message across: \u003cem\u003eNo one should have their life derailed like this. \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eOutside the realm of artistic production, though, the rappers’ broader approach to criminal-justice reform is less targeted in its vision. Most notably, Meek and Jay-Z announced the organization they founded with the Philadelphia 76ers partner Michael Rubin earlier this year.

Used to refer to mass shootings and the White House’s enabling of white supremacy, profanity shows the extent to which anger operates as currency in today’s political context. It acknowledges how many of this age’s tragedies have been enabled by leaders who have cared too little, and given too few damns. It insists that, if you are alive and awake in the America of the present moment, the only reasonable response is rage. As Heather Heyer \u003ca href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/08/18/if-youre-not-outraged-youre-not-paying-attention-heather-heyers-last-facebook-post\"\u003eput it\u003c/a\u003e before she was killed by a white supremacist in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017: \u003cem\u003eIf you’re not outraged, you’re not paying attention.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr class=\"c-section-divider\"\u003e\u003cp class=\"dropcap\"\u003eProfanity is an extremely efficient conduit of anger. It demonstrates rawness, and realness—the kind of personal authenticity that politicians of the moment are striving to convey to their audiences. And because the definition of profanity is socially constructed and mediated, those seemingly earnest f-bombs make another kind of promise, too. They hint at systemic change. They imply a shake-up at the foundations.

A jolt because no one—not even Salvini—has any clue how this will play out. “He’s playing with fire,” Stefano Folli, a columnist for the Italian daily \u003cem\u003eLa Repubblica\u003c/em\u003e, told me.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eHe’s also playing with consensus.

He isn’t exactly calling for Italy to leave the euro—although he did in 2014, and now commentators are calling on him to \u003ca href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-08-09/italy-and-matteo-salvini-face-their-moment-of-truth-on-the-euro?srnd=opinion\"\u003eclarify that once and for all\u003c/a\u003e—but both the League and the Five Star Movement have capitalized on a protest vote. Italian growth has been stagnant for years. A majority of Italians feel Italy has suffered under globalization and the euro. The economic anxiety is real.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWhen Salvini announced at a rally yesterday that it was time to end the government and let Italians choose, he amped up the rhetoric even further. “I will live and die a free man, not as a slave to anyone,” he said, referring to the EU. He said he wanted Italy to return “to what our grandparents left us”—apparently meaning the postwar economic-boom years before the euro. “We don’t want to go to Brussels with our hats in our hands,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eSalvini’s advisers say he made his move now so that the League could have full control over a budget bill that under normal circumstances Italy should pass by the end of the year, after submitting it for European approval, although the deadline is not binding. The League has been pushing for a flat tax, while the Five Star Movement has promised a universal basic income—a contradiction not easily resolved. But the budget bill could be politically toxic, and if it isn’t passed by the end of the year, the country would have to impose a sharp increase in value-added tax to meet spending commitments made by the current government. Italy has the lowest growth forecast of any EU country this year.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIn his speech, Salvini said he was sick of how the Five Star Movement had been blocking legislation that he argued was needed to kick the economy into gear. This week, Parliament approved a bill to move forward with a high-speed-rail line connecting Turin and Lyon. In what had become the most visible symbol of their discord, the League supported the bill on the grounds that it was good for business and for the economy, while the Five Star Movement opposed it on the grounds that it was useless, did environmental damage, and so many large Italian public-works projects become mired in corruption.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe Five Star Movement’s nominal leader, Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio, was nearly in tears after Salvini’s announcement; he said on television that his coalition partner had “put polls before the interests of the country.” The government had been hard at work doing things, he said, a message echoed by Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, a weak caretaker who this week grew a spine and said that Salvini would have to go before Parliament to answer for why he had decided to withdraw from the coalition. Salvini, Di Maio said, was on the beach for two weeks, then came back and brought down the government, accusing it of not working. “It seems a bit surreal,” Di Maio said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThere’s certainly something strange in the timing of Salvini’s decision. He could have pulled the plug in July, before Parliament went on recess, without causing a crisis over the August holiday.

At his rally yesterday, he deflected and said that the people who took “wagonloads of rubles” from Russia were the Italian Communists of yore, during the Cold War. But there may be an element of desperation here, in which Salvini is acting out of weakness as much as out of strength. It may be easier for him to respond to the Russia allegations in a campaign rather than in government. “Now he can say, ‘They’re attacking me because I’m running in elections,’” Folli, the political commentator, told me.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIn Italy, members of Parliament have immunity from prosecution and have been embroiled in countless scandals. That’s partly why the Italian electorate is so cynical, why the anti-establishment Five Star Movement did so well in the 2018 national elections, and why it proposed a bill to reduce the number of national lawmakers. This was supposed to have been put to a vote on September 9. Such a vote would have delayed elections further, potentially another factor in why Salvini acted now.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIt’s not entirely clear what happens now, and when. Parliament, which is on recess, must reconvene to hold a vote of no confidence before the government is declared dead. Only if no other viable coalitions emerge can the president call snap elections, which would likely be in the fall.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIf Italy does vote, the only things that would stop Salvini and his League from coming to power are Salvini himself (though it’s unlikely he’d change tacks now; losing face would be a huge defeat); an economic collapse (but markets have already factored into a lot more turmoil than Italy’s lately); or a judicial investigation into him and his party. The last of those could certainly weaken him, but if the years of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi taught us anything, it’s that investigations don’t stick, especially when there is little functional political opposition, as is the case today for Salvini.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThere is a final element that could hurt Salvini: humiliation. But the more the press and some Italians mock him for his bare-chested beach tour, the better he looks in the eyes of his followers. They like him. His message resonates. While his political opposition is mired in infighting, he’ll court his voters on the beaches—paunch out, cross around his neck, one selfie at a time. When they come back from the beach and look at their bank accounts, and their tax bills, that’s when the real election campaign will begin.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/xif-unah3vk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/xif-unah3vk/","published":"2019-08-09T12:00:48Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-595810"},{"title":"Stop the Slaughter of Our Children With These Weapons of War","content":"\u003cp\u003eSince the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in which 20 of our first graders were slaughtered with an AR-15-style rifle, I have pondered despairingly how long it would take for America to put an end to the killing generated by these weapons of war. I very briefly had hope that the massacre of our little ones would bring us to our senses, spurring Congress to pass commonsense legislation, including universal background checks and a ban on assault weapons—those massively lethal weapons of mass destruction.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI spent my entire professional life taking up arms in defense of our country, serving in wars from Vietnam to Afghanistan, and ending my service as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. During the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan I saw how our ground forces and special forces sought to improve the precision and lethality of their weapons, which took enemy lives and saved their own. Such is the nature of war.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut these weapons are for war; they are not for sport. Assault weapons are designed to kill as many people as possible in the shortest time possible. As the tragic events last week in El Paso and Dayton attest, these weapons make it virtually impossible for law-enforcement agencies to stop those bent on taking lives. In Dayton, heroic officers responded within 30 seconds, and yet the shooter still killed nine people.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI had hoped that our political leaders would put saving innocent lives ahead of their careers, if necessary sacrificing their own political ambitions to get this done. But our politicians have proved unwilling to take up the cause or to take risks for the sake of the many citizens, young and old, murdered both before and after Sandy Hook. Would you gather the courage if it were your son or daughter whose life had been taken?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the years I served as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, I sat with far too many mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters, sons and daughters of loved ones killed in combat, the best of us, who had made the ultimate sacrifice while serving our country.

The haunting, empty, tragic stares of these grieving families will live with me forever.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter Sandy Hook, I watched in abject disgust while our Congress did nothing, despite the fact that some 90 percent of Americans supported universal background checks. That inaction typified the paralysis and division consistently displayed by elected officials from both parties. Each party could display the same motto: “Party before country.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSince Sandy Hook, the politics have gotten worse and the weapons have become more deadly. And we are led by an administration without a moral compass, which seeks to divide us and destroy our values: equality, freedom, democracy, human rights, integrity, responsibility, accountability. These attacks threaten the very underpinnings of our civilization.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow is the time for courage. We must take steps to make our country and its citizens safe from this growing national-security threat by banning these assault weapons with their large magazines, and by putting in place comprehensive and universal background checks without loopholes.

There’s transgressive appeal to a mob boss rising to power and keeping it, through whatever murder and graft is necessary. Andrea Berloff’s directorial debut, \u003cem\u003eThe Kitchen\u003c/em\u003e, is steeped in the iconography of 1970s crime classics such as \u003cem\u003eThe Godfather\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eMean Streets\u003c/em\u003e, aiming to invoke a seedier New York where only intimidation and might are needed to rise to the top. However, the movie is also a quasi-comic tale of female empowerment, a narrative of three put-upon wives taking control of their husbands’ rackets and whipping them into shape.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStriking a balance between those two genres—a bluntly violent crime thriller and a heightened workplace dramedy—is a difficult task. \u003cem\u003eThe Kitchen \u003c/em\u003efails as spectacularly as possible, trying to frame the ascent of Kathy (played by Melissa McCarthy), Ruby (Tiffany Haddish), and Claire (Elisabeth Moss) as singularly triumphant, even though much of the action involves them arranging gangland killings and negotiating corrupt contracts. The vile business of organized crime is typically presented on-screen as morally corrosive; in \u003cem\u003eThe Kitchen\u003c/em\u003e, the ugliness is just an inconvenience to be navigated.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe film, written by Berloff (an Oscar nominee for her \u003cem\u003eStraight Outta Compton \u003c/em\u003escreenplay), is based on a comic-book series by Ollie Masters and Ming Doyle, and it’s easy to see how such a yarn would work in a pulpier format. The entirely fictional story is set in mid-’70s Hell’s Kitchen, which is run by Irish mobsters played by Brian d’Arcy James, James Badge Dale, and Jeremy Bobb. After they’re busted by the FBI agent Gary Silvers (Common), their wives assume leadership of the criminal enterprise, killing their rivals and paying more attention to local-business owners seeking their protection.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere’s an admirable ruthlessness to the triumvirate’s operation, which also enlists the services of the local assassin/traumatized veteran Gabriel (Domhnall Gleeson) and allies with the Mafia in Brooklyn. A grim procedural on the process of growing and maintaining a racketeering enterprise in 1970s New York could have been fascinating in its own right. But \u003cem\u003eThe Kitchen \u003c/em\u003ecan’t decide whether its protagonists are frightening antiheroes or emboldened pioneers; every victorious musical montage of Kathy, Ruby, and Claire at work dishearteningly seems to suggest the latter.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEach of the leads almost seems to be the star of her own, wildly different film. Kathy, a mother of two whose relationship with her husband was fairly stable, approaches mob life with practicality and stick-to-it-ness, brokering a big construction contract for the unions she controls. This effort entails the harassment of the Hasidic community and quickly escalates to homicide—something the movie shrugs off as the cost of doing business. Ruby has to contend with the racism of her Irish mother-in-law (Margo Martindale) and the suspicion of a community she married into. The film dampens Haddish’s natural comic energy, saddling the actor with a one-dimensionally cruel character who barely has a connection to the other two leads.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePerhaps the strangest story line of all is the one given to Claire, whose vicious and stupid husband abuses her before he’s thrown in jail. Once he’s gone, she links up with Gabriel and quickly takes to his death-dealing ways, shooting rivals on the street with impunity. Her arc is far more lurid than Kathy’s behind-the-scenes wheeling and dealing, and Berloff can’t get the two tones to coexist; dozens of transitions in \u003cem\u003eThe Kitchen \u003c/em\u003eare jarring as a result. Were the film building to a particularly tragic denouement, then the spiraling narrative of three women getting sucked deeper into a life of crime might make more sense.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInstead, \u003cem\u003eThe Kitchen \u003c/em\u003eends on a hopeful note, despite the high body count that has built up along the way. The optimism is baffling and unearned, and it’s made all the odder by the preceding atonality: Some scenes of murder are played for laughs and applause, while others are treated with solemn horror. One character lectures Kathy on the terrible life she’s leading, then comes back later to tell her what a good job she’s doing. I spent most of \u003cem\u003eThe Kitchen\u003c/em\u003e’s running time wondering if the film had been hastily reedited, or cut down from a more sprawling length—anything to explain the chaos playing out on-screen.

Something distinct and deeper is at work. This deeper force explains nearly all of Trump’s most odious and irresponsible comments, not just the racist ones.

Once leftists understand it, they will find it easier to defeat the identitarian right.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"dropcap\"\u003eNo one better anticipated today’s societal divisions than the political psychologist Karen Stenner, author of the 2005 book \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Authoritarian-Dynamic-Cambridge-Political-Psychology-ebook/dp/B00QIT3KXG\"\u003eThe Authoritarian Dynamic\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e. The book built on research literature that distinguishes between “authoritarians,” who prize what Stenner calls “oneness and sameness” so much so that they are prone to support coercion to effect it, and “libertarians,” who not only defend but affirmatively prize diversity and difference. (Those labels are not to be conflated with the popular definitions of the terms.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eStenner began her research with a questionnaire that probed the attitudes of her subjects toward child-rearing. Their answers indicated the extent to which they think that it’s more important for kids to obey their parents, have good manners, be neat and clean, and follow the rules—or alternatively, that it’s more important that they are responsible for their own actions, and creative, curious, independent thinkers who follow their own conscience and show good judgment. Designed to provide an unobtrusive, bare-bones measure of each subject’s fundamental stances toward conformity and difference, the child-rearing questionnaires were scored and the subjects arrayed from most libertarian to most authoritarian. Stenner was most interested in the people who scored at the extreme poles.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eShe thought that both the most extreme authoritarians and the most extreme libertarians have powerful, largely innate and highly durable psychological predispositions that affect how they react to all that is unfamiliar and different. Trying a new cuisine, attending a different faith’s religious service, or carpooling for a week with someone of a different race is energizing, exciting, and engaging for one type of person but leaves the opposite type frightened, even “unhinged.” And she wondered how those predispositions would influence how intolerant (if at all) a person was likely to be when circumstances confronted them with racial \u003cem\u003eor\u003c/em\u003e political \u003cem\u003eor\u003c/em\u003e moral differences.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eTo test her hypothesis, she designed a double-blind study.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eTrained student-interviewers in pairs were randomly assigned to visit the homes of the white people assessed as the most extreme “libertarians” and “authoritarians” (based on their original responses to those child-rearing questions). Some interviewers were African American, others white. They asked the same broad, open-ended questions provided by Stenner, recorded audio of their conversations for later “coding” and analysis, and kept interview logs to document their observations of the encounters, too.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/01/authoritarian-sexism-trump-duterte/576382/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: The new authoritarians are waging war on women\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eNeither interviewers nor subjects knew the true nature and specific purpose of the research nor the psychological profiles of the subjects.

The group whose child-rearing preferences skewed most toward traits of obedience and conformity were less pleasant, less intelligent, angrier, and less open to experience, among other attributes. But I want to focus on the results related to race. If contacted by white interviewers, the “authoritarians” were almost indistinguishable from the “libertarians” in their willingness to schedule a conversation. They proved dramatically more reluctant to participate when contacted by black interviewers.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe authoritarians were more hostile, suspicious, and anxious with black interviewers, whereas “especially given a black interviewer, libertarians were vastly more likely than authoritarians to display great warmth toward their visitors.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWith white interviewers, authoritarians were \u003cem\u003eless\u003c/em\u003e likely than libertarians to introduce talk about “social exclusion, isolation, and disconnection,” but with a black interviewer they were far \u003cem\u003emore\u003c/em\u003e likely, even as libertarians were indifferent to the interviewer’s race. “The language of authoritarians was especially inclusive when it was just ‘us’ talking among ourselves,” Stenner explained, “but they were clearly thinking exclusion when confronting one of ‘them.’”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eAuthoritarians displayed more anxiety, “but their fearfulness and nervousness was far more (and perhaps only) apparent when trying to get through the whole ordeal with a black interview partner listening.” They were far more inclined than libertarians to talk in terms of “us” and “them” when discussing race. They tended to echo negative racial stereotypes. And they were more likely to confess that they disapproved of mixed-race socializing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eRegardless of the interviewers, authoritarians tended to say fewer overall words and fewer different words than libertarians. And the evident differences were greatly magnified in the presence of black interviewers. The sophistication of discussions “tended to diverge by just over one grade level when both interviewers were white,” with authoritarians “talking at almost a fifth-grade level” and libertarians talking “around the sixth-grade level,” Stenner found. “But when forced to engage in conversations with a black primary interviewer, the two characters were as distinct as third and ninth graders in the complexity of their discussions.” Why? \u003cem\u003eThe\u003c/em\u003e crucial distinction between libertarians and authoritarians, Stemmer argued, is that “the former are excited and engaged and the latter frightened and unhinged by difference.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/02/adam-schiff-authoritarianism-threat-democracy/583609/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eAdam Schiff: America must stand as a bulwark against autocracy\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAuthoritarians also proved far less comfortable than libertarians with “the idea that one could be critical of America and Americans while still being a loyal citizen.” They were more inclined to voice the sentiment that Americans ought to “love it or leave it.” They were more likely to become emotional when talking about the American flag. They tended to support right-wing groups that believe there is a “true America” being undermined from within by minorities, political dissidents, and moral decay. And they were more inclined to believe that morality is on the decline.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIndeed, Stenner observed that “fears regarding immorality and crime, claims about the critical need to reestablish some normative order, and elaboration of plans for accomplishing this” occupied the bulk of “their psychic space,” consuming a hugely disproportionate share of their time and energy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"dropcap\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003eUsing “racist” as a shorthand to describe Stenner’s intolerant subjects is inadequate. Remember, they were distinguished eight months prior to being interviewed \u003cem\u003eonly \u003c/em\u003eby how they answered seemingly innocuous questions about child-rearing. The scores on those questionnaires turned out to predict huge differences in their behavior and interactions with interviewers of different races, who recorded their impressions without knowing the predispositions of their interview subjects or Stenner’s hypothesis.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThat’s because their intolerance of difference was much broader than racism, encompassing racial and ethnic out-groups, political dissidents, and people they consider moral deviants. Authoritarians display distinct traits \u003cem\u003eacross very different domains of tolerance\u003c/em\u003e. Stenner added that this intolerance manifests most commonly in demands for broad conformity, typically including “legal discrimination against minorities and restrictions on immigration; limits on free speech, assembly, and association; and the regulation of moral behavior, for example, via policies regarding school prayer, abortion, censorship, and homosexuality, and their punitive enforcement.”  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eAnd she cautioned that “a good deal of what we call racial intolerance is not even primarily about race, let alone blacks, let alone African Americans and their purported shortcomings,” though antiblack, ideological racists do of course exist, and African Americans are harmed regardless of what drives intolerance. “Ultimately,” Stenner contended, “much of what we think of as racism, likewise political and moral intolerance, is more helpfully understood as ‘difference-ism,’” defined as “a fundamental and overwhelming desire to establish and defend \u003cem\u003esome\u003c/em\u003e collective order of oneness and sameness.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/07/ronald-reagans-racist-conversation-richard-nixon/595102/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eTim Naftali: Ronald Reagan’s long-hidden racist conversation with Richard Nixon\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe distinction isn’t merely about word choice. It has critical implications for fighting and easing both racism and other forms of intolerance. For example, in an entirely separate experiment meant to manipulate the way authoritarians viewed “us” and “them,” subjects were told that NASA had verified the existence of alien life––beings “very different from us in ways we are not yet even able to imagine.” After being told that, the measured racial intolerance of authoritarian subjects \u003cem\u003edecreased by half\u003c/em\u003e, a result that suggests a general intolerance of difference that varies with perceptions of otherness, not fixed antagonism against a racial group. Their boundaries (and thus their behavior!) can be swiftly altered, Stenner emphasized, just by this simple cognitive device of creating a “superordinate group”: making “black people look more like ‘us’ than ‘them’ when there are green people afoot.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eUnder these conditions, the authoritarians didn’t only become kinder to black people, Stenner noted; they also became more merciful to criminals—that is, less inclined to want a crackdown on perceived moral deviance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"dropcap\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003eMy thinking about Western politics has been influenced by Stenner’s insight that what she calls “the authoritarian dynamic” provides a better account than mere racism of political conflict “across the seemingly diverse domains of race and immigration, civil liberties, crime and punishment, and of when and why those battles will be the most heated.” And that brings us back to 2019.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo its credit, the left long discerned that there was more racism on the right than many elites in the GOP or the conservative movement understood or wanted to see or admit. But many on the left \u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e the right misunderstand racism in politics because neither quite understands the role of authoritarians.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eMovement conservatives need to face up to the fact that authoritarians have existed across time and societies, and that the left is \u003cem\u003enot\u003c/em\u003e responsible for the racism or bigotry of authoritarians in their electoral coalition, nor for GOP politicians and operatives who cynically pander to them. Authoritarian intolerance is not a response to unfair accusations of racism. It likely stems from a perhaps innate predisposition to prize oneness and sameness that manifests most powerfully under conditions of perceived threat.

She says she loved to use the shared electric scooters from companies like Lime and Bird scattered around town. When those companies raised their prices, though, she started looking into buying her own scooter to save the $6 per trip she was spending. McPherson also used to charge Lime scooters in her apartment to earn a little extra money, but eventually the incentives for that got too low, too. \u0026ldquo;Even though I really love the company, and I think what they\u0026rsquo;re doing is incredible, as a user I want a little bit of a break,\u0026rdquo; she said.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eThe sharing economy was pitched as a way for consumers to give up owning things\u0026mdash;cars, bikes, scooters, clothes, vacation homes, and even\u003c/span\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://onezero.medium.com/the-sharing-economy-was-always-a-scam-68a9b36f3e4b\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003ebooks and movies\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003e, and to share them instead. It quickly caught on. Consumers eschewed buying cars for taking Ubers and Lyfts, switched to shared electric bikes or scooters for their commutes, and even signed up for platforms like Rent the Runway and Le Tote that allowed them to borrow clothes and then send them back, freeing up space in their closets. The number of car-free or car-light households (defined as those with fewer cars than workers) \u003ca href=\"https://www.citylab.com/perspective/2019/01/uber-lyft-make-traffic-worse-more-people-own-cars-transit/579481/\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003egrew\u003c/a\u003e more than 23% in Seattle between 2012 and 2017, 10% in San Francisco, and 7% in Philadelphia, faster than population growth in all of those cities, according to Bruce Schaller, a transportation consultant in New York City. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eBut many of the companies behind those initiatives were financed by massive venture capital (VC) investments.

By his math, it costs scooter companies like Bird $2.55 per mile to rent dockless scooters to customers. Before they raised their prices, these companies were generating just $2.43 in revenue per mile, he says, meaning they will eventually have to raise prices to make money. But as they do, fewer people will use the service.

People are paying about $2.50 a mile when they use ride-sharing companies like Uber and Lyft, estimates Korus. If they buy a car, they are essentially paying 70 cents a mile to go the same distance. Autonomous taxis could lower that cost to 26 cents a mile, because there\u0026#8217;s no driver to pay. Until Uber and Lyft can start offering self-driving cars at a meaningful volume, which could take years, the economics will be difficult. They could shift back to a higher-priced luxury model, like Uber\u0026#8217;s primary offering before the 2012 introduction of UberX. But that would fall well short of the transportation revolution they have promised. \u0026ldquo;Is this a real transportation replacement, or are they just going to take over the black car industry?,\u0026#8221; says White.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe road ahead for scooter- and bike-sharing companies is especially difficult given that the vehicles they offer can now be bought relatively cheaply.\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003e Decent electric scooters can found for around $400, about the same price as a month of twice-daily shared scooter rides. \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eElectric bikes start at about $1,000. \u0026ldquo;In decades past, e-bikes were heavy, had bad range, and were expensive,\u0026rdquo; says Mike Radenbaugh, the CEO of e-bike maker Rad Power Bikes. \u0026ldquo;Now they\u0026rsquo;re light, have fantastic range, and advances in consumer electronics have lowered their price.\u0026rdquo; He says revenues more than doubled in 2018, to $45 million, and that\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003e many of his customers were introduced to electric bikes through sharing programs. Electric bike sales in the U.S. grew 61% over the last year, to $176 million, according to the NPD Group, a research firm.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eCompanies in other businesses have figured out how to hook customers and keep them coming back even as they raise prices. Wireless companies have stopped subsidizing the cost of new phones in recent years, and while growth in smartphone sales has flattened, customers are still spending billions on the devices every year. Federal electric vehicle subsidies expired last year, yet Tesla sold more cars in its most recent quarter than it did during the quarter in which customers were still receiving subsidies.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eAnd some investors are willing to watch public companies lose money for year\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003es if they think they will eventually become profitable. \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eThe classic example is Amazon, which bled money for years as it built out expensive infrastructure to deliver packages in just a few days. Today, there are few investors who, if offered the chance, wouldn\u0026#8217;t go back in time to invest in Jeff Bezos\u0026#8217; \u0026#8220;everything store\u0026#8221; before the company\u0026#8217;s stock price skyrocketed.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eBut the ride-sharing companies are not like Amazon, argues Richard Clayton, research director at CtoW investment group, which works with pension funds sponsored by unions affiliated with the Change to Win federation. Amazon spent money upfront to build an intricate system of warehouses that allowed it to eventually dominate the two-day delivery market. It got customers so accustomed to quick delivery that they became willing to pay more for it. The same may not be true of on-demand scooters.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eShared mobility companies may work in the future \u0026mdash; if they get significant subsidies, says Susan Shaheen, a transportation professor at the University of California, Berkeley. Governments could offer up money, as they do for public transit, she said, or advertisers could contribute in order to get their name associated with the transit. The city of Dublin, California has a program called \u003ca href=\"https://www.wheelsbus.com/godublin/\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003eGoDublin\u003c/a\u003e that pays for half of riders\u0026#8217; Uber or Lyft fares for rides that start and end in Dublin. Meanwhile, CitiBank and Ford sponsor bike-sharing programs in New York and San Francisco, respectively. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eBut those promotions would have to be significant to help make shared mobility companies profitable. Moving people around a city is expensive, which is why public transit is often so heavily subsidized. Nearly every company that has tried to improve upon this subsidized model has failed. During Uber\u0026rsquo;s call Thursday, Khosrowshahi said the company was looking into making its shared ride experiences more efficient, perhaps by piling 10 people into a shared van. But past attempts to do even this without subsidies have faltered. Earlier this year, Chariot, a company owned by Ford that shuttled commuters around a few U.S. cities in shared van routes, abruptly\u003c/span\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/10/18177378/chariot-out-of-business-shuttle-microtransit-ford\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003ewent out\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003e of business. Rides cost up to $5, which paled in comparison to some of the promotions being offered by Uber and Lyft.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd for many consumers, the appeal of Uber, Lyft, and shared bike and scooter services is that they make fewer stops and are more predictable than public transit. Any move that makes ride-sharing more like the bus may turn customers off. Ian Chesal, who gave up on JUMP after the prices went up, says he will occasionally take an Uber or Lyft to work from the subway if he\u0026#8217;s running late. The bus gets stuck in so much traffic that it takes as long as walking.

Ricardo Rosselló right before Rosselló stepped down. The previous secretary of state, who would have been next in line of succession for the governorship, had resigned after being involved in a scandal over vulgar text messages that sparked the protests in Puerto Rico (and also led to Rosselló’s resignation).

The one catch: Pierluisi wasn’t approved by the Senate, although Rosselló argued that the secretary of state did not need legislative approval under a 2005 statute.

It remains to be seen if there’s even a candidate that can receive the approval of both lawmakers and the people at this point.

As of 2016, says US PIRG and KID’s report, only 18 states ban recalled products — like the Rock ’n Play — from child care facilities. For the rest of the country, there’s an accountability lag; recalling companies currently don’t have any other legally required responsibility beyond simply issuing the recall itself. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"n3jPkH\"\u003eGarber believes that should change. “Parents and day cares and caregivers prioritize keeping their kids safe, but can’t do it if they don’t have the necessary information,” he says, adding that the past six months alone have seen a not altogether unusual rash of recalls, from \u003ca href=\"https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2019/Childrens-Toy-Instrument-Sets-Recalled-Due-to-Violation-of-the-Federal-Lead-Paint-Ban-Made-by-Creative-Sto-and-Sold-Exclusively-at-Amazon-com-Recall-Alert\"\u003etoys that contain toxins\u003c/a\u003e to \u003ca href=\"https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2019/Target-Recalls-Wooden-Toy-Vehicles-Due-to-Choking-Hazard\"\u003etoys that pose a choking hazard\u003c/a\u003e.

Says Garber, “This is a good example of a larger hidden danger.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Xrof3a\"\u003eUS PIRG recommends that states without legislation banning recalled products change their laws immediately. But state legislation isn’t known to be a particularly swift or straightforward process, as the \u003ca href=\"https://www.aap.org/en-us/advocacy-and-policy/state-advocacy/Documents/How%20a%20Bill%20Becomes%20a%20Law%20at%20the%20State%20Level.pdf\"\u003eAAP laid out\u003c/a\u003e in its 2009 Advocacy Guide.

In the absence of new legislation, companies like Fisher-Price can — and should, says US PIRG — do more to inform and educate consumers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"WlneM9\"\u003e“Companies collect huge amounts of information on each of us,” says Garber. “They know what I bought, and they use it to target me for more things that they want me to buy. If they’re going to collect all this information about me, whether it’s through a loyalty rewards card program that tracks my purchases and account or for their marketing purposes where they buy this information, they should use that information for good in the world by helping to keep us safe.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"6wSVpk\"\u003eGarber adds that Fisher-Price and others should do a better job of publicizing recalls via social media and direct marketing. Fisher-Price does indeed \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/search?lang=en\u0026amp;q=recall%20(from%3Afisherprice)\u0026amp;src=typed_query\"\u003etweet\u003c/a\u003e out news of recalls, and engages with customers on the platform to answer questions. But \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/5/21/18634323/new-york-times-emotion-based-ad-targeting-sadness\"\u003etargeted ads\u003c/a\u003e could be a more immediate way to reach consumers since, as Garber points out, they can be “eerily accurate.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"85q9qS\"\u003e“Ensuring that consumers are notified of a recall is critical,” Fisher-Price said in a statement provided to Vox, adding that the company takes several steps to alert the public about recalls. In the case of the Rock ‘n Play, Fisher-Price created a \u003ca href=\"https://service.mattel.com/us/recall/BJD57_ivr.asp\"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e translated into nine languages to “centralize information for consumers,” in addition to publishing news of the recall on Twitter and Facebook, and alerting resale companies to “prevent unlawful resales” of the Rock ‘n Play. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"WZUiws\"\u003e“One of the best ways for consumers to ensure they receive notice of a product recall is to register their products when they are purchased or at any time after that — which takes only a few minutes,” said Fisher-Price. When products are recalled, Fisher-Price says it immediately notifies everyone who has registered their product — that is, everyone who takes the time to mail in those white cards that come inside the product packaging, or submit their information and product number online.\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"uOIVa1\"\u003eThe thing is, says Garber, many people don’t. “Most of us look at those [cards] and go, ‘I’m going to fill that out later,’ and then never do because we’re busy, especially if you’re a new parent.” The onus remains on the consumer — and in the case of day cares, relying on product registration means that the burden of responsibility falls on both businesses providing child care and on parents to ask their day cares, essentially, if they’ve seen the news. Fisher-Price also suggests that consumers sign up for product updates on its site, and register for product recall alerts from the CPSC at \u003ca href=\"http://recalls.gov/\"\u003erecalls.gov\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"xx7gt5\"\u003eGovernment agencies are not off the hook, however. The US Consumer Product Safety Commission could demand that these social media and advertising recommendations are essential policies stipulated by recalls, says Garber. US PIRG also advises that the CPSC must work more closely with recalling companies to inform day cares of recalls, and calls on the commission to hold both child care facilities and recalling companies accountable. Adds Garber, “That would go a long way to keeping kids safer.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"i6Yu2K\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://vox.com/goods-newsletter\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSign up for The Goods’ newsletter.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e Twice a week, we’ll send you the best Goods stories exploring what we buy, why we buy it, and why it matters.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"fO2l8h\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","url":"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/8/8/20792192/fisher-price-rock-n-play-recall-infant-deaths-day-care","published":"2019-08-09T16:10:48Z","guid":"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/8/8/20792192/fisher-price-rock-n-play-recall-infant-deaths-day-care"},{"title":"Joe Biden accidentally said “poor kids” are just as bright as “white kids”","content":"\u003cimg alt=\"Presidential Candidates Hit The Soapbox At The Iowa State Fair\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3TNr6P9CNH1OBsZF81F7d14OE5E=/608x0:5472x3648/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/64983195/1166885852.jpg.0.jpg\" /\u003e\n\n  \u003csmall\u003eDemocratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden delivers a 20-minute campaign speech at the Des Moines Register Political Soapbox at the Iowa State Fair. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\u003c/small\u003e\n\n  \u003cp\u003eThe former vice president immediately corrected himself to say “wealthy kids.”\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp id=\"bNYt4u\"\u003eDES MOINES — Campaigning in Iowa, \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/4/25/18185060/joe-biden-2020-presidential-election-campaign-policies\"\u003eJoe Biden\u003c/a\u003e had what has come to be known as a Joe Biden moment, telling a room of minority Iowa voters that “poor kids” are “just as talented as white kids,” before clarifying he meant “wealthy kids” — a gaffe that has since caught fire on social media.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"seJmJC\"\u003e“We have this notion that somehow if you’re poor, you cannot do it.

Just how far can renewables get?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"BbP1Sj\"\u003eAt the heart of the debate is the simple fact that the two biggest sources of renewable energy — wind and solar power — are “variable.” They come and go with the weather and time of day.

When people predict that renewables will fall short of 100 percent, what they are predicting is that we won’t be able to find enough flexibility to accommodate them (at least not fast enough).

Most renewable energy modeling matches the performance of a resource mix against a year or two of weather data on solar and wind availability in particular locations. Trancik’s team chose four locations (Arizona, Iowa, Massachusetts, and Texas) and gathered \u003cem\u003e20 years\u003c/em\u003e of data on them. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"di2xPf\"\u003eIt’s important to test renewable energy over longer time spans. In addition to daily and weekly fluctuations in solar and wind, there can be yearly or even multi-year fluctuations. And indeed, by looking back over 20 years, the team found several rare events in which wind and solar were both unusually low for an unusually long time. These rare events represent a spike in the amount of storage needed. Planning for them substantially increases the cost of a pure-renewables system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ht9Svf\"\u003eFor each of the four states, Trancik’s team modeled a renewables+storage system that has an “equivalent availability factor” (EAF) of 100 percent. That means the system would precisely match supply to demand, providing baseload, intermediate, and peaking power, given real-world resource-availability conditions, in every hour of every day, over 20 years. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"YstPWc\"\u003e(Actually, they did multiple scenarios per state: solar-only, wind-only, an optimized solar-wind mix, and all of those with two different tiers of storage technologies.

Here are the gory details:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp id=\"cjDGFE\"\u003eA cost-optimal wind-solar mix with storage reaches cost-competitiveness with a nuclear fission plant providing baseload electricity at a cost of $0.075/kWh at an energy storage capacity cost of $10-20/kWh. To reach cost- competitiveness with a peaker natural gas plant at $0.077/kWh, energy storage capacity costs must instead fall below $5/kWh (at a storage power capacity cost of $1,000/kW). To provide baseload, intermediate, bipeaker, and peaker electricity at $0.10/kWh with an optimal wind-solar mix, energy storage capacity costs must reach approximately $30–70/kWh, $30v90/kWh, $10–30/kWh, and $10–30/kWh respectively.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"8DvGYM\"\u003eThese are extremely daunting cost targets — not outside the realm of possibility, but well beyond the edge of most mainstream projections.

And a 100 percent EAF is a little crazy anyway; the existing power system is not up and available 100 percent of the time. There are brownouts and blackouts, after all. \u003cem\u003eNo\u003c/em\u003e power system is 100 percent reliable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"fOYlf1\"\u003eTrancik’s team found that if the EAF target is lowered from 100 to 95 percent, the cost target that storage must hit rises to $150/kWh. (More specifically, lowering the EAF reduced the required cost of energy storage by 25 percent for the first tier of storage technologies and 48 percent for the second tier.) That’s a much more tractable number, within reach of existing technologies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"kFvMUr\"\u003eWhy does lowering the EAF so little ease the pressure on storage so much? The explanation is in those rare meteorological events of extended low wind and sun. They don’t happen often over a 20-year span, but building enough storage to deal with them when they do happen makes the last few percent of EAF exponentially more expensive. To lower the EAF to 95 percent is to say, “something else can handle those rare events.” (As to what that something might be, we’ll discuss that later.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"gNtG3B\"\u003eSecond, remember, the team is modeling a system in which storage is doing almost all the flexibility work. In fact, there are \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/8/8/20758519/democratic-debate-qualification-polls-candidates-yang-gabbard\"\u003eother sources of grid flexibility\u003c/a\u003e. My favorite candidate for flexibility dark horse is “\u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/8/7/20754430/renewable-energy-clean-electricity-grid-load-flexibility\"\u003eload flexibility\u003c/a\u003e,” demand-side programs that can shift energy consumption around in time. Another source of flexibility is \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/8/3/17638246/national-energy-grid-renewables-transmission\"\u003eenhanced long-distance transmission\u003c/a\u003e, to carry renewable energy from regions that produce it to regions that need it. Another is dispatchable renewables like run-of-the-river hydro and advanced geothermal. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"U3dOOy\"\u003eAll of those sources of flexibility will grow and help to smooth out renewables. Storage won’t have to do all the work on its own. That, too, should ease the price pressure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"0UgRVQ\"\u003eThird, a renewables+storage system also gets easier if \u003cem\u003erenewables\u003c/em\u003e get cheaper. The numbers that Trancik’s team use for renewables are quite conservative. (For instance, $1/Watt solar costs are already being beat routinely in the US.) If renewable energy continues to defy expectations and plunge in cost, it would become cheaper and easier to oversize renewables and curtail the excess energy. That in turn would ease pressure on storage. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"4aCHT9\"\u003eIn short, the headline $20/kWh cost target for energy storage is almost certainly more stringent than what will be required in the real world. Even the $150/kWh target required for an EAF of 95 percent is likely too stringent. In the real world, storage will be assisted by other forms of grid flexibility like long-distance transmission, load flexibility, and microgrids, along with regulatory and legislative reforms. And renewables will probably continue to get cheaper faster than anyone predicts.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"GMtC32\"\u003eSo let’s call the target $150-$200, or thereabouts.

Roughly speaking, power capacity refers to how fast you can get energy out of it, measured in kW; energy capacity refers to how much energy you can store in it, measured in kWh. Each is priced separately, power capacity costs and energy capacity costs. The latter is the number we’ve been using for targets (I’ll explain why in a sec).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"4cVcps\"\u003eRemember how the study divides storage technologies into two tiers? Tier one technologies were modeled with high power capacity costs ($1,000/kW) and low energy capacity costs ($20/kWh). They include things like pumped hydro, compressed-air storage (CAES), and some proposed flow batteries, which use cheap and abundant elements dissolved in large volumes of water to store energy. They tend to have lower energy density than tier two technologies, but because of their low energy capacity costs, they are good for long-term grid storage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Y2rxjz\"\u003eTier two technologies were modeled with relatively lower power capacity costs ($700/kW) and higher energy capacity costs ($150/kWh). They include things like further advanced lithium-ion batteries, other battery chemistries, flywheels, and supercapacitors that are more suited to short-duration, high-power applications like, say, vehicles or appliances. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"hP5z6C\"\u003eThe overall levelized cost of energy storage (LCOSE) in the system “shows a higher sensitivity to storage energy capacity costs than to storage power capacity costs,” mainly because optimally sized systems need a \u003cem\u003elot\u003c/em\u003e of storage, enough to run between 6 and 180 hours at a time, depending on the system and location. That means the low energy capacity costs of long-term storage are prized; that’s why they are used in the study as targets. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"i2RXyu\"\u003eSo, with this information in our back pocket, let’s look at how storage technologies are coming along (this is worth a much longer post, but consider this a snapshot).

All the responses are perfect, but here are some highlights: \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli id=\"WyR8a3\"\u003e“It’s about living my best life, feeling like a bad man and doing what I have to do.

There’s a \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/3/20/16955588/feminism-waves-explained-first-second-third-fourth\"\u003ethird-wave feminist\u003c/a\u003e tilt, in the sense that women having sex and making money without shame — basically, activities men have been allowed to do forever — can be considered feminist acts. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"NRWpfw\"\u003eFinally, there’s the liberation of the speaker unabashedly calling themselves “hot” as a way of ownership over both their appearance and the meaning of the word. We know what a “hot girl” looks like in a traditional sense, of course, but the joy of hot girl summer is that it’s inclusive. Sure, plenty of women whom mainstream culture would label “traditionally hot” are posting photos of themselves with the caption “hot girl summer,” but many are using it subversively or ironically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"D4mb3u\"\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"\u003e\n\u003cp lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003eme trying to have a hot girl summer \u003ca href=\"https://t.co/i0PK9uY93k\"\u003epic.twitter.com/i0PK9uY93k\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e— bhald bhabie (@dollyxparton) \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/dollyxparton/status/1144360570487005184?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"\u003eJune 27, 2019\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cscript async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"gMv9EZ\"\u003eWhy am I seeing it everywhere?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"t7g1lN\"\u003eHot girl summer is a play on themes people on the internet are always talking about: being a girl, being hot, and summertime.

And although people often use the terms interchangeably, being cheap and being frugal are not one and the same. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"7x5P4i\"\u003eCheapskates are close-fisted. Cost is their bottom line, and they prioritize their penny-pinching spending habits over quality, value, and time. They’ll invite you over for dinner and then \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2018/10/12/17959636/venmo-etiquette\"\u003eVenmo you\u003c/a\u003e for your share of the groceries, calculated to the penny, the next day.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"jHKh82\"\u003eFrugal people like me, on the other hand, enjoy spending money. They just want to maximize that money to reach their personal goals and reduce stress. Frugality doesn’t mean compromising quality or neglecting your social life. It’s about making smart choices — I buy clothes secondhand, opt for generic store brands, and scope out free fitness classes over pricey gym memberships. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Y6JWsn\"\u003eOver time, I’ve learned that embracing a thriftier lifestyle and learning more about financial literacy benefits not just me but my greater community. In simpler living, I’ve been able to reduce clutter and be more environmentally friendly and less wasteful. Shopping thrift stores and consignment, for example, allows me to reuse and enjoy clothing while decreasing my carbon footprint and landfill waste, and supporting local businesses and deserving charities such as Goodwill and the Salvation Army. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ygxnSb\"\u003eAlso, by maintaining long-term goals, I’ve been able to adopt a more balanced view of spending. I’ve learned that if I have self-discipline, I will reap the long-term benefits: I control my budget, and not the other way around. And though striking a healthy balance between my needs, wants, and bank account hasn’t always been easy, the spending practices I’ve adopted now allow me to afford the things I care most about. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"8jnHfB\"\u003eBeing frugal is a lifestyle choice that doesn’t happen overnight. I asked two experts for helpful tips on becoming more frugal, without resorting to being cheap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"0JX97q\"\u003eHave the right mindset\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"VhMbVi\"\u003eAdopting frugality can be intimidating at first. After all, thinking about money, debt, and planning for the future can often leave people stressed and anxious. Money management requires discipline, and sometimes people can feel burned out before they even begin. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ftKirN\"\u003e“It’s really easy ... for people to be intimidated and overwhelmed by the uphill battle,” says Jamila Souffrant, the creator of the financial blog and podcast \u003ca href=\"https://www.journeytolaunch.com/\"\u003eJourney to Launch\u003c/a\u003e. “You want to do right and make the best decision, but often we get too far ahead of ourselves when really we just need a place to start.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Oh65WH\"\u003eSouffrant recommends looking at this lifestyle change not as a burden or a punishment, but rather an opportunity to approach with positivity and intention. Enjoy the financial and emotional rewards of being thrifty: Instead of leaning on others to help subsidize your costs, you’ll be able to contribute your fair share and be more generous with others. And as you experience greater financial independence, you’ll gain a sense of confidence and achievement.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"jqe8Wl\"\u003eA lot of people try to wait for the perfect moment, timing, or situation, where everything falls into place, to “make movements and improvements,” Souffrant says, but sometimes all it takes is one simple step forward. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"WAz2at\"\u003eOne step spenders can take to start shifting their money outlook is to acknowledge and forgive past financial mistakes. Coming into this journey from a place of pride and empowerment, rather than a place of shame and doubt, can allow room for better practices and help keep you on track.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"RXTgOG\"\u003eSouffrant says financial books, money podcasts, and online savings groups can provide positive reinforcement and help you build confidence and financial literacy. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"W4Ufoh\"\u003eShe also says that adopting conscious, intentional cost-saving habits, like skipping your daily \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/4/9/18296792/starbucks-habit-millennials-money\"\u003eStarbucks coffee\u003c/a\u003e or making your own avocado toast at home, can cultivate a healthier attitude toward money. It’s an argument that’s become controversial recently — critics have pointed out that traditional schools of personal finance, à la Suze Orman, put \u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/04/08/why-do-we-believe-americans-spend-too-much-money-coffee-avocado-toast/?utm_term=.de90747171c7\"\u003eundue shame and pressure\u003c/a\u003e on people to cut out small personal indulgences \u003ca href=\"https://slate.com/business/2016/05/the-latte-is-a-lie-and-buying-coffee-has-nothing-to-do-with-debt-an-excerpt-from-helaine-olens-pound-foolish.html\"\u003ewith little evidence\u003c/a\u003e that it will lead to real wealth. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"uA4dDm\"\u003eBut Souffrant points out that even though making coffee at home isn’t your ticket to overnight riches, it still makes a difference. “While saving a dollar or two on coffee isn’t going to make you a millionaire overnight, these small, practical, money-saving actions will help you make more conscious spending decisions in other, bigger areas of your life,” she says. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"oKFuYj\"\u003eFigure out what you’re working with \u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"lIaJrN\"\u003eOne of the simplest, cheapest, and most effective ways to curb your spending is to track your daily expenses in a journal over the course of a month. “It’s something that nobody wants to do ... but most people don’t have any idea what they’re making and spending,” says \u003ca href=\"https://danielsolin.com/\"\u003eDaniel R. Solin\u003c/a\u003e, a best-selling author of the \u003cem\u003eSmartest\u003c/em\u003e series of financial how-to books. A firm grasp of your finances is empowering and makes controlling your spending easier. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"iJ8gt9\"\u003eWith credit cards, online shopping, and recurring direct debits, it can be easy to spend money on various things without a second thought. The cumbersome task of recording every single expenditure compels people to be more aware of the amounts they are spending, which leads to smarter and less impulsive purchases. “People learn what it truly means to live within their means,” says Solin. There are plenty of personal finance tools and budget apps available, such as\u003ca href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mint-personal-finance-money/id300238550\"\u003e Mint\u003c/a\u003e,\u003ca href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ynab-you-need-a-budget/id1010865877\"\u003e YNAB (You Need a Budget)\u003c/a\u003e, and even an Excel spreadsheet that can help you manage your funds, keep on track, and alert you when you overspend. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"koSdJu\"\u003eAutomating your finances to directly distribute your paycheck where it needs to go — toward bills, insurance, emergency funds, and savings accounts, like your 401(k) — can help you stick to your budget. “Make sure the mandatory things in life are paid off first,” says Souffrant. “You never know what’s going to happen and you always want to be prepared.” Once you have those protective mechanisms in place and your basic needs are met, you’re freer to spend discriminately.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Gviu3q\"\u003eOf course, we’re all here because the goal is to spend less. Using a debit card or carrying cash can also help you avoid spending haphazardly and promote positive long-term spending habits. Another way to curtail spontaneous splurges, like a late-night online shopping spree at Sephora, is to delete saved credit card information from web browsers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"GOP7HI\"\u003eEmbracing a frugal lifestyle isn’t about abandoning your interests or declining all invitations that come your way, but rather being selective, and cutting back without cutting out the things that bring you the most joy. “It’s all about balance,” says Souffrant. “It’s more about adopting a disciplined mindset and flexing your savings muscle than it is about [consistently] cutting corners.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"Gyn490\"\u003eBe honest with your loved ones\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ONk5nt\"\u003eWhen I started budgeting, I found myself turning down invitations to dine out with friends. Instead of admitting the truth — that a dinner out was simply out of my price point — I would make excuses, saying I was unavailable, sick, or stuck at the office late with work, to avoid uncomfortable conversations. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"lrZaAU\"\u003eBut telling little lies to stick to my budget just stressed me out. I’m far from alone. The FINRA Foundation’s \u003ca href=\"https://www.usfinancialcapability.org/\"\u003eNational Financial Capability Study\u003c/a\u003e recently found that that 55 percent of millennials said that discussing their finances made them anxious. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"o65J7B\"\u003eAs challenging as it is, talking about money with friends and family is necessary if you want your budget and relationships to prosper. Instead of feigning a cold or making some other excuse, decline the invitation graciously and say that you’d love to attend but you’re following a strict budget at the moment. Or simply say you won’t be able to make it but hope they enjoy the event. You don’t have to give a reason. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"zmb4EF\"\u003e“It’s so refreshing when people are honest,” says Solin. “Having the confidence to say, ‘I don’t have the budget to do that,’ and, ‘I wish I could attend, but I can’t,’ helps you resist unnecessary pressure and avoid pretending to be someone that you’re not.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"L72SsS\"\u003eSouffrant agrees. “Sharing your goals and being open, honest, and upfront with your friends and family will not only help them understand your journey, but it may encourage [them to help] you to stay on track and carry the weight,” she says. People who love you want to see you succeed and won’t undermine your ability to do so.

On a crest in 1945, it was at its widest ever, but after hitting a trough, within twenty years it stood liquidated. Imperial Britain had interests across the globe with India occupying centre stage. It was imperative that Britain follow an agenda that met its strategic requirements when its withdrawal from India became imminent. Was it not in Britain’s strategic interest to partition India? Was it also not in its interest that the NWFP and Baluchistan, the two frontier provinces of India, join Pakistan? Why then, even after seven decades of India’s independence, do we still question the inevitability of partition? What were the British strategic considerations?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn February 1946, the India Office in London had circulated an important paper to a select few, like Sir Stafford Cripps and AV Alexander, on the subject of the viability of Pakistan. The paper was based on the assumption that Kalat (a substantial part of Baluchistan) and the NWFP would opt for Pakistan. In the February 1946 provincial elections, the NWFP had returned a Congress ministry to power. The provincial legislature had a comfortable Congress majority. Elections in the provinces had just concluded. It could reasonably and comfortably be assumed that the Congress ministry would last its tenure. So then why would a Congress-governed province opt for Pakistan? Or were the India Office mandarins confident of their ability to change the destiny of the NWFP? In their forecast, however, the British officials were not off the mark. What they perceived to be theoretically possible could well turn into reality with the help of the NWFP governor and the provincial bureaucracy. After all, the NWFP had never much been run along popular lines. Governor George Cunningham ruled the province during the World War II years (1939-45), even though both the Congress and the Muslim League got a chance to form ministries. Baluchistan, bordering Persia and the sea and therefore strategically very important, proved a far easier game for the British.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=\"pull-quote\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"quote-line\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWhy was the India Office then assuming that the NWFP, a Congress-ruled province, would opt for Pakistan?\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"quote-line\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e The idea mooted in the India Office paper was of at least two Pakistans with no federal union, however loose. The paper was essentially an exercise in assessing the consequences of this division. If India’s economic unity broke, so would the largest free trade area in the world. Calcutta was predicted to emerge as a major bone of contention between India and Pakistan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePunjab had long enjoyed prosperity because of its predominance in the army and military. At the time World War II broke out, the Punjab had long enjoyed prosperity because of its predominance in the army and military. At the time World War II broke out, the There weren’t any prominent industrial or manufacturing areas in either wing of Pakistan. Karachi (a port city in Pakistan) would be the only port of importance in West Pakistan. In the east, Chittagong (Bangladesh’s main seaport and its second-largest city) remained an indifferent port served only by a metre-gauge railway. There was no noticeable railhead except for the one at Lahore. The two divisions of Pakistan were only to be connected by sea, a two or three weeks’ voyage, as long as no hostile power commanded the Indian Ocean. The military commitments and priorities of West and East Pakistan differed greatly. A Soviet-aided Iran, the frontiers with Afghanistan, and the Soviet threat were all serious concerns that the armed forces in West Pakistan would have to contend with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe paper laid special emphasis on assessing the requirements of the armed personnel, including air force squadrons, necessary to resist tribal and Afghan aggression. This requirement was in addition to the forces needed for aiding civil power. The war potential of Russia being immense, an estimate of the force needed by Pakistan to defeat a Soviet-aided Afghanistan was pointless. Strategically, Pakistan would not be safe even with bases in Afghanistan and Iran. Karachi, its one link with the outside world, stood exposed to air attacks and invasions from the sea. The single line of railway between Karachi and Multan the sole means of communication between Karachi and Punjab—faced similar dangers. Lahore, the rail centre, was well within effective bombing range of Afghan/Persian airfields. Western Pakistan lacked the strategic depth necessary to enable the main bases to be located out of the effective range of enemy bombers. This factor assumed crucial importance because the mountainous NWFP could be an obstacle to the efficient functioning of radars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe paper further contended that the experience of the two World Wars showed that the Bengalis and the Assamese did not make for good soldiers. The 60,000 Bengali Muslims recruited in World War II were assigned mostly to military labour. As for the Assamese Muslims, only 3,000 had been enlisted. The inhabitants of Sindh and Baluchistan (in West Pakistan) were omitted from the list of potential manpower, as they, even more than the Bengalis and the Assamese, did not take to army life. It was left to Punjab and the NWFP to provide the manpower necessary to meet the needs of a Pakistani army. Punjabi Muslims and Pathans lagged behind in education and it was highly doubtful whether the technical needs of the Pakistani army could be met without a prospective scheme of training, which was both time-consuming and expensive. Nor could Pakistan produce a sufficient number of officers necessary for a large army. Assistance from the United Kingdom would, therefore, certainly be required in the form of technical help and training. This shortage of officers and technicians was to affect the air force more seriously than the army. It was difficult to assemble more than one squadron for Pakistan from within the Royal Indian Air Force. The formation of the Pakistan Air Force was to be a slow and laborious business. An almost complete lack of industry in Pakistan was militarily as serious as the shortage of officers and technicians. Practically everything needed for the clothing and equipment of the Pakistan armed forces would have to be imported.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=\"pull-quote\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"quote-line\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWithout strong allies, West Pakistan could not be defended against Russia.

Britain desperately needed a foothold in the Indian subcontinent where it could legitimize its presence as an ally of the newly created state of Pakistan. Leaders of the movement for Pakistan also appreciated the expediency of a British presence in the state. What could a militarily weak Pakistan do but allow British presence on its soil for a substantial period of time? It suited Britain to partition India. Apart from enabling Britain to sustain its position in the Middle East, the creation of the two dominions of India and Pakistan within the British Commonwealth also allowed for a continuity of sorts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eExcerpted from Raghvendra Singh’s \u003c/em\u003eIndia\u0026#8217;s Lost Frontier \u003cem\u003ewith the permission from Rupa Publications\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eWe welcome your comments at \u003ca href=\"mailto:ideas.india@qz.com\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eideas.india@qz.com\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://qz.com/india/1684372/why-the-india-pakistan-partition-suited-the-british-empire/","published":"2019-08-09T08:00:02Z","guid":"https://qz.com/1684372/auto-draft/"},{"title":"The controversial role of private military and security companies in Africa","content":"\u003cimg width=\"1024\" height=\"577\" src=\"https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/RTR4UPRZ-e1565335998190.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;w=1024\" class=\"attachment-medium_10 size-medium_10 wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" /\u003e\u003cp\u003ePrivate military and security companies have been regular fixtures in conflicts across the globe.

These were pivotal in providing Executive Outcomes the best opportunity to regain territory from the Revolutionary United Front while training the Sierra Leone military.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the simultaneous presence of each of the companies is not indicative of competition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe also found that although hiring the companies shifted the balance of power in the government’s favour by 1996, the conflict \u003ca href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/000203970904400305\"\u003ewouldn’t end completely until 2002\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur qualitative assessment highlighted that, instead of the companies helping to bring the conflict to an end, the same data could actually indicate that they simply managed its intensity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis analysis underscores the need to really come to grips with the concept of effectiveness of private military and security companies. It also suggests that more work needs to be done on uncovering insights on contract terms and conditions, however aspirational a task.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eConclusions\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe are not suggesting that private military and security companies should be avoided. They have proven to be useful alternatives for organisations such as the \u003ca href=\"https://www.dcaf.ch/sites/default/files/publications/documents/SSR_PAPER3.pdf\"\u003eUN and the World Food Programme\u003c/a\u003e. Rather, our analysis points to the need to fully understand the intricacies of their interactions – not only with the entities that contract them, but with one another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is particularly important in Africa. Foreign investment by both Russia and China is likely to see an increase in private military and security companies hired to protect their investments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis might increase security in the region. But depending on the terms of the contracts and the clients these organisations are accountable to, it may not be in the best interests of the states where they operate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition, a more complete understanding of the roles undertaken by private military and security companies during conflict is necessary to fully understand their effects on conflict dynamics, including duration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRecent work has moved in this direction with event datasets like the \u003ca href=\"http://psed.siecenter.du.edu/\"\u003ePrivate Security Event Database\u003c/a\u003e. This provides information on where these companies operate, their clients and the services they provide. Though real time information on contracts and events is likely to prove difficult to get, using historical datasets like this can increase our understanding of their influence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor governments, the expanding list of services in an increasingly globalized market allows for greater opportunity to fill real or perceived gaps in security. In certain cases, private military and security companies may be used to insulate a regime from collapse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegardless of the reasons, the interactions between the companies and the influence they have on conflict and stability will continue to be important.\u003c!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

It enlivens me. My family swears by Darjeeling tea,” says the 51-year-old homemaker from Kolkata in West Bengal, the second-largest tea producing state in India and home to the much loved Darjeeling tea gardens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut something is amiss lately, feels Majumder. According to her, the \u0026#8220;champagne of teas\u0026#8221; is losing its original taste and aroma. “Darjeeling tea doesn’t seem to have the sensory appeal as it used to do earlier. I don’t know what it is but something is missing,” she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMajumder might be clueless about the reason but she’s right about her favourite tea not being the same anymore. Researchers believe climate change has tampered with the well-recognised flavour for which Darjeeling tea is treasured across the globe.

Strong winds, frequent frost, hail, and excessive rainfall have become detrimental to the production of high-quality tea. The reduction in sunshine hours and infestation of different types of insect pests and diseases has also impacted the tea quality and the quantity,” says Mrityunjoy Choubey, senior scientific officer, DTR\u0026amp;DC, Tea Board, Kurseong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe reason of reduction in yield may not be solely due to climatic change but there are other drivers such as switching over to inorganic from organic cultivation practices, age of tea bushes, soil erosion that could be the behind the gradual declining in production of Darjeeling Tea in general and DTR\u0026amp;DC in particular, said the study.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eMitigation\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s not all gloom and doom, though, for tea-lovers. Researchers at the DTR\u0026amp;DC are working on new planting materials (tea clones) that would not only be resistant to climate change but would also ensure that there is no change in the flavour of Darjeeling tea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The purpose was to find the clones that would be at par or better with the best clones and overcome the challenges of climate change. We have zeroed on in 3-4 vegetative clones that are stress-tolerant and deal with the issues plaguing the Darjeeling tea. We are planning to release them in the tea gardens. We are hopeful that it would be a huge hit in the coming future and overcome climate issues,” Choubey added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdditionally, a tea genome sequencing project involving six partner institutions to develop climate-resilient tea plantation methods using the latest molecular tools and techniques is also on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eGood news for growers as well\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExperts insist that the superior quality of clones would also be beneficial for growers. “It would enhance quality and production and thus growers would get more returns,” says Biswajit Bera, director (research), Tea Board India, adding the agency is also studying soil microbiology to improve soil fertility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTea Board India is a government agency representing different sections of the tea industry. The board is also working on in-situ conservation in the hills in order to preserve local seeds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We have found that planters bring clones from Assam because they are drought-resistant but compromise quality in the bargain. So, we are prioritising local seeds so that consumers get the real taste of Darjeeling tea and this way we also preserve the Darjeeling tea strain,” Bera said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdditionally, a tea genome sequencing project involving six partner institutions to develop climate-resilient tea plantation methods using the latest molecular tools and techniques is also underway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTea growers couldn’t be happier, having borne the brunt of climate change on the Darjeeling tea market. “We witnessed an overproduction of 30-40% of Darjeeling tea in April this year due to erratic weather. But the quality of overproduced tea is rubbish and failed to attract foreign buyers. The uneven rainfall in March led to free flush, resulting in poor quality because the labour shortage delayed the plucking periods,” says Sumon Majumder, general manager (export and marketing), Darjeeling Impex, which runs the Namring tea estate, one of the largest tea gardens in Darjeeling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eManpower shortage has hit the industry hard because of, among other reasons, the lack of interest of the educated, younger generation of pluckers who find better employment in other professions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven the dearth of pluckers, cutters (shears which are used to cut roses, so cutters can be replaced) are used which impact the quality to some extent. The labour shortage has also increased the tea plucking rounds, from seven days to 10-12 days. Importantly, it is the first time in the 165-year-old history because of the large scale absenteeism of the workers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFurther, the sale of Darjeeling tea has fallen because people are not drinking too much tea due to the excessive heat and humidity this year, explained Majumder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe market is still reeling from the \u003ca href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/food/fund-starved-darjeeling-tea-companies-face-an-existential-crisis/articleshow/63197551.cms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"\u003ethree-month long statehood agitation\u003c/a\u003e in 2017 in the Darjeeling hills that virtually shut down the area for 104 days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The major foreign buyers, like Japan and Germany, procured tea from other countries such as Nepal during the agitation. They still have the old stock and have clearly told us that it would take at least another year before they buy tea from us. Exporters have also incurred losses,” Majumder adds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003ePlains mirror the hills\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClimate change has hit tea gardens in the plains too, wreaking havoc on the tea-growing areas in the Dooars and Terai plains in West Bengal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pest infestation has increased due to climate change. Tea mosquito bugs (\u003cem\u003eHelopeltis \u003c/em\u003esp.) and looper caterpillars (\u003cem\u003eAchaea janata\u003c/em\u003e) have been destroying the tea gardens. Erratic heavy rains have stripped the soil of fertility,” says A Babu, deputy director and senior principal scientist, Tea Research Association, North Bengal, adding that measures are being taken to prevent further damage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShade trees are being planted to protect the tea bushes from direct rays of the sun and preserve moisture in the soil. Organic tea cultivation is also being promoted to deal with climate change. “We have also developed two clones (TV-34 and TV-35) that can withstand climate issues and also retain the same flavour in the produce,” adds Babu.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cool weather conditions in hills act as a barrier for pests infestation but the hot and humid conditions lead to their intrusion. The erratic rainfall caused by climate change takes away the fertility of the topsoil and exposes hard rocks. Organic farming is useful because it involves vegetative munching using vermicompost that helps to maintain the temperature of the plant even in excessively humid conditions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut experts rue that most tea garden owners are yet to wake up to the realities of climate change. Pranab Kumar Biswas, who runs the Centre for Mitigation of Climate Change and Global Warming in Siliguri, says that there has been 17.6% departure of rainfall from 1901 to 2015, based on his climate study spanning a hundred years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis story was originally published on \u003ca href=\"https://india.mongabay.com/2019/08/can-climate-resilient-clones-save-darjeeling-tea/?utm_source=Mongabay+India\u0026amp;utm_campaign=6ac6485b1d-RSS_DailyUpdate_CAMPAIGN\u0026amp;utm_medium=email\u0026amp;utm_term=0_7953c9bb60-6ac6485b1d-80610523.\"\u003eMongabay-India. \u003c/a\u003eWe welcome your comments at \u003ca href=\"mailto:ideas.india@qz.com\"\u003eideas.india@qz.com\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://qz.com/india/1684339/indian-scientists-work-on-climate-change-resilient-darjeeling-tea/","published":"2019-08-09T07:22:28Z","guid":"https://qz.com/1684339/auto-draft/"},{"title":"One woman is transforming libraries to make lifelong readers out of Indian children","content":"\u003cimg width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_2710-e1564541042676.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;w=1024\" class=\"attachment-medium_10 size-medium_10 wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" /\u003e\u003cp\u003eDalbir Kaur Madan is on a mission to make lifelong readers out of children.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2011, she set up the One Up library and bookstore in Amritsar, in the north Indian state of Punjab, with that view. “I also realised that there were limited public spaces for children. The only options were the shopping malls,” she told Quartz.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat began as a physical space gradually evolved into a larger project to breathe new life into school libraries. Madan began consulting with schools in the city and signed up for numerous courses in pedagogy and learning methodologies in New York.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile there are several new initiatives that are trying to engage children and offer them alternatives to smartphones and gadgets, Madan’s consultation projects with schools is unique. A school’s library can often be a static space, and no new books may be added to the shelves for years. When Madan works with a school, she helps it design reading programmes and an ever-expanding, comprehensive list of books.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a successful run in Amristar, she moved to New Delhi and set up the One Up children’s library in the affluent neighbourhood of Vasant Vihar in 2017. Through this space, Madan helps children as young as 7 months to build a relationship with books.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe has also helped institute one of the first awards that recognises school librarians. Quartz spoke to Madan about her journey from a bookstore owner to a champion of the library.

But my children always grew up around books and our conversations, even today, often start with, “So what book are you reading right now?” I thought if my family reads this way, I’m sure everyone else does too. With that in mind, I set up the library expecting it to be an immediate success.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I realised that people don’t really read or encourage others to read. A lot of people want to read but they don’t know how to pick up that habit. It was hard to sell the concept of a library when I first set up One Up. This is also because people don’t see the value in books and simply look at them as some sort of bargaining commodities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow did you get involved with school libraries?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter I set up the library in 2011, I realised there was something broken within the system, and that I needed to go back to the schools. When I started visiting schools in Amritsar, Jalandhar, Chandigarh, Mumbai and Delhi, I realised libraries had not changed from the time I had left school. They still remained centres of issuing and returning books, though some tried to be slightly progressive and do a few things here and there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the end of the day, a school’s library was as good as the person it was blessed with. Principals and librarians would sometimes display great ambition, but I felt the library spaces weren’t empowered to think differently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis led me to speak to school heads and to work with them to develop reading programmes as part of the curriculum. I wanted to help schools and parents change the way they nurtured their readers. When children come to a school at 3 years, they are curious, they are readers and they want to read. But how do we ensure that when those children step out of the school at 18 years, they continue to be readers?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow is your library different from a traditional library?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eResearch suggests that if a parent reads out aloud to their children for 15 minutes every day, up to the age of 3, a child can develop a subconscious vocabulary of 157,000 words. A research in the US says that there can be up to a 30-million word gap between kids born into a family that reads or where parents read aloud to the child, and those who don’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo ours is a library where facilitators read out to children. We encourage the parents of our members to accompany them and read out to the toddlers themselves. As the children grow older, they not only develop a thirst for reading but also the stamina to stay focused. What I try to emphasise through One Up is the fact that reading—like any other activity or hobby—needs practice and focus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also try to keep parents engaged so that reading truly becomes a habit for a child. For instance, we have fun competitions where we tell parents to send us photos of their children reading on vacation.

She was a librarian at the American Embassy School in New Delhi and was a huge guiding force for One Up to become what it is today.

The \u003ca href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/hgp/description\"\u003eHuman Genome Project\u003c/a\u003e was completed back in 2003, after all. That’s quite an achievement: In less than 20 years, we have progressed from the first draft of a single human genome to being able to easily and cheaply sequence the genome of any interested individual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis gives us the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the biosphere and will allow us to harness microbes for all kinds of purposes. Very soon, for instance, genome sequencing and analysis will become an integral part of a standard medical check-up and enable personalized medicine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, all this will only happen if we master the analysis of the deluge of data we’re creating. And that might be a bigger challenge than sequencing all the genomes themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe history of genome sequencing\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe genomic revolution started in 1995 when J Craig Venter’s team at the Institute for Genome Research published the first genome sequences of two tiny, humble bacteria: \u003cem\u003eHaemophilus influenzae \u003c/em\u003eand \u003cem\u003eMycoplasma genitalium\u003c/em\u003e. Since then, the accumulation of genome sequences of many life forms—from bacteria to fungi to plants to animals (including, of course, \u003cem\u003eHomo sapiens\u003c/em\u003e)—has \u003ca href=\"http://gregoryzynda.com/ncbi/genome/python/2014/03/31/ncbi-genome.html\"\u003egrown exponentially\u003c/a\u003e. Thanks to the startling advances of metagenomics—whereby researchers sequence all DNA from a particular environmental sample, without isolating organisms and growing them in the laboratory—we’re closer to achieving our goal of total genomic understanding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese sequencing methods have made a prospect realistic that, until now, would have be considered sheer fantasy: decoding the language that makes up the entire diversity of life on earth. This does not mean that literally all unique genomes will be sequenced, however: The number of species on Earth is unknown, but current estimates point to \u003ca href=\"https://www.nature.com/news/2011/110823/full/news.2011.498.html\"\u003eseveral million species of eukaryotes\u003c/a\u003e (organisms with complex cells containing a nucleus, like ourselves or fungi), and perhaps \u003ca href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/113/21/5970\"\u003eseveral billion of species of prokaryotes\u003c/a\u003e (organisms with simple cells like bacteria). However, a collection of representative genomes for all existing species seems a realistic goal—and for some particularly important species, including humans, there will be not one but thousands, if not millions, of representative genome sequences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, what? What could—and should—we do with all that genomic data that stores the information of all organisms on earth?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do we do with the data?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo begin with, we will know the entire range of biodiversity on Earth. This will allow reconstruction of the biochemical networks that define the functioning of every ecosystem and will eventually allow us to manipulate ecology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnprecedented, deep understanding of the evolution of life will become possible as well. Complete knowledge of the history of life is unachievable because we will never have access to extinct evolutionary intermediates, but reconstruction by comparison of extant genomes will yield detailed information on these long-gone life forms. This might seem a somewhat abstract goal, but “\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_in_Biology_Makes_Sense_Except_in_the_Light_of_Evolution\"\u003eNothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution.”\u003c/a\u003e Such understanding will revolutionize biological science.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnalysis of the complete genomic database will also enable understanding of the emergence of pathogenic bacteria and viruses. The relevance of such advances in this case is obvious—what if we could predict and control potential viral outbreaks?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the most immediate value will be a complete catalog of all the proteins genes encode. Scientists are already well aware of the most abundant genes and proteins (think, for instance, of hemoglobin, which fills our blood and allows us to breathe). However, there is a huge mass of rare ones that could prove fascinating and, in quite a few cases, very useful for various technologies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, CRISPR. The recent identification of this relatively rare gene is a perfect example of this type of protein discovery.

Even though we live in an information-dominated era, the principal bottleneck lies in the area of algorithms and computing power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe computational power of human civilization keeps growing exponentially, but the amount of data we are generating grows even faster. And algorithms are struggling to keep up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThink of it this way: The more genomes we sequence, the more time is required to compare each genome sequence to each other. When the computation required to do this grows proportionally to the square of the number of sequences, this basic task becomes insurmountable quite quickly. This deeper problem plagues genome research even today, and will become central in all genome analysis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUp to now, all true achievements of genome analysis, be it inference of key evolutionary events or discovery of new enzymes for genome editing, have been driven by a combination of automatic computation and human expertise. This approach is being challenged and will become completely impractical in the new era of total sequencing. Because of the sheer number of sequenced genomes, all analysis will have to be fully automated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf this sounds like a call for replacement of human expertise with artificial intelligence, it is. To master the giga-databases of the future, new generations of AI are essential, as is hardware such as quantum computers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSequencing the entire range of Earth’s biodiversity is not a pipe dream anymore. In fact, it might become tangible reality within the lifetime of the current generation of scientists. However, to turn this wealth of data into valuable information that can help society, as opposed to useless noise, tremendous—and not entirely foreseeable—advances in computer science and technology are essential.

When the ride-hail company went public in late March, it had a \u003ca href=\"https://qz.com/1563655/lyft-ipo-filing-shows-a-history-of-losses-and-no-clear-path-to-profitability/\"\u003ehistory of losses and no clear path to profitability\u003c/a\u003e. The stock hasn\u0026#8217;t traded above its $72 IPO price since early April, closing ahead of earnings at around $60. Lyft lost $911 million in 2018, up from $688 million the previous year. It lost \u003ca href=\"https://qz.com/1615121/lyft-loses-lots-of-money-but-hides-it-with-non-gaap-accounting/\"\u003e$1.1 billion in the first quarter\u003c/a\u003e of this year alone, thanks to a hefty stock-based compensation bill triggered by the IPO. It has warned that its adjusted loss for this year could exceed the loss in 2018.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Roberts said the worst is over. In the second quarter, Lyft reported $867 million in revenue, up 72% from the same period last year. It said revenue per active rider—defined as quarterly revenue divided by the number of riders that quarter—rose to $39.77, a 22% increase from the second quarter of 2018. Lyft said it had adjusted full-year forecasts, and now expected to lose less money in 2019 on an adjusted basis than it did in 2018.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"atlas-chart\" data-id=\"HkMx9T2qK\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"449\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/qz-production-atlas-assets/charts/atlas_HkMx9T2qK.png\" style=\"max-width: 100%; min-width:100%;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;We believe we have a clear path to profitability,\u0026#8221; Roberts said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat\u0026#8217;s the path? Why, higher prices! \u0026#8220;We began to adjust prices on select routes and in select cities based on costs and demand elasticities,\u0026#8221; Roberts told investors. \u0026#8220;We expect that these changes will accelerate Lyft\u0026#8217;s path to profitability, and further, we believe these price adjustments reflect an industry trend\u003ci class=\"dummy_elem\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e.\u0026#8221; Translation: Lyft is raising fares for riders and believes the rest of the industry (read: Uber) is doing so too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyft didn\u0026#8217;t provide many details on these price hikes—in fact, it never directly said which way the \u0026#8220;adjustments\u0026#8221; were going, and company spokespeople declined to clarify. Roberts said the changes kicked in toward the end of June and that Lyft tried \u0026#8220;to pick routes and cities where the demand impact would be the smallest.\u0026#8221; He added that Lyft is working to do more lucrative rides, like airport trips and rides in premium mode. He said Lyft made shared rides more efficient in the second quarter and also deployed driver incentives more efficiently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSubsidies have always cast a shadow on the ride-hail industry. Practically since Uber and Lyft started service, they\u0026#8217;ve relied on discounts and coupons to make the service more affordable for riders, and bonuses and incentive payments for drivers to make the gig more attractive. These subsidies were financed by tremendous amounts of venture capital money. The model worked so long as investors were willing to hand over more funds, but it was never going to be sustainable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe problem for Lyft is that as the second-largest player in a hyper-competitive US ride-hail market, charging riders more or paying drivers less risks losing market share to Uber. Guggenheim Partners analyst Jake Fuller summed up the company\u0026#8217;s predicament in an \u003ca href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/lyft-stock-price-shares-fall-below-ipo-price-2019-4-1028075252\"\u003eApril 1 research note\u003c/a\u003e, shortly after Lyft\u0026#8217;s IPO. \u0026#8220;We see four paths to profitability: cut driver pay, turn off incentives, reduce insurance costs or shift to self-driving cars,\u0026#8221; Fuller wrote. \u0026#8220;The first two would be tough in a highly competitive category, the third might not be enough by itself and the fourth is likely 10 years out.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuller was right that Lyft\u0026#8217;s paths to profitability were limited in a highly competitive environment. But a few months out from its IPO, Uber and Lyft seem headed toward a detente. Uber, which \u003ca href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/08/uber-earnings-q2-2019.html\"\u003ereported second-quarter results yesterday\u003c/a\u003e, also mentioned \u0026#8220;more favorable economic conditions\u0026#8221; and \u0026#8220;improved shared ride efficiency\u0026#8221; on its call.

Increasingly restrictive abortion bills are being voted on, and passed, by old \u003ca href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/alabama-abortion-ban-white-men_n_5cdc101ce4b0c39d2a1474ad\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewhite men\u003c/a\u003e. Most notably in May, all 25 votes in favor of Alabama’s passed abortion ban—the strictest in the country—came from men, denying the right to abortion even in the case of rape and incest (though it has \u003ca href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/zmp3w8/alabama-abortion-bill-is-direct-challenge-to-roe-v-wade\" target=\"_blank\"\u003enot yet gone into effect\u003c/a\u003e). \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e The Alabama Legislature is made up of \u003ca href=\"http://www.ncsl.org/legislators-staff/legislators/womens-legislative-network/women-in-state-legislatures-for-2019.aspx\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e84 percent\u003c/a\u003e men. Such gender imbalance is the norm in many statehouses nationwide, as it is in Florida where men make up 70 percent of both the House and Senate. But Book is no longer willing to accept the norm. The first-term senator recently introduced \u003ca href=\"https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2020/60/BillText/Filed/PDF\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ea bill\u003c/a\u003e for a potential constitutional amendment that would require at least 50 percent women in the chamber before the legislative body can vote on bills concerning abortion. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e “At the very least,” Book said,“if these laws are being forced upon women, women should be at the table.”\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e Book’s bill was inspired by both the Alabama bill and her own personal history as a survivor of child sexual abuse. Book said she believes that forcing someone to carry a pregnancy that was the result of rape or incest is the definition of cruel and unusual punishment. She points out that people from Georgia and Alabama must often travel to Florida to receive abortion care, due to extremely strict abortion laws in those states and the fact that abortion is protected under the Florida constitution until 24 weeks. For those people and for Floridians, Book said Florida must act quickly before Republican legislators begin to mimic Alabama—though some have already tried.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cdiv class=\"article__embed article__embed--vice\" data-related-article=\"true\"\u003e\u003ciframe src=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/embed/article/8xzana/six-week-abortion-ban-roe-v-wade-history?utm_source=stylizedembed_vice.com\u0026utm_campaign=gyzpwm\u0026site=vice\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:0px none;margin:0px;\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e Over a \u003ca href=\"https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/politics/2019/08/02/florida-senator-moves-block-abortion-votes-until-least-half-those-voting-women-abortion/1904576001/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003edozen\u003c/a\u003e anti-abortion bills were filed in Florida last session, though none of them made it to a floor vote.

Book admits that bringing more women in to vote on abortion bills doesn’t inherently guarantee more pro-choice votes, but she does believe that she and other pro-choice women are more likely to find common ground with Republican women than men from either party on the issue of abortion, specifically on sexual assault exceptions. “At least we can come to a place of conversation, whereas on the other side [men] cannot relate,” she said. “These are cruel laws that only attack women.” \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e Book says that she hasn’t yet given much thought to how the law would factor in trans or non-binary lawmakers, some of whom may be personally affected by abortion legislation. “The gender identity piece is very important,” she said. “We don’t have anybody [who is trans] serving.” \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e But Book will need men to pass her bill before it can become law. After the bill is sent to a committee, it would need to make it to a vote and pass the Florida legislature, before ultimately ending up on the ballot for Floridians to decide whether to add it to the state's constitution. Ironically, Book has to win over Florida’s 70 percent male, Conservative-majority House and Senate in order to make that a reality.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e While Book is aware that the odds are stacked against her bill, she’s not discouraged. “I know that I have a very long road to hoe with this,” she said, “but my challenge to colleagues on the other side of the aisle is, don’t fear the debate.”\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e Kara Gross, legislative director at the Florida American Civil Liberties Union, points out that while Book’s bill is the first of its kind in the U.S., legislative gender parity laws are already the norm in countries like Argentina, Mexico, Ecuador, and many others. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e She adds that Book’s bill isn’t about who’s more likely to be pro-choice or anti-abortion. “The issue is regarding who should be the primary decision makers in whether to restrict a woman’s access to safe and legal abortion care,” she said. “Should men be the primary decision makers and gatekeepers of access to women’s healthcare? All [the bill] does is ask the legislature to put that question to Floridians.” \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e Book agrees. “If we’re making these types of decisions, unless we have fair representation, there should be no conversation.” \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/page/sign-up-for-the-vice-newsletter\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e Sign up for our newsletter\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ci\u003e to get the best of VICE delivered to your inbox daily.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","url":"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/gyzpwm/this-creative-strategy-could-prevent-men-from-banning-abortion-1","published":"2019-08-09T15:36:25Z","guid":"gyzpwm"},{"title":"How to Find the Perfect Fragrance, According to Your Zodiac Sign","content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e Download the \u003ca href=\"https://c.singular.net/api/v1/ad?st=646112177054\u0026h=376469cccad655ad7532485ba5ae658703bf5ad6\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAstro Guide app\u003c/a\u003e by VICE on an iOS device to read daily horoscopes personalized for your sun, moon, and rising signs, and learn how to apply cosmic events to self care, your friendships, and relationships.\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cdiv class=\"article__media--image\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"article__media--image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1558453751149-Articles-970x250.jpeg\" alt=\"Astro Guide app banner\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e \u003cp class=\"article__text--dropcap\"\u003eThere have long been classical and speculative links between planets and scents in astrology, and when it comes to smells, our preferences are just as unique as our natal charts!

Perfumes with a silky or velvety depth are Venusian in their decadence. “Cashmeran, a commonly used and expensive synthetic musk, smells like a soft, warm blanket,” Zappas says.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e Marissa’s suggestions:\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cul\u003e \u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://fave.co/2YJH5zW\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eOud Immortel by Byredo\u003c/a\u003e: luxurious, earthy, resinous, sweet, and even a little barnyard\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://fave.co/2Zy5wxB\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePassiflora by Keiko Mecheri\u003c/a\u003e: passionflower, tropical fruits\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://fave.co/2YslZqi\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRed Roses by Jo Malone\u003c/a\u003e: like a bouquet of fresh red roses\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://fave.co/2YLQeYI\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHinoki by Comme des Garcons\u003c/a\u003e: soft, enveloping wood\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://fave.co/2MEFR2n\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePetit Cherie by Annick Goutal\u003c/a\u003e: a gentle pear and rose fragrance, great for teenagers\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://fave.co/2YrPyZe\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eConfetto Eau de Parfum by Profumum\u003c/a\u003e a decadent almond marzipan smell\u003c/li\u003e \u003c/ul\u003e \u003ch2\u003e Moon-ruled Cancer\u003c/h2\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cb\u003e Earthy mushroom to salty sea; gourmand notes\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eLike Venus, the moon conjures images of mystery, magic, and romance.

These scents align with Cancer’s beachy vibe. Zappas also says that mushrooms are ruled by the moon, which would make them a good fit for Cancer: “Mushroom notes are used typically in building white floral fragrances such as gardenia…They accentuate the floralcy with a sense of plush, musty earthiness.

Sauron invades Eriador, is forced back by a Númenorean expedition, is returns to Númenor. There he corrupts the Númenoreans and seduces them to break the ban of the Valar. All this, the course of history, must remain the same. But you can add new characters and ask a lot of questions, like: What has Sauron done in the meantime? Where was he after Morgoth was defeated? Theoretically, Amazon can answer these questions by inventing the answers, since Tolkien did not describe it. But it must not contradict anything which Tolkien did say. That’s what Amazon has to watch out for. It must be canonical, it is impossible to change the boundaries which Tolkien has created, it is necessary to remain “tolkienian.”\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eApparently, the estate has pretty firm guidelines about when the show can take place, too:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class=\"article__blockquote\"\u003eThe First and Third Ages are ‘off-limits’, you can’t have the First Age. Events could be mentioned at the most if they explain the events of the Second Age. But if it is not described or mentioned in the Lord of the Rings or in the appendices, they probably cannot use it. So the question is to what extent they may hint at events that took place, for example, in the First Age, but still continue to affect the Second Age. There are several maps authorized by Tolkien, not just the ones we are familiar with, and some of those maps have places on them which are not in the other maps. But if Tolkien authorized them then that’s okay. So it’s a bit of a minefield.

At 43, he's dropping his tenth album \u003ci\u003e Port of Miami 2\u003c/i\u003e exactly 13 years to the week that he released the first installment as his breakout debut. While most rappers who came up at the same time as him have burnt out, faded away, or otherwise fallen out of favor, the boss has outlasted the competition, his larger-than-life persona enduring with major label backing. Furthermore, having narrowly \u003ca href=\"https://www.ajc.com/news/crime--law/rapper-rick-ross-bodyguard-plead-contest-kidnapping-assault-case/zOoIdj2xSwO0okWr2rYqwI/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eavoided prison\u003c/a\u003e, dodged attempts on his life, and overcome health scares, he's a survivor in several senses of the word.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWith production by familiars including Beat Billionaire, Jake One, and J.U.S.T.I.C.E.

Released back in the days when CD sales still mattered and the legitimization of streaming music hadn't yet arrived, that earlier album topped the Billboard 200 and earned RIAA platinum certification. Leaning into the Miami \u003ci\u003e Scarface\u003c/i\u003e tropes more so than rappers from the East or West coast could, Ross' cocaine-cowboy bars conjured up images of volatile drug cartel deals and the ins-and-outs of the Carol City street hustle. \"I understood what everybody gon' respect, and that's a motherfucking winner, that's a \u003ci\u003e boss\u003c/i\u003e,\" Ross says of his approach on that project. \"That's somebody going from mud to marble, when they see somebody come from nothing and don't stop till they get it.\"\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAt the time, the crime-pays narrative behind \u003ci\u003e Port Of Miami\u003c/i\u003e wasn't something hip-hop listeners necessarily associated with Ross' hometown. \"Miami was a party city,\" he says. \"You come down, you snort good cocaine, you fuck all the pretty bitches, you go jump in a beach, and you go back home.\" 2 Live Crew and the bass music scene had done a tremendous regional branding job, yet those vibes failed to convey what else was happening down there. Though he chose a different path, Ross maintains a level of respect for these predecessors, as well as for what his erstwhile Slip-n-Slide labelmate Trick Daddy brought to the table as well. And while he’s humbly unwilling to take credit for South Florida's current status as a SoundCloud rap hub, he concedes that \u003ci\u003e Port Of Miami\u003c/i\u003e cemented him in the city's historic hip-hop lineage. \"Did I most definitely do something major for where I'm from?\" he muses. \"Of course, the same way Uncle Luke did, the same way Trick did.”\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSince Ross has been alive for as long as hip-hop has existed, he also credits some key golden age acts including Biz Markie and EPMD for shaping him while he was young into the kind of rapper he became in time for \u003ci\u003e Port Of Miami\u003c/i\u003e. \"I knew when I heard [Boogie Down Productions'] 'Loves Gonna Get'cha,' 'My Philosophy,' and all that,\" he says. \"That's how I knew my music would be different. Because where I'm from, I was damn near the only one that cared about KRS-One.\" New York rap music made its way down I-95 in those crucial years, feeding the streets and providing a soundtrack for the game.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\"Slick Rick, that first album, all the dope boys in my hood everywhere, that shit\u003ci\u003e saturated\u003c/i\u003e the hood,\" he says, remembering hearing \u003ci\u003e The Adventures Of Slick Rick\u003c/i\u003e down at the park. The eyepatched icon echoed Tony Montana on \"Hey Young World,\" and that resonated in a major way with an adolescent Ross. Just mentioning his name prompts him to sing the classic hook, to me and me alone. \"I really believed it,\" he says of its the-world-is-yours messaging, and that mentality ultimately fueled \u003ci\u003e Port Of Miami\u003c/i\u003e over a decade-and-a-half later. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\"That's the dope thing, to me, from album number one and seeing album number ten come to fruition,\" Ross says. \"I really pray motherfuckers know and understand by now that I really was \u003ci\u003e believing\u003c/i\u003e what I was saying.

In person, he carries himself accordingly, confident and authoritative yet humble amid the self-made luxury. In conversation, he sometimes leans on tropes and turns of phrase that feel like personal brand sloganeering. But for the most part, he projects his status most authentically by speaking without pretense or arrogance. With the benefit of lived wisdom, this has become effortless for him. \"The things I actually do are things that are a part of my lifestyle, things that I would do if I wasn't in [this] business,\" he says. \"That way it doesn't have any weight on me.\"\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWith all of his prior nine albums charting in the Billboard 200's top ten and two Drake collaborations \"Money In The Grave\" and \"Gold Roses\" both concurrently charting on the Hot 100 right now, he appears well-positioned to see \u003ci\u003e Port of Miami 2\u003c/i\u003e live up to its legacy. One thing he may never quite top, however, is \"Hustlin,\" a song that transcended its role as his signature hit and became a pop culture phenomenon, featured, for example, in broad comedic films like \u003ci\u003e Horrible Bosses 2\u003c/i\u003e and \u003ci\u003e We're The Millers\u003c/i\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eEven though the track took on a life of its own and moved further and further away from its original context, the mainstreaming of \"Hustlin\" doesn't seem to bother Ross in the slightest, who instead expresses pride in its ubiquity. \"Without me taking too much credit, it spoke values,\" he says. \"It basically broke down survival; on every level, you got to get up every day and hustle—regardless of how much paper you got, what you are.\" With his various business dealings, be that with Luc Belaire, his Rich By Rick Ross hair and beard grooming line, or his Checkers and Wing Stop franchises, he lives this ethos. \"You're the CEO of your life, and your life is the biggest business you will ever run.\"\u003c/p\u003e","url":"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ywazny/rick-ross-port-of-miami-2-interview","published":"2019-08-09T14:15:54Z","guid":"ywazny"},{"title":"Tom Delonge’s UFO Research Center Is Making Politicians Demand Answers","content":"\u003cp\u003e Last month, \u003ca href=\"https://walker.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/walker-discusses-reports-uap-encounters-sends-letter-navy-secretary\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRepublican representative Mark Walker of North Carolina\u003c/a\u003e wrote a letter expressing concern over the recent surge in UFO-related events affecting American military forces.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e Walker’s concerns stem from the \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/16/us/politics/pentagon-program-ufo-harry-reid.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDecember 2017 article in the \u003ci\u003e New York Times\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e about the now defunded secret Pentagon UFO program called AATIP and the \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/26/us/politics/ufo-sightings-navy-pilots.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003erevelations that several Navy pilots in 2004 and 2015 engaged in bizarre encounters with anomalous aerial objects off the coast of California and Florida\u003c/a\u003e. \u003ca href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/23/us-navy-guidelines-reporting-ufos-1375290\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe news that the Navy is now changing its protocols for personnel to report UFO sightings\u003c/a\u003e has spurred a renewed interest in the potential safety and security risks these unknown objects pose. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e \"The reports mention the existence of these encounters both domestically and abroad during various missions and trainings,\" Walker wrote. \"Based on pilot accounts, encounters with these UAPs (unidentified aerial phenomena) often involved complex flight patterns and advanced maneuvering, which demand extreme advances in quantum mechanics, nuclear science, electromagnetics, and thermodynamics.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat's most notable is that what Walker is asking for closely aligns with what Blink 182 singer Tom Delonge's To the Stars Academy (TTSA) has been uncovering and publishing over the last few years. \u003ca href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/xwnezk/tom-delonges-ufo-organization-says-its-obtained-exotic-metals-unknown-to-science\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWhile TTSA has made some odd claims\u003c/a\u003e, the sheer amount of attention the media is giving the UFO topic in the last two years has undoubtedly increased. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e “What we see here with Mark Walker’s letter to the Secretary of the Navy is the undiscussed, but most successful component of TTSA—a political lobby,\" Tim McMillan, a law enforcement consultant and intelligence analyst interested in UFOs, said in an interview. \"It’s abundantly clear by the language of his letter, Rep.

It is in conversation with all of the things that make these first-person walking simulator work so well: the small island you hike on feels like a real place, the situations and people you encounter are slight sketches with a lot of personality, and it doesn’t overstay its welcome. Like Florian Veltman’s \u003ca href=\"https://vltmn.itch.io/lieve-oma\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e Lieve Oma\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ci\u003e A Short Hike \u003c/i\u003eanchors you to a very specific activity, a hike to get cell service, and then spins an entire world out from there.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"article__media\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1565295272495-Short-Hike-1.jpeg\" alt=\"A bird talks to a dog farmer over a campfire in A Short Hike, a new kind of walking simulator.\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"article__image-caption\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e \u003cp\u003e What makes \u003ci\u003e A Short Hike \u003c/i\u003eso interesting as a product of this family tree of walking simulators is that it functionally combines the narrative and tonal chops of that genre with the activities of an \u003ci\u003e Animal Crossing \u003c/i\u003egame. Like \u003ca href=\"https://www.firewatchgame.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e Firewatch\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/9k4jbd/first-person-games-are-changing-but-into-what\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e Paratopic\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, this game about bird hikes really expands the domain of what this genre is doing. Instead of merely walking, talking, and listening you collect coins and shells. You can fish. You can glide around and pick up treasure chests. You can use a water bucket to create bounce pads for easier access to higher areas on the map.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e \u003ci\u003e A Short Hike \u003c/i\u003euses the basic structure of the walking simulator as a kind of disguise. Like the main character, you might think that you’re in for a short hike up to Hawk Peak to get some cell service. In reality, you’re in for a day of firmly experiencing this small island for what it is: a vacation paradise, a place for people to live and camp, and a plotted nature that you can stomp around in. Where \u003ci\u003e Dear Esther \u003c/i\u003econstantly dangles the red light of the aerial in your face so that you know the direction you’re universally pointed in, \u003ci\u003e A Short Hike \u003c/i\u003edoesn’t put your final destination in your face at all. The top-down 3D style means that you’re only going to encounter Hawk Peak if you want to. If you want to fish undisturbed for hours, well, you can do that. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e What we can see here is a shift in the skeleton of the walking simulator. Think of it as a Saturday Simulator instead, a form of fun and leisure that has a goal and a definite end point but which doesn’t herd you toward that point in the way another video game might. \u003ci\u003e A Short Hike\u003c/i\u003e is simply about the pleasure of spending time in a place with a myriad number of mechanical modes of interacting with the world, not \u003ci\u003e walking through it\u003c/i\u003e, and this is so qualitatively different that I can’t wait to see what other experiences this inspires. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e \u003ci\u003e You can follow Cameron Kunzelman on \u003c/i\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/ckunzelman\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e Twitter\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ci\u003e .\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","url":"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/8xw983/a-short-hike-takes-a-nice-long-day-to-reinvent-the-walking-simulator","published":"2019-08-09T12:11:34Z","guid":"8xw983"},{"title":"This Simple Law Could Have Saved The US $126 Billion in Broadband Deployment Costs","content":"\u003cp\u003e A new report states that America could save billions of dollars on fiber broadband deployment with a fairly simple law.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e Deploying fiber broadband across the country the size of the United States is hugely expensive. A large portion of these costs come from digging up public streets to lay fiber, a process that’s both time consuming and \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/Eb0x99oKwTM\" target=\"_blank\"\u003echaotic\u003c/a\u003e, especially when \u003ca href=\"https://statescoop.com/louisville-ky-loses-google-fiber-after-company-placed-lines-too-shallow/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003edone incorrectly\u003c/a\u003e. Fiber itself, however, is cheap. It's digging up the ground that's expensive.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e As a result, telecom experts have long pushed for a “dig once” law that would mandate the installation of fiber conduit during roadway construction and upgrades. These conduits would make running fiber along major thoroughfares much easier, saving taxpayers a fortune over the longer haul. The \u003ca href=\"https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policy/otps/policy_brief_dig_once.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"\u003egovernment claims\u003c/a\u003e 90 percent of deployment costs come from burying fiber. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e A \u003ca href=\"https://broadbandnow.com/report/dig-once-digital-divide/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003enew study by BroadbandNow\u003c/a\u003e, a consumer-focused company that tracks US broadband availability, states that passing “dig once” legislation could have saved the United States $126 billion in broadband deployment costs.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e “Goldman Sachs \u003ca href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-much-it-would-cost-google-to-build-a-cable-network-2012-12\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehas estimated\u003c/a\u003e that it could cost upwards of $140 billion to build high-speed service out to the entire country,” the firm said. “If dig once had been implemented nationally, it could’ve provided up to $126 billion in savings, bringing the estimated total to a far more palatable $14 billion.”\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e Dig once legislation has been routinely proposed since 1996 by a rotating crop of lawmakers, but the legislation rarely goes anywhere. For example, California Rep. Anna Eshoo and West Virginia Rep. David McKinley introduced bipartisan dig once legislation \u003ca href=\"https://eshoo.house.gov/issues/telecommunications/eshoo-and-mckinley-introduce-dig-once-legislation-to-reduce-cost-of-expanding-broadband/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003elast year\u003c/a\u003e, though it failed to gain traction in Congress. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e Three other efforts by Eshoo (2009, 2011, and 2015) were similarly unsuccessful. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e Matt Wood, General Counsel of consumer group Free Press, told Motherboard in an email exchange that there’s a number of reasons why such laws don’t gain traction. The biggest being that incumbent ISPs like AT\u0026T, Verizon, and Comcast aren’t keen on anything that would make it easier for competitors to challenge their \u003ca href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/yw7e7g/the-future-of-american-broadband-is-a-comcast-monopoly\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eregional broadband monopolies\u003c/a\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e But Wood also stated it’s not always that simple. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e “Sometimes, different types of ISPs can have different interests, and people get caught in the middle of the food fight,” Wood said. “So telephone companies that own some conduits—and really, electric companies, which these days own far more poles and conduits than communications providers do in lots of areas—may have lobbied against these bills and prevented their passage even when other large ISPs would benefit from them and faithfully backed them.”\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e In 2018, a variation of Eshoo’s dig once legislation was initially included in an act reauthorizing the FCC, but wound up \u003ca href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/03/dig-once-rule-requiring-fiber-deployment-is-finally-set-to-become-us-law/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ebeing shelved\u003c/a\u003e for undisclosed reasons at the last minute, punting any action to the states without requiring hard action. And while 11 states and 18 cities currently do have dig once policies in place, broader adoption of such rules has been slow going. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e The report notes that identifying why dig once bills routinely die prematurely is difficult given the closed door legislative process. But the report suggested that lobbying by telecom incumbents and short-sighted state leaders are both to blame.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e “Transportation agencies and public works departments have been known to oppose dig once on the principle that it creates even more operational overhead, despite the long-term benefits far outweighing the short-term costs,” the report said. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e Wood called a federal dig once law a “no brainer” as it would help clarify authority conflicts across varying levels of government.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e \"Of course there are also federalism questions when it comes to interactions between federal law, state rights-of-way, city rights-of-way, and private owners too, so the whole thing is messier than it needs to be,” Wood said. “And that's why a federal bill would be so welcome.\"\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e This week Presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren \u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@teamwarren/my-plan-to-invest-in-rural-america-94e3a80d88aa\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eunveiled a rural broadband plan\u003c/a\u003e that would make dig once policies the centerpiece of future US broadband efforts. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e “We will make sure that all new buildings are fiber-ready so that any network can deliver service there, and we will also enact ‘dig once’ policies to require that conduit is laid anytime the ground is opened for a public infrastructure project,” Warren said. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e Wood noted that the dig once issue remains only a small part of the US broadband problem.

But as they do, fewer people will use the service.

People are paying about $2.50 a mile when they use ride-sharing companies like Uber and Lyft, estimates Korus. If they buy a car, they are essentially paying 70 cents a mile to go the same distance. Autonomous taxis could lower that cost to 26 cents a mile, because there\u0026#8217;s no driver to pay. Until Uber and Lyft can start offering self-driving cars at a meaningful volume, which could take years, the economics will be difficult. They could shift back to a higher-priced luxury model, like Uber\u0026#8217;s primary offering before the 2012 introduction of UberX. But that would fall well short of the transportation revolution they have promised. \u0026ldquo;Is this a real transportation replacement, or are they just going to take over the black car industry?,\u0026#8221; says White.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe road ahead for scooter- and bike-sharing companies is especially difficult given that the vehicles they offer can now be bought relatively cheaply.\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003e Decent electric scooters can found for around $400, about the same price as a month of twice-daily shared scooter rides. \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eElectric bikes start at about $1,000. \u0026ldquo;In decades past, e-bikes were heavy, had bad range, and were expensive,\u0026rdquo; says Mike Radenbaugh, the CEO of e-bike maker Rad Power Bikes. \u0026ldquo;Now they\u0026rsquo;re light, have fantastic range, and advances in consumer electronics have lowered their price.\u0026rdquo; He says revenues more than doubled in 2018, to $45 million, and that\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003e many of his customers were introduced to electric bikes through sharing programs. Electric bike sales in the U.S. grew 61% over the last year, to $176 million, according to the NPD Group, a research firm.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eCompanies in other businesses have figured out how to hook customers and keep them coming back even as they raise prices. Wireless companies have stopped subsidizing the cost of new phones in recent years, and while growth in smartphone sales has flattened, customers are still spending billions on the devices every year. Federal electric vehicle subsidies expired last year, yet Tesla sold more cars in its most recent quarter than it did during the quarter in which customers were still receiving subsidies.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eAnd some investors are willing to watch public companies lose money for year\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003es if they think they will eventually become profitable. \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eThe classic example is Amazon, which bled money for years as it built out expensive infrastructure to deliver packages in just a few days. Today, there are few investors who, if offered the chance, wouldn\u0026#8217;t go back in time to invest in Jeff Bezos\u0026#8217; \u0026#8220;everything store\u0026#8221; before the company\u0026#8217;s stock price skyrocketed.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eBut the ride-sharing companies are not like Amazon, argues Richard Clayton, research director at CtoW investment group, which works with pension funds sponsored by unions affiliated with the Change to Win federation. Amazon spent money upfront to build an intricate system of warehouses that allowed it to eventually dominate the two-day delivery market. It got customers so accustomed to quick delivery that they became willing to pay more for it. The same may not be true of on-demand scooters.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eShared mobility companies may work in the future \u0026mdash; if they get significant subsidies, says Susan Shaheen, a transportation professor at the University of California, Berkeley. Governments could offer up money, as they do for public transit, she said, or advertisers could contribute in order to get their name associated with the transit. The city of Dublin, California has a program called \u003ca href=\"https://www.wheelsbus.com/godublin/\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003eGoDublin\u003c/a\u003e that pays for half of riders\u0026#8217; Uber or Lyft fares for rides that start and end in Dublin. Meanwhile, CitiBank and Ford sponsor bike-sharing programs in New York and San Francisco, respectively. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eBut those promotions would have to be significant to help make shared mobility companies profitable. Moving people around a city is expensive, which is why public transit is often so heavily subsidized. Nearly every company that has tried to improve upon this subsidized model has failed. During Uber\u0026rsquo;s call Thursday, Khosrowshahi said the company was looking into making its shared ride experiences more efficient, perhaps by piling 10 people into a shared van. But past attempts to do even this without subsidies have faltered. Earlier this year, Chariot, a company owned by Ford that shuttled commuters around a few U.S. cities in shared van routes, abruptly\u003c/span\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/10/18177378/chariot-out-of-business-shuttle-microtransit-ford\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003ewent out\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003e of business. Rides cost up to $5, which paled in comparison to some of the promotions being offered by Uber and Lyft.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd for many consumers, the appeal of Uber, Lyft, and shared bike and scooter services is that they make fewer stops and are more predictable than public transit. Any move that makes ride-sharing more like the bus may turn customers off. Ian Chesal, who gave up on JUMP after the prices went up, says he will occasionally take an Uber or Lyft to work from the subway if he\u0026#8217;s running late. The bus gets stuck in so much traffic that it takes as long as walking. Taking a bus, he says, \u0026#8220;was never really a consideration.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/time/topstories/~4/-KsYG75ybcE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/-KsYG75ybcE/","published":"2019-08-09T16:00:09Z","guid":"http://time.com/?p=5648510"},{"title":"5 Years Later, Michael Brown’s Father Is Calling For A Reinvestigation Into His Son’s Death","content":"\u003caside class=\"right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad\" id=\"right-rail__ad-5648721\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module\" data-src=\"https://time.com/5648721/michael-brown-new-investigation/\" data-widget-id=\"SB_2\" data-ob-template=\"timemag\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(CLAYTON, Mo.) \u0026mdash; On the fifth anniversary of Michael Brown\u0026#8217;s death in Ferguson, his father is urging the top St. Louis County prosecutor to reopen the investigation into the white police officer who fatally shot the black and unarmed 18-year-old.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael Brown Sr. spoke Friday outside the St. Louis County Justice Center.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;Justice has not been served,\u0026#8221; Brown, 41, said as he was surrounded by about three dozen supporters. \u0026#8220;My son deserved to live a full life.

But this is an updated story that takes place in a modern era that looks to be more than a little inspired by the rise of the alt-right in Trump\u0026#8217;s America. In the trailer, we see a group of people have taken up the mask of the right-wing vigilante character Rorschach, and the cops are hiding their faces too.

Elijah Cummings, D-Md., as well as with the press and members of policy advocacy groups. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eShe also uses her account to monitor the public’s reactions by\nretweeting, liking, and replying to their tweets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd, as with the president’s tweets, hers “produce an extraordinarily high level of public engagement,” as the 2\u003csup\u003end\u003c/sup\u003e Circuit will again surely recognize. Ocasio-Cortez’s tweets reach an audience of more than 5 million followers (more than seven times the population of her district), occasionally dominate the news cycle, and receive hundreds of thousands of “likes” and retweets.\u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eA look at her official account only underscores that her personal account is her primary vehicle for official public outreach and engagement. Her official account has only 186,000 followers, it follows no one, tweets only a few times per month, and earns a tiny fraction of the likes and retweets of her personal account. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePut simply,\nOcasio-Cortez uses her personal Twitter account in all the same ways that Trump\nuses his, so under the 2nd Circuit’s reasoning, she cannot ban other people\nfrom it for disagreeing with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eStill, she’s determined to distinguish her Twitter use from the president’s. Judging from \u003ca href=\"https://ecf.nyed.uscourts.gov/doc1/123115768444\"\u003eher response\u003c/a\u003e to the lawsuit, her defense rests on two arguments. First, she will argue that she did not block anyone because she disagreed with their political viewpoints. That’s doubtful, but she might argue that the blocked users’ tweets were not disagreements, but harassment.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd second, she\nwill argue that she does not use her account for official purposes.\u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis second argument depends entirely on word games. She denies that she uses her personal Twitter account to advocate her “positions,” but she admits that she uses it to communicate her positions and to advocate “matters.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf this is the\nbest argument she’s got, her defense is in serious trouble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of blocking Twitter users, Ocasio-Cortez—and all other politicians—should remember that getting heckled is in the job description.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAccept it.

So first off, you actually made \u0026#8230; This is a weird way to phrase it, but you actually made the record books as the youngest person in the U.S. prosecuted for terrorism charges. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWith that background, when did you first come to the U.S. from Pakistan, and what were your impressions of the U.S.?

We finally joined our dad who kind of sponsored us to come in to the country. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBy first beginning impressions of the country, were this dreamland, that magical kingdom like Hogwarts where it feels like Narnia, because that\u0026#8217;s all I was exposed to in Pakistan. And these are movies. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd, of course, the media representation of the United States was the only thing that I was familiar with. So that\u0026#8217;s what I was hoping to find when I first came to the United States.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTrinko: And how old were you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKhalid:\u003c/strong\u003e I was about 13 years old at that point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTrinko: And when you first came, I mean, I can\u0026#8217;t imagine moving at 13. Did the reality turn out to be as magical as you thought it would be?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKhalid:\u003c/strong\u003e No, no. It wasn\u0026#8217;t. I began to see the United States as a very \u0026#8230; Of course, it was a very developed place, for sure. But at the same time, I think there was not that much emphasis on the community mindset that I kind of had in Pakistan because everyone kind of knew each other, I think. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo just navigating this very seclusive, isolated, individual environment was kind of difficult for me to kind of process. But slowly but surely I think I was able to, when I enrolled in high school and began to talk with people, I was able to make some sense of maybe the society being a little bit different and my ability to kind of reconcile that. But I wasn\u0026#8217;t sure how that would have gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDaniel Davis: So at what point did you become interested in the world of Islamist extremism, and how did that transition come about?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKhalid:\u003c/strong\u003e So in high school I was subject to a lot of bullying and taunts because my first name is Mohammad and I happened to be \u0026#8230; A lot of students would just jokingly refer to us name of terrorism. And I kind of wanted to know more answers to that, why people were kind of associating my name with terrorists. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo I just went online, began some YouTube searches about meaning of religious identity and religious ideology. One thing led to another. I started watching YouTube videos that would portray the West in a civilizational struggle against Islam and Muslims in general. And that is where I met online extremists who kind of made sense to my personal journey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDavis\u003c/strong\u003e: \u003cstrong\u003eAnd did you have a devout Muslim background coming into that? \u003c/strong\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKhalid:\u003c/strong\u003e I was born a Muslim, so I did memorize a few chapters of the Quran. I had never really read the religious teachings or the religious aspect of religion itself. That happened afterwards. And the meaning of religion and the meaning of religious phrases and texts definitely happened after when I began my searches online on YouTube.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTrinko: So what online really spoke to you? What resonated from the extremists?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKhalid:\u003c/strong\u003e The portrayal of or the depiction of the world as two, in two divides, like this black and white world. I think that kind of spoke to me and that kind of made sense in the way what was happening to me. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eA lot of content struggle that I faced in high school were, I mean, they were isolated, but they were also kind of directed towards me personally. So I kind of felt that I needed to understand what was happening to me. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn that understanding, I began watching YouTube videos that kind of portrayed bombings and these killings that were, according to the videos, being done by the United States against Muslims in general, drone strikes, for example, and all these air attacks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI began to see that as reality. I began to see that as something that was actually happening in the world. And that spoke to me about our role as Muslims to kind of speak up and even advocate against those kind of things. And that\u0026#8217;s where online extremists kind of came in and swooped in, and they introduced me to Islamist ideology. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDavis: And were you keeping that kind of secret? Or were you talking about it with your family and your friends?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKhalid:\u003c/strong\u003e Oh, this was definitely something that was not known to my parents at all, even my friends. I did not speak to anyone in high school about it. I did not speak to my own parents. My family was not aware what was happening to me. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd, I mean, people online were just my brother and sisters. So they were just more than friends to me. And eventually that became part of my larger family, and I dissociated myself from my own family. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo sitting in my basement in my family\u0026#8217;s house, not talking to my own parents, not talking to my own siblings, but just going online, spending hours upon hours talking to these people and trying to make sense of the world and the twisted ideology that it was part of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTrinko: And obviously this was a hypothetical, but do you think if your high school experience had been different, if there hadn\u0026#8217;t been bullying, do you think you still would have fallen into this online world or not?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKhalid:\u003c/strong\u003e I think I would not have had the motive if I was not bullied in high school to kind of know or learn more about the meaning of religion itself. It\u0026#8217;s very possible that things would have turned out differently because I would not have the motivation or the instigation to explore more about religion because, of course, there would be taunts at that point. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut I think the presence of online extremists is just so monumental in terms of what they join, in terms of their inspiration. I think it\u0026#8217;s very hard to escape from it if you\u0026#8217;re trying to look for the meaning of religion and religious components, especially when it comes to Islam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDavis: So you said you got warnings from the FBI about your online activity.

So the FBI kind of became interested with me as I went more into deep web area, and I began to cruise online extremist forums that were password protected. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eA lot of my activities were not known, or they were not visible in the public. So the FBI kind of wanted to know more about my interactions of people I was communicating with and what I was saying and how those communications were and the nature of those communications. We had a lot of individual private meetings back and forth prior to my arrest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTrinko\u003c/strong\u003e: \u003cstrong\u003eAnd I guess I\u0026#8217;m just thinking I\u0026#8217;m a very rule-follower type of person. I would be completely freaked out if I was on the FBI\u0026#8217;s radar. Did you ever have moment where you thought, \u0026#8220;Maybe I should backtrack now?\u0026#8221; What were you thinking during those meetings?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKhalid:\u003c/strong\u003e Right. Right. So I did not really think of the FBI as something that was serious threat to be taken into because, again, I was about 14 or 15 years old at that point. So still new to the country, still reconciling my place in the country, and not knowing what institutions are actually part of, which ones to take seriously, which ones to not. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut the FBI, I just saw them as part of the other as some \u0026#8230; these people who had to be \u0026#8230; whom I had to get off my back because they were just interested in something that I would have to tell them the answers to, but I would not have to take them as seriously as they should have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI mean, of course I realize, I guess, the biggest reality came crashing down upon me on the day of my arrest when I actually found out there will be consequences for what I\u0026#8217;m doing. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd throughout my time in prison, I mean, that definitely gave me, I guess, the light in terms of knowing, \u0026#8220;Well, the FBI was not kidding around when it came to my extremism or when it came to dissuading me from the path.\u0026#8221; Because they had warned there may be consequences, but I just did not take them seriously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTrinko: And did the FBI contact your parents or tell them about this?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKhalid:\u003c/strong\u003e Correct. The FBI did come to my house in front of my parents. They would not tell my parents what the meetings between them and me were about. Mostly also because I did ask them not to tell my parents, so they respected that for some reason. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut we would just go to a isolated room or we would just go to different areas like restaurants, for example, and just talk about whatever they would want to know and they would kind of talk to me about my life and what I was doing online mostly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDavis: So tell us about your actual arrest and the trial that came after that.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKhalid:\u003c/strong\u003e So a day after Independence Day on 2011, so July 5 is when I was arrested, I lost my independence on that day. I was taken to a juvenile facility and tried as an adult and charged with one count of conspiracy to provide material in support of a terrorist. And I faced up to 15 years behind bars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDavis\u003c/strong\u003e: \u003cstrong\u003eAnd you were how old?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKhalid:\u003c/strong\u003e At that point I was 17 years old.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDavis: Wow.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKhalid:\u003c/strong\u003e So I was tried as an adult, sentenced five years, and then after serving those five years I was transferred to immigration custody where a protracted legal battle over my citizenship ensued. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAfter some proceedings I was finally released under supervision subject to three years of probation. And that was finalized and that was finished. Very recently I obtained my U.S. citizenship after the legal fight was won.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTrinko: And what was the terrorism plot that you were charged in conjunction with? What was it about?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKhalid:\u003c/strong\u003e So the plot was, it was a very famous plot with a woman best named by \u0026#8230; Jihad Jane. Her name was Colleen LaRose. The plot was to kill a Swedish cartoonist \u0026#8230; Was it Danish? Danish or Swedish. I forgot. But his name was Lars Vilks. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHe had drawn characters of prophet Muhammad that many Muslims found offensive at that point. The plan was to kind of eliminate him or kill him. So did recruit people from the United States as well as Europe to travel to Europe and partake in also this organized group that another individual by the name of Black Flag had aspired to create. And he wanted us to kind of be part of that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo I kind of sent out questionnaires. I was only involved in translated jihadist propaganda. So I just took that a step further and received some materials from Colleen LaRose. And that I forwarded to her while she was actually traveling in Europe. So that was the actual nature of the crime. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTrinko: Was there ever a moment when you were planning it where you thought, \u0026#8221; \u0026#8230; We\u0026#8217;re trying to kill a man here, and am I really OK with that?\u0026#8221; I just would love to understand more of your thinking at that time.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKhalid:\u003c/strong\u003e So at that point, I think I tended to be very stubborn in my actions. \u0026#8230; At the same time, I was also a juvenile. So I don\u0026#8217;t think I completely understood what the consequences of my actions could have been. A lot of it was aspirational instead of on the field or stuff could have potentially happened. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut I do realize and I do understand that it was something that was serious. It could have potentially killed this innocent person. But \u0026#8230; hindsight is always 20/20, right? At this point, I mean, yes, it was wrong for me to do, but at that point I did not really see it as something that could have even \u0026#8230; At least I did not take it as seriously as I should have at that point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTrinko: Did you ever think about his family or his friends?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKhalid:\u003c/strong\u003e I did not, no. Because in this \u0026#8220;us versus them\u0026#8221; world that Islamist ideology is a part of, you forget about families and friends. You don\u0026#8217;t look at the other person as a human being. It\u0026#8217;s just part of the enemies. But either they\u0026#8217;re with us or they\u0026#8217;re against us. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDavis: So when you were in prison you started to change your mind about Islamist extremism. How did that come about?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKhalid:\u003c/strong\u003e I was actually encouraged to speak about my life, about my journey by correctional officers in the juvenile facility themselves. So they wanted to understand what had happened to me and what my thoughts were. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI was a recluse. I did not want to talk to them. But they kept on insisting. And eventually to start the conversation they began expressing about their lives, their dreams, and their hopes, and their struggles. And that\u0026#8217;s something that kind of really made sense to me personally in terms of that humanization aspect that was missing from my life. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo I did open up to them, and that was the beginning of my de-radicalization process, basically. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo they actually encouraged me to read an English copy of the Quran, which I did for the first time. And I finally was able to disavow my beliefs and my views. It was not a easy thing to do, of course. It took a lot of self-reflection. But they definitely put me on that path by just humanizing. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDavis: And was that because your just reading of the Quran led you away from this extremism? You felt like that was a fair reading of the Quran?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKhalid:\u003c/strong\u003e Yes. I think there\u0026#8217;s a lot of \u0026#8230; cherry-picked words that are actually used by extremists. It happens in every single form of extremism, but especially like Islamist extremism I think that there\u0026#8217;s a tendency to cherry pick verses of the Quran and use that as a part of propaganda strategy, [which] was something that I was involved in. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut reading the Quran in its context I think definitely made sense. And the humanization part which kind of spoke to the spiritual side of religion for me kind of definitely helped me move on from that black and white mindset that I had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTrinko: And are you a practicing Muslim right now?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKhalid:\u003c/strong\u003e I am.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTrinko: And what does your faith mean to you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKhalid:\u003c/strong\u003e I think faith is, it\u0026#8217;s a guiding post. I don\u0026#8217;t think it\u0026#8217;s an end all towards everything. I think we all are believers in something. I mean, no one does not believe in anything. But at the same time I think a lot of times some people have a tendency to just use faith as this end all thing that kind of, I guess, that kind of just separates them from the reality of what they are in, I guess, if that makes sense. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo the spiritual side kind of focuses more on the connections, more focuses on what we have common [with] other people. But I think a lot of times that religious side is kind of just narrowed down in its interpretations to kind of be this part of these extremes that you can be part of. Either we all go to heaven or the disbelievers go all in hell. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI like the thing we all will have our judgment with God, which is, I think, what Islam kind of speaks about. It speaks more about we all are going to have our reward with God in whatever form he is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDavis: So there\u0026#8217;s a debate here in U.S. about assimilation and whether we have an assimilation problem. What\u0026#8217;s your take on that?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKhalid:\u003c/strong\u003e I think the issue is more about integration. I don\u0026#8217;t like the word \u0026#8220;assimilation.\u0026#8221; I think the issue\u0026#8217;s more about integration with the society. And I think that\u0026#8217;s a debate that\u0026#8217;s happening within the Muslim communities in terms of how far they want the Muslim identity to be part of the American identity. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the conference today, we spoke about the African American Muslim identity and how there\u0026#8217;s a lot of initiatives on that aspect already. I think that could be branched out to other cultural groups, so whether they\u0026#8217;re Arabs, whether they\u0026#8217;re Hispanic, or whether they\u0026#8217;re African American, I mean, a lot of groups can kind of work together in terms of developing and enhancing their American Muslim identity while being part in this country that is the greatest country in the world, in my opinion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTrinko: Now, to return to your conversion as it were to not being an extremist, it sounds like it happened really suddenly. And I believe you mentioned at The Heritage Foundation panel that you also discovered, I believe, that you were diagnosed with Asperger\u0026#8217;s. Is that correct?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMohammad\u003c/strong\u003e: Correct.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTrinko: And did that play a role? Did you understand yourself differently?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKhalid:\u003c/strong\u003e Yes. Having a Asperger\u0026#8217;s diagnosis helped me understand why I was so socially recluse in high school, why I was not willing to confide in other people or even talk to people. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt also made sense in the sense of letting me know why I was focusing so much on the internet and not on the human side of things. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo just knowing that had the characteristics of a disorder but also using my weaknesses as a form of strength in terms of forcing myself to get to know people, whether they were prisoners or the staff members behind bars, which is the only thing I could have done at that point, I think it was meaningful and very instrumental in helping me shape my worldview and my viewpoint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#8217;s easy to imagine that change being so sudden \u0026#8230; But there was a lot of internal struggle within me that I had to reconcile and that I had to finally make a decision if this is the path that I want to take and what are the consequences for that path are, whether they are going to be receptive to something that I want to live the rest of my life with, if that makes sense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTrinko: Yeah. Was it something that happened over months, over years? Were there times where you were like, \u0026#8230; \u0026#8220;I think I\u0026#8217;m going to be less extremist,\u0026#8221; but then you would swing back and be like, \u0026#8220;No, I miss the black and white thinking. This isn\u0026#8217;t the way to go.\u0026#8221;?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKhalid:\u003c/strong\u003e I think it definitely happened over the course of a couple of months. It didn\u0026#8217;t happen just in a few days. But it definitely, speaking with the correctional counselors in the juvenile facility in which I was incarcerated for a couple of months. And then just continuing that conversation with other officers and other prisoners when I was in bureau prison custody in a adult institution, I think led me on a path to finally renounce my views and understand the world as more than just being black and white. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI like to say that the world became more colorful for me while I was behind bars, which is unfortunate. But I do fully believe that I needed the reality of prison to come to terms with my actions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDavis: What advice would you give to Americans who are not Muslim, engaging with Muslims in a way that encourages people away from extremism? What can non-Muslims do?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKhalid:\u003c/strong\u003e I think a lot of times, non-Muslims and Muslims do have the possibility of working together on a lot of interfaith issues, I believe. Because a lot of times Islamist ideology kind of capitalizes on this \u0026#8220;us versus them\u0026#8221; divide, just portioning everyone who\u0026#8217;s not part of the Muslim faith as just someone who\u0026#8217;s just part of the other. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo understanding the person behind that other label, understanding whether they\u0026#8217;re Jews, Christians, atheists, agnostics, whoever they are and just communicating with them on a human level, just sharing about something as personal as what some biggest struggle that you faced or some biggest challenge that you dealt with can be very meaningful to someone who happens to be Muslim and who\u0026#8217;s also reconciling their place in this country.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is difficult. I think sometimes to be a Muslim in an atmosphere that\u0026#8217;s polarized, there\u0026#8217;s a lot of attacks or bigotry sometimes directed against Muslims. But I think in the end it\u0026#8217;s about balance and bringing out the ideals of the American dream that I think we all aspire towards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTrinko: And you were radicalized at a very young age. And it just seems like we talk a lot in this country about sort of the crisis of young men and being troubled and looking for meaning. It connects with all sorts of issues from extremism to not finding jobs, etc. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0026#8217;m curious just because of what you\u0026#8217;ve been saying if you\u0026#8217;re familiar with Jordan Peterson, and if you have any thoughts on what he has to say. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd also, what would sort of be your advice to parents of young male teenagers who seem troubled, and can they monitor their online activities? What in retrospect would you say?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKhalid:\u003c/strong\u003e I think, in a way, all of us are looking for a meaning, sense of a purpose, and belonging in this world. And I think being a young person, you\u0026#8217;re in a particular spot to develop your identity, develop your place in the world and how you relate to the world. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI went wrong in that case, right? I did not find the right company and the right community in which I could be a part of and contribute to the community. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, I became a part of the extremist circles and proliferated and propagated in extremist ideology. I think a lot of times if you have the necessary guidance, whether it\u0026#8217;s from our parents or even \u0026#8230; Not just our parents, but also our teachers and our people who go with us to school or go with us to our legislatures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI mean, if it\u0026#8217;s just a basic conversation about life, just getting to know the other person, also getting to know the person beyond that culture, right? Not just, for example, I\u0026#8217;m Pakistani. So not just a person [who is] Pakistani but also a person who may have happened to be from Spain or who may happen to be from Australia. Just connecting what makes us more human, I guess, definitely helps in that understanding of the world as more inclusive and more diverse than just being secluded to your own culture and having that identity within the same religious circle that it may not be. Does that make sense?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTrinko\u003c/strong\u003e: \u003cstrong\u003eIt does.

Now it\u0026#8217;s a liability.\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"related-content__dek\"\u003eRep. Eric Swalwell\u0026#039;s entry into the 2020 Democratic primary race shows just how much political winds have shifted on guns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\t\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eSure, every mass shooting triggered a wave of indignation at our collective inability to curb gun violence, and renewed calls for legislative action. But when those bills inevitably stalled at the feet of Republican obstructionists, Democrats would allow their outrage to recede, at least until the next mass shooting. Like the tides, their interest ebbed and flowed.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eIn this case, the gravitational force at work was the National Rifle Association. Republicans have cowered in fear of the group’s undue influence for decades, but more than a few Democrats did as well. And leaders within the party were keenly aware that their most vulnerable members in Congress often hailed from districts where existing “gun culture” all but forbade politicians who wanted to win an election from running afoul of the NRA.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eThat is simply no longer the case. If gun control was once a third rail of Democratic politics, it’s now a litmus test.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eThere are two broad and interconnected reasons why. The first is the aforementioned rise of new advocacy organizations focused on the issue of gun control. Many of them have been around for years, but their political influence is only now coming into maturation thanks in no small part to the survivors of the school shooting in Parkland, Florida. Their refusal to be silenced and forgotten has kept the issue of gun control in the public consciousness even as the current administration sets the rest of the world on fire.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eGun control, even as recently as the 2016 election, was never a Top 5 issue for voters in the same way health care, the economy, and social safety net programs were. But since Parkland, there is evidence to suggest the issue is firmly lodging itself in the minds of voters. During the 2018 midterms, gun policy was ranked as a very important issue by 69 percent of voters in a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center. That ranked it ahead of taxes, Medicare, Social Security, immigration, and all but two other issues.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eSo animating has the issue of gun control become, among Democrats in particular, that an entire presidential campaign was launched atop a platform of gun control. And while Rep. Eric Swalwell’s (D-CA) entry into the field was short-lived, the very notion of a candidate running on the issue of gun control was unthinkable even four years ago.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eSimultaneously, as the influence of gun control groups has grown, the NRA’s has waned. Once the standard bearer for single-issue advocacy organizations — their grading system for politicians once had the ability to sink or sustain an entire campaign — the NRA is now limping into the 2020 election season after a series of highly publicized and deeply embarrassing failures.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eThe first came at the hands of the Parkland survivors once again. Their effort to encourage boycotts of corporations that partnered with the NRA was a resounding success, and resulted in the group losing dozens of corporate allies and the financial incentives that came with them. Infighting within the senior leadership of the organization leaked into the public arena, leading to resignations, lawsuits, and more bad press. The organization’s foray into original video, NRA TV, was unceremoniously shuttered, and their finances, once their greatest source of strength, are reportedly in shambles. Some Republicans may still regard the NRA as a formidable political force, but the American public, by and large, do not — perhaps the most valuable political asset for mainstream Democrats running for office in 2019 is how triggering their candidacy is to the NRA. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eIn the clearest sign yet of the group’s devaluation, on Thursday both the White House and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) — the same Mitch McConnell who has staked his entire reputation on being a roadblock to any meaningful legislation proposed by Democrats — signaled a willingness to consider bills strengthening and expanding background checks on guns. As legislative responses to mass shooting events go, it leaves a lot to be desired. But the NRA has staunchly opposed any effort to buttress existing background check measures, and if they can’t even keep Moscow Mitch in line, one has to wonder what actual power the NRA has left.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eThe shifting political headwinds make it all the more curious then, that guns are only now commanding the attention of the Democratic field. Several candidates have released plans or proposals about how to address gun violence in the United States, but through four nights and nearly ten hours of debates so far, the issue has barely been raised. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"promo amp-wp-article-promo\"\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"post__figure

The weather is often cold but can shift without warning. And if you want to stay very long, you have to find food in an environment where plants and animals are relatively scarce. But around 47,000 years ago, people apparently lived (at least for a while) in a rock shelter 3,469 meters (11,400 feet) above sea level in Ethiopia’s Bale Mountains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArchaeologists found hundreds of stone tools, thousands of discarded animal bones, and ancient hearths buried in layers of sediment on the floor of Fincha Habera rock shelter. According to radiocarbon dates from charcoal and burnt bone, the first people lived there between 47,000 and 31,000 years ago. The site is one of the earliest examples we have of people living at high elevations, instead of just venturing up to collect stone or forage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil recently, paleoanthropologists thought that people didn’t tackle the challenges of life at high elevations—in places like the Tibetan Plateau, the Peruvian Altiplano, or the Ethiopian mountains—until pretty late in our species’ world takeover. High places are difficult, so it made sense that people would have put the effort off as long as possible, until they found a really compelling reason. This find, along with others, suggests ancient people (and likely our hominin cousins) were much more capable than we’ve sometimes realized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1548857#p3\"\u003eRead 9 remaining paragraphs\u003c/a\u003e | \u003ca href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1548857\u0026comments=1\"\u003eComments\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"feedflare\"\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=Tc7UzIzhSPU:WEeAJ_nEUMI:V_sGLiPBpWU\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=Tc7UzIzhSPU:WEeAJ_nEUMI:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=Tc7UzIzhSPU:WEeAJ_nEUMI:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=Tc7UzIzhSPU:WEeAJ_nEUMI:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=Tc7UzIzhSPU:WEeAJ_nEUMI:qj6IDK7rITs\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=Tc7UzIzhSPU:WEeAJ_nEUMI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","url":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1548857","published":"2019-08-09T14:14:43Z","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1548857"},{"title":"A Boeing code leak exposes security flaws deep in a 787’s guts","content":"\u003cdiv id=\"rss-wrap\"\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"intro-image intro-left\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/boeing787-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"American Airlines Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner aircraft with registration N818AL landing at Athens International Airport.\"\u003e\u003cp class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/boeing787.jpg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"683\" data-width=\"1024\"\u003eEnlarge\u003c/a\u003e \u003cspan class=\"sep\"\u003e/\u003c/span\u003e American Airlines Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner aircraft with registration N818AL landing at Athens International Airport.

He was surprised to discover a fully unprotected server on Boeing's network, seemingly full of code designed to run on the company's \u003ca href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/boeing-737-max-test-flight-ups-and-downs\"\u003egiant 737\u003c/a\u003e and 787 passenger jets, left publicly accessible and open to anyone who found it. So he downloaded everything he could see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, nearly a year later, Santamarta claims that leaked code has led him to something unprecedented: security flaws in one of the 787 Dreamliner's components, deep in the plane's multi-tiered network. He suggests that for a hacker, exploiting those bugs could represent one step in a multi­stage attack that starts in the plane’s in-flight entertainment system and extends to highly protected, safety-critical systems like flight controls and sensors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoeing flatly denies that such an attack is possible, and it rejects his claim of having discovered a potential path to pull it off. Santa­marta himself admits that he doesn't have a full enough picture of the aircraft—or access to a $250 million jet—to confirm his claims. But he and other avionics cybersecurity researchers who have reviewed his findings argue that while a full-on cyberattack on a plane's most sensitive systems remains far from a material threat, the flaws uncovered in the 787's code nonetheless represent a troubling lack of attention to cybersecurity from Boeing. They also say that the company's responses have not been altogether reassuring, given the critical importance of keeping commercial airplanes safe from hackers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1548993#p3\"\u003eRead 18 remaining paragraphs\u003c/a\u003e | \u003ca href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1548993\u0026comments=1\"\u003eComments\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"feedflare\"\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=KSeheJ56-Ak:lvKLznuOt9s:V_sGLiPBpWU\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=KSeheJ56-Ak:lvKLznuOt9s:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=KSeheJ56-Ak:lvKLznuOt9s:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=KSeheJ56-Ak:lvKLznuOt9s:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=KSeheJ56-Ak:lvKLznuOt9s:qj6IDK7rITs\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=KSeheJ56-Ak:lvKLznuOt9s:yIl2AUoC8zA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","url":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1548993","published":"2019-08-09T14:11:31Z","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1548993"},{"title":"Samsung’s Bixby speaker, announced one year ago today, still hasn’t launched","content":"\u003cdiv id=\"rss-wrap\"\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ca name=\"page-1\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n      \u003cul class=\"gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide\"\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n        \u003cdiv class=\"gallery-item-content\"\u003e  \n        \u003cdiv class=\"gallery-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/galaxy-home-980x523.jpeg\" alt=\"\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n        \u003cp\u003e\n          The Samsung Galaxy Home is Samsung's long-rumored Bixby smart speaker.

Assistants need to be on a wide range of hardware form factors and integrate with a software ecosystem. The Google Assistant connects to a huge range of Google apps and services and has the backing of Google Search, while Apple's Siri connects to iCloud and syncs across Macs, iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches, and Apple TVs. Amazon doesn't quite have the wide range of services that the operating system vendors have, but there are still things like Prime Video, Amazon Music, and more. And Amazon was first to market, which has given it a sizable \"Skill\" app store, a lead on hardware, and integration with third-party devices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1548699#p3\"\u003eRead 2 remaining paragraphs\u003c/a\u003e | \u003ca href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1548699\u0026comments=1\"\u003eComments\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"feedflare\"\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=OJVuJ_D7YN8:gP7nDgwMP8Q:V_sGLiPBpWU\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=OJVuJ_D7YN8:gP7nDgwMP8Q:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=OJVuJ_D7YN8:gP7nDgwMP8Q:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=OJVuJ_D7YN8:gP7nDgwMP8Q:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=OJVuJ_D7YN8:gP7nDgwMP8Q:qj6IDK7rITs\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=OJVuJ_D7YN8:gP7nDgwMP8Q:yIl2AUoC8zA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","url":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1548699","published":"2019-08-09T14:00:07Z","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1548699"},{"title":"Sean Murray calls No Man’s Sky Beyond the game’s “2.0” version—we believe it","content":"\u003cdiv id=\"rss-wrap\"\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"intro-image intro-left\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/1920x1080_Beyond_KeyArt-800x450.png\" alt=\"Want to strap into VR?

Regardless of where it\u0026#8217;s stored, the idea is to give customers direct control over their own data. \u0026#8220;We are really trying to alert our customers to threats or to potential privacy exceptions that are occurring in their environment in real time, and being in their environment is really the best way to facilitate this,\u0026#8221; she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe product works by getting read-only access to the data, then begins to identify sensitive data in an automated fashion using machine learning. \u0026#8220;Our product automatically looks at the schema and samples of the data, and uses machine learning to identify common protected data,\u0026#8221; she said. Once that process is completed, a privacy compliance team can review the findings and adjust these classifications as needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWade, who started the company in March, says the idea formed at previous positions where she was responsible for implementing privacy policies and found there weren\u0026#8217;t adequate solutions on the market to help. \u0026#8220;I had to face the challenges first-hand of dealing with privacy and compliance and seeing how resources were really taken away from our engineering teams and having to allocate these resources to solving these problems internally, especially early on when GDPR was first passed, and there really were not that many tools available in the market,\u0026#8221; she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInterestingly Wade\u0026#8217;s co-founder is her husband, John. She says they deal with the intensity of being married and startup founders by sticking to their areas of expertise. He\u0026#8217;s the marketing person and she\u0026#8217;s the technical one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe says they applied to Y Combinator because they wanted to grow quickly, and that timing is important with more privacy laws coming online soon. She has been impressed with the generosity of the community in helping them reach their goals. \u0026#8220;It\u0026#8217;s almost indescribable how generous and helpful other folks who\u0026#8217;ve been through the YC program are to the incoming batches, and they really do have that spirit of paying it forward,\u0026#8221; she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"feedflare\"\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=r_pjL8saP_Y:wT987tX-KEw:2mJPEYqXBVI\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=r_pjL8saP_Y:wT987tX-KEw:7Q72WNTAKBA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=r_pjL8saP_Y:wT987tX-KEw:yIl2AUoC8zA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=r_pjL8saP_Y:wT987tX-KEw:-BTjWOF_DHI\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=r_pjL8saP_Y:wT987tX-KEw:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=r_pjL8saP_Y:wT987tX-KEw:D7DqB2pKExk\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=r_pjL8saP_Y:wT987tX-KEw:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=r_pjL8saP_Y:wT987tX-KEw:qj6IDK7rITs\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/r_pjL8saP_Y\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/r_pjL8saP_Y/","published":"2019-08-09T15:52:54Z","guid":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=1866785"},{"title":"Robocall blocking apps caught sending your private data without permission","content":"\u003cp id=\"speakable-summary\"\u003eRobocall-blocking apps promise to rid your life of spoofed and spam phone calls.

Adobe’s solution to that is Project Glasswing, a transparent LCD display that could potentially be used in retail environments or public spaces like hotels and museums. The prototype display can blend digital and physical environments without the need for glasses and headsets. “We like it as an alternative form of AR,” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Kc13Df\"\u003eParasnis stresses that Project Glasswing isn’t a hardware product; instead, it’s a means for Adobe to showcase how its software can be used in real-life applications, especially in retail.

There’s no limit, server-wide, to how many people can go live. (That said, only one person can stream in any single voice channel.) It’s also a server-level feature, which means that admins can turn the feature off if they’d like. The feature is very low latency; in the demo I saw, the stream was stable and just about real time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"WTcq7z\"\u003eGo Live isn’t taking aim at Twitch, Mixer, or any of the other streaming platforms. There’s no webcam support, for one thing, and it’s limited to 10 viewers because of bandwidth restrictions and latency goals, both of which seem hard to overcome.

The first scene is set to the background music of Donovan’s wonderful “\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAzTnsSgs2s\"\u003eSeason of the Witch\u003c/a\u003e,” played by a never-seen DJ who recalls Wolfman Jack from \u003cem\u003eAmerican Graffiti\u003c/em\u003e. These period touches aren’t winking celebrations of childhood, though. The film is set in the past because director André Øvredal has something specific to say about that era and the children who lived in it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"9kEWUg\"\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"\u003e\u003ciframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vlya92LZqZw?rel=0\" style=\"border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"encrypted-media; accelerometer; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"3SEQfD\"\u003eThe movie is loosely based on Alvin Schwartz’s famous collections of short horror stories for kids. A group of friends led by Stella (Zoe Colletti) investigates a haunted house on Halloween. There, they find and take an old book left behind by a long-dead child from a wealthy family. Sarah, now a ghost, starts writing new short stories in the book and the stories come true, resulting in horrible fates for Stella’s friends. Stella and her love interest, an out-of-towner named Ramón, try to learn about Sarah’s past in order to stop her before her stories do them in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"qwQm9s\"\u003eThe stories Sarah writes in the book are the parts of the movie based on Schwartz’s work. These setpieces are excellent. They have the nightmarish, inevitable illogical logic of folk tales or urban legends. Fans who were terrified as children by narratives of spiders hatching where they’re not supposed to hatch will not be disappointed, nor will those who fondly remember the creature who assembles itself from its own severed bits. Harold the scarecrow is particularly effective. Øvredal reminds viewers that you don’t really need spectacular makeup or gouts of blood to create a good scare. You can just walk by the same straw-stuffed figure a couple of times and then notice it’s not there anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"hR8KMB\"\u003eThe frame story, by contrast, isn’t based directly on Schwartz’s writing, and it’s very different. The narrative of Stella and her friends abandons the book’s taut economy for a meandering supernatural slasher. It’s like \u003cem\u003eNightmare on Elm Street \u003c/em\u003ewith a less visually compelling villain. \u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-YX_6if_jfbDcGKQMxp55bFMzKM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18956503/ScaryStories2.jpg\"\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"0iQ9wc\"\u003eIt’s true that the frame is fairly ruthless in its willingness to do in its characters, especially compared with something like \u003cem\u003eStranger Things\u003c/em\u003e. But it also has themes of reconciliation, forgiveness, healing, and even anti-racism, all of which sit oddly beside the source material’s straightforward, scare-the-kids-so-badly-they-never-sleep-again ethos. Colletti and Garza have excellent chemistry; their scenes together sizzle. But is anyone going to this film to see a teen romance, no matter how convincingly portrayed? It was always going to be a challenge to adapt a book of short stories, but Øvredal really seems to have gone out of his way to irritate his core audience. It’s an odd choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"6jzWAT\"\u003eOdd choices aren’t always bad choices, though. Gradually, it becomes clear that the story Øvredal wants to tell is about childhood trauma — specifically, about what parents do to, and expect from, their children. Stella’s mother abandoned her, which is part of why she forms such a quick, unhealthy connection with Sarah, whose parents abused her. One of Stella’s friends is attacked after his parents decide to leave him without notice overnight; another is pursued by a hideous, bloated creature who looks like a parody of a pregnant woman. Parents, the movie suggests, are writing their kids’ stories, and what they write is death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"9DT2la\"\u003eThat may seem paranoid. But in 1968, it was literally true. Those televisions in the background often show images of Vietnam. One shows Richard Nixon, lying as per usual, as he talks about how he doesn’t want to drop bombs. This background tale about the necessity of war and the need for men to fight entangles a number of the male characters. One high school kid who disappears prompts his peers to speculate that he may have just gone off to the army early because he was so eager to kill communists. A war story substitutes for a horror story, and at least one of them is the true tale of why a boy isn’t coming home.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BBSR5wtEuw7YYM9Bi8LNBPa6A-4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18956514/ScaryStories3.jpg\"\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"slN0eB\"\u003eThe 1968 setting isn’t a fun retro jaunt. It’s part of the film’s meditation on how the world is made up of stories and how those stories trap people. Placing the film in the past is a way of framing it as fiction; it’s occurring once upon a time. The true story of the 1968 election is slotted in beside false stories of the supernatural, even as Stella and her friends try to research Sarah’s true history, which is eventually written down, then received as a fictional story. Truth and lies slide around each other, tying knots around children’s lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"llx8Ie\"\u003e”You don’t read the book. The book reads you,” Stella declares, in a campy, melodramatic line. But \u003cem\u003eScary Stories \u003c/em\u003eis remarkably insightful and sober in its assessment of the way stories control people, rather than the other way around. “This person is insane, so we can torture her.” “That person must go overseas and shoot a stranger.” Quentin Tarantino’s \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/26/8931587/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-quentin-tarantino-review-golden-era-tribute\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e \u003c/em\u003ewas supposed to be the summer’s virtuoso meta-fiction, but its rewritten happy ending, musing on the impotence of writing, seems a lot less bleak than \u003cem\u003eScary Stories\u003c/em\u003e’ acknowledgment that some scripts will take you far away where you’ll never be seen again. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Mi61tE\"\u003eThat’s not to say that the ending, which clumsily gestures toward a sequel, is perfect — nor, for that matter, is the film as a whole. Like the title says, the movie has more than one tale to tell, and the disjunction in tone and purpose is sometimes jarring or just inexplicable. (Why is there a car chase in this movie?) But Øvredal is to be commended for simultaneously staying true to a beloved franchise and twisting its head around to face in an unexpected direction. Thanks to him, the film isn’t just a collection of scary stories. It’s a meditation on why the stories we tell ourselves shape us and why that’s the scary bit.\u003c/p\u003e","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/9/20798564/scary-stories-to-tell-in-the-dark-movie-review-alvin-schwartz-horror-adaptation","published":"2019-08-09T15:57:12Z","guid":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/9/20798564/scary-stories-to-tell-in-the-dark-movie-review-alvin-schwartz-horror-adaptation"},{"title":"Vergecast: Galaxy Note 10 appears, Disney gets a streaming bundle, and Apple uses Siri recordings","content":"\u003cimg alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-xoKoO03wh4CD3gSys6o5KCNGH8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/64983008/cwelch_190806_3577_0002.0.jpg\" /\u003e\n\n  \u003csmall\u003ePhoto by Chris Welch / The Verge\u003c/small\u003e\n\n  \u003cp id=\"oyL8tv\"\u003eThis week on \u003cem\u003eThe Vergecast\u003c/em\u003e, Nilay Patel, Dieter Bohn, and Paul Miller run through Samsung’s Unpacked event where we got \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/7/20754566/samsung-galaxy-note-10-plus-2-size-price-release-date-s-pen-dex-laptop-unpacked-event\"\u003eour first look at the Galaxy Note 10\u003c/a\u003e.

\u003csmall\u003eIllustration by Alex Castro / The Verge\u003c/small\u003e\n\n  \u003cp id=\"iaw-4\"\u003eApple’s Face ID biometric security can be misled using a pair of glasses with tape attached to them, security researchers from Tencent have discovered. \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/23/18194566/amazon-scout-autonomous-six-wheeled-delivery-robot\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eThreatPost\u003c/em\u003e reports\u003c/a\u003e that the method is able to fool Face ID into thinking someone’s eyes are open, meaning it could allow hackers to gain access to a locked iPhone while its owner is asleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"iaw-5\"\u003eThe reality of the hack, however, means that it’s unlikely to be of much practical use in a real-world context. A hacker would need to literally place a pair of glasses onto their target without them noticing, and then hold their phone up in front of them. It would be much easier for someone to simply force a target to look at their device, like one FBI agent \u003ca href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2018/09/30/feds-force-suspect-to-unlock-apple-iphone-x-with-their-face/#18bd74801259\"\u003edid last year\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-float-right\"\u003e\u003caside id=\"q7CD0P\"\u003e\u003cq\u003eTouch ID was hacked within 24 hours of release\u003c/q\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"iaw-6\"\u003eTencent’s discovery sheds an interesting light on how Apple’s latest biometric security process works, however. The researchers realized that when a subject is wearing glasses, Face ID only tries to look for 2D rather than 3D information from the eye area. It’s then relatively easy to fake this 2D information with a black piece of tape with a white spot on it, which Face ID then mistakes for an open eye as part of its “liveness detection” mechanism. (You can see a picture of these so-called “X-Glasses” in \u003ca href=\"https://threatpost.com/researchers-bypass-apple-faceid-using-biometrics-achilles-heel/147109/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eThreatPost’s\u003c/em\u003e report\u003c/a\u003e.) Since the rest of the face matches the iPhone’s biometric record, the phone unlocks. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"iaw-7\"\u003eThis isn’t the first time security researchers have claimed to have discovered a vulnerability with Face ID. Back in 2017, \u003ca href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/hackers-say-broke-face-id-security/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eWired\u003c/em\u003e reported\u003c/a\u003e that the Vietnamese research firm Bkav released a video showing them unlocking someone’s phone using a complicated silicone mask with 2D eyes and lips printed on paper. However, this method relied on the team having access to either detailed measurements or a digital scan of their target’s face, which isn’t easy to come by.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"iaw-8\"\u003eIn contrast, Apple’s previous biometric security method, Touch ID, was hacked \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2013/9/22/4759128/chaos-computer-club-biometric-hack-apple-touch-id\"\u003ewithin 24 hours of first going on sale\u003c/a\u003e, and it relies on having just a single high-resolution photograph of a fingerprint left behind on a surface. The following year, one security researcher showed how they could use these techniques to construct a working model of the German defense minister’s fingerprint \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2016/5/2/11540962/iphone-samsung-fingerprint-duplicate-hack-security\"\u003eusing a high-resolution photo of their hand\u003c/a\u003e. You could also, obviously, just hold a target’s finger on their phone while they’re sleeping — no glasses required.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"WXl3fh\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/9/20798569/face-id-hack-black-hat-conference-2018-glasses-tape","published":"2019-08-09T15:11:22Z","guid":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/9/20798569/face-id-hack-black-hat-conference-2018-glasses-tape"},{"title":"I let strangers design my apartment","content":"\u003cimg alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CRV0HBB4cWnqcMnU378aY9xFpP0=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/64982911/tr_cb2115a6_bb65_4565_b804_416ff1765caf_613932_4_elsie_userview_22.0.jpg\" /\u003e\n\n\n\n  \u003cp\u003eIf you hate redecorating, make someone else do it for you\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class=\"p--has-dropcap p-large-text\" id=\"IRdrxD\"\u003eSome people have the ability to walk into a furniture store and pick out various pieces of housewares that appear seemingly mismatched but somehow work perfectly together when placed in a room. I am not one of those people. I moved in June and decided that after years of having a sloppily put together 20-something’s apartment, I was ready for something that felt more composed and intentional. If I wanted to fake being an adult, at the very least I could try to have an adult-looking apartment, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"anqDhC\"\u003eFaced with this task, I looked to e-interior design services for help. You may have seen ads about them in your inbox, Instagram, or on flyers at your local big brand furniture store. These services promise to make revamping your home as easy as a few clicks on a computer, so I put a few of them to the test to see if paying someone to restyle your house is worth the investment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"j0z8Oo\"\u003eControl\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"L0gEaX\"\u003eFor the project, my boyfriend and I were willing to invest up to $3,000 on new furnishings and art (about a fourth of that budget I anticipate to make back in selling furniture we’re replacing). Our small (but reasonably sizable, for New York City) apartment needed the most work in the living / dining room, which is open to the kitchen. We cook at home a decent amount, but never have enough people over for a formal dining space. We do have friends over frequently to hang, drink, and play games, so we wanted the room to feel light, bright, and easy for multiple people to maneuver around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"2TGOtM\"\u003eWhile we were flexible about furniture choices, we did have some pieces we wanted to keep, like the gray / wood armchair I dragged home through the streets of Brooklyn on my own in the middle of August. There was no way this thing’s going on Craigslist just yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YWVNqvF4CLiUFizxcMf1bijJn7U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18956279/214495936_1.jpg\"\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"CnBJVR\"\u003eNaturally, there were some design challenges with the space itself. First, the apartment features steel floors, and we wanted a little bit of warmth to counter the industrial vibes. Second, we’re on the top floor, which has a sloped ceiling from the roof in the living room. Lastly, there is a brick feature wall that we cannot mount anything on, and it’s directly across from a west-facing window that could add glare to a TV.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"vhhGYo\"\u003eKeeping these factors in mind, I tried out four different services to see how our main space could be laid out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch1 id=\"h2rypO\"\u003eRoomstyler 3D Room Planner\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p--has-dropcap\" id=\"tOy7IU\"\u003eTrying to stretch as much of my budget as possible, I first tried a few free services for modeling my soon-to-be home. Some light Googling led me to \u003ca href=\"https://livingspaces.roomstyler.com/\"\u003eRoomstyler\u003c/a\u003e, a 3D rendering tool for mocking up rooms and furnishing them with select furniture pieces from a catalog. This seemed like a good start for envisioning how we could lay out some of the items that would make the move with us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"XL22yA\"\u003eBefore moving in, I took photos of the unit (old tenant’s things and all) and measured all the walls and windows. The tool lets you click and drag walls around to fit any irregularly shaped rooms, or specify wall length and height. You may not find exact matches for your home materials but you can get pretty close. There were no options for steel floors that I could find, for example, but dark grey brick replicated the feel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-wide-block\"\u003e  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pA_pWh0g2VZRmAmrOkiyIZt04K8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18956290/Screen_Shot_2019_08_09_at_9.32.12_AM.png\"\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"tsMXYj\"\u003eChoosing the wall colors and floor felt surprisingly zen until I got to the furniture layout portion. While you can choose any color under the sun to virtually paint your room, the furniture selection tool is super clunky to use. A search for sectionals offered up hundreds of results, but filtering by color suddenly slimmed the results down to one or two options, even though there were clearly pieces that fit what I wanted when I didn’t clarify color choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-float-left c-float-hang\"\u003e\u003caside id=\"K6H8av\"\u003e\u003cq\u003eIt felt like re-creating a West Elm showroom by memory using only stuff from Walmart\u003c/q\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"h4MM0H\"\u003eSome categories would also randomly disappear. A look under home entertainment did not offer anything resembling at TV I could stick into the room for a visual, even if it wasn’t my exact model. And I couldn’t find a single art piece to place on the wall to create any kind of interest in the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"f1j2sk\"\u003eI got so tired of scrolling through options that I just plopped a couple of items in there to visualize the space. Eventually, I felt embarrassed by the duckling I’d created. The room looked as if I was trying to re-create a West Elm showroom by memory using only stuff I can get from a local Walmart.

While there are plenty of apps on the market for placing furniture in your home, I decided to go with \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/20/16339006/apple-ios-11-arkit-ikea-place-ar-app\"\u003eIkea Place\u003c/a\u003e as it was one of the first furniture AR apps. Presumably, two years of existence might have given it some leverage over newer apps. Plus, there is an Ikea close to me, which would make the decoration process faster if we ended up with a layout we liked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"UYsZvU\"\u003eMy presumptions failed me. Ikea says it has thousands of items from its catalog on the free AR shopping app, but I could not find a single floating wall shelf to stick onto my wall for visuals, forcing me to resize a media console for effect. Like Roomstyler 3D, there was also a lack of art options as these tools mostly focused on large furniture items for rudimentary layouts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"aqJ9A4\"\u003eThe problem with AR, too, is unless everything has been virtually placed, some items might not take foreground into effect. That left me with planters I couldn’t stick in a corner next to a media console, or chairs I couldn’t place behind a coffee table. Scale was also an issue, as each time I moved things up or down the items tended to dramatically shrink or expand, making it difficult to lay things out in a realistic way. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-wide-block\"\u003e  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qbAIsNCp_Mlkj--gaMYmAFOJd9c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18956371/Screenshot_20190709_161554.png\"\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003eOh... dear.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"iR3wFx\"\u003eI applaud the folks working with AR to create interesting use cases, like on-location work training.

The service promises to create a mood board, layout, and a shopping list to help make implementing the design easy — all under a flat rate instead of an hourly bill you might get with an in-person designer. (Havenly starts at $19 for a consultation, while the full experience is $169 for a bare room, with help on where to lay out each piece.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"RvEkry\"\u003eHavenly starts with a style quiz where you select photos of rooms you like and answer a few personality questions. You can select the level at which you want to be involved in the process, or say screw it and let your designer take the wheels. Then, you’re presented with a few color schemes and mood boards to rate, before you’re asked to upload photos of the room and any relevant inspiration pics. All this information allows Havenly to match you with an in-house designer that best suits your style and needs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-wide-block\"\u003e  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0AOpqwWJX_daaxnUgTw9aibyFxk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18956375/Screen_Shot_2019_07_09_at_11.54.43_AM.png\"\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"pjB9Hv\"\u003eIf you’re impatient, here’s where the service might start to get annoying. Havenly has a modest group of designers it works with, which means if your aesthetic best matches someone who’s currently working on several projects, you might end up waiting a while until they can start yours (not unlike sought-after designers in real life).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-float-right c-float-hang\"\u003e\u003caside id=\"fLRYAf\"\u003e\u003cq\u003eToward the end, I settled\u003c/q\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"4T5gDF\"\u003eAnd once they finally get started, they’re going to start asking you more questions, with a day or two in between each response. I began my style quiz on April 19th and heard back from Cathrine, my paired designer, on April 28th. She gave me some initial mood boards on May 1st, and sent a revision on May 6th after I rated them on a four-star scale. You’re also able to rate individual pieces in the mood board so your designer knows what exactly in the room you love or hate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"RJsIGe\"\u003eThe first few mood boards felt like a good start, but as the process went on we continued to have the same feedback on tiny things, like coffee table and art choices.

Toward the end, I just accepted that this is the best we were going to do. I did like the multiple layout options our designer provided, the varying floor plans, and the unisex color scheme I hadn’t previously thought of. It also felt like everything in the design was within our budget, give or take a few key decorative pieces (the mirror and wall lamp felt less urgent than the sectional and media console, and doing without them for the time being did not lose the entire aesthetic).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"T0V3t9\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUse if you:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"A0uA5y\"\u003eAre willing to take the time to revise until you get what you want.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"M6mcKj\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDon’t use if you:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"uRIrnu\"\u003eAre impatient.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch1 id=\"61stMI\"\u003eModsy\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p--has-dropcap\" id=\"xaiee9\"\u003eConcurrent with Havenly, I also started a project on \u003ca href=\"https://www.modsy.com/\"\u003eModsy\u003c/a\u003e, a competing e-interior design tool. The main difference is that Modsy will also render a 3D version of your room which you can use to view multiple angles. The service also partners with several popular retailers so you can swap in a piece of furniture with something else from its catalog if you don’t like what the designer has created for you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"yk19DL\"\u003eModsy starts similarly to Havenly, where you fill out a style quiz by picking photos of rooms you’re more drawn to, like or dislike pieces of furniture in the example designs you chose, and explain the goals of your project. Then you upload photos of your room to cover a 360-degree view.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-wide-block\"\u003e  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KSZRofZIgw_mFe8P27Ae6zknHnk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18956403/Screen_Shot_2019_07_09_at_12.04.17_PM.png\"\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"wJ8oCJ\"\u003eI was unable to get a good 360-degree angle of the room since the previous tenants were in the process of moving out, so using the few photos I had, I stitched them together in a super choppy way, alongside some images from the apartment’s real estate listing. Modsy somehow managed to take the mangled photo I slapped together and made a reasonably realistic render of the room, with only the floor color represented incorrectly.

While they were a great start, the designs felt a bit bare. It also felt like Modsy blew through my budget by suggesting not one, but two West Elm shelves in addition to a new sectional. Thankfully, it does partner with several retailers with 3D renders of their catalog available to you, so you can change out pieces you don’t love with something else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"K7piZQ\"\u003eThis was by far Modsy’s main advantage over other services. I could erase excess embellishments that I didn’t care for, or replace items with less expensive versions or a different color to change up the scheme.

(And maybe it’s because I am a Googleable figure, but after providing Modsy feedback that our household loves to travel, I couldn’t help but notice the JFK to Tokyo wall art in the back, clearly a nod to a \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2erH_yo7-c\"\u003eprevious video\u003c/a\u003e I did for \u003cem\u003eThe Verge.\u003c/em\u003e)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"BsHZlj\"\u003eModsy also came to our rescue when we started unpacking our stuff and realized we had a lot more art than we thought, and didn’t know what to do with them. I sent the team photos of all our mismatched pieces of art and Modsy was able to render how to hang them on the wall in ways I wouldn’t have thought to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Qfd2fm\"\u003eIn the end, our budget only allowed us to buy a few staple pieces that Modsy recommended. And while I loved what the designer created for the second half of our living room, currently I have repurposed this area as a review “room” for an upcoming gadget, so hopefully we’ll be able to see the dining area design through in a few months.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"g530y3\"\u003eIn comparison with Havenly, Modsy starts at a higher price point at $69 for a slower turnaround time (seven to 14 days) and $149 for the base package for one room (five to 10 days). But the premium feels justifiable, giving you more flexibility to experiment on your own without necessarily waiting for the designer to send back a mockup. Still, though, it is clear that Modsy makes most of its money from referral purchases you make through its designs, and often you’ll get renders with a bunch of little pieces you might not want or need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"E79cY8\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUse if you:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"LmAPNe\"\u003eAre indecisive / need to see a lot of options before deciding on something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"wUQkce\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDon’t use if you:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"JWEUz6\"\u003eNeed to stick to a strict budget.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"p-fullbleed-block\"\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"ERZmro\"\u003e\u003cdiv data-anthem-component=\"imageslider:8773864\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p--has-dropcap\" id=\"xairNF\"\u003eWhile these services had their merits and disadvantages, if I had to go through the process again with another room, I would probably choose Modsy. For someone who lacks a design eye, it was helpful to see exactly how things were supposed to be placed. The catalog of items that you can swap in and out of your design also made it easy to try out a bunch of options in case the pieces Modsy picked didn’t work for you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"mEbdRZ\"\u003eThat said, there is a personal flair to Havenly, too. You’re interacting directly with a human being, which gives you the chance to communicate exactly what you want. But if all this is too much work, then your best option is to go the old-school route of actually working with a real-life interior designer, who you can pay to do the work down to hanging up photos and laying out your rugs. Plus, it’s always nice to support local, independent artists when you can afford to. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"c-end-para\" id=\"IsNWcU\"\u003eBut as my former colleague Kaitlyn Tiffany says, \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2016/5/25/11763286/blue-apron-vs-plated-hello-fresh-box-meal-delivery-cost-reviews\"\u003elife is expensive\u003c/a\u003e, and you have to pick your luxuries.

/\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen you think about obstacles to automation, without fail, our brains go to the hard stuff. The mind jumps to actions like the lack of financing, investors not getting on board, not having the right technology, etc. In reality, what keeps companies from diving into the deep end of automation has nothing to do with any of these reasons and \u003cem\u003eeverything\u003c/em\u003e to do with another fact. The business simply doesn\u0026#8217;t think they’re ready to make the leap or realize how easy it can be to get started. Look at the four obstacles to automation, and get over them now. You’ll wonder why you didn’t do it sooner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFour of the most common reasons companies don’t automate.

I had been doing the same mundane data entry task over and over until I thought, \u0026#8220;there has to be a better way.\u0026#8221; Through a little bit of pain, I learned how to create some automation in my job. It eliminated the small task and led me more time to focus on the insights after the data entry. The automation made things better once I mentally removed the obstacle. Sometimes automation can cause a little bit of pain upfront but lead to dividends in the end.

This mindset doesn’t allow for inevitable errors and growing pains. Is automation worth it? Absolutely. But to think that automation is the answer to all your business prayers is a mistake. As with all aspects in your business, automation is only as good as the team you hire, the strategy you deploy, the content you produce, the data you analyze, etc. In other words, there are a lot of “quality” factors at play to truly get the best out of automating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAutomation is a process, not a magic pill, but it may shine a light on where you need to improve. Automation isn\u0026#8217;t going to mask or solve long-term product issues, but it surely can be a key to your future success as a business. Adding automation can expand your resources and reach without adding more salary. It can also improve morale for data-heavy jobs and create a reliable infrastructure to build upon for the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLast but not least:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCreators of automation in the workspace can take many different roles.

foot in Iraq. Born in Greece to Iraqi refugee parents, he immigrated to the United States with his family via a refugee resettlement program 40 years ago, when he was just 15 months old. He considered himself American and knew hardly anything of Iraqi society. Still, on the afternoon of June 4, he found himself wandering the arrivals terminal of Al Najaf International Airport, about 100 miles south of Baghdad, with around $50, some insulin for his diabetes, and the clothes on his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAldaoud was used to getting by with little. For most of his adult life, he had experienced homelessness, working odd jobs, and stealing loose change from cars as he grappled with mental illness. But that was in the relative comfort of his hometown — for decades, he rarely strayed more than a few miles from his parents’ house in Hazel Park, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit. He had no idea how to survive in Iraq, and he was unprepared to make a run at it; he hadn’t known his deportation would come so soon, and officials with Immigration and Customs Enforcement wouldn’t let him call his family before they sent him off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAldaoud spoke no Arabic, had no known family in Iraq, and nobody knew he was there.

He was one of a number of people who have been deported as a result of an ongoing ICE crackdown on Iraqi communities — a crackdown advocates say has recklessly placed deportees in danger. His mental illness, his lack of language skills and connections, and his struggle with diabetes — the likely cause of his untimely passing — made Aldaoud especially vulnerable. His story was intended to raise alarms about the possible human toll of ICE’s actions. Now, it’s a testament to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He died alone,” said Mary Bolis, one of Aldaoud’s three sisters. “It’s unfair.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cu\u003eFor two years,\u003c/u\u003e the Trump administration has been trying to deport Iraqis with longstanding removal orders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 until recently, the Iraqi government — citing logistical, political, and humanitarian concerns — largely refused to repatriate its deportable nationals. Under President Barack Obama, ICE and the State Department \u003ca href=\"https://www.aclumich.org/sites/default/files/field_documents/473-5exhibit1-03_december302016emailfromafenzeltobkoontzre_iraqice-02.pdf\"\u003etried on several occasions\u003c/a\u003e to convince Baghdad to cooperate in the deportation process, but to no avail. Shortly after taking office, the Trump administration \u003ca href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/ice-iraq-chaldeans/\"\u003eramped up the pressure\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt started with the travel ban. In January 2017, a week after his inauguration, President Donald Trump signed an \u003ca href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-protecting-nation-foreign-terrorist-entry-united-states/\"\u003eexecutive order\u003c/a\u003e barring nationals from seven majority-Muslim countries from entering the United States.

That March, after a federal court struck down the first iteration of the Muslim ban, Trump signed a \u003ca href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-protecting-nation-foreign-terrorist-entry-united-states-2/\"\u003enew one\u003c/a\u003e, this time with Iraq removed from the list.

While he was incarcerated, ICE placed a detainer on him, letting the jail know that agents planned to pick him up upon release. On the morning of June 8, 2017, ICE agents transferred Aldaoud to the Northeast Ohio Correctional Center in Youngstown.

As soon as ICE launched the raids, \u003ca href=\"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2017/09/michigans-iraqi-chaldean-community-is-fighting-to-protect-dozens-of-people-from-deportation.html\"\u003eChaldean community leaders\u003c/a\u003e recruited the help of large legal nonprofits, including the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan, to sue to prevent the impending deportations — teeing up what was to become a long and hard-fought legal battle. Meanwhile, Aldaoud and 350 others like him sat in ICE detention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cu\u003eAccording to his\u003c/u\u003e sisters, Aldaoud was a joy to grow up with. “He was amazing. His teachers would love him and want more of him in their classroom,” said Nagham Shamoon, his older sister. But he and their father — who suffered from alcoholism, according to the sisters — would constantly butt heads, and Aldaoud’s life took a turn for the worse when their dad threw him out of the house at the age of 16.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter getting kicked out, Aldaoud dropped out of high school and turned to drugs, according to his sisters, which began a cycle of homelessness and incarceration that would define his life for the next 25 years. In his late teens, he also started to show signs of mental illness; although it appears that he was never officially diagnosed, his sisters say that doctors told them that he fit the profile of someone experiencing bipolar schizoaffective disorder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGetting thrown out of the house also affected Aldaoud’s immigration status. Shortly after he moved out, his mother, father, and older sister began the process of becoming U.S. citizens (his two younger sisters were born in the United States). But Aldaoud kept the “legal permanent resident” status to which all refugees resettled to the U.S. are entitled and which, under U.S. immigration law, can be revoked if one is convicted of any of a \u003ca href=\"https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid%3AUSC-prelim-title8-section1227\u0026amp;num=0\u0026amp;edition=prelim#0-0-0-246\"\u003elong list of crimes\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven when they weren’t living together, Aldaoud and his father continued to fight well into Aldaoud’s 20s. The confrontations would sometimes turn physical, and Aldaoud’s dad, now deceased, would often call the cops on him. Once in 1998, then again in 2004, Aldaoud landed assault convictions. They were the first of many infractions — including obstructing a police officer, breaking and entering, larceny, marijuana possession, and disorderly conduct — that ICE would use to justify his removal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c!-- BLOCK(photo)[3](%7B%7D)(%7B%22scroll%22%3Afalse%2C%22align%22%3A%22center%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22915px%22%7D) --\u003e\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-center  width-fixed' style='width: 915px;'\u003e\u003c!-- CONTENT(photo)[3] --\u003e\n\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-262903\" src=\"https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/08/jimmy-young-1565316022-915x1024.jpg\" alt=\"jimmy-young-1565316022\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"caption\"\u003eA family photo of Aldaoud in his teens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class='caption source' style=''\u003ePhoto: Courtesy of Mary Bolis\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- END-CONTENT(photo)[3] --\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c!-- END-BLOCK(photo)[3] --\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAldaoud’s sisters say there’s no way he would have intentionally hurt anyone: “He’d never hurt a fly — to this day would never hurt a fly,” Mary, two years his junior, told The Intercept before he died. Still, with his precarious immigration status, his convictions rendered him deportable. In 2005, he tried to head off deportation by applying for asylum. “Ive been in the United States my whole life (besides when I was one year old),” he wrote in his application. He claimed to fear “strangers over there attacking me for being an American.” But in November of that year, a judge ordered him removed from the country.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the next 12 years, Aldaoud continued to live his life in Michigan. He was known by patrol officers to be homeless and suffering from addiction. According to police reports, he sometimes squatted in abandoned houses, and he spent most of his waking hours near the intersection of 8 Mile and John R Roads in Hazel Park, just a 3-minute drive from his parents’ home. Every few months he would get caught stealing change from unlocked cars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was jailed frequently, which caused him a lot of stress. Incident reports filed by corrections officers indicate that, while in county jail, Aldaoud would eat as much candy as he could get his hands on in an effort to irritate his diabetes and trigger hospitalization. He knew that, after he was sent to the hospital, jail officials would likely release him into the care of his mother. He loved and depended on his mother. In a brief call with The Intercept a month before he died, Aldaoud said that life became much harder for him when she passed away in 2015.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cu\u003eIn July 2017,\u003c/u\u003e as Aldaoud approached his eighth week in ICE detention, a federal judge in Detroit \u003ca href=\"https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/hamama-v-adducci-opinion-and-order-granting-petitioners-motion-preliminary-injunction\"\u003eissued a decision\u003c/a\u003e on the ACLU’s lawsuit. The ruling barred the government from deporting most eligible Iraqis until they had a chance to argue their individual cases for fear-based relief in immigration court — a huge win for Iraqi communities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the battle was far from over. Government lawyers promptly filed challenges, so it was unclear how much time Iraqis had to get in front of a judge before ICE would be allowed to resume its crackdown. And with a nationwide backlog of more than \u003ca href=\"https://trac.syr.edu/immigration/reports/536/\"\u003e1 million cases\u003c/a\u003e, it can take years to get a date in immigration court.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, ICE refused to release those Iraqis it had detained while the courts were processing their claims. It wasn’t until November 2018— nearly a year and a half after the initial raids — that a judge ordered ICE to release the\u003ca href=\"https://www.aclumich.org/sites/default/files/field_documents/judge_goldsmith_ruling_to_release_iraqi_nationals.pdf\"\u003e final 110 Iraqis\u003c/a\u003e it was holding in detention, including Aldaoud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, however, victory was short-lived.

Christopher Schaedig, a Michigan-based civil litigation attorney, volunteered to represent Aldaoud pro bono, and he managed to secure a May 2018 hearing in immigration court. Aldaoud had a winnable case, Schaedig told The Intercept. Like many of the other Iraqis, he was applying for protection based on the U.S.’s status as a signatory to the Convention Against Torture, and Schaedig had expert testimony lined up that would attest to the persecution of Christians in Iraq.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut on the day of the hearing, the judge had to postpone proceedings after the Department of Justice lawyer trying the case realized he had prosecuted one of Aldaoud’s old criminal charges and had to recuse himself. Aldaoud became agitated, according to Schaedig and Aldaoud’s sisters. Despite the postponement having nothing to do with Schaedig’s work, Aldaoud fired him in open court and decided to proceed without representation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a move Schaedig and Aldaoud’s sisters attributed to Aldaoud’s mental health troubles — and it wasn’t the first time he had pulled it. During the criminal trial for a home invasion charge in 2012, Aldaoud fired his court-appointed attorney and declared that he wished to represent himself. The court struggled with the question of whether he was competent enough, and the ordeal went all the way to the \u003ca href=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/2774130/people-of-michigan-v-jimmy-aldaoud/\"\u003eMichigan Court of Appeals\u003c/a\u003e, which ultimately tossed his conviction because a judge didn’t adequately explain to Aldaoud the risks of acting as one’s own lawyer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Aldaoud lucked out in criminal court, immigration court wasn’t nearly as amenable to his impulsiveness — not least because one isn’t legally guaranteed counsel in immigration proceedings. Without Schaedig’s representation, he lost his case for protection. He was released from ICE detention with all the other Iraqis in December 2018 with a GPS tracker, which he immediately removed, and  by late May, ICE agents had arrested him again on the street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cu\u003eWhile going through\u003c/u\u003e customs in Najaf Airport, Aldaoud — anxious and on the verge of breakdown — encountered an immigration officer who spoke some English. The officer asked for his passport, but Aldaoud didn’t have one. He asked Aldaoud if he spoke any Arabic; Aldaoud said that he didn’t. He asked about family or friends in the area, to which Aldaoud responded that all he had were his sisters back in the United States. So the officer, Ahmed Alboshweb, let him use his phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tried calling his youngest sister, Rita Bolis, but she wouldn’t pick up. At 7:09 a.m. Michigan time, he left her a voice memo over the messaging service WhatsApp: “Rita!” he exclaimed. “I’m in Iraq! … Please, Rita, just answer the phone when you wake up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[5](%7B%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22right%22%7D) --\u003e\u003cblockquote class=\"stylized pull-right\" data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"right\"\u003e\u003c!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[5] --\u003e“Rita!

Mary spent the rest of the day on the phone trying to figure out why her brother was deported without her and her sisters knowing — and, more importantly, how to get him settled in safely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat Aldaoud was in Najaf in southern Iraq, instead of Baghdad to where most U.S. deportees have been flown, was of particular concern. According to Daniel Smith, an Iraq-based human rights researcher, Najaf is a Shia stronghold in a country where mostly Shia militias have, for years and with the \u003ca href=\"http://www.cvt.org/sites/default/files/attachments/u11/downloads/ReclaimingHope_01042016.pdf\"\u003egovernment’s acquiescence\u003c/a\u003e, persecuted ethnic and religious minorities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s not as it there’s an open “pogrom” of Christians or outsiders in the south, Smith said, “but if someone does want to victimize you in some way, you’re not necessarily protected from it.” He added that it was “crazy” and “irresponsible” for ICE to send Aldaoud to Najaf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBelkis Wille, a senior Iraq researcher at Human Rights Watch, added that Aldaoud’s deportation to Najaf — and to Iraq in general — was especially dangerous considering that he was never given the identification documents needed to navigate the country. This has been an issue for all deportees from the U.S.; as Human Rights Watch \u003ca href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/12/20/us-deporting-iraqis-without-valid-documents\"\u003ehas documented\u003c/a\u003e, there are checkpoints in virtually every neighborhood in Iraq. Without a way to prove one’s identity — and no family support or language skills to get out of a tight situation — deportees are highly vulnerable to arrest or detention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[6](%7B%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22left%22%7D) --\u003e\u003cblockquote class=\"stylized pull-left\" data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"left\"\u003e\u003c!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[6] --\u003eIt was “crazy” and “irresponsible” for ICE to send Aldaoud to Najaf.\u003c!-- END-CONTENT(pullquote)[6] --\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c!-- END-BLOCK(pullquote)[6] --\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd detention very often leads to torture, said Smith, which is “a routine tool of interrogation” and “doesn’t have to come from a place of hostility in Iraq.” (ICE did not respond to The Intercept’s repeated questions regarding why Aldaoud was sent to Najaf and why the agency isn’t ensuring that Iraqis are able to procure identity documents before their deportation.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith these dangers in mind, a ragtag group quickly mobilized to ensure Aldaoud’s safety. His sisters contacted ACLU lawyers, who got in touch with a Baghdad-based lawyer from Heartland Alliance, an anti-poverty nonprofit, who then booked a hotel for Aldaoud in Najaf. Moved by Aldaoud’s story, Alboshweb, the immigration officer, was also eager to help, he told The Intercept in an interview in mid-July. “Don’t worry, I’m with you. I’m security man. Don’t worry,” he said he told him. He gave him some food and a cigarette and helped him check into his hotel room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeartland Alliance also contacted Samir Kada, a Michigan Chaldean who had to leave his wife and eight kids behind when he was deported in November 2018. Unlike most other deportees, Kada has family connections in Baghdad, and he had been able to obtain identity documents for himself a few weeks prior to Aldaoud’s arrival. He quickly gathered a paid crew to pose as Aldaoud’s family and procured a fake ID to get him past checkpoints. Two days after Aldaoud’s arrival, Kada drove to Najaf to pick him up and bring him safely to Baghdad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cu\u003eAs in Michigan,\u003c/u\u003e Aldaoud was effectively homeless in Baghdad, and he was constantly distraught. According to his sisters, he would often say that he would rather live in jail in the United States than on the streets in Iraq. “It wasn’t home for him,” said Mary. During a brief the call with The Intercept, Aldaoud said he spent his days “staring at the wall.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough he would call his sisters often, Aldaoud relied heavily on Kada, his only real support in Iraq. He would sometimes stay at Kada’s apartment, and Kada would often run errands for him. The most important of those errands involved replenishing Aldaoud’s insulin supply — though Kada said he questioned the quality of the insulin he was able to obtain in Iraq.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast weekend, Kada flew to Egypt to take care of a medical emergency of his own: He needed surgery for a stomach condition. Soon after he left, Aldaoud fell violently ill. Aldaoud called Mary, who got in touch with Kada, and they tried to convince him to go the hospital. He refused several times, according to his sisters. He was scared; while he vomited, he cried out for his mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn Monday, Aldaoud finally agreed to seek help, so Kada organized a ride to take Aldaoud to the hospital. In the hospital, doctors gave Aldaoud an IV and shots, according to Kada and Aldaoud’s sisters, and after a few hours, they discharged him, and he went to stay in Kada’s apartment. The next morning, Kada, still in Egypt, sent someone to check on him. He was on the floor, dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He was scared and alone,” said Mary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[7](%7B%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22center%22%7D) --\u003e\u003cblockquote class=\"stylized pull-center\" data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"center\"\u003e\u003c!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[7] --\u003e“They just picked up a random homeless person from Detroit and threw him in Iraq.

Meu tio que morava no Rio foi até a clínica conosco. Para mim, seria só ficar paradinha recebendo as radiações que destruiriam o cavernoma (pelo menos o principal deles, o que mais trazia complicações). Não foi. Chegando lá, o radiologista explicou que teria que colocar uma coroa na minha cabeça, que teria de ser parafusada. Essa coroa ia medir a quantidade de radiação que eu receberia. Se a radiação fosse menor que o desejado, o efeito não seria alcançado. Se fosse maior, o cérebro poderia sofrer danos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlhei a coroa, os parafusos, as injeções e me desesperei. Mamãe segurou uma mão, papai a outra, e começaram as injeções de anestesia: duas na testa e duas na nuca. Mamãe desmaiou em seguida, pois ficou tocada demais com o que acontecia. Depois de instalada a coroa, fizeram a radiocirurgia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOs radiologistas falavam que levaria meses para que os efeitos pudessem ser percebidos em alguma tomografia e na ressonância magnética.

Havia também as questões estéticas. Engordei entre 15 e 20kg por causa dos remédios que comecei a tomar, mas consegui seguir a vida. Optei pelo tratamento conservador (exames anuais e consultas periódicas) e fui vivendo como dava.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMas o quão abrangente é o significado de “conseguir seguir a vida?\u0026#8221; É um “ficou tudo bem?\u0026#8221; Significa que superei todos os perrengues?

Although not a journalist, Lina Sergie Attar, who initially wrote under the pseudonym Amal Hanano, is in my mind one of the defining writers of the Syrian conflict; her essays, published in the \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/14/opinion/sunday/watching-my-beloved-aleppo-rip-itself-apart.html\"\u003eNew York Times\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2012/12/11/the-land-of-topless-minarets-and-headless-little-girls/\"\u003eForeign Policy\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/11/syrias-season-of-monsters-112988\"\u003ePolitico\u003c/a\u003e, and elsewhere, capture the deep pain of the Syrian experience, of watching our home country unravel from afar and being helpless to stop it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeven of the journalists who contributed to Hankir’s anthology spent some portion of the last eight years covering Syria; three of them are of Syrian descent. Their reflections on the evolution of their relationships with Syria felt deeply familiar to me, and their exploration of the links between the personal and the professional are likely to resonate with all journalists whose work intersects with their personal identities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c!-- BLOCK(photo)[6](%7B%7D)(%7B%22scroll%22%3Afalse%2C%22align%22%3A%22left%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22540px%22%7D) --\u003e\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-left  width-fixed' style='width: 540px;'\u003e\u003c!-- CONTENT(photo)[6] --\u003e\n\u003cimg class=\"alignleft size-article-medium wp-image-262563\" src=\"https://prod01-cdn06.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/08/Nour-Malas_courtesy-the-author-1565199875-540x675.jpg\" alt=\"Nour-Malas_courtesy-the-author-1565199875\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"caption\"\u003eNour Malas in 2019.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class='caption source' style=''\u003ePhoto: Courtesy Penguin Random House\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- END-CONTENT(photo)[6] --\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c!-- END-BLOCK(photo)[6] --\u003e“Syria: never the country I called home, but certainly my homeland,” writes Nour Malas, a Wall Street Journal reporter. “I would untangle the many shades of this identity at the very moment the country was coming undone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike Malas, I always knew I was from Syria, but I never felt fully Syrian. I was, after all, born and raised in the United States and barred from visiting Syria due to decades of entrenched political repression. It was the protests of 2011 that led me down the path of exploring my relationship to the country of my parents’ birth. I suddenly found myself bonding with people through our shared cultural heritage. I straddled the line between activist and aspiring journalist, using Facebook, Twitter, and Skype to forge connections with young Syrian protesters and media activists, many of whom eventually joined the exodus out of Syria.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a student, I wrote a handful of articles about Syria for niche publications like Syria Deeply and The Majalla.

It is, of course, possible to develop empathy without a personal connection to a story, but there is little that can come close to the feeling of being invested in adequately portraying the story of one’s homeland.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think often of the ways my familial background helped me forge relationships with Syrian strangers. Whether it was the Syrian refugees in Chicago who let me into their homes when I was a graduate student of journalism, or the Syrian women in Turkey who shared their experiences with me when I was \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/02/03/syrian-women-turkey-empowerment/\"\u003eon assignment \u003c/a\u003efor The Intercept, I have no doubt that my Syrian identity — and the fact that I spoke in Arabic in the same dialect as they did — opened those reporting doors for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich brings me to a more difficult question: Who benefits from these stories we tell? Who benefits when we use our proximity to the story to produce content for the Western gaze? Natacha Yazbeck reflects on this ethical conundrum: “I get thanked a lot for my dedication to the little Alis,” Yazbeck writes, remembering a young boy who was the sole survivor in his family of a massacre in Syria. “It is useful when you can talk to them in their own tongue, because it’s like you are one of them. It’s our capital in English, our brand. Our \u003cem\u003eraseed\u003c/em\u003e in Arabic. Our capital. We force our own names over little Ali’s and call it a byline.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe post \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/08/09/arab-women-journalists-book/\"\u003eThe Sharpest Lens on the Arab World Belongs to the Arab Women Reporting There\u003c/a\u003e appeared first on \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com\"\u003eThe Intercept\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://theintercept.com/2019/08/09/arab-women-journalists-book/","published":"2019-08-09T13:00:11Z","guid":"https://theintercept.com/?p=262543"}]},{"url":"https://off-guardian.org/feed/","items":[{"title":"India’s Tryst with Destiny","content":"","url":"https://off-guardian.org/2019/08/09/indias-tryst-with-destiny/","published":"2019-08-09T08:44:46Z","guid":"https://off-guardian.org/?p=61220"},{"title":"8chan: The Latest Fearporn Drive","content":"","url":"https://off-guardian.org/2019/08/09/8chan-the-latest-fearporn-drive/","published":"2019-08-09T14:47:33Z","guid":"https://off-guardian.org/?p=61246"}]},{"url":"https://www.eff.org/rss/updates.xml","items":[]},{"url":"https://www.wsws.org/en/rss.xml","items":[{"title":"The Mississippi raid: Trump’s attack on immigrants and his Democratic enablers","content":"","url":"http://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2019/08/09/pers-a09.html","published":"2019-08-09T05:00:00Z","guid":"http://www.wsws.org/asset/8f4b9dfe-dcd9-4e6e-bb11-4e8596d9830H/pers-a09.html"},{"title":"Chelsea Manning faces $441,000 in fines and another year in jail for refusing to testify against WikiLeaks","content":"","url":"http://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2019/08/09/mann-a09.html","published":"2019-08-09T05:00:00Z","guid":"http://www.wsws.org/asset/5153bc23-e8c3-4f55-bdd2-12ff6a407cdA/mann-a09.html"},{"title":"John Pilger warns: “Do not forget Assange.

To and Luen Group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTriads began as part of a patriotic movement to restore Ming rule in China in the 17th Century, but later turned to organised crime \u0026#8211; including drug trafficking, extortion and prostitution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is a clear hierarchy within a triad, less important and \u0026#8220;useful\u0026#8221; members \u0026#8211; usually those with a lower IQ \u0026#8211; can be \u0026#8220;deployed\u0026#8221; by other, higher up members into fighting and to carry out dangerous crimes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt has been reported that as technology evolves and China becomes more affluent, triads have ditched their traditional older ways of warfare and membership \u0026#8211; higher-ups now communicate over chat apps, rather than long sit-down meals, and visible triad tattoos and other gang signs are a thing of the past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c!--googleoff: all--\u003e\n\t\t\u003cdiv class=\"sun-grid-container
