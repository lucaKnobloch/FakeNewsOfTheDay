But the charge bears the echoes of the stock options backdating scandal that started before the global economic collapse and extended beyond, making executives wealthier at the expense of shareholders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOptions backdating was a common way for corporate boards to pass more compensation onto managers and directors. Stock options allow people to buy corporate shares at a pre-arranged price. In backdating, a board would edit the original option grants, changing the date to one when the price was lower, letting a person pay less and instantly net more money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe practice was controversial for two reasons. Although in theory legal, \u0026#8220;the place where these companies got into trouble was in the accounting,\u0026#8221; said Robin Ferracone, CEO of executive compensation consultancy Farient Advisors. \u0026#8220;You have to account for the extra value. It\u0026#8217;s like a new option. Lots of times the accounting was not done properly.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor many companies that were caught up in the scandals, backdating was an attempt to \u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/2007/04/26/on-the-theory-that-backdatings-not-illegal-if-you-account-for-it-correctly/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ehide the maneuver from investors\u003c/a\u003e and accountants, so the illegality wasn\u0026#8217;t a simple technical oversight. Such companies as Broadcom, \u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/apple/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eApple\u003c/a\u003e, Deloitte \u0026amp; Touche, and others got caught up in investigations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe reason CEOs and boards hid the activity was the second part of the controversy. Investors and workers became angry over well--if not lavishly--paid executives receiving extra consideration without delivering any more value. \u0026#8220;We don\u0026#8217;t get ours but you get yours,\u0026#8221; Ferracone phrased it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;I think it does go to the corporate culture,\u0026#8221; said Michael Klenov, an attorney with plaintiff law firm Korein Tillery. \u0026#8220;It\u0026#8217;s a one-way option for an executive and it sounds like it was done by the board at the expense at the shareholders. It seems the rules were changed to benefit the CEO.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt may be that the example at Nissan was a single occurrence without a sign of repeat offenses. Japanese laws are not necessarily the same as those in the U.S. Also, times have been good for investors for a long time. \u0026#8220;You earn 10% and you\u0026#8217;re not that worried about something that happened that kept you from earning 10.2%,\u0026#8221; Klenov said. \u0026#8220;But when stocks are down 20%, people are wondering.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBackdating in the U.S. has largely fallen away in the wake of Dodd-Frank.

Can Tesla hit its target without massive discounting and incentives that impact margins? Musk's body language when he talks about how the quarter is shaping up will be telling. Ben Kallo, an analyst at Robert W. Baird, thinks any update on deliveries or demand could be a positive catalyst. \"We continue to believe demand concerns are overblown, and we think a favorable update at the annual meeting could help further improve sentiment,\" Kallo wrote in a research note.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eDenholm\u0026#8217;s debut as chair\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobyn Denholm was appointed board chair Nov. 7 as part of the company's settlement agreement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Denholm was the chief financial officer of Australian telecommunications company Telstra, but she officially left Telstra in May and is expected to serve as board chair full time. Will Tesla use the meeting as an opportunity to introduce Denholm to its shareholders? Or will she stay out of the limelight, at least publicly deferring to the CEO?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eBig in China\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChina is Tesla's second-largest market after the U.S., and the company's gigafactory near Shanghai will produce batteries as well as cars for the local market.

A lot has changed since then in upper management. New CFO Zachary Kirkhorn and new General Counsel Jonathan Chang were both promoted into those roles within the past year. Investors may be keen to hear from Jerome Guillen, president of automotive, or any of the regional sales leads, but it's unclear if they or others will be asked by Musk to address the meeting this year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eBoard seat shrinkage\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Tesla filed its proxy on Good Friday, it contained a bombshell: directors Brad Buss, a former CFO at SolarCity Corp., and Linda Johnson Rice, CEO of Johnson Publishing Co., won't be seeking re-election after their terms expire Tuesday and won't be replaced. That reduces the size of the 11-member board to nine. Tesla has proposed electing two directors: Kathleen Wilson-Thompson, who just joined the board in December, and Ira Ehrenpreis, a venture capitalist who has been on the board since May 2007. Proxy-advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. believes a vote for Wilson-Thompson is warranted but is recommending against Ehrenpreis \"for concerns regarding the continued lack of performance-conditioned pay to executives other than CEO Musk.\" Glass Lewis recommends that shareholders vote for both nominees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTesla is also proposing to reduce director terms from three years to two years, giving the board a two-class structure. If approved, longtime board member Antonio Gracias would be reassigned as a \"Class 1\" director and would not stand for re-election at the end of his term in 2020. If the proposal is not approved, Gracias would serve until the end of his term in 2021.

Therefore, Queer Awakenings also wants to \"bridge the gap between policy makers and\u0026#8230;those who are based in underserved, under resourced and remote areas\u0026#8230;who aren't necessarily at the table\" when policy decisions are made.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the recent ruling is any indication, it has been successful in doing that thus far.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGatsha explained changing laws in Botswana through the court system has been key for progress in protecting the queer community's rights, citing a 2017 ruling which allowed \u003ca href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-botswana-transgender-court/activists-celebrate-botswanas-transgender-court-victory-idUSKBN1C91OW\"\u003etransgender\u003c/a\u003e people to change their genders on national identification cards. \"However, it highlighted how the law can be just in favor of people who had institutional backing, people who had power, who had resources, or access to networks were able to assert their rights,\" they said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hope with publicizing the marginalized part of a marginalized community through technology is that gaps like that will be filled but also in employment law, which prohibits termination based on sexual orientation but has done little to prevent in hiring practices and during employment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGatsha said advocacy work for the LGBTQ community in Botswana and around the world going forward should \"focus on the human level\u0026#8230;in different spaces [like] public health, it's not just in strategic litigation but there is a need to occupy spaces of business, there is a need to occupy spaces of governance, there is a need to occupy spaces of accountability.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMore must-read stories from \u003ci\u003eFortune\u003c/i\u003e:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003e--\u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/2019/06/10/usmca-trade-deal-mexico-tariffs/\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eDemocrats hold out on USMCA\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003e as Trump walks back Mexico tariffs\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003e--The story behind the\u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/2019/06/08/baby-trump-balloon/\"\u003e \u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eBaby Trump balloon\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003e--FCC takes major steps toward\u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/2019/06/07/fcc-robocalls-fake-caller-id/\"\u003e \u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003elimiting robocalls and scammers\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003e--\u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/2019/06/07/michael-bloomberg-climate-change/\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eMichael Bloomberg pledges $500 million\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eto combat climate change\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003e--Listen to our new audio briefing,\u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/radio/\"\u003e \u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eFortune\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003e 500 Daily\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eGet up to speed on your morning commute with \u003c/span\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eFortune\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003e's\u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://ceodaily.fortune.com/\"\u003e \u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eCEO Daily\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003e newsletter.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"http://fortune.com/2019/06/11/botswana-lgbt-rights-pride-month/","published":"2019-06-11T15:49:05Z","guid":"http://fortune.com/?p=2648609"},{"title":"Trump and Biden Assail Each Other in Overlapping Visits to Iowa","content":"\u003cp\u003ePresident Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden are assailing each other in overlapping visits to the key state of Iowa on Tuesday, previewing what the country might get in next year\u0026#8217;s election if Biden becomes his party\u0026#8217;s nominee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe president unleashed a series of schoolyard taunts of the former vice president before taking off from the White House, declaring \u0026#8220;Joe Biden is a dummy.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;I\u0026#8217;d rather run against Biden than anybody,\u0026#8221;

Steady innovation has led to robots that can independently \"learn\" to navigate tight corridors and grasp delicate objects without crushing them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of the leading American and Japanese robotics companies and investors recently gathered in Menlo Park, Calif. to discuss \u003ca href=\"https://svrobo.org/the-rise-of-the-robots-2019/\"\u003eartificial intelligence in robotics\u003c/a\u003e and its impact on business. Their conclusion? The robots are coming. But it may require some cooperation between the U.S. and an important overseas ally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJapan has long been a powerhouse in robotics, fueled by its huge appetite for automating its automotive and manufacturing industries. But these kinds of old-school robots lack the cutting-edge machine-learning software that could help them continuously improve on the job.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRecognizing the problem, Japanese robotics companies, in some cases, are partnering with U.S. companies that specialize in A.I. software. The goal is to take the best from both countries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Bay Area is good at software engineering and Japan is good at hardware engineering,\" said Tomochika Uyama, the Consul General of Japan in San Francisco. The combination makes for \"a perfect pairing,\" he added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, IHI Corporation, a Tokyo-based industrial equipment giant, recently partnered with San Francisco startup OSARO, which creates \u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/2019/05/28/ai-buzzwords/\"\u003ereinforcement learning software\u003c/a\u003e for robots that helps them, through trial and error, pick up objects they\u0026#8217;re never encountered before. The spawn of the partnership is now being used in IHI\u0026#8217;s warehouses to grab objects like water bottles and toothpaste and then place them in bins on conveyor belts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We are hardware manufacturer, so we are looking for a partner who can bring us the new power of A.I.,\" said IHI vice president Kohei Taya.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/amazon-com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAmazon\u003c/a\u003e, which uses thousands of robots in its warehouses, is somewhat of a role model in robotics. The company acquired robot maker Kiva Systems in 2012 for $775 million, and has since used its technology to jumpstart its use of robots internally. Last week, during an event in Las Vegas, Amazon showed off two new robots that can more efficiently move and sort packages than older models. The machines are intended to speed up the warehouse work while saving money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, it appears more robotic companies are trying to create the next big Kiva Systems that could help more businesses than just Amazon package goods and track inventory. If the recent robotics event in Menlo Park is any indication, some of these next-generation robots could be the result of U.S.-Japanese teamwork.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonathan Vanian\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cspan class=\"DashboardProfileCard-screenname u-inlineBlock u-dir\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/JonathanVanian\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"username u-dir\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003e@JonathanVanian\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\"mailto:jonathan.vanian@fortune.com\"\u003ejonathan.vanian@fortune.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://cloud.newsletters.fortune.com/fortune/newsletters/?newsletter_name=EYE_ON_AI\"\u003eSign up for Eye on A.I.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"listicle-item\" id=\"listicle-item-2645247-1\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"listicle-content\"\u003e\u003ch2 class=\"listicle-title\"\u003eEYE ON A.I.

(Modern Fertility has now raised a total of $22 million.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe investment from Forerunner in the femtech space signals that the same trends \u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/2017/06/25/kirsten-green-forerunner-ventures-women-vc-fund/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eGreen\u003c/a\u003e has sought out and cultivated in the retail world--cult-like brands that develop long-term relationships with consumers--are poised to reshape women\u0026#8217;s healthcare. \"Kirsten has invested in these companies that have really changed consumer behavior,\" says Afton Vechery, Modern Fertility's CEO and co-founder. \"She has fundamentally shifted consumer brands.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe investment also highlights the ways startups like Modern Fertility are attempting to turn women's reproductive health into a less taboo, more mainstream wellness issue that can be tracked and monitored just like sleep and nutrition. The company's mission, says Vechery, is to \"integrate fertility into broader women's behavior and culture.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreen says she\u0026#8217;d been meeting with a lot of women's health companies and pro-actively sought out Modern Fertility, which was not looking for funding. \"Over the last 18 months, we have been spending more time on thinking about the evolution of healthcare and health and wellness,\" Green says. Green saw investment opportunities emerging as people have become more pro-active about their health but are also dissatisfied with the current healthcare system and services that exist, she adds. Like her investments in the more traditional consumer space, Green saw Modern Fertility as having the potential to create long-term relationships with women, who are \u0026#8220;going to be interested in how their bodies evolve over time.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eModern Fertility, which was started in 2017 by Vechery and co-founder Carly Leahy, provides an at-home hormone lab test that would normally be conducted at a fertility clinic when a woman is struggling to get pregnant. It makes those tests available to women earlier in life at a lower cost. \"We in society today are so focused on preventing pregnancy instead of planning for it--it's this almost immediate transition and it's a total black box,\" says Vechery. \"We're really transitioning the conversation to how can we think about fertility in a preventative care context proactively.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the main areas the new funding will go toward is research. Because the healthcare system treats women only once they have a known fertility issue, the majority of research is done on women diagnosed with infertility. By attempting to get women to think about their reproductive health earlier, the startup hopes to instead track the fertility of women who don\u0026#8217;t necessarily have issues--what Vechery calls a \u0026#8220;a new area that is largely under-researched\u0026#8221;--and as a result, discover better predictors of fertility. To do so, Modern Fertility offers customers the ability to opt in to clinical studies, where their anonymized data is analyzed by its team of fertility doctors. This information will feed into the company\u0026#8217;s product development as well as produce academic research that Vechery says she hopes can move the reproductive health industry forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVechery says that the fundraising process was very different than when she was raising her seed round and fertility and women\u0026#8217;s health wasn\u0026#8217;t yet a hot area. \u0026#8220;The industry understands that women are just a massive part of commerce,\u0026#8221; she said, \u0026#8220;and investors are paying very close attention.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"http://fortune.com/2019/06/11/kirsten-green-forerunner-modern-fertility-series-a-femtech/","published":"2019-06-11T14:30:43Z","guid":"http://fortune.com/?p=2648434"},{"title":"This CEO Is Disrupting Consumer Packaging to Fight the Garbage Crisis","content":"\u003cp\u003eTom Szaky, the founder and CEO of TerraCycle, is known for recycling the unrecyclable--cigarette butts, chewing gum, diapers--but last year, as he watched the business model for recycling crater (in part because it's not profitable to recycle many of the new, lighter, more flexible plastics), he had an epiphany.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRecycling was a way to manage the ongoing garbage crisis, but it isn't the solution to it, he said, speaking at the \u003cem\u003eFortune \u003c/em\u003eCEO Initiative on Tuesday morning. Szaky wanted to get at the waste crisis' root cause--which he says is the prevailing culture of disposability (i.e. the fact that we throw many things away after a single use, from coffee cups to ice cream containers, and feel no sense of ownership towards them).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe problem, he realized, was largely packaging. Over the years, companies have designed for disposability--focusing on ways to make the containers, wrappers, cups, and other thing-holders as cheap and convenient as possible. That's why food and drink and packaged goods companies, according to Greenpeace, are the biggest creators of plastic waste.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSzaky's solution to all this is a platform called Loop, which turns the current model on its head. Working with partners that run from \u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/kroger/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eKroger\u003c/a\u003e and Walgreens to \u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/procter-gamble/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eP\u0026amp;G\u003c/a\u003e and Colgate, the new venture incentivizes companies to create the most durable and valuable packaging they can. (Loop members buy their Haagen-Dazs ice cream, Tide detergent, and other goods in stainless steel containers, which they return, and are cleaned by Loop.) Szaky said another megabrand signs on as a partner every two days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We're shifting ownership back to the producer,\" noted Szaky, who added that while the model is an old-fashioned one (think milkman), the shift has led companies to be far more innovative in their package design to better serve customers. Soon, said Szaky, Loop will notify its customers when their goods like pasta sauce are about to expire. Its brand partners gain from the data they're able to gather about what products are sold and which containers come back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eMore must-read stories from \u003c/span\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eFortune\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003e:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003e--\u003c/span\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eFortune\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003e CEO Initiative 2019: \u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/2019/05/07/ceo-initiative-livestream-2019/\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eWatch the livestream\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003e--These \u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/2019/06/08/workplace-communication-tools/\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003ecommunication tools\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003e can radically improve workplaces\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003e--Four ways algorithms can boost \u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/2019/06/01/ai-artificial-intelligence-diversity-hiring/\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003ediversity in hiring\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003e--Find out which \u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/2019/05/14/fortune-500-ceos-most-admired/\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eFortune\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003e 500 CEOs are most admired\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003e by their peers\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003e--Uber's CEO has\u003c/span\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/2019/06/07/uber-coo-cmo-departures/\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eabsorbed the COO role\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003e for more control\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eGet up to speed on your morning commute with \u003c/span\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eFortune\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003e's \u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://ceodaily.fortune.com/\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eCEO Daily\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003enewsletter.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"http://fortune.com/2019/06/11/packaging-garbage-crisis-loop/","published":"2019-06-11T19:50:41Z","guid":"http://fortune.com/?p=2648826"},{"title":"Chanel Invests in Boston Startup Making Sustainable Silk","content":"\u003cp\u003eChanel Inc. is the latest retail giant to make a public nod toward environmentally conscious products, investing in an eco-friendly chemistry company as part of an effort to make luxury items less damaging to the planet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth the apparel and cosmetics industries are major sources of waste, and chemicals often used to make fabrics and skincare products, such as\u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/2019/03/07/microplastic-pollution-global-problem/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003e microplastics\u003c/a\u003e, ingredient stabilizers, and textile finishers.

When a child is stricken with cancer, the parents and child are fighting the disease together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver the last several years, Rosen Hotels \u0026amp; Resorts has championed Runway to Hope\u0026#8217;s mission: to support families, primarily in Central Florida, fighting pediatric cancer while seeking a cure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ve been supporting it since it started about eight or nine years ago,” said Harris Rosen, president/COO of Rosen Hotels \u0026amp; Resorts. “We know of a number of families, including our own, that had cancer within the families, and so we thought that supporting an enterprise would be appropriate.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis cause is deeply personal to Rosen as his 26-year-old son had anaplastic astrocytoma, a malignant brain tumor. “Our youngest son, Adam, passed recently due to brain cancer, and so our support regarding Runway to Hope has increased because of Adam’s illness and death,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis year, Runway to Hope’s fundraising efforts broke records. A significant $1.5 million was raised at the Adam Michael Rosen Foundation Presents Runway to Hope’s annual Spring Soiree. The donations will be used to fund programs in all three children\u0026#8217;s pediatric oncology programs in Central Florida as well as directly benefit children through Runway to Hope\u0026#8217;s Family Assistance Program.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a result of his son’s passing, Rosen is determined to take the mission forward with his own foundation—The Harris Rosen Foundation. Earlier this year, he made a $12-million donation to fund a unique collaboration of researchers to find a cure or treatment for brain cancer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We will be working with the University of Florida\u0026#8217;s brain cancer institute, and we submitted a gift to the university, which has given it an excellent start in terms of fundraising efforts,” said Rosen. “The gift will represent a substantial change philosophically in terms of how cancer treatment or cures are created. Instead of universities and labs working individually, this initiative will include 12 universities working together to find a cure or treatment for all brain cancers. There will be two labs—the Adam Rosen Lab and the Adam Michael Rosen Clinic. Our hope is that within a 10-year period, there’s a good chance a cure or treatment will be achieved. This new collaboration will no doubt expedite the findings dramatically.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Adam Michael Rosen Foundation will continue to provide funding to Runway to Hope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRosen noted that there’s more work to be done, and he will continue to be a part of the efforts in the future. “There’s no doubt we will be a major sponsor as we were this year.

Teneo’s clients can contribute by purchasing Society B merchandise with 10% of the purchase price going directly to KINF or three additional charities, or through a new fundraising website for KINF created by Teneo. The site also contains information about the seven networking events that Teneo will host throughout the year in major U.S. cities where the program will be introduced and encouraged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrior to creating the program, the company would purchase the items for each of the events it held. “We would send all of that material to our events,” he said. “We would have all of our hotels there, and a meeting planner would be given a backpack and be able to stuff all of the various school supplies that the disadvantaged children needed… Then the person from that school would come to pick up the items.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe new program skips the step of having the items packed by the participants at Teneo’s events. Now, KINF, which has all these supplies on hand, packages and ships needed supplies directly to the local schools that it has determined are most in need. This helps ensure resources go directly to KINF, targeting those schools most in need and greatly reducing Teneo’s carbon footprint in the process, according to Schugt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“On top of that, when we have an event, we typically invite up to 150 meeting professionals, and every one of them gets a $50 gift card,” he said. “Then they go on the Society B website and whatever they buy, 10% is donated to one of the charities that Society B offers, one of which is KINF. We find that a lot of our planners are supporting us through that as well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince its founding in 1995, KINF has distributed $1 billion in school supplies, directly benefiting more than six million students and nearly 200,000 teachers. Teneo will be contributing $8,000 to launch the program and has invested nearly $40,000 in gift cards of $50 allotments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe program was launched on April 23, at a networking event at the Boston Park Plaza.

At RLH Corp., we promote the idea of ‘failing fast’ and not fearing failure. We try a lot of different technologies and solutions; while some work, some clearly don’t, but we promote everyone’s ability to have great ideas.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeeping up with the latest technology is essential for Strebel. “Omni focuses on the guest experience and uses technology as a way to enhance that experience,” he said. “It is important for us to stay updated on new tech innovations and understand how people are using them on a daily basis. With this information, we can determine how we might be able to integrate this new technology during their stay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe issue of cybersecurity and guest privacy remains a concern that brands take seriously, especially given recent reports of data breaches across many industries. “At RLH Corp., we really strive to create authentic experiences for our guests,” said Mount. \u0026#8220;Part of that experience includes providing guests with a level of trust that when they provide us their information, we are going to do our best to protect it from being exposed to criminals.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMount said that the company has worked on two projects in the area of protecting guest information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first project was removing credit card data by tokenizing all credit cards during the reservation process at the CRS. “RLH Corp. was one of the first brands to leverage tokenization at the hotel PMS, but as we’ve grown so rapidly through acquisitions, this brought new and unique challenges,” he said. “The path forward required us to move tokenization away from the hotel and to the CRS.  By tokenizing credit cards at the CRS during the reservation creation process we remove all credit card data throughout our system of hotels.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second project for RLH was moving its loyalty system authentication to identity management company Okta. “Again, this created significant challenges with finding new integrations to our CRM, marketing systems, reporting systems and others, but in the same way we felt tokenization was important to all RLH Corp. guests, we felt taking extra steps to secure our loyalty guests\u0026#8217; information was obviously the right path forward,” said Mount. “The Okta solution allows us secure loyalty system authentication and provide RLH Corp. a platform to continue to build more secure guest identity solutions for the future.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor Omni, cybersecurity is extremely important. “Operating in a secure environment is table stakes these days, said Strebel. “We work hard to educate our associates on protecting data, and we take the utmost care with our guest data. We have a number of industry partners that we work with to routinely evaluate our privacy posture.”\u003cem\u003e \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreene said that his company invests heavily in technology to deliver memorable experiences for guests and customers—and that includes keeping that technology safeguarded. “These technology capabilities require high maturity in data security and privacy,\u0026#8221; he said. \u0026#8220;We require IT systems to meet and maintain compliance with our information security framework, which aligns to established best practices, industry standards, legal/regulatory requirements and corporate mandates.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hotels also have to balance being respectful of guest privacy with the desire to provide them with a personal experience. “Our privacy program is based on consent, transparency and trust,” said Greene. “The personal experience is enabled by consent. Once that consent has been captured, we strive to create those memorable experiences, maintaining trust through strong commitments to transparency and security.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMount echoed Greene’s sentiment. “Securing guest data is important to RLHC but, at the same time, allowing hotels to leverage guest data to provide the best possible service experience is really why we all run hotels,\u0026#8221; he said. \u0026#8220;Reporting on guest data while securing the data is still possible, but it requires the technology teams and business teams to work in unison toward the same end goal. Allowing both teams to understand all the goals up front, the business can help IT solve challenges implementing the security solutions, while IT can help the business solve challenges finding new guest reporting and management solutions.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe post \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.hotelbusiness.com/rapid-pace-of-change-in-tech-privacy-personalization-are-top-of-mind/\"\u003eRapid Pace of Change in Tech, Privacy \u0026#038; Personalization Are Top of Mind\u003c/a\u003e appeared first on \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.hotelbusiness.com\"\u003eHotel Business\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://www.hotelbusiness.com/rapid-pace-of-change-in-tech-privacy-personalization-are-top-of-mind/","published":"2019-06-11T15:30:36Z","guid":"https://www.hotelbusiness.com/?p=183658"},{"title":"Tech Firms Make Deals, Enter Partnerships","content":"\u003cp\u003eNATIONAL REPORT—Acquisitions and partnerships are happenings in the hospitality technology sector, including Cvent’s acquisition of two companies.

So she came up with a plan that was boilerplate noir: Hire a killer to murder him, and collect the life-insurance payout. She met the hit man in a Walmart parking lot on Valentine’s Day last year, and gave him a down payment of three gold rings and $402 in cash, and a promise of another $4,500 on the back end. Fortunately for Danielczak’s husband, if unfortunately for her, the hit man was an undercover cop. She is now serving two years in a Wisconsin prison, having been convicted of solicitation to commit first-degree intentional homicide.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStories of unconsummated contract killings make headlines on a regular basis. Sometimes the motive is shockingly impersonal: Last year, a Houston man allegedly took out a $2,000 contract on the police officer who had been slapping his business’s vehicles with tickets. More often, the crime can be \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2019/02/building-public-database-murdered-women/582769/?utm_source=feed\"\u003etraced to an intimate but fractured relationship\u003c/a\u003e. In February, federal authorities charged an Indiana man and his girlfriend with murder for hire, after the two allegedly solicited a hit on the man’s ex-wife following a child-custody battle. The couple agreed to a fee of $5,000 to $10,000, “depending on the job’s complexity.” As in the Danielczak case, both the Houston and Indiana plots were foiled by undercover law-enforcement officers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCriminologists have a name for a person who hires a hit man: \u003ci\u003einstigator\u003c/i\u003e. They also confirm what news stories suggest: Lots of instigators get caught because they don’t know what they’re doing. After all, most of us don’t socialize with professional killers. The average person therefore looks to acquaintances or neighbors for referrals, or finds his way to criminal bottom-feeders who are likely to be inept and inexperienced. The former may be inclined to call law enforcement, while the latter may lose their nerve or botch the job. Which helps explain why so many murders for hire don’t produce any dead bodies.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 2003, the Australian Institute of Criminology published \u003ca href=\"https://aic.gov.au/publications/rpp/rpp53\"\u003ean analysis of 163 contract-killing cases\u003c/a\u003e (some completed, others merely attempted) in Australia; it remains one of the most significant studies ever conducted of the subject. The authors determined that 2 percent of all murders in Australia were contract killings and that contracts were, in some cases, surprisingly affordable. One unfulfilled contract was for 500 Australian dollars; another job was completed for just $2,000. Among other key findings, nearly 20 percent of all contracts involved a romantic relationship gone wrong, and 16 percent were financially motivated.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother study, this one of contract killings in Tennessee, found instigators pretty evenly split between men and women. This is notable, given that almost all conventional murders are committed by men. But it tracks with the fact that women are almost as likely as men to wish someone dead. In \u003ci\u003eThe Murderer Next Door: Why the Mind Is Designed to Kill\u003c/i\u003e, David M. Buss, an evolutionary psychologist, reports that “91 percent of men and 84 percent of women have had at least one vivid fantasy about killing someone.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003caside class=\"callout-placeholder\" data-source=\"curated\"\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat of the people who are hired to kill? Reid Meloy, a forensic psychologist who has consulted on a dozen murder-for-hire cases, told me that virtually all of the contract killers he’s examined display \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/03/a-hidden-problem-at-the-heart-of-psychopathy/555335/?utm_source=feed\"\u003emoderate to severe psychopathy\u003c/a\u003e. “Psychopathy, as a constellation of personality traits, gives them both the aggression and the emotional detachment to be able to carry out an act like this for money,” he says. Other experts I spoke with believe that both parties to a contract killing are engaged in psychological distancing. The contractor comforts himself by saying, \u003ci\u003eThis is my job. I’m just following orders. \u003c/i\u003eThe instigator thinks, \u003ci\u003eI’m not a murderer—he’s the one pulling the trigger.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePark Dietz, a forensic psychiatrist who has testified in court cases of criminals ranging from serial killers (Jeffrey Dahmer) to deranged assassins (John Hinckley Jr.), has another theory as to why homicidal people hire help. “My prime suspect is the depiction of hit men in popular culture, such as films, TV, video games, and novels,” Dietz told me, noting that the last time he entered \u003ci\u003ehit man\u003c/i\u003e into Netflix, hundreds of results appeared. According to Dietz, such entertainment gives “the illusion that this is a service available to anyone.” In a world where dangerous or unpleasant tasks are routinely outsourced, a viewer might think, \u003ci\u003eWell, why not this too?\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003csmall\u003e\u003ci\u003eThis article appears in the July 2019 print edition with the headline “Hired Guns.”\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/small\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AtlanticBusinessChannel/~4/YBamVwIAgqQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/AtlanticBusinessChannel/~3/YBamVwIAgqQ/","published":"2019-06-11T12:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:39-590620"}]},{"url":"https://toucharcade.com/feed","items":[{"title":"Foursaken’s ‘Block Fortress: Empires’ Launching June 20th, Available for Pre-Order Now","content":"\u003cp\u003eThe hard working brothers at Foursaken Media \u003ca href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2017/09/13/block-fortress-empires-is-the-next-foursaken-media-game-and-its-minecraft-meets-clash-of-clans/\"\u003efirst announced\u003c/a\u003e their latest entry in the immensely popular \u003cem\u003eBlock Fortress\u003c/em\u003e series back in September of 2017, called \u003cem\u003eBlock Fortress: Empires\u003c/em\u003e, but it wasn\u0026#8217;t until nearly a year later that we \u003ca href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2018/08/23/block-fortress-empires-beta-test/\"\u003eheard from the game again\u003c/a\u003e as it was looking for beta testers last August.

Yes, go get it. \u003cem\u003eFinal Fantasy 8\u003c/em\u003e is finally get its turn at a re-release with an impressive-looking remaster that will be hitting a variety of systems later this year. \u003cem\u003eFinal Fantasy Crystal Chronicles\u003c/em\u003e has a vague date now, with it scheduled for a fourth-quarter release. Localized versions of\u003cem\u003e Romancing SaGa 3\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eSaGa Scarlet Grace\u003c/em\u003e were shown, with no release date other than \u0026#8220;soon\" mentioned. Impressive trailers for \u003cem\u003eOninaki\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eDragon Quest XI S\u003c/em\u003e, and \u003cem\u003eDragon Quest Builders 2\u003c/em\u003e were played as well.

Each week sees a good-sized stack of games that I need to go through, and my first step in dealing with that is to fire up each and every game for ten or fifteen minutes to get a basic sense of what it\u0026#8217;s all about. Based on those mini-sessions, I home in on the ones that I\u0026#8217;d like to review, and that, my friends, is how the sausage is made. Or rather how I tend to make it. A fine family recipe honed over the course of two decades. A well-oiled machine, you might say. And every once in a while, a game comes along that throws a giant wrench into that machine, causing fires, loss of limbs, and pure unbridled anarchy. All in the figurative sense, of course. Except that last one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow do such tragedies occur? Well, sometimes a game is just \u003cem\u003eso\u003c/em\u003e good that I can\u0026#8217;t stop playing it after just fifteen or so minutes. I just want to keep playing, and that leads to all of the other games sitting there picking their teeth and sighing rather loudly at the hold-up.\u003cem\u003e Slay the Spire\u003c/em\u003e is one of those wrenches. It\u0026#8217;s a \u003cem\u003emagnificent\u003c/em\u003e wrench. At the moment it is also a wrench with some annoying technical problems, and let\u0026#8217;s leave the analogy here because it\u0026#8217;s starting to come unglued. The point is that this is a game that is so good that I just want to play the heck out of it, and even when it does something mean like crash on me, I still just want to play it more. Not that I don\u0026#8217;t want those crashes fixed, but the core gameplay is so good here that I\u0026#8217;m totally willing to take the lumps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-254025\" src=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/slaythespire2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/slaythespire2.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/slaythespire2-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/slaythespire2-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/slaythespire2-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlay the Spire is a deckbuilding roguelite game where you fight a series of battles as you ascend a spire. Each battle will take a little bite out of you in most cases, but you\u0026#8217;ll also be rewarded with a precious new card for your deck. Every so often, you\u0026#8217;ll come across something on the map that isn\u0026#8217;t a battle. It might be a random event, or a shopkeeper, or just some treasure. You can somewhat guide your progress by choosing a route at the various branching paths, but there\u0026#8217;s a lot of randomness at play here. Each floor culminates in a boss battle that will not go well for you if you haven\u0026#8217;t properly prepared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis game almost perfectly rides the line between being random enough that each session feels fresh and static enough that you feel like you\u0026#8217;re getting useful knowledge with each failure. As you play more and learn about enemies, you\u0026#8217;ll start to develop proper countermeasures. As you uncover new cards, you\u0026#8217;ll start piecing together new strategies. Will you get this card in the next run? Maybe not, but you will get it again sometime. And what if you happen to get that card and this card in the same run? Why, then you could pull off this sort of attack! And that\u0026#8217;s the way the thinking goes as you play \u003cem\u003eSlay the Spire\u003c/em\u003e. It\u0026#8217;s utterly compelling in all the right ways. It even has a bunch of things that will unlock as you make your many runs, such as new characters that each bring slightly different strategies to the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-254026\" src=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/slaythespire3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/slaythespire3.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/slaythespire3-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/slaythespire3-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/slaythespire3-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for the technical issues, they\u0026#8217;re clearly of the unintended sort. Sometimes the game randomly halts for a short moment with no particular discernible reason. The game also crashes now and then, and that\u0026#8217;s a bit more predictable in some cases. One of the bosses seems to trigger it with some regularity. Apparently a patch has already been whipped up and will be sent out as soon as possible. If you\u0026#8217;re terribly worried about it, there\u0026#8217;s no harm in waiting. But honestly, the issues are infrequent enough, the game is good enough, and the developer is trustworthy enough that you don\u0026#8217;t have to feel bad about buying it right now, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAside from these problems, it\u0026#8217;s a marvelous port. The game takes to handheld play like a fish to water, and problems that plague other PC ports to Switch like excessive loading times and tiny text in undocked mode aren\u0026#8217;t very bad at all here. While I think I\u0026#8217;d like it even better on my iPad or iPhone, I\u0026#8217;m certainly quite okay with this Switch version. If you\u0026#8217;re looking for your next big time sink, I\u0026#8217;ll happily push \u003cem\u003eSlay the Spire\u003c/em\u003e into your hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSwitchArcade Score: 4.5/5\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVectronom ($9.99)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-253405\" src=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/vectronom.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/vectronom.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/vectronom-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/vectronom-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/vectronom-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is kind of, sort of a rhythm-based arcade game. There is certainly a beat going on in the music of each stage, and many bits and pieces of the stage are timed along with it. If you can move to the rhythm of that beat, you\u0026#8217;ll find the stages easier to clear without question. At the same time, you can just ignore the beat and use your eyes to guide you. You won\u0026#8217;t get full points for clearing the stage if you do this, but you\u0026#8217;ll still clear it. So yeah, \u003cem\u003eVectronom\u003c/em\u003e. A rhythm game where no sense of rhythm is actually required. On paper, it sounds right up my alley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stages are played from an isometric viewpoint and you control a little cube that can move in four directions. You have to guide the cube to predetermined locations on the stage, and doing so will either change up the stage and ask you to head to a new point, or finish it altogether once you\u0026#8217;ve reached the third such goal. There are switches to hit, collectibles to grab, hazards to avoid, and all kinds of moving bits that appear, disappear, and change according to the beat of the background tunes. The visuals are similarly in tune with the music. But as mentioned, nothing says you have to move along with the beat. You can just push in the desired direction at any point and away you\u0026#8217;ll go. But it\u0026#8217;s a lot easier to play if you do try to follow the music.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-254027\" src=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/vectronom2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/vectronom2.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/vectronom2-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/vectronom2-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/vectronom2-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0026#8217;re graded at the end of each stage according to things like how many collectibles you grabbed, how many attempts you took, and how well you matched with the beat. A perfect clear presumably requires you to stick to the stage\u0026#8217;s rhythm from start to finish. If that sounds like the sort of thing you\u0026#8217;d like to master, you might enjoy \u003cem\u003eVectronom\u003c/em\u003e. It\u0026#8217;s certainly stylish, if nothing else, and the controls more or less work fine in that awkward isometric sort of way. You can even have other players join in, however counter-productive that quickly proves to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePersonally, I got a little weary with it by about the halfway point, but it\u0026#8217;s not an overly long game so it was easy enough to push through it. Well, I mean easy in the sense that there wasn\u0026#8217;t a lot of road ahead of me. It\u0026#8217;s certainly not easy in terms of putting said road behind you. Some levels are almost infuriating. But once you find yourself in synch with the sounds and find the proper path through each level, \u003cem\u003eVectronom\u003c/em\u003e has moments where it almost feels magical. And then you fall off another ledge and die, all because you can\u0026#8217;t feel the music in your bones. Well, that\u0026#8217;s how it goes. A decent game that is certainly well-made, but perhaps gets a little \u003cem\u003etoo\u003c/em\u003e comfortable moving to its own groove.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSwitchArcade Score: 3.5/5\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRefunct ($2.99)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-253914\" src=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/refunct.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/refunct.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/refunct-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/refunct-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/refunct-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eRefunct\u003c/em\u003e is a really nice coffee break, but not much more than that. You\u0026#8217;re put in a strange world that is composed of some platforms stretching out of the water. Through a pure process of discovery, you will find out you can jump, and then you may notice a switch laying around. You step on it, and more platforms rise up. And did the ground just turn green when you set foot on it? It did. Hm. And what\u0026#8217;s that thing over there? Should I collect it? Yes, you should. Or don\u0026#8217;t.

You have to find your way to increasingly out-of-the-way switches to raise more pieces of the world. Eventually you\u0026#8217;ll get them all and a little celebration will play. There isn\u0026#8217;t much to do after that, but you can wander around a bit if you like. The play controls are quite good in \u003cem\u003eRefunct\u003c/em\u003e, and it\u0026#8217;s pleasant enough hopping around, painting all the platforms as you go.

It mostly succeeds at that, but not always. You can see what it\u0026#8217;s going for, however, and that\u0026#8217;s cool. Are there better ways to spend a few bucks on the eShop? Yes, probably.

The games do that job well, even if they tend not to add many frills. They\u0026#8217;re also usually packed with enough content to keep you busy for hours on end. As such, it really comes down to how well you like the kind of puzzles each game offers. Does anyone really need a review of something like \u003cem\u003eWord Search\u003c/em\u003e? Probably not. But here we are.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eWord Wheel by POWGI\u003c/em\u003e is the latest game from this developer, and it is a no-frills, puzzle-packed presentation as usual. The idea here is the reliable game of making as many words as you can from a set group of letters. They\u0026#8217;re arranged as spokes around a hub letter. That hub letter must be in every word you spell, but otherwise it\u0026#8217;s all up to you. The game will tell you how many words you should be able to find, and it will even accept certain bonus words that are likely not included due to being dirty or too slangy. Not that I would know. Lean the stick in the direction of a spoke and hit the button to select it. Once you\u0026#8217;ve finished your word, hit the trigger to submit it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-254029\" src=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/wordwheel2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/wordwheel2.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/wordwheel2-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/wordwheel2-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/wordwheel2-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe game features 100 such puzzles, and just to give you an idea of what that adds up to, the first puzzle has 66 words and it took me a couple of hours to find them all. Some of the puzzles have more words, which sometimes results in them being harder or easier. It\u0026#8217;s more fun to play this with others who can make their own suggestions, and the game even formally supports local multiplayer in a chaotic sort of way. It\u0026#8217;s an okay way to pass the time if you\u0026#8217;re really bored, but if I\u0026#8217;m being very honest I found this one a little more dull than most of the other puzzle games from Lightwood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSwitchArcade Score: 3/5\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNew Releases\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Last Remnant Remastered ($19.99)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-254030\" src=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/thelastremnant.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/thelastremnant.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/thelastremnant-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/thelastremnant-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/thelastremnant-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSwitchArcade Highlight!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurprise!

You may be completely repulsed by this game because it doesn\u0026#8217;t particularly care about following the usual rules, but you may also fall completely head-over-heels in love with it for the same reason. That\u0026#8217;s how Kawazu rolls, friends, and I wouldn\u0026#8217;t have it any other way.

It\u0026#8217;s a little hard to explain how it works, but let\u0026#8217;s give it a go. This is a twin-stick shooter in the literal sense, but each of your sticks is taking care of a ship on its own part of a splitscreen. One ship is invincible but it is powered by resources that need to be collected by the other ship, which is not invincible. The lower your health gets, the more your score racks up, so it\u0026#8217;s actually a good thing to be near-death. Except there\u0026#8217;s one more wrinkle: your score doesn\u0026#8217;t count if you die. It\u0026#8217;s up to you to choose when you\u0026#8217;re ready to retire, and only then is your score put into the proverbial books. So you have to pat your head and rub your tummy at the same time, glide along the edge of death as much as possible, and make the right call about when to pack it in before you lose everything. Neat. For whatever else I have to say about the game, the fact that it pulls off that highly-clever basic concept makes it an easy recommendation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBattle Worlds: Kronos ($29.99)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-254032\" src=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/battleworldskronos.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/battleworldskronos.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/battleworldskronos-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/battleworldskronos-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/battleworldskronos-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the one hand, this is a reasonably well-constructed turn-based strategy game. It does most of the things you\u0026#8217;d want a game like this to do, and in spite of its PC origins, it\u0026#8217;s not terrible to play with a controller. It may look a lot like an RTS, but I assure you that this is more or less a very prettied-up, Western-style take on games like \u003cem\u003eAdvance Wars\u003c/em\u003e. My main gripe with it is just how utterly bland it is. It tries to do a story, and the text makes attempts at having some kind of unique voice at times, but on the whole this is like the result of a Betty Crocker recipe for turn-based war games. Oh, and it basically starts off tough instead of ramping up like most games, but don\u0026#8217;t be too intimidated.

I can wait a bit longer for \u003cem\u003eFinal Fantasy VIII\u003c/em\u003e on mobile but I\u0026#8217;m super glad to have confirmations for two SaGa ports.

It was notable for a few reasons at the time. It was the first \u003cem\u003eFinal Fantasy\u003c/em\u003e game on a Nintendo system since the SNES days. Square Enix went with Sony for \u003cem\u003eFinal Fantasy VII\u003c/em\u003e (which is now available on literally everything). \u003cem\u003eFinal Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Remastered Edition\u003c/em\u003e was announced for PS4 and \u003ca href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2018/09/14/switcharcade-roundup-nintendo-direct-news-recap-edition/\"\u003eSwitch release\u003c/a\u003e.

When they reveal iOS and Android alongside other platforms, the game is usually the same as the other versions which is a good sign. This means it likely will be a premium experience with all the content. It is good to see them not abandon iOS and Android for newer releases. Getting a day and date release is excellent.

Finish a challenge, and you’re awarded Nitro Points (think of Nitro Points like Experience Points). Complete more challenges to continue to fill that Nitro up.

Keepstar to stop the repair timer and chip it down to get it ready for the kill.  However, the fighters had been doing a very effective job and there wasn\u0026#8217;t much left to shoot when my alt arrived, and he was there ahead of the whole fleet sitting in M-OEE8.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCalls were made to pull some, then all fighters as the fleets began jumping in.  People were getting

The PlayStation 4-exclusive JRPG will launch on March 3, 2020. If that sounds like too long to wait, and you're in Los Angeles this week, Square Enix says all E3 2019 attendees will have a chance to play the game's first real-time demo on the show floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonday night's event included the clearest demonstration yet of how the game's combat system will work: as a mix of real-time attacking and dodging, and an \"active time battle\" (ATB) system of pausing to activate special abilities and items. The latter will only activate once players have built up enough of their fighters' ATB meters, which grow as players pull off more successful weapon swipes and dodges.

One of her ATB special attacks, a flurry of punches followed by a flashy bicycle kick, fit in nicely with Cloud's barrage of sword swipes within a Japanese kanji character, a massive lighting-ball blast from Barret's machine gun, and a green, particle-filled explosion of healing power from Aerith. Barret's standard attacks will largely revolve around gun shots, not melee swipes, so he will be able to control real-time combat from a distance—and that likely means other popular \u003cem\u003eFFVII\u003c/em\u003e characters will work the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1519979#p3\"\u003eRead 8 remaining paragraphs\u003c/a\u003e | \u003ca href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1519979\u0026comments=1\"\u003eComments\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"feedflare\"\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?a=kMcEAeChyVs:7yYFS_NNhGg:V_sGLiPBpWU\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?i=kMcEAeChyVs:7yYFS_NNhGg:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?a=kMcEAeChyVs:7yYFS_NNhGg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?i=kMcEAeChyVs:7yYFS_NNhGg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?a=kMcEAeChyVs:7yYFS_NNhGg:qj6IDK7rITs\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?a=kMcEAeChyVs:7yYFS_NNhGg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","url":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1519979","published":"2019-06-11T02:20:45Z","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1519979"},{"title":"Microsoft working to get “every single Xbox One game” working on Scarlett","content":"\u003cdiv id=\"rss-wrap\"\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ca name=\"page-1\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"video\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"wrapper\" style=\"display:block\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HDhh8jy1YQI?start=0\u0026amp;wmode=transparent\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLOS ANGELES—When Microsoft announced \u003ca href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/06/microsoft-reveals-first-details-on-project-scarlett-game-console-for-2020/\"\u003ethe first details of its next game console\u003c/a\u003e Sunday, it said that \"thousands of games across four console generations will look and play best on Project Scarlett.\" In \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDhh8jy1YQI\"\u003ea video follow-up focused on backward compatibility\u003c/a\u003e posted Monday, the company clarified that its goal is that \"every single game you play on Xbox One today [will] work on the Scarlett device.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat would be a change from previous Xbox console generations, which have only supported \u003ca href=\"https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/backward-compatibility\"\u003ea significant subset of previous generations' titles\u003c/a\u003e through software updates.

New Foreign-Policy Tune","content":"\u003cp\u003e“Basically, my entire adult life has been one where it’s a little bit illegible where you’re supposed to be as a Democrat on foreign policy,” Pete Buttigieg told me last weekend. He was preparing to give his first speech on the subject, today at Indiana University. So far, most of the Democratic candidates have avoided the question of how they’d conduct foreign policy, and the voters and the press have made that easy for them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen candidates decide to say something about global affairs, they tend to quarantine their views in a single all-encompassing speech, as if to get the topic out of the way. Elizabeth Warren gave hers in Washington in November. Bernie Sanders has actually given two, in Missouri in 2017 and last fall at Johns Hopkins. None of the other candidates has given even one.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis silence about America’s role in the world is strange. The quest to replace Donald Trump presents the first chance since the end of the Cold War for Democrats to think fundamentally anew about foreign policy. The liberal internationalist approach of the Bill Clinton years aimed to enlarge the sphere of capitalist democracies, manage the world’s chaos, and extend American influence, through free trade, NATO expansion, diplomatic deal making, and occasional military intervention.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/05/george-packer-pax-americana-richard-holbrooke/586042/?utm_source=feed\"\u003ehigh-water mark\u003c/a\u003e was the American-led peace agreement in 1995 that ended the war in Bosnia and repaired damage to the transatlantic alliance. September 11, the Iraq War, and the financial crisis threw this consensus into confusion. Those were the early years of Buttigieg’s adult life, when Democratic foreign policy became “a little bit illegible.” Still, the approach of the ’90s persisted into Barack Obama’s presidency—free trade, diplomacy, ongoing war—even as Obama himself became more and more skeptical of American overreach.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHillary Clinton, a holdover from the unipolar moment, was the last of the muscular interventionists. Her defeat marked the demise of the old liberal internationalism, and Trump has shattered what was left of it. But this landscape of ruins is also an open field. In his Indiana speech, Buttigieg welcomed “a season for thinking about what comes next with greater urgency and, in certain ways, greater freedom than has been available to a president for some time.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMost of the energy in the new thinking is on the left. Sanders has called for a foreign policy based on the worldwide struggle against oligarchy and corporate power—a “global progressive movement” for economic equality, democratic rights, and environmental sustainability. In this view, American dominance has been a mixed bag at best, a force for ill as much as good, and it should yield to a transnational movement led by citizens, not just governments.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs Peter Beinart has \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/10/bernie-sanders-and-end-american-century/573001/?utm_source=feed\"\u003epointed out\u003c/a\u003e, this idea goes back to World War II and the appeal in 1942 by FDR’s Vice President Henry Wallace for a foreign policy of “the common man.” Wallace wanted to extend the New Deal into the postwar period as a worldwide crusade for equality. Sanders wants to take his “political revolution” at home and join it to a worldwide campaign against authoritarians and for “the people.” It isn’t the foreign policy of a nation-state so much as the extension of movement politics across borders, as if President Sanders would be the leader of a global nonprofit organization, not a country.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhere does Buttigieg come down? When I asked him which recent presidents might serve as models for foreign-policy making in his administration, he didn’t single anyone out. “What’s interesting about the period certainly since the Cold War is how hard it is to say there’s been a real alignment that many of us could feel like we’re signed up for,” he said. “Most of what I get out of looking at the past is cautionary tales, and just reminders of how hazardous it is.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter our interview, he got back to me with the name of an earlier president—Harry S. Truman, the namesake of one of Buttigieg’s dogs. In 1948, Truman defeated Wallace, the Progressive Party candidate, and made liberal anti-communism the doctrine of the postwar Democratic Party.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eButtigieg doesn’t have anything like a doctrine yet, or even detailed policy positions, and he doesn’t speak Truman’s rough-hewn Middle American. When Buttigieg talks about foreign policy, he sounds more like a Rhodes Scholar and McKinsey consultant than like a midwestern mayor or a veteran—“challenges and opportunities,” “You’ve got diplomatic, economic, information, and cybertools in your toolkit in addition to the hard-security assets.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eButtigieg spent seven months as a Navy intelligence officer in Kabul in 2014, which was supposed to be the last year of the American war in Afghanistan. Five years later, American troops are still there. Buttigieg is a critic of ill-defined military intervention generally. “I believe we should use force when there is a clear and present threat to the U.S.,” he said in his speech, “when it’s necessary to deter and defend against an attack on or imminent threat against the United States, our citizens at home or abroad, or our treaty allies, and when we act as part of a legitimate international coalition to prevent genocide or other atrocities.” Those conditions would have ruled out the war in Iraq, of course, which Buttigieg opposed while he was at Harvard, but also military intervention in the Syrian civil war. When I asked whether he would have ordered missile strikes after the Syrian regime massacred civilians with chemical weapons outside Damascus in the summer of 2013, the answer was no, not without the support of allies and Congress.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat was also Obama’s position. (Buttigieg added that the “deeper problem” was Obama’s original red line, which turned out to be erasable.) But Buttigieg doesn’t see Obama’s foreign policies as useful guides to the future. Both Republican and Democratic presidents since the Cold War have failed to connect events overseas with the lives of ordinary Americans. It wasn’t until his last months in office, just days after the election of Trump, that Obama said, “Globalization needs a course correction.” That failure to see the connection between foreign and domestic policy explains the public’s exhaustion with unexplained commitments and its loss of faith in foreign-policy elites.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eButtigieg is placed by age and experience—a Millennial, a veteran of the forever war, the mayor of a struggling industrial city—to insist on making the connection. “Everything we have to say about foreign policy has to be tied back to what it means at home,” he told me. In other words, every geopolitical move should be evaluated by its effect on American workers, farmers, and citizens.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEver since the ’90s, for example, America’s relationship with China has generally been more beneficial for elites than for ordinary Americans. “I’m not among the Democrats who think that China’s nothing to worry about,” Buttigieg said. He might have been talking about Sanders, who barely mentioned China in his two speeches, and then described it not as an economic and political threat but as a global partner on climate change. “While I think it’s a real strategic failure to just poke them in the eye with tariffs and see what happens,” Buttigieg went on, “I think it’s not wrong to perceive a real challenge from China.” Under Trump, he admitted, “there’s something about the orientation on China that I think is not completely wrong.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut where Trump sees a merely economic rival, Buttigieg sees a dangerous ideological model (“the perfection of dictatorship”) whose stability and success look more and more attractive to other countries. To prevail against that competition, America has to be true to its own claims about itself. “If the U.S. is perceived as seeking to dominate the world as a matter of just calculation around our interests, then I think it’s going to be morally suspect, and it’s going to arouse a lot of resentment around the world and ultimately be self-defeating.” But the rising popularity of Chinese-style authoritarianism and Russian-style oligarchy make it all the more important “that American values be vindicated globally … It’s actually a moment that kind of makes me, more than usual, feel patriotically committed to American values, at least American values at our best and what they’re supposed to be.” In framing a picture of the next few decades as a battle of competing ideologies, Buttigieg sounds a bit like Truman at the beginning of the Cold War.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eButtigieg wants to set a generous narrative of national identity against Trump’s cramped and cruel vision, and against the progressive hostility to any national identity at all. It won’t be easy. He speaks of the compassion of his Indiana neighbors toward refugees, their desire to be part of “a greater project” than just America First. But the strongest political emotions of the moment are fear, disillusionment, and hatred. As impressive as he is personally, Buttigieg hasn’t yet found the words, the music, and the policies to make his appeal convincing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/zkJipv5Jx2E\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/zkJipv5Jx2E/","published":"2019-06-11T18:19:11Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-591436"},{"title":"Kevin Durant’s Disastrous Comeback","content":"\u003cp\u003eEntering last night’s fifth game of the NBA Finals, the Golden State Warriors \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/05/golden-state-warriors-finals-kevin-durant/590413/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eneeded Kevin Durant\u003c/a\u003e. They faced elimination, trailing the Toronto Raptors three games to one in the best-of-seven series, and injuries had hampered them along the way. Durant himself had missed more than a month of the playoff run with what was \u003ca href=\"https://www.nba.com/article/2019/05/09/kevin-durant-goes-locker-room-leg-injury\"\u003etermed a “calf strain,”\u003c/a\u003e but the team’s problems went beyond that. The shooting guard Klay Thompson had sat out Game 3 after hurting his hamstring. One center, Kevon Looney, was playing through a cartilage fracture in his chest, and another, DeMarcus Cousins, had torn his quadriceps muscle earlier in the postseason and could hardly jump. When Durant was cleared to play by team personnel yesterday afternoon, after rampant speculation about whether he’d return at all, the stage was set for the most straightforward type of sports heroism.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThings held to script for a while, with Durant netting three three-pointers and a pair of free-throws in 12 minutes to stake Golden State to an early five-point lead. He looked cautious but able, the usual knifing patterns of his game replaced by a catch-and-shoot routine at which he is only slightly less effective. But early in the second quarter, trying a more complex dribbling maneuver, he fell to the floor and reached for his right heel. The game then split. On the court, the remaining Warriors gave up the lead before charging back to retake it in the closing minutes, extending their season by another game. Off the court, Durant was helped to the locker room, eventually leaving the arena on crutches and in a walking boot. In the hours that followed, the news was about as bad as it can be for a professional basketball player: He is thought to have \u003ca href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/26944533/sources-warriors-believe-kd-torn-achilles\"\u003etorn his Achilles tendon\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" height=\"513\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/06/RTX6YT4I/14ab0dfdd.jpg\" width=\"672\"\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"caption\"\u003eKevin Durant sits on the court after an apparent injury during the second quarter in Game 5 against the Toronto Raptors of the 2019 NBA Finals at Scotiabank Arena.(Kyle Terada / USA TODAY Sports)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eQuestions about the nature of Durant’s preexisting injury and his potential for further damage arose immediately, buttressed by more fundamental questions of motivation, influence, and pressure. “I don’t believe there’s anybody to blame,” \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlYQimx7ArI\"\u003esaid\u003c/a\u003e the Warriors general manager Bob Myers late Monday night, his voice cracking, “but I understand this world, and if you have to, you can blame me.” The minds of many basketball fans backtracked: to videos of Durant, in preceding days, with an ice pack \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/JaredSGreenberg/status/1137813030144811008\"\u003ecloser to his heel than to his calf\u003c/a\u003e; to reports that some Golden State players were \u003ca href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/report-warriors-frustrated-kevin-durant-150223962.html\"\u003efrustrated with his ongoing absence\u003c/a\u003e; to pundits calling his return the Warriors’ \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNYqmXkTxA8\"\u003eonly chance\u003c/a\u003e at a championship.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe invitation from Myers is easy to accept. The cleanest explanation is that the Warriors were not as careful as they should have been, or would have been under different circumstances, that their attention to their star player’s health existed in some kind of relation to the direness of their challenge. Complicating matters is the fact that Durant was due to be a free agent at year’s end—he may now opt to \u003ca href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-11/durant-s-injury-leaves-nba-decision-makers-saying-holy-s\"\u003estay with the team\u003c/a\u003e while rehabbing his injury—which, in the cynic’s view, could have made the Warriors less invested in his long-term health. Myers recognizes that the cynic’s view will likely be the prevailing one. “The people that worked with [Durant] and cleared him are good people,” he said preemptively at the postgame presser. “They’re good people.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe ramifications of Durant’s injury are extensive. The immediate effect is that, if his recovery spans the usual year-plus required of an Achilles injury, the NBA will be without one of its most exciting figures, with a guard’s handle and an all-time shooting stroke ludicrously packaged into a near-7-foot frame. His absence will alter the direction of the league this summer, as organizations lined up to pursue him in free agency will have to decide whether he’s worth the risk; \u003ca href=\"https://www.theringer.com/nba/2019/6/10/18656560/new-york-knicks-nba-draft-free-agency-trades-zion-durant-kawhi-kyrie-kemba-ad\"\u003epredicted superteams\u003c/a\u003e may quickly become the stuff of alternate histories.

In his paper, which is currently under peer review, he looks closely at the construction of homes that are larger than at least 90 percent of the other houses in the neighborhood. By his calculation, if homes in the 90th percentile were 10 percent bigger, the neighbors would be less pleased with their own homes unless those homes grew 10 percent as well. Moreover, the homeowners most sensitive to such shifts are the ones whose houses are in the second-biggest tier, not the ones whose houses are median-sized.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo be clear, having more space does generally lead to people saying they’re more pleased with their home. The problem is that the satisfaction often doesn’t last if even bigger homes pop up nearby. “If I bought a house to feel like I'm ‘the king of my neighborhood,’ but a new king arises, it makes me feel very bad about my house,” Bellet wrote to me in an email.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe largest houses seem to be the ones that all the other homeowners base their expectations on. In neighborhoods where the biggest houses are more modest, Bellet told me, expanding the size of one’s house can be 10 times as satisfying as undertaking such an expansion in a neighborhood where the biggest homes are palatial.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBellet sketches out an unfulfilling cycle of one-upmanship, in which the owners of the biggest homes are most satisfied if their home remains among the biggest, and those who rank right below them grow less satisfied as their dwelling looks ever more measly by comparison. He estimates that from 1980 to 2009, the size of the largest 10 percent of houses increased 1.4 times as fast as did the size of the median house. This means that the reference point many people have for what constitutes a big home has shifted further out of reach, just as many other lifestyle reference points have shifted in an age of pronounced wealth inequality.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo reach these conclusions, Bellet scraped data on millions of American homes from the real-estate website Zillow, and grafted it onto data from the American Housing Survey, which has been conducted by the Census Bureau since 1973 and records, among other things, how big new homes are and how satisfied homeowners are with their houses. The merging of these two sources allowed Bellet to examine how envy might play out on the level of the neighborhood block, and to study, for instance, whether being close to an enormous new house makes one less satisfied with one’s own home. (It appears to.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBellet was looking in particular at the links between the size of one’s home and one’s satisfaction with it. But it could well be the case that having a bigger home is beneficial in ways he wasn’t focusing on. “There could be positive impacts on, say, long-run life satisfaction more generally if McMansion neighborhoods also have better schools, which improves the future outcomes of homeowners’ kids,” Bellet wrote to me.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf course, expansive homes could be unfulfilling in other ways. “The big house represents the atomizing of the American family,” a historian of landscape development \u003ca href=\"https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5525283\"\u003etold NPR for a story on gargantuan American homes back in 2006\u003c/a\u003e. “Each person not only has his or her own television—each person has his or her own bathroom … This way, the family members rarely have to interact.” It’s comfortable, in a way, but maybe also lonely.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn this sense, the story of American home sizes in the past half century is a story of shifting norms. Fifty-plus years ago, a one-bathroom house or a bedroom that slept multiple siblings might have felt cramped—but it also \u003ca href=\"https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5525283\"\u003eprobably felt normal\u003c/a\u003e.

She enlists Celeste (Nicole Kidman), a former lawyer, to helping her convince the mayor to allow the play to happen. When they succeed, they’re elated: As stay-at-home moms living in the affluent seaside city of Monterey, California, they rarely venture outside of family life. They \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3KTEJz_Rgs\"\u003erealize they want, simply, “more.”\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e“I feel so ashamed for saying this, but being a mother, it’s not enough for me, it’s just not.

I’m evil.” No, she’s not, Madeline responds—she feels the same way. “That made me feel alive, too,” she says about persuading the mayor. “I want more!” And then she honks the horn and screams. The scene is electrifying: two women finally voicing how suffocated they feel as mothers who can’t embrace motherhood as their primary identity—even if they can only admit their desires to each other inside the safety of Madeline’s car, insulated from the judgment of everyone else.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIn Season 2, Mary Louise Wright (Meryl Streep), the mother of the murdered, abusive Perry (Alexander Skarsgård), arrives in Monterey, ostensibly to help Celeste cope with life as a widow. But she also seems acutely aware of Celeste and Madeline’s longing—and she knows how to use it to her advantage. Which makes her a fascinating threat: The beloved smothering mother—the “smother”—is nothing new, but in Streep’s hands, and on a show populated now by tormented characters weighed down by guilt, Mary Louise brings a welcome, wicked energy to the proceedings.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eJust look at the way Madeline wilts in her presence in the second-season premiere, when Mary Louise almost immediately picks up on her existential dissatisfaction. “I find little people to be untrustworthy,” Mary Louise \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GnlVd4l_5Y\"\u003ebegins\u003c/a\u003e, in a singsongy voice that only Meryl Streep, she of the \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ja2fgquYTCg\"\u003esubdued line readings\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_1MW46G9I\"\u003eOscar-winning intensity\u003c/a\u003e, can pull off. “You seem like a nice person.

Mary Louise wants answers about her son, wants everyone to mourn him, wants him back. Unlike Madeline and Celeste, she embraces her role as the grieving mother and dutiful grandmother—and she uses it as a Trojan horse for her villainy. Because underneath that soft-spoken demeanor is a woman capable of exploiting the insecurities and underlying guilt of the women her son knew. It’s an insidious form of cruelty packaged inside a well-meaning, maternal facade.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eBut thank goodness she’s there.

In her verbal sparring matches with Madeline, she sits while Madeline stands above her, but Mary Louise walks away from both of their exchanges on top. It’s not clear just yet why Madeline irks her so much; maybe she intuits that Madeline had something to do with Perry’s death, or maybe it’s the fact that Madeline has leaned into her wants (by embarking on a new career).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith Celeste, she’s even more malicious, picking at her shame—Celeste admits to her therapist that she still feels “responsible” for Perry’s death—and toying with her gratitude.

As the season continues, she’ll seek out other members of the “Monterey Five,” hoping not just to learn how Perry died, but also to change their minds about him.

The commander, U.S. Navy Captain William Shepherd, decided to honor a naval New Year’s tradition, in which the person at the helm recites a poem. Shepherd had written something for the occasion, which included the following, recorded in the ship’s log:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThough star trackers mark Altair and Vega / Same as mariners eyed long ago / We are still as wayfinders of knowledge / Seeking new things that mankind shall know.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe station had been under construction, in orbit, for four years at that point, but Expedition 1 marked the beginning of continuous human habitation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eToday the space station’s “wayfinders of knowledge” are still steering an orbiting laboratory for experiments in biology and materials science. But just as explorers of the sea did their job to blaze a path for merchants, the ISS could soon play host to wayfinders of a different sort, whose voyages will be enabled by a whole lot of cash. About $58 million, according to NASA, which announced last week that it would allow private citizens to fly to the only other realm where humans have lived.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNASA will charge about $35,000 a night per passenger to sleep on board the ISS and use its amenities, starting as soon as next year. The station can accommodate two paying visitors for up to a month, but people won’t be able to just show up. Visitors will sign contracts with SpaceX, Boeing, or other companies to pay for the rocket ride, fees, and other costs. That means these trips will remain the purview of the very rich and very powerful for a very long time to come. That makes space tourism unsustainable, and to a certain mind, depressingly out of reach. Once, astronauts chosen for their courage, verve, intelligence, and vigor embodied the mystique of space. Now the right stuff will come with a price tag. The stars may be an \u003ca href=\"http://aeon.co/magazine/health/the-health-effects-of-a-world-without-darkness/\"\u003eeverlasting connection to our ancestors\u003c/a\u003e, but the prize of soaring among them will be reserved for the wealthy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNASA’s decision to open up the space station is in some ways a natural next step for space exploration. Earlier, earthbound vessels all experienced a similar transformation. Transoceanic ships, railroads, and airplanes spawned cottage industries to enable their spread and wide adoption, and each eventually reached the masses. And in widening access to space, NASA is actually behind the Russians, whose space agency has transported a few space tourists through a company called Space Adventures.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut space is different. Space, as they say, is hard. To get there, you have to strap yourself to a bomb, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/04/spacex-anomaly-dragon-nasa/588277/?utm_source=feed\"\u003esometimes those bombs malfunction\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePersonal space exploration is also hard to justify. Space is not obviously a place of riches ready for the taking. There are no ports full of exotic foods to bring home, and there are no people or animals to oppress or exploit (at least not yet). There are no vast tracts of arable land where intrepid explorers can make, hunt, or gather everything they need. There is no water, or wind, or soil, or anything except sunlight and radiation. There is no good reason to take on the risk and the debt to get there in the hopes of making it rich.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/10/how-much-risk-is-space-flight-worth/541935/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: Space travel’s existential question\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis has not stopped private companies from exploring space, and it shouldn’t. The region where the space station circles Earth is mostly free from gravity’s influence, transforming many basic physical processes and enabling interesting science. Already, astronauts frequently conduct experiments for pharmaceutical firms that could lead to new medicines, because some proteins grow better in microgravity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile these projects are financed by private companies, government workers do the job. Astronauts undergo extensive training on Earth before flying to space to conduct biology experiments. It’s not clear yet whether the tourist visits will be open to private firms, turning the ISS into a co-working space in orbit. A private company could, in principle, buy tickets for its own scientists, or for that matter, manufacturers. Under the new tourism plan, NASA will also allow, for the first time, purely for-profit ventures that do not meet any educational or research goals. That could include flying objects or food to space, then selling them to collectors or connoisseurs back on Earth.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut space-based tourism doesn’t have the same utility as private, space-based research or as space-based mining, which may happen someday on the moon or on asteroids. Space-based tourism has no obvious external benefit—at least, none beyond the pure, personal exhilaration of a real-life glimpse of Earth’s curvature. Space tourism is a lark. It’s something for very rich people to do with their money. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has literally said so. “The only way that I can see to deploy this much financial resource is by converting my Amazon winnings into space travel. That is basically it,” he \u003ca href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/jeff-bezos-interview-axel-springer-ceo-amazon-trump-blue-origin-family-regulation-washington-post-2018-4\"\u003etold \u003cem\u003eBusiness Insider\u003c/em\u003e in 2018\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBezos also said he believes that his rocket company, Blue Origin, is his most important contribution to society; he argues that humans should spread throughout the solar system and leave Earth “zoned residential.” But occasional tourism by extremely wealthy people is a giant leap from something like Saturn-ward expansion.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis latest decision, to allow paying visitors, reveals the most about the attitudes of current political leadership toward space: as a place like any other, best suited for commerce.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSeveral multimillion-dollar tickets to the ISS could offset some of NASA’s bills, for starters. The agency currently spends about $8 million a day to operate the station, NASA officials said during the announcement last week. Some of those funds could be redirected to pay for a sped-up moon mission, aimed at landing astronauts back on the moon by 2024. That year also looms large for the station: Donald Trump’s administration has proposed ending federal funds for the ISS in 2024 and moving toward private stations or private ownership.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis poses somewhat of a conundrum for private companies. If you knew your cruise ship would be unusable within the next five years, how much time and money would you invest in selling tickets to sail on it? How much money would you invest, or be expected to invest, to maintain the station in a visitor-friendly state? Even if NASA could promise a shipshape ISS, the number of people visiting would hardly cover all the expenses. “This is not going to be a profit-making venture for NASA at all,” said Jeff DeWit, NASA’s CFO, at a news conference last week. “But it will help defray expenses.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/06/trump-nasa-international-space-station-bridenstine/562076/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: What should we do about the International Space Station?\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHanding tourists the keys to the ISS reflects a much broader shift in space exploration, one that prioritizes resource extraction and commercial profit over pure research and collective scientific efforts.

I’ve never applied for astronaut training, which is one form of an answer. The idea has certainly grown more plausible, as companies such as SpaceX have grown up and built successful rockets. And I can’t deny that a part of me dreams of experiencing the curvature of Earth, or visiting the gray and looming hills of our moon. I often answer that I have a telescope, and for me, right now, that is enough.

By today’s standards the machine is a dinosaur. It boasts a nine-inch black-and-white display. Mine came with a hard disk that offers 20 megabytes of storage, but some lacked even that luxury. And the computer still would have cost a fortune: The version I have retailed for $3,900, or about $8,400 in 2019 dollars.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThat’s a lot of money. It’s one of the reasons why computers weren’t as universal three decades ago as they are today, especially at home. In 1984, when the Macintosh first appeared, \u003ca href=\"https://www.census.gov/prod/2001pubs/p23-207.pdf\"\u003eabout 8 percent\u003c/a\u003e of U.S. homes had a computer; five years later, when the computer I’m writing on was sold, that figure had risen to a whopping 15 percent.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThat made for a totally different relationship to the machine than we have today. Nobody used one every hour—many people wouldn’t boot them for days at a time if the need didn’t arise. They were modest in power and application, clunking and grinding their way through family budget spreadsheets, school papers, and games.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eA computer was a tool for work, and diversion too, but it was not the best or only way to write a letter or to fritter away an hour. Computing was an accompaniment to life, rather than the sieve through which all ideas and activities must filter. That makes using this 30-year-old device a surprising joy, one worth longing for on behalf of what it was at the time, rather than for the future it inaugurated.\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr class=\"c-section-divider\"\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe original Macintosh was an adorable dwarf of a computer. About the size of a full-grown pug, its small footprint, built-in handle, and light weight made it easy to transport and stow. Perched on a single, wide paw, the machine looks perky and attentive, as if it’s there to serve you, rather than you it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe whirring drone wasn’t an original feature. Steve Jobs insisted on shipping the Macintosh without a cooling fan, to make it run quietly, but by the time this model appeared he had been \u003ca href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/john-sculley-spills-the-beans-on-firing-steve-jobs/\"\u003epushed out of the company\u003c/a\u003e, largely on account of how he’d run the Macintosh division. The introduction of Macintosh hard disks in 1985 had ended the machine’s silent service anyway; the SE got one inside the machine, and its smooth bezel was replaced by a more aggressive, vented one: a kind of goblin version of the endearing original.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eMy affection persists, though. I feel comfortable addressing this little machine. Now that laptops are ubiquitous, working on a computer at a desk is an ergonomic misery. At coffee shops and co-working spaces, people hunch over them, staring down toward screens perched at table-level. Laptops are even common in offices now, because their portability allows workers to take the job into the field with them—or more likely, to bring it home. Older desktop machines sat monitors higher up, either atop the machine itself, as the Apple II did, or in an all-in-one design, like my Mac SE. The result has me looking directly at the screen, no hunching required.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/05/freewrite/481566/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: The future of writing looks like the past\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThen there’s the simplicity. Everyone knows that the great triumph of the Macintosh was its ease of use. Unlike DOS or Unix workstations, and even unlike Apple’s earlier computers, the Mac’s graphical user interface freed consumer computing from esoteric commands. The design was never intuitive, to use a term often applied to it: The metaphor of folders, files, and a desktop, operated via overlapping widows, still required considerable new knowledge, even if that knowledge could be learned quickly. But it wasn’t user-friendliness alone that made computers of this era great—it was simplicity. Mouseing, dragging, and menuing does make the machine easier to learn how to use than punching in commands by keystroke. But after that, the plainness of its operation is more important. A 1980s Mac offers only a handful of useful features. (Once Windows 3.0 arrived on the scene in 1990, that truth applied to a PC as much a Macintosh.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eOn my modern MacBook Pro, a million things are happening at once. Mail retrieves email, sounding regular dings as it arrives. Dispatches fire off, too, in Messages, in Skype, in Slack. Attention-seeking ads flash in the background of web pages, while nagging reminders of Microsoft Office updates bounce in the dock. News notifications spurt out from the screen’s edge, along with every other manner of notices about what’s happening on and off the machine. Computing is a Times Square of urge and stimulus.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eBy contrast, the Macintosh SE just can’t do much. It boots to a simple file manager, where I face but a few windows and menu options. I can manage files, configure the interface, or run programs. It feels quiet here, despite the whirring noise. At least it’s literal noise, in the ears, instead of the ethereal kind that bombards my faculties on the MacBook Pro.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThere aren’t many programs worth running on this old machine, anyway. I installed Pyro, a popular screen-saver of the era, and Klondike solitaire, as if I couldn’t distract myself with my iPhone instead. Even within the programs that made people spend money on computers, simplicity reigns. I’m writing in Microsoft Word 4.0, which was released for this platform in 1990. More sophisticated than MacWrite, Apple’s word processor, the program is still extremely basic—the only reason I chose Word was so I could open the file on my modern Mac to edit and file it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" height=\"468\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/06/ZIeLYSBcUZYajrzSk0l3cLEOs9SnqUqr9cbXfV4I86_2VbiuSR6giyrWNNpUdOv5oE1_xpnC61L3XXIZ5DSaqscg51g6DmDMLCtwKdcOtPNquYIn1p6P_kg8_WpSrd2WgtNKF8f4/58009f82e.png\" width=\"624\"\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"caption\"\u003eThe author’s circa-1988 Macintosh SE, displaying a draft of this article in progress (Ian Bogost / The Atlantic)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThere’s not much to report; it’s a word processor. A window displays the text I am typing, whose fonts and paragraphs I can style in a manner that was still novel in the 1980s. Footnotes, tables, and graphics are possible, but all I really need to do is produce words in order, a cruel reality that has plagued writers for millennia.

Of course, it doesn’t matter much, since I can’t go online with this machine (at least, not without adding a modem, and software that wouldn’t become available for another half decade or so).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe \u003ca href=\"https://gizmodo.com/9-minimal-word-processor-apps-for-distraction-free-writ-1730016034\"\u003emany writing tools\u003c/a\u003e that today promise to encourage focus and attention are just racing to catch up with a past three decades gone.

Even the keyboard that came with this machine leaves out the extras: No function keys or other extras adorn its surface, which only exists for inputting text. The primitive screen also makes a difference. Today’s internet addicts sometimes \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/video/index/480240/adventures-in-grayscale/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eset their devices to monochrome\u003c/a\u003e to make it less tempting to pick them up. But this Macintosh screen is already black-and-white, which solidifies its role as a tool for me to use rather than a sink for all my time and attention.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eEven the tiny, nine-inch size offers startling benefits. \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/05/freewrite/481566/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eWhen I wrote about the Freewrite\u003c/a\u003e, a portable, hipster word processor that can save files to the cloud, I celebrated the welcome surprise of writing in the world instead of on the computer. That device is flat, with an e-ink screen. In the hands of a touch-typist, it liberates a writer from the sense of being inside the computer, fully enveloped by its overwhelming occupation of your field of vision, and thereby of your attention and ideas. It combats a neglected terror, where what is thinkable only extends as far as what the computer can present.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe all-in-one Macintosh engenders a similar experience. The screen is big enough to see clearly from a foot away, but small enough that it doesn’t overtake my vision. I can look up from it and stare around it, into the distance. Laptops, especially smaller ones, afford something similar, but they also contain the effort of all labors and pleasures; there’s no need, nor desire, ever to look up from one. The Macintosh is portable, handle and all, because it likely would have been put away when its owner wasn’t working on it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThen, small screens were the norm, first in \u003ca href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/25727481?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents\"\u003ededicated word processors\u003c/a\u003e, and then in desktop computer monitors, too. The Mac SE’s tiny screen wouldn’t have seemed so tiny back then; even the largest ones were only a few inches bigger. Well into the 1990s, a 17-inch computer monitor would have been heavy and costly, a luxury relegated almost exclusively to professionals.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eEven televisions \u003ca href=\"https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-1990-09-30-1990273133-story.html\"\u003ewere smaller in this era\u003c/a\u003e. A 13-inch TV wouldn’t have been uncommon, and a standard set measured around 25 inches. That made both the television and the computer less prominent in, but more fused with, the home (or work) environment—and, counterintuitively, it did so by receding more into the background. It’s easy to forget a machine’s context of use so long after its equipment has vanished. That history cannot be \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/05/mac-attack/527979/?utm_source=feed\"\u003erecreated in software emulation\u003c/a\u003e alone. Even when computers became everyday fixtures, they did so away from ordinary life: on out-of-the-way credenzas behind workplace desks or in the covert shadow of basement offices. One would have to go to it, rather than carrying it everywhere. The device was often shared, especially in the home, making it an accessory to life, rather than life itself. It’s hard not to long for that time, given the compulsive draw of constant computing today.\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr class=\"c-section-divider\"\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eEven bracketing the welcome absence of the internet, with its hurtling notices and demands, the speed of this machine’s operation changes the tenor of my work. Computers used to be slow as hell. When I first got a 386 PC in the early 1990s, I would switch it on and leave the room for a while, so it could , load the BIOS, then DOS, then Windows 3.1 atop it—hard disk grinding the whole time—until finally it was ready to respond to my keystrokes and mouse clicks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe Macintosh SE I’m writing on now boots much faster than Windows ever did, but everything here is slow too. When I open a folder, the file icons all take shape like a color squad entering formation. Loading a program like Word issues a long pause, giving me enough time to view and read the splash screen—a lost software art that provided entertainment as much as feedback. Saving a file grinds the hard disk for noticeable moments, stopping me in my tracks while the cute watch icon spins.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/05/mac-attack/527979/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: What it’s like to use an original Macintosh in 2017\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eBy comparison, today’s machines are lightning-fast. Solid-state drives make boot times and file access almost immediate. Modern multicore processors can  access colossal amounts of memory, all the while wasting vast computing power through inefficiency or devoting huge amounts of machine resources to facilitate high-level software development that makes it easier to write programs. Today’s machines power through most simple tasks, like word processing, by brute force. I don’t even notice booting my modern laptop, running a program, or saving a file anymore. Those acts have evaporated into historical memory, increasingly inaccessible even to those, like me, who used the first generations of personal computers often enough to know better. Computers are faster now in every way, but the time that power has captured just gets invested in more computing time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eI glance past the small form of the Macintosh and ponder that idea while this file saves. The drone of the disk and the fan seems to lull into a resonant frequency with the desk, the chair, and my body and brain connected to them. I wait while my document writes to disk, while Word quits, and while the Mac shuts down. It’s a strange feeling; I can’t remember the last time I shut down a computer, instead of just closing it up or letting it sleep, ready to be reanimated at the touch of a button.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe high-tech industry would characterize that act as an inconvenience, probably, imposed by the primitive technology of the past. Inevitably, in the hands of engineers and investors, the machines were bound to become faster, more powerful, more influential, more ubiquitous. And indeed they did, and now they are everywhere. My laptop is always on; my tablet is ever at the ready; my smartphone is literally in my actual hand except when I’m sleeping, if indeed I ever sleep instead of staring at it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eAs I flick off the power switch on the back of Macintosh, the whine retreats in a gentle diminuendo, until it finally gives way to silence.

The boundaries of this digital age have been redrawn, and by 2020, the exciting world of streaming media might start to look very old-fashioned once again.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/0MoPTkH2lz4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/0MoPTkH2lz4/","published":"2019-06-11T13:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-591373"},{"title":"The Future of Marketing Is Bespoke Everything","content":"\u003cp\u003eAlthough there are billions of people in the world, it’s always tempting to believe your existence is unprecedented in some way. For me it’s my hair, which I’ve long suspected poses an uncanny challenge to the world of follicular maintenance. It’s curly yet fine, frizzy yet flat, oily at the roots yet dry as kindling at the ends. Everything I do to it only makes it worse, including bleaching the ends, wearing it in a topknot most of the time, and flat-ironing it half to death.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMaybe the problem is me. But maybe, I sometimes imagine, the problem is simply that hair products aren’t equipped to deal with the paradox atop my head. Every high-quality shampoo and conditioner I’ve ever used has been some version of \u003cem\u003efine\u003c/em\u003e: My hair ends up looking clean and smooth enough, but it still feels like there’s some yet unseen level of beauty I could be achieving. I let myself believe that the only thing standing between me and perfect hair are the whims of cosmetic chemistry.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA few months ago, Prose, a start-up that offers personalized, custom-blended hair-care products based on customers’ responses to a lengthy survey, wore me down with an alluring marketing tactic: beautiful Instagram ads indulging the idea that what’s going on on my head might be too unique for whatever Sephora has to offer. If I told the company my long list of petty hair complaints, perhaps I’d never again have to stand in front of \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2019/05/too-many-options/590185/?utm_source=feed\"\u003ea wall of indistinguishable products\u003c/a\u003e, trying to guess which one might be my holy grail.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat did I have to lose except money, which history suggests I am almost always willing to lose? I ordered a shampoo, a conditioner, and a mask that promised to “balance” my roots. The package arrived with a full-color card-stock brochure of the ingredients that would fix my hair and maybe my life. It was the beauty enthusiast’s answer to a baseball fan’s advanced stats: In the “diagnostic” section, I learned about the causes of my bad-hair days, such as “\u003ca href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/beauty-skin-care/sebum\"\u003esebum\u003c/a\u003e” and “damage.” On the next page, little illustrations of things like plant collagen and silk proteins promised a better tomorrow.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe personalized shampoo, conditioner, and hair mask came in simple containers that evinced a distinctly Millennial sense of understated luxury. Each had my name on the label. I wasn’t just going to wash my hair, I told myself. I was going to outsmart it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr class=\"c-section-divider\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor 40 years, Burger King has been offering customers the opportunity to “\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJXzkUH72cY\"\u003ehave it your way\u003c/a\u003e.” But technological limitations have long prevented personalization from moving beyond food service and into the consumer-product market. If you go to the drugstore to buy face wash, picking up a version blended just for you would require it to be made on-site, just like your Whopper. Shopping for one-of-a-kind things has been the province of the wealthy—those who could afford bespoke suits and customized cars while the rest of America bought off the rack.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow, aided by advances in manufacturing and the direct-to-consumer nature of online shopping, personalization has become the \u003ca href=\"https://www2.deloitte.com/tr/en/pages/consumer-business/articles/made-to-order-the-rise-of-mass-personalisation.html\"\u003ehot new thing\u003c/a\u003e at much more accessible prices. That’s especially true in the wellness industry, where Prose is one of a slew of new companies offering everything from custom-blended face creams to individualized vitamin cocktails. Together, these brands have attracted millions of shoppers (and millions of dollars in venture-capital funding) by tapping into something powerful: the idea that we’re all fancy and special enough to have something made just for us.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/05/food-customization-america/482073/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: Fancy Starbucks drinks and the special snowflakes who order them\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBefore starting Prose, Arnaud Plas, the company’s CEO and co-founder, spent 10 years in the beauty industry, including six at the behemoth L’Oréal, where the demand for constant novelty wasn’t fueled by any particular consumer need. “Retailers [were] asking for more and more new products just to fill the shelves,” Plas says. Meanwhile, he got the feeling that consumers wanted the opposite: more simplicity and clearer choices.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBecause everyone’s hair has different needs, however, making a one-shampoo-to-rule-them-all company wouldn’t work in the same way it has for\u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2018/12/12/18125668/best-products-casper-glossier-brooklinen\"\u003e Millennial-friendly brands\u003c/a\u003e of mattresses or suitcases, which distill broad, confusing product categories down to a single product they promise is the best. That’s where personalization comes in. “It’s simplicity for customers, because we’re only pushing one option,” Plas says. In addition to a bespoke product, personalized beauty brands offer something maybe even more beguiling for overstimulated shoppers: freedom from choice.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo make that happen, Prose uses a method preferred by many personalization start-ups, including Care/of, which doles out nutritional supplements, and Curology, which mixes custom creams: an internet survey. I love talking about myself, so taking a lengthy quiz that would assure me of my hair’s snowflake status wasn’t exactly a tough sell. Plas says the brand now gets more than a million survey submissions a month.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEven so, asking people to describe their hair—or their skin, or their eating habits—has limitations. “It’s very important not only to ask the questions, but how you ask the questions,” Plas cautions. “We’re realizing that some people don’t really know how to answer.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAccording to Holly Maguire, the creative director at the cosmetic-development company Freelance Formulations, people have a difficult time situating themselves on a continuum when they don’t have much experience with other people’s skin or hair. “I think everyone’s perception of themselves and their skin and hair and how they look varies,” she says. “What constitutes oily hair? How do you tell if you do actually have oily hair, and what level is it?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn reality, my paradoxical hair isn’t as special as I’d like to believe. Lots of people bleach and heat-style, leave their hair in a ponytail holder for a day or two, or go a little overboard with the dry shampoo. I simply believe my hair is special because it’s my problem. While taking my own survey on Prose’s website, my potential to be an unreliable hair narrator (hairrator?) became clear. Prose asks about texture and moisture, but also about your environment, your activity level, and how much time you spend outside. I live in New York City and walk a lot, but I don’t exercise outside—unless exercise includes walking a lot? Prose also wants to know how you eat, which means I had to divine the practical difference between a diet that is “balanced” and one that is “unrestricted.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo get the most out of personalization via algorithm, not only do you have to know the ins and outs of your own needs, but you have to think about what a brand might be trying to learn by asking a particular question, and how that information might impact your results. It’s the e-commerce version of swiping your hand under an automatic faucet, trying to determine what kind of motion the machine wants in order to get your hands wet. These services can only go as far as the partnership between user and technology allows, which means that if you do a half-assed job answering the survey, you could end up with a multivitamin or skin-care routine no better than what you would have bought at a store.\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr class=\"c-section-divider\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat doesn’t mean personalization programs can’t have upsides for both consumers and brands. Maguire sees advantages to using personalized products, even though her company creates things for the mass market. “When you’re talking about skin sensitivities or allergies, I definitely think that a custom product could be needed,” she says. Personalized beauty-product brands frequently let customers opt out of fragrances or ingredients derived from animals, which gives shoppers with sensitivities or ethical preferences more options than they would have otherwise. In addition to the lengthy up-front explanation of which ingredients are in each product, Prose follows up with buyers after three weeks to tweak their formulas as needed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is the internet, though, so acquiring a personalized life isn’t a simple exchange of money for goods and services. Brands like Prose don’t just collect revenue—they collect data. Exhaustive surveys provide useful context when formulating a bespoke product, but they also give companies a level of granular information about their consumers that most traditional brands could never hope to acquire. L’Oreal will never know anything about my exercise habits, but Prose already does.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/05/how-online-shopping-makes-suckers-of-us-all/521448/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: How online shopping makes suckers of us all\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRonald Goldsmith, a consumer psychologist and a professor emeritus at Florida State University, says that data collection has always been a lucrative by-product of any customization program. “Companies will frequently collect that information, mesh it with what other information they can get from other sources, and sell the information back and forth” to other companies, he says. Prose’s privacy policy allows it to sell your data to other companies at will, as do the policies of most similar brands. (Prose shares data with partner companies like payment processors, but Pras says that Prose does not sell data to third parties.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEven with the privacy issues that are rampant in much of modern shopping, Goldsmith thinks personalized products are an easy sell to many consumers, who tend to love them. In spite of the indignities of admitting that an Instagram ad worked on me (and in spite of the healthy amount of journalistic skepticism with which I approached my Prose shampoo order), I’m now part of that group. My curls are shiny and bouncy, even though most curl-friendly products weigh down my hair. The products smell amazing (and so does my hair), and my one-of-a-kind shampoo and conditioner were a couple of bucks less expensive per bottle than the high-end stuff I normally buy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI also didn’t have to flip between product listings, trying to divine the secrets of several near-identical varieties of hair goop. The correct choice showed up in my apartment with my name right there on the label. “Choice overwhelms people, and studies have shown that people don’t respond well to too much choice,” Goldsmith explains. Personalization is a way out of that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNevertheless, Goldsmith says, the current crop of companies offering personalization might end up too successful for their own good: “The problem is that when it works, competitors do it.” It’s not hard to imagine a near future in which upstarts and big brands alike will let you have it your way with a custom cocktail of nutrients or a special face serum all your own, as long as you’re willing to tell them everything about yourself.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/FRDG3UnR8LM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/FRDG3UnR8LM/","published":"2019-06-11T12:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-591367"},{"title":"People Who Pay People to Kill People","content":"\u003cp class=\"dropcap\"\u003eM\u003cspan class=\"smallcaps\"\u003eegan Danielczak\u003c/span\u003e couldn’t stand living with her husband, but couldn’t afford to live without him. So she came up with a plan that was boilerplate noir: Hire a killer to murder him, and collect the life-insurance payout. She met the hit man in a Walmart parking lot on Valentine’s Day last year, and gave him a down payment of three gold rings and $402 in cash, and a promise of another $4,500 on the back end. Fortunately for Danielczak’s husband, if unfortunately for her, the hit man was an undercover cop. She is now serving two years in a Wisconsin prison, having been convicted of solicitation to commit first-degree intentional homicide.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStories of unconsummated contract killings make headlines on a regular basis. Sometimes the motive is shockingly impersonal: Last year, a Houston man allegedly took out a $2,000 contract on the police officer who had been slapping his business’s vehicles with tickets. More often, the crime can be \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2019/02/building-public-database-murdered-women/582769/?utm_source=feed\"\u003etraced to an intimate but fractured relationship\u003c/a\u003e. In February, federal authorities charged an Indiana man and his girlfriend with murder for hire, after the two allegedly solicited a hit on the man’s ex-wife following a child-custody battle. The couple agreed to a fee of $5,000 to $10,000, “depending on the job’s complexity.” As in the Danielczak case, both the Houston and Indiana plots were foiled by undercover law-enforcement officers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCriminologists have a name for a person who hires a hit man: \u003ci\u003einstigator\u003c/i\u003e. They also confirm what news stories suggest: Lots of instigators get caught because they don’t know what they’re doing. After all, most of us don’t socialize with professional killers. The average person therefore looks to acquaintances or neighbors for referrals, or finds his way to criminal bottom-feeders who are likely to be inept and inexperienced. The former may be inclined to call law enforcement, while the latter may lose their nerve or botch the job. Which helps explain why so many murders for hire don’t produce any dead bodies.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 2003, the Australian Institute of Criminology published \u003ca href=\"https://aic.gov.au/publications/rpp/rpp53\"\u003ean analysis of 163 contract-killing cases\u003c/a\u003e (some completed, others merely attempted) in Australia; it remains one of the most significant studies ever conducted of the subject. The authors determined that 2 percent of all murders in Australia were contract killings and that contracts were, in some cases, surprisingly affordable. One unfulfilled contract was for 500 Australian dollars; another job was completed for just $2,000. Among other key findings, nearly 20 percent of all contracts involved a romantic relationship gone wrong, and 16 percent were financially motivated.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother study, this one of contract killings in Tennessee, found instigators pretty evenly split between men and women. This is notable, given that almost all conventional murders are committed by men. But it tracks with the fact that women are almost as likely as men to wish someone dead. In \u003ci\u003eThe Murderer Next Door: Why the Mind Is Designed to Kill\u003c/i\u003e, David M. Buss, an evolutionary psychologist, reports that “91 percent of men and 84 percent of women have had at least one vivid fantasy about killing someone.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003caside class=\"callout-placeholder\" data-source=\"curated\"\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat of the people who are hired to kill? Reid Meloy, a forensic psychologist who has consulted on a dozen murder-for-hire cases, told me that virtually all of the contract killers he’s examined display \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/03/a-hidden-problem-at-the-heart-of-psychopathy/555335/?utm_source=feed\"\u003emoderate to severe psychopathy\u003c/a\u003e. “Psychopathy, as a constellation of personality traits, gives them both the aggression and the emotional detachment to be able to carry out an act like this for money,” he says. Other experts I spoke with believe that both parties to a contract killing are engaged in psychological distancing. The contractor comforts himself by saying, \u003ci\u003eThis is my job. I’m just following orders. \u003c/i\u003eThe instigator thinks, \u003ci\u003eI’m not a murderer—he’s the one pulling the trigger.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePark Dietz, a forensic psychiatrist who has testified in court cases of criminals ranging from serial killers (Jeffrey Dahmer) to deranged assassins (John Hinckley Jr.), has another theory as to why homicidal people hire help. “My prime suspect is the depiction of hit men in popular culture, such as films, TV, video games, and novels,” Dietz told me, noting that the last time he entered \u003ci\u003ehit man\u003c/i\u003e into Netflix, hundreds of results appeared.

Andrew Ferguson, a law professor at the University of the District of Columbia who testified at the May hearing, told me that accuracy issues compromise the reliability of facial recognition, and current legislation is far too weak to prevent misuse. “The technology is not ready for prime time,” he said. “And as was just demonstrated with the hack, the security systems are not ready for prime time either.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/Va37l9oK0v8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/Va37l9oK0v8/","published":"2019-06-11T11:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-591403"},{"title":"One Day, All of This Will Be Embarrassing","content":"\u003cp\u003eI was at home on a recent Sunday when one of my twin 6-year-old sons did something absolutely adorable, but you’ll have to take my word for it. I’m not showing you the picture. He had spent the whole morning making a complete superhero constume out of paper, and when it was time for him to try it on, I pointed my phone at him, as so many 21st-century parents do. He immediately—and definitively—told me he was not okay with that. “Don’t put that online!”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t entirely object to digital sharing: After I pleaded for a bit, he gave me permission to send it to a group text of grandparents and cousins. “It’s okay if it’s only family,” he said. I later asked him to tell me a little more about why he didn’t want his photo online, and he explained, “I’m shy. I might get embarrassed if other people saw it who aren’t our friends.

But what I endured is nothing like the unblinking surveillance my own children face. Gigabytes and gigabytes of photos and videos are on hard drives and the cloud, chronicling them from birth and even before. Many parents have begun to consider what it means to amass their child’s digital identity before the kid knows what a digital identity is. And even if some technological concepts come easy—my kids seemed to know how to use a touch screen before they could speak or read—they sometimes struggle with forms of media that felt hardwired into my 20th-century brain. The first time we watched a movie on live TV, in a hotel room while on vacation, my kids got upset when we couldn’t rewind to the beginning and were utterly baffled (and annoyed) by commercial breaks. (We don’t allow them to watch YouTube, where they would have become well acquainted with such interruptions.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTechnological change is often measured in terms of new features, specs, and business models. But what people do with the technologies they have is not just about what’s technically possible; it’s a product of zigzagging cultural and psychological moods. Although my son doesn’t use a smartphone much (yet), he is constructing an attitude about what technology should do (bring stuff to him) and not do (transmit his personal details) that I am noticing more lately. Indeed, later that same day, as my family tried a new restaurant near our house, I snapped a photo of my wife enjoying dinner. “Don’t post that to Instagram!” she told me, protesting that she wasn’t wearing makeup. But she said it was fine to text it to some neighbors who were curious about the new place.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe most obvious lesson from all this may be simple: I need to put down my phone. But I also—optimistically, I admit—choose to see these moments as signs of a cultural transformation afoot. The age of sharing is ending, and just as I scoff at the disco era of my parents’ generation, I am hopeful that one day my kids will, after unearthing one of my cringey-er social-media posts, ask me, “You really just put \u003cem\u003ethat\u003c/em\u003e out on the internet, Dad?

Many of the things that we tend to think of as permanent additions to our collective cultural habits—publishing a steady stream of short opinions about news, sports, and celebrities and sharing photos and videos of babies, pets, meals, and everyday life with the world—are only a few years old.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBefore 1999, few people aside from the most eager of computer enthusiasts would have thought to maintain a digital identity—and fewer still would have known how to even if they wanted to. So it is by no means a stretch of the imagination that all these things that seem so lodged into our culture will change yet again, and all the ingrained habits of the past few years of exploding social media—the YouTube life-streamers, the Instagram influencers, the raging tweetstormers—will be as outmoded and embarrassing to teens and 20-somethings of the future as Disco Stu, clinging to his chest hair and gold medallions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd while much worthy discussion is being had about the role of the biggest player in social media, Facebook, and whether it’s polluting our media and democracy, I am reasonably sure that my kids will never sign up for a Facebook account. Now, I am not predicting that Facebook or social media will disappear, anymore than the last days of disco meant the end of nightclubs, dancing, cocaine, or casual sex. But even if I don’t know much about the future, I do know this: Kids are never going to think their parents are cool.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/G0YVg_eT9Hg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/G0YVg_eT9Hg/","published":"2019-06-11T11:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-591361"},{"title":"A Community Within a Community","content":"\u003cp\u003eDuring our years of reporting for \u003cem\u003eOur Towns\u003c/em\u003e, I’ve visited YMCAs all across the country. My quest began as a way to keep fit while traveling. I bought day passes to swim in Burlington, Vermont; Columbus, Mississippi; Redlands, California; Allentown, Pennsylvania; Sioux Falls, South Dakota; Duluth, Minnesota; and Wichita, Kansas.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf I couldn’t find a Y, I would swim at a local public pool, like in Holland, Michigan; Greenville, South Carolina; Dodge City, Kansas; Winters, California; and Bend, Oregon. As a last resort, I turned to nature, jumping into the Snake River in Clarkston, Washington; Lake Champlain in Vermont; Lake Erie in Erie, Pennsylvania; Lake Michigan in Holland, Michigan; the freezing Atlantic in Portland, Maine; and the also-freezing Pacific along the West Coast.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRecently I added another venue to my list: the YMCA of Danville, in the so-called Southside of Virginia, bordering North Carolina. Danville, once a thriving tobacco and textile town, has placed a big bet on its Y as more than a fun and healthy place to work out, or swim, or play basketball. It is an anchor institution for restoring the spirit and pride of Danville.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe YMCA is a natural for this role, with its 135-year history in Danville and now a brand-spanking-new, $15 million, 50,000-square-foot facility on the Dan River. Spurred on by an initial gift from the private Danville Regional Foundation, which was followed by millions more from other foundations, institutions, and individuals in town, the new Y opened in 2014. The building is a beautiful, award-winning design of brick, glass, and exposed beams, with natural light and social space. It became the first development facing the river in more than 100 years, and in homage to that history, the Y also shows off reclaimed wood from the old textile mill that once stood on its spot.\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr class=\"c-section-divider\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe hotel where my husband, Jim, and I were staying was just a mile upriver from the Y. The woman at reception told me that the best way to get there was to “walk down Riverside Drive to Biscuitville, cross at the light, and go straight to the Riverwalk Trail. That leads to the Y.” So I did just that. Biscuitville was hopping; cars were lined up at the drive-through to pick up morning biscuits. The bike shares were lined up next to the Riverwalk. I meandered along the path, under the lush, overgrown foliage, past a few bridges, the wildlife markers, the local sculpture, and on to the Y.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSarah Folmar, the CEO of the Y, showed me around. We toured the rooms for yoga, Zumba, Pilates, and aerobics; the gym, which can accommodate basketball or volleyball or the trending pickleball; a walking track; and an expansive fitness center, where exercisers on treadmills may be distracted by views of the rushing Dan River. There’s a massage room, a fancy machine to measure and record blood pressure, and another to measure weight and body fat. Some 2,500 square feet of physical therapy and rehab space is leased by the Danville Regional Medical Center.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the social space at the entry, featuring an 18-by-18-foot glass donor wall that you can’t miss, several older men sat with coffee and newspapers, shooting the breeze. The child-care center, which was funded by the Hughes Memorial Foundation, offers after-school care and summer programs. A separate “child watch” room gives up to two hours of free child care for exercising parents, included in the $65 family fee. Those rooms were buzzing, as school had just ended for the year. The Y also offers after-school child care at four different elementary schools around the county, where Y staff uses the facilities of the school, and children can stay put. Of course, I noticed the six-lane pool, quietly hoping for my chance to swim later in the morning.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo Danville, the Y is more than its stunning physical plant. In a town where you see the occasional remnant of self-advertising as “the last capital of the Confederacy” (somewhat of a stretch, as Jefferson Davis hunkered down in Danville for just the \u003ca href=\"https://www.godanriver.com/news/local/closing-the-door-on-the-last-capital/article_8e44bbb0-de3d-11e4-9d7d-5f619b3e3e6a.html\"\u003esingle final week\u003c/a\u003e before the end of the Civil War), the Y serves a membership today that reflects Danville’s nearly half-white and half-African-American population. The 100 or so people I saw on my morning at the Y were mixed in about the same proportion.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe’re a “community within a community,” Sarah Folmar said. “When so much going on in the world is negative, even in the city of Danville, inside these four walls, everything changes. It is a positive place.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr class=\"c-section-divider\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe made our tour slowly, as Folmar greeted what seemed to me about half the members by name, inquiring about family and how they’re feeling. And they greeted back. A 93-year-old man was resting on the exercise equipment; two young women, who call themselves the River City Belles, were recording a live Facebook feed about healthy eating.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI also met, by name, every one of the staff who was present that morning. Several were discussing ideas from the professional training sessions they had recently attended. Staff interviews are thorough, and retention rate is high. A telling question in the interview process is a self-rating on a scale of 1 to 10 of smile-ability. “Anything less than a 10,” reports Folmar, “and it’s not the place for them.” She added, as an afterthought, “A hundred is even better!”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEach of the 2,700 Ys in the U.S. has its own personal stamp. They all belong to the 175-year-old national organization, which offers various resources like help with strategic planning, big-picture marketing, and training in exchange for membership dues. The Y in Danville also belongs to the Virginia Alliance of YMCAs, which advises on state-relevant initiatives, like diabetes prevention and water safety. Beyond that, each local Y is independent and autonomous, with its own fiscal and governing responsibilities, but free to be the “heartbeat of the community,” as Folmar describes the Y in Danville.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe stamp of the YMCA (for Young Men’s Christian Association, of course) in Danville showed a stronger Christian element than I saw in most other Ys that I visited. It makes sense; Danville is a churchgoing town. The question that Danvillians are likely to ask of newcomers, several residents told me, is not “Where are you from?” or “What do you do?” but “Do you have a church yet?” Folmar reported that one of the most popular merchandise items at the Y is a T-shirt with a Bible verse printed on it. And a fishbowl in the workout space, which would likely be filled with mints or candies at other Ys, was filled here with strips of paper containing Bible verses. I had seen one other so filled, in northeastern Mississippi.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI found in Danville, as I had in most other towns, that the Ys and public sports complexes were my second-favorite spots—runner-up to the public libraries—to reveal the culture and mood of a town and to rub shoulders (literally) with folks I otherwise would be unlikely to meet. The Ys also shared the democratic nature of public libraries, where \u003cspan class=\"smallcaps\"\u003eOPEN TO ALL\u003c/span\u003e, as is carved in granite above the Columbus, Ohio, main library door, refers to every single person, including the homeless, at no cost. The last two words of the Danville YMCA mission statement, “for all,” echo “open to all.” Folmar points out in full disclosure, “We are a membership organization.” But she explained that the Y offers reduced-fee memberships; last year, the Y gave away more than $135,000 in scholarships, and its goal is for no one to be turned away because of financial hardship.\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr class=\"c-section-divider\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eBy one measure, the new Y is a roaring success. Before it opened, Y membership in Danville was 2,300. Today, just five years later, it is 9,000. By another measure, there is still serious work to do. The latest Regional Report Card, including 2016 health data from Danville, commissioned by the Danville Regional Foundation, shows a lot of work still left to do. Compared with Virginia as a whole, the adult obesity rate, adult smoking, diabetes, and physical inactivity in Danville are all higher.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAbout an hour and a half later, our tour concluded, and Folmar asked if I would like to swim. Yes. The water-aerobics class had ended, and I shared the six-lane pool with just a few other swimmers. Folmar’s final gesture: As I traveled light and had forgotten a towel, she lent me her own.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/Qc5fHsSrcEA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/Qc5fHsSrcEA/","published":"2019-06-11T10:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:374-591397"},{"title":"What Nancy Pelosi Wants to Do Before Impeachment","content":"\u003cp\u003eIn the conference room Nancy Pelosi once used as Democratic minority leader, she displayed only one item on the walls.

Bush’s reelection in 2004, when Republicans expanded their majority by three seats. Bush was pushing for a politically risky overhaul of Social Security. Members of her caucus and outside advocacy groups pressured Pelosi to propose alternative policies. But Pelosi knew that once Democrats offered a solution, they would give Republicans something to attack rather than defend. For nearly two years, Republicans watched their favorability ratings fall, dragged down by a spate of scandals and the unpopular war in Iraq. Only a few months before the midterm election, Pelosi and the House Democratic Caucus rolled out “6 for ’06,” the legislative priorities they would pass if in the majority. Naturally, Republicans took an offensive posture, but by then it was too late. Public sentiment had ripened for a Democratic legislative agenda, the party gained 32 seats in the House, and Pelosi became speaker. Then she mobilized her majority to pass those very priorities. Two years later, in 2008, the electorate rewarded Democrats with an even larger majority. Timing was everything.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn a more mundane level, I caught Pelosi’s ire when I forgot the Lincoln mantra. It was May 2003, only two years into my 16-year tenure representing a fairly competitive district on Long Island, New York. When Republicans offered a new package of tax cuts skewed to the wealthiest, I indicated to the Democratic whip’s office that I was undecided. A few days before the vote, Pelosi hunted me down on the House floor and asked why I couldn’t oppose the measure. When I told her that many of my constituents favored it, she looked me squarely in the eye and said, “Well, educate them.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePelosi’s sensitivity to public sentiment requires her to keep tabs on three fronts.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe first is the Democratic caucus. She constantly monitors and measures the mood of her colleagues. She rotates through her office the House Democratic leadership, a wider leadership group called the Steering and Policy Committee, the chairs of various legislative committees, and the leaders and members of dozens of disparate caucuses (the Congressional Black Caucus and the conservative Blue Dogs, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, the Congressional Progressive Caucus and the moderate New Democratic Caucus). Then she goes to ground, conferring with members one-on-one. Not everyone knows what everyone else is thinking. She and Majority Leader Steny Hoyer do. It’s how they shape consensus.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePelosi tells her caucus, “Our diversity is our strength; our unity is our power.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/06/democrats-fall-line-behind-pelosi-impeachment/591088/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: Why pro-impeachment Democrats are still siding with Pelosi\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe second is the congressional electorate, which determines which party controls the House. Sure, Pelosi has institutional responsibilities. Yes, she must reflect the progressive values and priorities of the Democratic Party. But she also has a responsibility to keep Democrats in the majority, so that they can fight effectively for those values and priorities. She’s got to win elections.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAn impeachment inquiry that results in Trump’s acquittal in the Senate may jeopardize the 31 Democrats in districts where Trump beat Hillary Clinton in 2016. If Democrats lose 18 seats in 2020, they return to the minority just in time for Republicans to try to use gerrymandering to keep them there for a decade. Many Democratic members from those districts tell me that public sentiment, particularly among vitally needed swing voters, is currently against impeachment. Even Republicans recall how the failed impeachment of President Bill Clinton backfired: In 1998, Democrats gained seats in Congress, a rare occurrence for a president’s party in a midterm election.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe third is the presidency. When Barack Obama was president, Pelosi made sure that decisions by House Democrats were calibrated to avoid friction with the White House. Today, Pelosi makes sure that decisions by House Democrats won’t fortify Trump in battleground states including Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Florida, Michigan, and others. “Trump is goading us to impeach him,” Pelosi recently told an audience in New York. “That’s what he’s doing. Every single day, he’s just, like, taunting, taunting, taunting. Because he knows it would be very divisive in the country, but he doesn’t really care. He just wants to solidify his base.” If Pelosi and Trump agree on anything, it may be this formula: At this moment in time, impeaching Trump minus convicting Trump equals reelecting Trump.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/05/impeach-trump-not-yet/590578/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eDavid Frum: The wisest remedy is not impeachment\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut “this moment in time” does not mean “all moments in time.” Pelosi, remember, believes it’s possible to shape public sentiment. That’s why she’s unleashed her committee chairs to fully exercise their oversight responsibilities by investigating every facet of potentially impeachable offenses: Jerry Nadler of the Judiciary Committee, Adam Schiff on Intel, Maxine Waters on Financial Services, Elijah Cummings on Oversight and Reform. They may find a smoking gun—incontrovertible evidence that crystallizes public support for impeachment and maximizes pressure on House Republican incumbents in moderate districts. Then Pelosi will have achieved her goal: a broader public consensus for impeachment and stronger, if not necessarily overwhelming, bipartisan support.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eProgressives worry that if Democrats avoid impeachment with this president, they will set a bad precedent. Just how bad must things get? Fair enough. But for Democrats there’s a worse outcome: a premature impeachment that acquits and helps result in the reelection of Trump with a loyal Republican majority in Congress, an expanded Republican majority in state legislatures, and a permanently hyper-conservative judiciary.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat would fracture and set back the country more than at any time since Lincoln.

In a slightly different mold, there’s John Tavner of Amazon’s \u003cem\u003ePatriot\u003c/em\u003e, a traumatized hitman who bungles jobs and would rather play music, and the titular character of HBO’s \u003cem\u003eBarry\u003c/em\u003e, a reluctant gun for hire who just wants to act; these killers take lives grudgingly, as if murder were a monotonous day job. Viewers, in turn, get a relatable, largely genial protagonist to root for.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe writer Kim Young-ha recognizes, and challenges, this cultural sympathy for the serial killer with his recent collection of short stories, \u003cem\u003eDiary of a Murderer\u003c/em\u003e. The four-parter, translated from Korean by Krys Lee, opens with a novella of the same name that follows an aging former serial killer, Kim Byeongsu, as he battles Alzheimer’s. Though Byeongsu murdered prodigiously in his prime, his weakened state now leaves him reliant on his adopted daughter, Eunhui. When a spate of murders hits their town, he becomes convinced that her boyfriend, Pak Jutae, is behind them and decides to kill him before any harm comes to Eunhui. The premise of a skilled, aging murderer unable to trust his own memories is a quirky spin on the moral quagmires that criminal antiheroes usually face.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eByeongsu is less apologetic about his crimes than his TV counterparts. While Dexter refers to his murderous side as his “dark passenger” and Barry would call himself an actor foremost, Byeongsu continually and proudly refers to himself as a serial killer. This pride, combined with his newfound vulnerability, makes him strangely magnetic; his attempts to sort through his memory in the midst of immediate danger are fascinating, much like watching a car accident unfold in real time. His desperate attempts to document his days elucidate the anger, fear, and frustration of dementia, often creating asides between the reader and author that the protagonist isn’t privy to. These moments can, at times, read humorously, undercutting the tenuous control he prides himself on exercising over his life.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eStill, Byeongsu maintains a chilling detachment that’s often played for irony. His mission to protect his daughter, though a classic hero’s tale, is written off as mere obligation. Having made a promise not to harm Eunhui (moments before he murders her mother), he sticks to it: “I hated people who made empty promises, so I tried hard not to become that kind of person.” He’s dispassionate even when discussing his compassion toward animals. “Over the years, I’ve saved many lives,” he argues, “even if those lives belong to animals that don’t speak.” Kim complicates the reader’s understanding of what makes this killer “good”: Though largely harmless in his post-serial-killing days, he remains unapologetic about his psychopathy. His onscreen counterpart in the film adaptation of this story, \u003cem\u003eMemoir of a Murderer\u003c/em\u003e, trades in this complexity for more standard antihero pabulum (his only desire is to keep Eunhui safe). Kim’s original, though, makes it harder to empathize with him.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eUnlike Dexter, who is disturbed by his urge to kill, or Barry, who is uncomfortable with his talent for killing, Byeongsu’s frustration has more to do with the mental and physical limitations that keep him from being the effective murderer he knows he can be. His attitude toward killing is closer to Hannibal’s celebratory approach (though when we meet Byeongsu, he has few Hannibal-esque faculties remaining). A killer since age 16, he continued to murder out of the “hope for a more perfect pleasure.” He explains, “Each time I buried a victim, I repeated to myself: I can do better next time.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThis fixation isn’t limited to serial killers, and is most explicitly explored in the collection’s fourth and final story, “The Writer.” In it, the wealthy owner of a publishing house considers killing his ex-wife. He echoes Byeongsu when he says, “Planning a murder is a little like contemplating immigration. Once you start thinking about it, you can’t stop.” Obsession—that relatable character flaw—rather than a twisted morality, becomes the reader’s uneasy point of identification with Kim’s protagonists. A similarly myopic self-interest surfaces even within Kim’s most altruistic-seeming characters. In “Missing Child,” a father stubbornly searches for years for his missing son and is disappointed to realize that bringing him home is not enough to restore the happy family he imagined they were in the past.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWhat makes Byeongsu stand out from Kim’s other characters, however, is the charming curiosity with which he approaches life and his crippling condition. He reads poetry and cites philosophy texts, constantly challenging himself. After meeting Pak for the first time and being overcome with the recognition of a fellow serial killer, he references Jorge Luis Borges’s short story “The Other.” Later, in the middle of his murderous plotting, he muses, “It suddenly occurred to me: I might be jealous of Pak.” Killing is to Byeongsu a way to discover an authentic self. His fixation on the suspected younger killer doubles, per his Borges reference, as a fixation on a past version of himself.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eKim’s use of pastiche—diary entries, jotted-down notes, snippets from a recorder Byeongsu wears around his neck—to re-create Byeongsu’s interactions with his dementia draws readers deeply into the protagonist’s voice. This peripatetic self-awareness, patchworked together through his disease, makes him a compelling narrator. Hints of megalomania, such as his penchant for likening himself to tragic Greek heroes (“If Oedipus looks into the mirror, he’ll see me standing there”), allow for some paradox in this reading. But Kim manages to blindside even wary readers with a twist that recognizes the worst of Byeongsu’s fears about losing control.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e“To an elderly serial killer, Alzheimer’s is life’s practical joke. No, it a hidden-camera prank show. Surprised you, right? Sorry. It’s only a joke,” Byeongsu notes bitterly, though not without wit. As he drifts in and out of his memories, readers’ various interpretations of the truth will act as a Rorschach test—assessing the limits of their faith in him. But Kim asks, compellingly, why readers might be so eager to believe him in the first place.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/kx6Thk58xBY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/kx6Thk58xBY/","published":"2019-06-11T10:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-589324"},{"title":"Why I Didn’t Tolerate Hairsplitting in War","content":"\u003cp class=\"dropcap\"\u003eJoshua Wheeler became famous as the first American soldier to die in the fight against the Islamic State—ISIS.

At that point, U.S. forces were no longer doing all the fighting in that troubled part of the world. Instead, they were engaged in training and support of local forces battling against the militants of ISIS. One day, the Kurdish commandos Wheeler was working with received a tip: A nearby compound controlled by ISIS contained some 70 local hostages, held prisoner for cooperating with Iraqi government officials. Now it appeared that the execution of those hostages was imminent—in fact, aerial photos showed a newly dug mass grave near the compound, waiting for their bodies.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn October 22, the Kurdish commandos swung into action, supported by their U.S. special-operations partners. They launched a helicopter raid on the compound, determined to rescue the hostages. Wheeler and a team of 10 to 20 U.S. fighters went along to provide intelligence and communications support. But the raid went wrong. An effort by the commandos to blast a hole in the compound’s outer wall failed. Gunfire immediately broke out. It was obvious that the commandos were in trouble.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWheeler and his men did what American fighters do—they ran toward the sound of the guns. When the battle ended, the hostages had been freed. A few of the Iraqi commandos were injured. Only one rescuer died in the operation—Joshua Wheeler.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDays later, my wife, Stephanie, and I met with Wheeler’s wife, Ashley, at Dover Air Force Base. We welcomed her husband’s remains after they came down the cargo ramp of a C-17, and the three of us spoke together briefly. Ashley was an extraordinary person, filled with love and admiration for her husband. It was a marriage that had made her life whole, she said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs usual, Stephanie and I then prepared to depart the base, giving Ashley some time and space to handle the difficult moment in her own way. But before we could leave, an officer sought me out. “Mrs. Wheeler would like another moment with you, sir,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI returned, and found Ashley as composed and dignified as ever. There was no bitterness in her voice. But she did have one question to ask the secretary of defense who had signed her husband’s orders—the same question many in the press were also asking: “Did he die in combat?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI was saddened—and angered—that she even had to ask that question. But I understood all too well why she was asking.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/10/first-combat-death-iraq-combat/412261/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: When combat isn’t combat\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe strategy we were pursuing in Iraq and Syria to destroy ISIS was to enable and support local forces rather than substitute for them. The strategy was the right one. But the administration’s plan to enable local forces had led to a game of “gotcha” with some reporters. Several tried to trip up administration spokespeople into making misstatements about exactly what our forces were doing in the Middle East.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI was put off by the very idea of playing such verbal games. “Of course Josh died in combat,” I told Ashley Wheeler. And when I spoke to the press about the incident on October 28, I repeated those words: “Of course he died in combat.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWar has to be spoken about bluntly, especially when leaders are talking with the troops or their families. Accordingly, I used honest language—words like \u003cem\u003ewar\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003ecombat\u003c/em\u003e—whenever it was appropriate, and ignored the “suggested edits” from the White House staff substituting other, less forthright words.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI followed the same principle when addressing the troops. Thus, shortly after we completed the coalition military-campaign plan of 2015 against ISIS (the same plan that two U.S presidents stuck with), I traveled to Fort Campbell, Kentucky. That’s where the 101st Airborne was preparing to deploy to Baghdad—the first unit to begin putting the new plan into action. I wanted to give them a clear notion of what their mission was. To accomplish that, I made sure to do two things.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirst, I told the troops how proud I was of them, how proud their country was of them, and how proud they should be of themselves. I said they were doing “the noblest thing you can do with your life—protecting America and making a better world for our children.” I told them they were part of “the finest fighting force the world has ever known,” a phrase I used in practically every speech I made, mainly because I believed it to my bones.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSecond, I told the troops precisely what we were asking them to do—what the strategy was and why it was the right one. I told them how it would fit into history. I explained how we needed to destroy the fact of an Islamic State based on its evil ideology in order to destroy the idea itself. And I would explain that they were working hand in hand with local forces rather than on their own—which would be frustrating at times—because we wanted our victory to be planted firmly in local conditions and culture, and therefore lasting.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStrategy and history are big ideas to these young people, many not yet out of their teens. But if my words were clear and direct, they could remember the words, they could repeat them to their mom or dad, and hopefully they could recall them proudly for years to come. In a democracy, every man and woman who dons a uniform in the service of the country should share that personal understanding of and commitment to the cause for which they fight. That’s a basic reason it is an important part of the SecDef’s job in command to talk plainly and comprehensively about war, especially to those waging it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/11/the-pentagon-wants-to-weaponize-the-brain-what-could-go-wrong/570841/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: The Pentagon’s push to program soldiers’ brains\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"dropcap\"\u003eSometimes talking honestly about war means recognizing the consequences of the decisions we must make at the Pentagon, as I had to do when meeting the families of the fallen at Dover Air Force.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt was usually only 24 or 48 hours since the family members were notified.

I had read carefully about each service member in advance, and I briefly stated the importance of the mission they had been conducting and the reason for it. I wanted them to hear these things in my own words. I told them it wouldn’t mean much to them to hear these words on this day, but perhaps sometime in the years to come it would.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEvery family took it their own way.

No less profound is the sense of grief one experiences on a visit to a cemetery where the fallen have been laid to rest.

It seemed a fitting way to end my work as the steward of America’s fighting forces.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think a lot about those twin journeys, and about the men and women—known to me and unknown—whose remains are honored at Arlington. In a very real sense, their story sums up for me the central mission of any secretary of defense.

Though on the surface the debate in France appears to mirror that under way in the United States, there are key differences. For one, the split in France goes beyond a left-right clash and pits a new set of activists against establishment antiracism groups, who are staunch defenders of universalism. France also espouses a more restrictive vision of free speech than the U.S., with narrow laws on hate speech, defamation, and, as of recently, apology for terrorism. Critics say this framework is applied selectively: After the 2015 attack at the satirical newspaper \u003cem\u003eCharlie Hebdo\u003c/em\u003e, for example, much of the nation rallied around free expression. Those—often French Muslims—who refused to express full solidarity with the publication, which had caricatured the Prophet Muhammad, were \u003ca href=\"http://www.slate.fr/story/112429/qui-etaient-je-ne-suis-pas-charlie\"\u003edeemed unpatriotic\u003c/a\u003e, and some faced legal consequences, notably for “apology for terrorism.” “Everyone says, ‘\u003cem\u003eVive la liberté d’expression\u003c/em\u003e,’” Tin told me. “But there’s less and less freedom of expression for those deemed ‘enemies’ to French values.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is the context in which the blackface row at the Sorbonne began and subsequently escalated. Students at the university said they had tried to contact Philippe Brunet, the director of \u003cem\u003eThe Suppliants\u003c/em\u003e—a fifth-century play that tells the mythical story of the Danaids, the 50 daughters of the king of Libya, who flee forced marriages to their Egyptian cousins—to express their discomfort. But according to Tin, Brunet refused to engage in dialogue, and so they went to CRAN. Students also reached out to UNEF, the influential national student union, which called on the university to take action.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBrunet did not address Tin’s characterization of his communication with the students, but told me he hadn’t meant to offend. Besides, he said, this year the actors would wear masks instead of dark makeup. He also argued that the 2018 performance was not racist, and that accusations of blackface simply don’t apply to antique theater, but were instead used to discredit him—“undoubtedly for political reasons,” he told me by email. The art of “imitation,” he added, had been practiced since ancient times.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStill, on the night the play was originally scheduled to run in March, some 50 students, along with members of the Black African Defense League and the Anti-Negrophobia Brigade—two small antiracism groups unaffiliated with CRAN or UNEF—rallied outside the university.

But Mario Stasi, the president of LICRA, contends they supported the blockade by default. “The CRAN acted like the morality police and denounced the play,” he told me. “What followed is their responsibility.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI asked Stasi whether there was room to consider the students’ and activists’ perception that the play was offensive—even if the offense had been unintentional. “It’s not a question of their feelings,” he said. “It’s a \u003cem\u003ecommunautariste\u003c/em\u003e political project. How can we debate, when the CRAN tries to impose its own vision—one of a fractured France? We want to maintain universalism.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhy did the Sorbonne episode, one of many recent spats over race, hit such a nerve? According to Éric Fassin, a sociologist at Paris University 8, it combines the “double symbolism” of the Sorbonne—one of France’s most prestigious universities, which was central to the country’s May 1968 protests—and a protest against a classical text. “Preventing it [\u003cem\u003eThe Suppliants\u003c/em\u003e] from taking place is seen as an attack on the heart of the culture,” he told me.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe decision to stage the blockade—defended by a minority, but generalized to describe the actions of all parties involved—deepened polarization, he added. “Now conservatives are all too happy to talk about freedom of expression,” Fassin said. “They can say, ‘Look how intolerant these antiracists are, how they wage their war against the “politically incorrect.”’” From there, the debate lost its complexity, he argued, as LICRA and others glossed over the different organizations’ varied positions and the questions they raised: “What is the history of racial costumes in France? How do certain aesthetic choices fit into racism? Can we talk about racism in the arts, without involving the people it affects? Who determines the meaning of art—the artist or the audience?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/01/je-suis-charlie-france-patriotism/384990/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: What \u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/01/je-suis-charlie-france-patriotism/384990/?utm_source=feed\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eJe Suis Charlie \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/01/je-suis-charlie-france-patriotism/384990/?utm_source=feed\"\u003ehas become\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUNEF and CRAN, for instance, diverged on Brunet’s use of masks instead of makeup—a disparity worth unpacking. Whereas Mélanie Luce, UNEF’s president, described the masks to me as “extremely caricatured” and replete with “racist stereotypes,” CRAN didn’t take issue with them—Tin, who had written his doctoral dissertation on Greek tragedies, said they were “a theatrical tradition.” But he was struck by what he saw as a refusal to acknowledge that blackface had been used in the first place. “Dark makeup has a long history in France, not just in the U.S., that was used to justify slavery and colonialism,” he said, dismissing arguments that freedom of expression gave artists the right to use blackface in their performances. “Should it be their free expression to insult black people?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother issue that got lost in the controversy’s noise was minority representation in the arts: If more minorities were involved in the production of \u003cem\u003eThe Suppliants\u003c/em\u003e, for example, perhaps the performance and casting would have been approached differently.

The evidence on involuntary chemical castration is much less clear. In the same way that removing the hands of a bread thief could theoretically help prevent future crimes, rendering a person’s genitals less virile makes certain acts less feasible. But unlike other therapeutic approaches, chemical castration (or surgical castration, for that matter) does not address the antisocial instincts that often underlie such crimes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSome ethicists \u003ca href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3824348/\"\u003eargue\u003c/a\u003e that child offenders are diseased, and it is only humane to treat them—even sometimes without consent.

Some legal scholars believe mandatory chemical castration violates the Eighth Amendment, which is against cruel and unusual punishment.

The medical establishment and state have long erred on the side of narrowly defining normalcy and punishing “deviancy,” as they have with homosexuality, which was only removed from psychiatry’s \u003cem\u003eDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder\u003c/em\u003es in 1973.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis change came in the wake of researchers beginning to document the wide variations in human sexuality in mainstream journals. The range of what was “normal” began to separate from morality and expand to show that the idea of what constitutes sexuality is vast and complex. Today, the psychiatric establishment still uses a diagnosis of \u003ca href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4712755/\"\u003ehypersexual disorder\u003c/a\u003e, but the concept has shifted from a more rigid imposition of norms to an idea about how a person relates to sex. There is no cutoff for what is too much sexuality. Some people have sex multiple times a day, others almost never do. The current hypersexual disorder is defined only insofar as it causes distress: When you lose your job because you need to keep having sex, or when your relationship falls apart because you lose all interest in sex, a person may have reason to seek care.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf there is a role for the medical community in preventing assault, it is to help equip willing patients to relate to people in healthy ways—to treat whatever psychological element precludes healthful, pro-social behavior. If such people find themselves in court, they could be offered the same option. This has been the suggestion of some physicians in South Korea, for example, who \u003ca href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3565125/\"\u003eargue\u003c/a\u003e that chemical castration can be an effective tool for offenders who want and consent to the treatment “within the context of simultaneous comprehensive psychotherapeutic treatment.” Denmark has implemented options for “\u003ca href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11673-014-9534-3\"\u003esexological treatment\u003c/a\u003e” of some sex offenders that included therapy and androgen-blocking medications.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn every case, though, the suggestion is that this would be consensual, voluntary care.

I just received a beautiful letter from Kim Jong Un.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe first surprising thing here is that Trump gave no sign of having been aware of the story prior to the \u003cem\u003eJournal \u003c/em\u003ereport. He did not, however, dispute its accuracy. Given how personally involved the president has been in negotiations with North Korea, if the report is indeed accurate, it is hard to imagine he would have been in the dark. Perhaps Trump is simply playing dumb, though he doesn’t typically have much of a poker face.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAmerican officials often avoid discussing sensitive stories like this with the press, and one reason for that caution became clear as Trump continued. The context of his remarks makes clear that what Trump “wouldn’t let … happen” is not Kim Jong Nam’s killing, but his cultivation as an American asset. Trump \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/16/us/politics/trump-obama-north-korea.html\"\u003ehas said\u003c/a\u003e that former President Barack Obama described North Korea as the nation’s greatest foreign-policy challenge, and Trump has taken that cue, making it a major priority. By saying he wouldn’t allow American intelligence to cultivate an asset so close to Kim, he’s saying he wouldn’t use spying to better understand the country’s biggest overseas challenge.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePut another way, he’s ruling out having the best information possible headed into high-stakes negotiations. Tying one hand behind your back like this makes sense only if you have a messianic belief in your own negotiating prowess—which Trump does, despite the collapse of the most recent round of talks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt might be a moot point, however, because by responding this way, Trump is sending a clear message to any would-be informants: \u003cem\u003eThe United States doesn’t have your back\u003c/em\u003e. Why would any other North Korean take the risk of ending up like Kim Jong Nam? If Fifield and the \u003cem\u003eJournal \u003c/em\u003eare right, Kim Jong Nam’s assassination wasn’t just Kim killing his brother and rival; it wasn’t even just North Korea using chemical weapons in a foreign country. It was North Korea killing an American intelligence asset in the early days of the Trump administration, a test of the new president’s resolve.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTrump’s nonchalance is especially strange given that the United States expelled 60 Russian diplomats in 2018 in retaliation for Russia’s poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Britain. Yet when an alleged American informant is killed, his response is not to warn North Korea not to act that way again, but to rush to assure North Korea that he won’t let such spying happen again.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe guiding principle of Trump’s interactions with Kim has been to try to flatter Kim’s ego and play the good cop, while allowing other members of his administration to take the hard line. Arguably, that paid off in getting Kim to negotiate, even though no deal has been struck. But it also risks letting Kim get away with heinous acts, because the risk of offending him is that negotiations will break off. Moreover, this incident shows it works both ways: Kim grasps the importance of flattering Trump, as with the “beautiful” letter he sent the president. A beautiful letter here, a beautiful letter there, and pretty soon the president of the United States is apologizing to you after a report that you killed an American informant.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/jVvJoJym-eQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/jVvJoJym-eQ/","published":"2019-06-11T19:21:58Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-591457"},{"title":"A Russian Journalist’s Arrest Counters the Image of Putin the Puppet Master","content":"\u003cp\u003eMOSCOW—In the days following the arrest of Ivan Golunov, an investigative journalist detained on drug charges, dozens of reporters and public figures began lining up—quite literally—to take part in a peculiarly Russian form of protest: the “single picket.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDemonstrations here require an official permit, and with authorities often loath to sanction critical rallies, protesters, in an effort to evade the requirement, will stand alone, holding up a banner or placard while a line of people will form nearby, ready to step in and offer relief.

If you can’t, then it’s not.” My colleague Ian Bogost, who co-created an MIT book series called Platform Studies, agreed, as did most people in the technical community.

In the years before 2016, nearly all of Mark Zuckerberg’s public references to Facebook as a platform were technical, about connecting with developers. But every once in a while, he slipped in a more colloquial usage of the term. As far back as a 2008 interview with Sarah Lacy at SXSW, Zuckerberg said, “We think that we might have a chance here to build a platform that fundamentally changes the way that people can connect and communicate.” Later, after the company went public, Facebook executives primarily referred to their advertising platform. “We’re building,” Facebook’s COO Sheryl Sandberg held, “the world’s first ad platform that delivers personalized marketing at scale.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/05/why-pelosi-video-isnt-fake-facebook/590335/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: Facebook’s dystopian definition of “fake”\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIf the concept of a platform sounds confused, that’s actually the power of the metaphor.

Facebook had to get advertisers ready for the idea that their ads would run next to Confederate-flag memes and Farmville posts and divorce announcements. This was not an easy task, but these companies turned the risky nature of openness into a strength. It was downright virtuous to support this wild world of content. “Unlike Hollywood and the television networks, who could be painted as the big bad industries,” Gillespie noted, “online content seems an open world, where anyone can post, anything can be said.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThis was not true, of course.

For Team Joe, the real race is against Trump and not against his fellow Democrats. It\u0026#8217;s part of the reason he\u0026#8217;s not rushing to these come-one-come-all events, such as a forum focused on African-American issues at the end of the week in Charleston, S.C.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other Democratic candidates are pinning their hopes on the fact that, historically, the early frontrunner rarely maintains the lead all the way to the start of the primary season.

That puts Sanders in a virtual tie with Warren and Buttigieg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBiden is certainly thought to have the potential to catch up in Iowa in measures outside of polling, where the stakes are high for someone who is such a recognizable Democratic figure. Biden is betting big on his electability argument, that he alone is best positioned to make Donald Trump a one-term President. Biden\u0026#8217;s first stop Tuesday? One of the 32 counties in Iowa\u0026#8217;s 99 counties that Trump flipped from red to blue in 2016.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;I would say that Biden has to win Iowa. I mean, being the former vice president of the United States, I think if he doesn\u0026rsquo;t win Iowa, I think that could be the death knell of his campaign,\u0026rdquo; Woodard said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside Biden\u0026#8217;s inner-circle, that is their nightmare scenario, evoking memories of his 1988 bid that ended before Iowa and 2008, when he dropped out late the night of the caucuses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn Tuesday, Biden rolled out a round of endorsements, including an operative who proved pivotal to Barack Obama\u0026#8217;s Iowa victory in 2008. Still, he was playing catch up to several of the candidates who are on his heels in various ways. Harris, for example, announced her first local elected official endorsement more than two weeks ago, and Booker rolled out an Iowa steering committee at the start of this month. Still, Biden is running at his own pace. And although he has yet to open his headquarters in Philadelphia, he\u0026#8217;s making inroads in the early states. For instance, Biden recruited Jake Braun to run his Iowa operations. Braun has worked in Iowa politics since 2002 and has three presidential caucuses under his belt. And Biden lured away Julia Krieger, who had been Rep. Tim Ryan\u0026#8217;s national communications director, to serve as his Iowa communications strategist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, some candidates are very much banking their investment in Iowa ends up paying off. Delaney, for example, has been running for president since 2017 and fighting an uphill battle against low name recognition. He has visited all 99 counties, started airing ads during the Super Bowl way back in February of 2018, has made 29 trips to Iowa, and has eight offices in the state. He notes he has \u0026#8220;similar efforts\u0026#8221; in New Hampshire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsked whether he was counting on Iowa, Delaney, in a recent interview with TIME in his Des Moines headquarters, said, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m banking on early states, yes, absolutely.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeantime, fellow longshot candidate Marianne Williamson, a self-help author calling for a \u0026#8220;spiritual awakening\u0026#8221; in the country, has moved to a Des Moines condo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of this action can be wearying for even the most committed voter. The Des Moines \u003cem\u003eRegister\u003c/em\u003e reported that the likeliest of caucus-goers \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/IAStartingLine/status/1138240365411127296\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003esay there are simply too many candidates\u003c/a\u003e on the Democratic side, and voters at several recent events had said they aren\u0026#8217;t ready to commit to any of them just yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;The people that I\u0026rsquo;m talking to, they\u0026rsquo;re still very much in the gathering knowledge stage,\u0026rdquo; Madalyn Anderson, chair of the Story County Democrats, said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor that reason, the field isn\u0026#8217;t likely to shrink much anytime soon.

The Task Force is an independent panel of experts that reviews available data and makes recommendations on various health issues. Many medical organizations rely on this advice for treating patients. Based on the studies it analyzed, the USPSTF now recommends that people who are not yet infected with HIV but are at high risk of becoming infected start taking\u003ca href=\"https://time.com/4114402/aids-hiv-drug-prep/\" \u003e PrEP, or Pre Exposure Prophylaxis\u003c/a\u003e, a daily medication most commonly made up of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate paired with emtricitabine (sold under the brand name Truvada), or composed of tenofovir alone.

Currently, he says, there are up to 1.2 million people in the U.S. who are potentially at higher risk of getting an HIV infection than the general population, but fewer than 30% of them are taking advantage of PrEP.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite numerous studies supporting PrEP\u0026rsquo;s effectiveness, many physicians who aren\u0026rsquo;t HIV experts are still reluctant to prescribe the drug since they would be giving it to otherwise healthy people, and exposing them to potential side effects, which include kidney and digestive system problems, as well as bone loss, although these are relatively rare. Not all insurers cover the entire cost of PrEP either, leaving patients with high co-pays, but with the USPSTF\u0026rsquo;s new guidance, more payers should be convinced that the drug is worth reimbursing. \u0026ldquo;I consider this a significant advance toward our quest to get as many people on prevention as we possibly can,\u0026rdquo; says Fauci. \u0026ldquo;We are not going to bring the incidence of new infections down significantly unless PrEP is maximally utilized.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe task force evaluated 12 rigorous studies, and found that PrEP lowered the risk of getting HIV by 54% in follow-up periods of anywhere from four months to four years, compared to those receiving either a placebo or nothing at all. The studies showed that even when people in the studies used PrEP more intermittently\u0026mdash;for example only during periods when they would be engaging in higher risk behaviors\u0026mdash;their risk of acquiring HIV was still lower than among those not using PrEP. And the more faithfully people took the daily pills, the higher the likelihood that they would be protected from HIV. Based on these results, the task force determined that the benefits of protection from HIV outweighed the potential risks of the medication.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuch strong evidence doesn\u0026rsquo;t always lead to changes in practice, notes Dr. Diane Havlir, professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, who was not part of the task force. With PrEP, she says, the evidence needs to be part of a broader, community-based effort to reach people who might benefit and help them to trust in the benefits that PrEP can provide. \u0026ldquo;So much in health happens outside the doors of the clinic,\u0026rdquo; she says. \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s why community outreach ambassadors, people who talk about using interventions such as PrEP, are one of the most important parts of making something like PrEP uptake happen.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn San Francisco, Havlir, along with Dr. Susan Buchbinder, director of Bridge HIV at the San Francisco Department of Public Health, has pioneered a program called \u0026ldquo;\u003ca href=\"https://time.com/3596979/the-end-of-aids/\" \u003eGetting to Zero San Francisco\u003c/a\u003e,\u0026rdquo; aimed at making the city the first in the U.S. to have zero new infections over a year. To do so, they have worked with city officials to initiate universal HIV testing for anyone treated in the emergency room of San Francisco General Hospital. \u0026ldquo;Testing is the gateway to prevention, and testing is the gateway to treatment,\u0026rdquo; says Havlir. (In its latest guidelines, the USPSTF also confirmed its previous advice that all people between the ages of 15 years and 65 years be tested for HIV.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHavlir and Buchbinder have also launched an innovative treatment program that immediately connects people who are diagnosed with HIV to the hospital\u0026rsquo;s treatment clinic and set up with their first dose of anti-HIV pills.

It is also the solution to an unanticipated problem that sprung up when he first sought to disrupt African education. In 2008, Swaniker launched his African Leadership Academy in Johannesburg, recruiting high school students from across the continent and promising to prepare them for the best universities the world had to offer. But once they got into those Ivy League and European universities, they rarely came back. \u0026ldquo;I realized we were actually contributing to the brain drain,\u0026rdquo; says Swaniker. \u0026ldquo;So I said it\u0026rsquo;s time that Africa had its own Stanford and MIT and Harvard.

Each classroom is dedicated to a influential African leader or artist \u0026mdash; the Sankore wing, referencing one of the oldest universities in the world, in Timbuktu, Mali, features classrooms named after Ethiopian runner Haile Gebrselassie, U.N. general-secretary Boutros Boutros-Ghali and South African writer Bessie Head; the faculty lounge celebrates South African anti-apartheid activist Steve Biko. The four dormitories are dedicated to the great African civilizations, such as Axum, Kongo, and Songhai. Even the cafeteria aspires to pan-African cuisine, though Nnadi, the Nigerian computer-science student, says the attempt to create his nation\u0026rsquo;s national dish, jollof rice, \u0026ldquo;needs a lot of help.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eComplaints about cafeteria food being a universal college constant, the real difference at ALU can be found in the classrooms. ALU emphasizes real-world problem solving, starting on day one. Incoming students are presented with a list of challenges currently facing African countries, from climate change to health care, education, urban growth or immigration. For the rest of the year they are expected to research the issue, discuss it with classmates, teachers and outside specialists, and present concrete solutions. Developing leaders for the 21st century, says Swaniker, goes beyond academics. \u0026ldquo;The whole idea is to create problem solvers who have learned how to learn, rather than regurgitate knowledge. That means developing vital skills: critical thinking, leadership, communication, entrepreneurship, data analysis\u0026mdash;this is what we need to develop Africa.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of majors, students have missions.

Another team developed a campus-to-town transport system, vital for co-eds itching to get away from the sugar-cane fields surrounding the university for something more lively. Group work is encouraged because it develops leadership skills, says Nnadi, 20. \u0026ldquo;Going into real life from this point, I feel like there is no problem I won\u0026rsquo;t be able to deal with because I have seen it all: slackers, fights, conflict.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eAnd summer internships are mandatory. \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eThe school coaches students through the rigorous internship research and application process; by the time they graduate, most will have at least a year\u0026rsquo;s worth of work experience\u003c/span\u003e in Africa,\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003e and have applied to multiple jobs, giving them a head start in the real world.

This muddle of meanings creates an opportunity to seek a more precise understanding of what I call “Democratic neoliberalism.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"aTagcy\"\u003eIt is actually not the first time Democrats have been called neoliberal. In the early 1980s, the term emerged to describe a group of figures also called the Watergate Babies, Atari Democrats, and New Democrats, many of whom eventually became affiliated with the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC). In this iteration, the term neoliberal was embraced not as opprobrium. Rather, it used a form of self-description and differentiation to imply that they were “new Democrats.” In 1982, Washington Monthly editor Charles Peters published “\u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1982/09/05/a-neo-liberals-manifesto/21cf41ca-e60e-404e-9a66-124592c9f70d/\"\u003eA Neo-Liberal’s Manifesto\u003c/a\u003e,” which aimed to lay out the core principles of this group; two years later, journalist Randall Rothenberg wrote a book called \u003ca href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=qk2DAAAAMAAJ\u0026amp;q=randall+rothenberg+neoliberal\u0026amp;dq=randall+rothenberg+neoliberal\u0026amp;hl=en\u0026amp;sa=X\u0026amp;ved=0ahUKEwiIrcyRs_3hAhVK71QKHR8-A1EQ6wEIKzAA\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Neoliberals\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e that sought to codify and celebrate this cohort’s ascendency. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"9M5RzD\"\u003eThe DLC and its allies have largely received attention from political historians for their electoral strategy instead of their policies. Yet, even more than electoral politics, this group had an impact on shaping the ideas and policy priorities of the Democratic Party in key issues of economic growth, technology, and poverty. They also created a series of initiatives that sought to fuse these arenas together in lasting ways.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"J76bGd\"\u003eThe realm of policies is where parties can have an impact that reaches beyond elections to shape the lives of individual people and intensify structures and patterns of inequality. It thus points to the importance of expanding the study of US political parties writ large, beyond simply an examination of political strategy and electoral returns and instead thinking about the ways in which parties come to reflect and shape ideas and policy. It also demonstrates the importance of treating neoliberalism less as an epithet and more as a historical development. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"5b6jrY\"\u003eUnlike their counterparts in fields like sociology and geography and even in other historical subfields, historians of the United States were long reluctant to adopt the term “neoliberal.” Many still argue that the neologism has become, in the words of Daniel Rodgers, “\u003ca href=\"https://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/uses-and-abuses-neoliberalism-debate\"\u003ea linguistic omnivore\u003c/a\u003e” that is anachronistic and potentially “cannibalizing.” In the past few years, scholars of 20th-century American political history, however, have increasingly embraced neoliberalism and sought to understand its historical evolution. Building and drawing on the work of influential theorists like \u003ca href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=F5DZvEVt890C\u0026amp;printsec=frontcover\u0026amp;dq=short+history+of+neoliberalism\u0026amp;hl=en\u0026amp;sa=X\u0026amp;ved=0ahUKEwjvjpzRs_3hAhXO0J8KHRH7DX0Q6wEIKzAA#v=onepage\u0026amp;q=short%20history%20of%20neoliberalism\u0026amp;f=false\"\u003eDavid Harvey\u003c/a\u003e, these inquiries have been important in the efforts to understand the relationship between capitalism and politics and the power dynamics with them. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"yb5CYB\"\u003eYet these accounts have largely depicted the rise of neoliberalism in the 1970s as inextricably intertwined with conservative ascent and the Reagan Revolution, and situated the Clinton era and the rise of the New Democrats as a piece of a larger story about the dominance of the free market and the retreat of government. This approach flattened and obscured the important ways that the Clintons and other New Democrats’ promotion of the market and the role of government was distinct from Ronald Reagan, Milton Friedman, and their followers. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"0k0rat\"\u003eThe principles and policies Clinton and the DLC espoused were not solely a defensive reaction to the Republican Party or merely a strategic attempt to pull the Democratic Party to the center. Rather, their vision represents parts of a coherent ideology that sought to both maintain and reformulate key aspects of liberalism itself. In \u003cem\u003eThe Neoliberals\u003c/em\u003e, Rothenberg observed that “neoliberals \u003cem\u003eare \u003c/em\u003etrying to change the ideas that underlie Democratic politics.” Taking his claim seriously provides a means to think about how this group of figures achieved that goal and came to permanently transform the agenda and ideas of the Democratic Party.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"kC4AOj\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFrom Watergate Babies to New Democrats \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"B1DiDd\"\u003eThe group of policymakers and politicians that circulated around the DLC suggests that the roots of many aspects of neoliberalism emerged less from free market conservatism than from the ideology, institutions, and social commitments of liberalism. This group updated and extended many of the core tenets of post-New Deal liberalism, especially the emphasis on technocratic expertise, individualist solutions to structural problems, growth over redistribution, and development of strong partnerships between public and private sectors, particularly nonprofits, businesses, and foundations. The efforts to portray the DLC as indicative of the rightward shift of the party, therefore, fail to acknowledge the ways in which they advocated retaining key aspects of liberalism.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"zGw2W7\"\u003eThis faction emerged in the early 1970s as a response to the economic problems and political realities of the decade. This group, first called the Watergate Babies, swept into the capitals and statehouses around the country in 1974 largely with a base in the white suburban areas. They promised to stop the war in Vietnam, end corruption, and make government more efficient and transparent. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"PWq3LR\"\u003eThe group took aim not just at Richard Nixon and Republicans but also at the Democratic establishment. While they agreed with the postwar liberals’ commitment to stimulating economic growth, they eschewed the Great Society for increasing bureaucracy and begun shifting away from the party’s traditional emphasis on industrial manufacturing and labor unions in the 1970s and 1980s. Figures like Michael Dukakis, Paul Tsongas, Bill Bradley, Tim Wirth, and Al Gore abided by the maxim “the solutions of the thirties will not solve the problems of the eighties.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"4GvAWC\"\u003eThe group received criticism and consternation from more traditional liberals and members of the left who feared they were simply “rejiggering” the ideas of Reagan. Yet as Gary Hart explained, “what is changing are not our principles, goals, aspirations, or ideals, but methods.” He and his allies believed that New Economy sectors and tools such as finance and tech and market-based policies and global trade offered the means to create not just economic growth but also justice, individual opportunity, and rights. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"3RnsUv\"\u003eThis group was heavily influenced by the work of figures like Lester Thurow, whose 1980 book \u003ca href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=V5uBbTOzYOAC\u0026amp;printsec=frontcover\u0026amp;dq=The+Zero-Sum+Society\u0026amp;hl=en\u0026amp;sa=X\u0026amp;ved=0ahUKEwio-JmitP3hAhUM0lQKHU5FDNgQ6wEIKzAA#v=onepage\u0026amp;q=The%20Zero-Sum%20Society\u0026amp;f=false\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Zero-Sum Society\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e essentially became something of a guidebook. Thurow argued that the solution to the multifaceted problems of the 1970s lay in “accelerating the growth of productivity,” which he believed could happen by investing public and private resources in sunrise rather than sunset industries. No arena seemed more on the rise than computers and high tech, and the group’s intense promotion of the technology would lead to their nickname of “\u003ca href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=BvEmvXDK7dIC\u0026amp;q=inauthor:%22Robert+B.+Reich%22\u0026amp;dq=inauthor:%22Robert+B.+Reich%22\u0026amp;hl=en\u0026amp;sa=X\u0026amp;ved=0ahUKEwie6dK1tP3hAhWosVQKHU1NARU4ChDoAQg4MAM\"\u003eAtari Democrats\u003c/a\u003e.” Also influenced by the work of \u003ca href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=BvEmvXDK7dIC\u0026amp;q=inauthor:%22Robert+B.+Reich%22\u0026amp;dq=inauthor:%22Robert+B.+Reich%22\u0026amp;hl=en\u0026amp;sa=X\u0026amp;ved=0ahUKEwie6dK1tP3hAhWosVQKHU1NARU4ChDoAQg4MAM\"\u003eRobert Reich\u003c/a\u003e, these politicians stressed education and retraining as a way to address the problems of deindustrialization and make the United States a leader in the global economy. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"8tAMcR\"\u003eIn the early 1980s, Rep. Gillis Long (D-LA) and his chief of staff Al From brought together several members of this cohort in Congress as part of the Committee on Party Effectiveness. The group met weekly to develop a unified platform in order to “\u003ca href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=2EsVAQAAIAAJ\u0026amp;dq=Kenneth+baer\u0026amp;hl=en\u0026amp;sa=X\u0026amp;ved=0ahUKEwjFxaO4tv3hAhWSGXwKHWzRD88Q6wEIKzAA\"\u003erejuvenate\u003c/a\u003e” the party. They eventually issued a series of reports titled “\u003ca href=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/Rebuilding_the_Road_to_Opportunity.html?id=mQIVHAAACAAJ\"\u003eRebuilding the Road to Opportunity\u003c/a\u003e,”\u003cem\u003e \u003c/em\u003eprimarily authored by Wirth and From. While the reports did call for full employment (something this wing of the Democratic Party would later abandon), the thrust of\u003cem\u003e “\u003c/em\u003eRebuilding” bore the direct influence of Thurow and Reich in its commitment to national investment in high-tech and job retraining and stemming the growth of government. The leaders of the effort built upon its institutional infrastructure to form the DLC in 1985 with the goal of reconstructing the party’s electoral coalition and recapturing the White House.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"aUJMkm\"\u003eIn the aftermath of Dukakis’s defeat in the 1988 election, the DLC leadership came to realize that it needed to develop a more coherent set of principles and policies in order to achieve its larger goals. Thus, the DLC leadership founded a think tank called the Progressive Policy Institute (PPI) led by DLC policy director Will Marshall to help it further deepen its intellectual infrastructure and formulate clearer policy proposals. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"v0X5pv\"\u003eDavid Osborne, an early fellow at PPI, was especially influential in helping achieve and shape this mission. Osborne’s research centered largely on the rise of public-private partnerships and “\u003ca href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=25WwAAAAIAAJ\u0026amp;q=inauthor:%22David+Osborne%22\u0026amp;dq=inauthor:%22David+Osborne%22\u0026amp;hl=en\u0026amp;sa=X\u0026amp;ved=0ahUKEwjhuO2Qtf3hAhXLhlQKHTWOBfcQ6wEIUDAG\"\u003ethird sector institutions\u003c/a\u003e” such as nonprofits and other community organizations, which he argued offered a more effective means of providing social services and economic development than traditional government bureaucracies. Osborne reduced the argument of his 1988 book, \u003cem\u003eLaboratories of Democracies, \u003c/em\u003eto a “slogan”: “if the thesis was government as solution and the antithesis was government as problem, the synthesis is government as partner.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"QWKTCb\"\u003eAlong with co-author Ted Gaebler, Osborne expanded on this argument in \u003ca href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=IMKGAAAAMAAJ\u0026amp;source=gbs_similarbooks\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eReinventing Government: How the Entrepreneurial Spirit Is Reinventing the Public Sector\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e, \u003c/em\u003epublished in 1992. The book’s model of “entrepreneurial government” advocated both efficiency techniques to make government more results-oriented and less costly as well as ways to decentralize authority and to shift more responsibility and control onto the community. It also suggested that the government should serve not as a service provider but as a “catalyst” in connecting the public and private sectors. Clinton, who served as the head of the DLC in the early 1990s, emerged as the most influential advocate of the ideas in “Reinventing Government,” praising it as a “blueprint” to “revitalize government.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"RK0a1c\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Clinton Revolution\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Mqu9tZ\"\u003eWhen Clinton and Gore made their bid for the White House in 1992, these themes were central to their campaign. Clinton repeatedly promised “\u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/17/news/their-own-words-transcript-speech-clinton-accepting-democratic-nomination.html\"\u003ea new approach to government\u003c/a\u003e” that “offers more empowerment and less entitlement … that expands opportunity, not bureaucracy.” The DLC and PPI continued to exert an influence as Clinton made the transition to Washington. In fact, From and DLC staffer Bruce Reed headed the domestic policy transition team. In a homage to Reagan, From and Reed penned a report called “The Clinton Revolution” with a clear plan for the new president’s first 100 days. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"llrOBM\"\u003eJust after the election, PPI also published “\u003ca href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=zBGGAAAAMAAJ\u0026amp;q=mandate+for+change\u0026amp;dq=mandate+for+change\u0026amp;hl=en\u0026amp;sa=X\u0026amp;ved=0ahUKEwi1mpiptf3hAhWrslQKHRo9Cq0Q6wEIKzAA\"\u003eMandate for Change\u003c/a\u003e,” as a more public-facing guidebook for the incoming administration. Fusing the arguments of “Reinventing Government”\u003cem\u003e \u003c/em\u003ewith the DLC’s other principles, “Mandate for Change”\u003cem\u003e \u003c/em\u003ecalled for “introducing choice, competition and market incentives into the public sector” and the need to “emphasize economic growth generated in free markets as the prerequisite for opportunity for all.” The book outlined programs and initiatives for shoring up economic growth through the high-tech sector and for advancing free trade, as well as programs for addressing poverty and other social issues. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"YppV40\"\u003eDuring the late 1980s and early 1990s, the PPI actively promoted ideas like enterprise zones, microenterprise in both the United States and the developing world, welfare-to-work, charter schools, and cap and trade. These proposals came to directly influence many of the policies the Clinton administration advocated and implemented during its tenure. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"U9JfPe\"\u003eThe version of neoliberalism embedded in these policies understood a distinct role for government to stimulate market-oriented solutions to address social ills such as unemployment and poverty. It thereby aimed not to eradicate the welfare state but rather to reformulate it. It extended the importance of poverty alleviation, which had long served as a benchmark of liberal policy, and had many similarities with the basic ideas of the war on poverty. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"EdTET6\"\u003eIn a clear divergence from previous liberal initiatives, however, this approach largely sought to use the tools and techniques of the New Economy to address problems like economic inequality, capital flight, and racial segregation. It also advocated a collaborative and mutually constitutive vision of the relationship between the public and private sectors, which in the process made private sector actors and ideas deeply embedded in government policy. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr class=\"p-entry-hr\" id=\"IBNneT\"\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"EghIg8\"\u003eAlthough questionable if it fully “reinvented government,” the Democratic version of neoliberalism forged in the 1970s that came to fruition in the Clinton era has had an enduring influence. It lasted well beyond when Bill Clinton left office and the DLC officially closed up shop in 2011. The mainstream Democratic Party — as demonstrated by the Obama administration and its allies — remained committed to growth and investment over redistribution and celebrated market-orientated solutions, public-private partnership, especially with the tech industry, and nonprofits and foundations as the main mechanism for addressing problems of inequality. In promoting the market and private sector as a means to “do good” and solve problems of poverty, the Democrats helped make market ever more embedded in government policy and American life. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"AsXh8j\"\u003eHistorians and pundits have often overemphasized the ideological coherence of the Republican Party, but there has been less willingness to recognize the ways Democrats have maintained a consistent vision through much of the past 30 years. Bernie Sanders’s campaign in 2016 represented one of the first sustained challenges to the party’s orthodoxy especially on economic matters. Sanders and many of the other candidates in the crowded 2020 Democratic presidential primary field have tried to provide an alternative to the party’s longtime approach. It remains to be seen if there will be a true break or more of the same. \u003c/p\u003e","url":"https://www.vox.com/polyarchy/2019/6/11/18660240/democrats-neoliberalism","published":"2019-06-11T17:50:00Z","guid":"https://www.vox.com/polyarchy/2019/6/11/18660240/democrats-neoliberalism"},{"title":"Some primary voters move toward Biden after his Hyde Amendment reversal","content":"\u003cimg alt=\"Joe Biden kicks off his campaign for the 2020 US election at a rally in Philadelphia on May 18, 2019.\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PVaEof6bgoRuAG_M46rnU9cFMVA=/0x0:3556x2667/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/63987277/GettyImages_1144793538.0.jpg\" /\u003e\n\n\n\n  \u003cp\u003eA new poll again shows reproductive rights are an important factor in the 2020 elections. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp id=\"IdrlMs\"\u003ePresidential candidate Joe Biden’s \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/06/us/politics/joe-biden-hyde-amendment.html\"\u003ereversal of opinion\u003c/a\u003e on the Hyde Amendment,\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003ea measure he’s stood by for decades that prohibits federal funding for most abortions, seems to have worked in his favor. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Z2T5wl\"\u003eBiden has long supported the Hyde Amendment, which blocks the use of Medicaid funds for abortion.

With rains in March and April, ice on rivers created ice jams, effectively creating dams that allowed water levels to rise and overtop banks and levees.

However, the recent severe rainfall comports with what scientists expect to happen due to global warming. As average temperatures rise, air can hold on to more moisture. Roughly every degree Celsius of temperature increase allows a parcel of air to hold on to 7 percent more water. That moisture is then released as an increasing amount of precipitation. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"SEuNKY\"\u003eThe warming the planet has experienced so far is already driving up the likelihood of \u003ca href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1516588\u0026amp;xs=1\u0026amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Fnews%2Fglobal-warming-already-driving-increases-in-rainfall-extremes-1.19508\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eextreme rainfall events\u003c/a\u003e.

This is something we had been working on for months, and we launched it on Wednesday of last week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ePeCMD\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd this is a series of policy changes you’ve been rolling out for years now.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"o09f85\"\u003eSo, just to be clear ... Yeah. So, we’ve been making lots of different policy changes on YouTube. We have made about 30 changes in the last 12 months, and this past week, we made a change in how we handle hate speech. That took months and months of work, and hundreds of people we had working on that. That was a very significant launch, and a really important one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ELvNag\"\u003eWhat we did with that launch is we made a couple big changes. One of them was to make it so that if there’s a video that alleges that some race or religion or gender or group, protected group, is superior in some way, and uses that to justify discrimination or exclusion, that would now no longer be allowed on our platform. Similarly, if you had a religion or race, and they alleged that inferiority, that another group was inferior, and they used that to justify discrimination in one way. Those were changes that we made. So, examples would be like, “Race X is superior to Y, and therefore Y should be segregated.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Vbn8nB\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIs it weird to you that you had to make a rule that said, “This shouldn’t be allowed”? That this wasn’t covered either by an existing rule? That you had to tell your community, “Look. This is not acceptable”?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"uS0ysI\"\u003eWell, actually, a lot of this ... We’re a global company, of course. And so, if you look at European law, there are a number of countries that have a really strong hate speech law. And so, a lot of this content had never been allowed in those countries, but had actually been allowed in the US and many other countries. And so what we had actually done with it a few years ago is we had actually had limited features, meaning that it wasn’t in the recommendations. It wasn’t monetized. It had an interstitial in front of it to say that this was content that we found offensive. And when we did that, we actually reduced the views to it by 80 percent. So, we found that it was effective, but we really wanted to take this additional step, and we made this step on Wednesday. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"BWzxrU\"\u003eWe also added, which is really important, a few other definitions to protected groups. So, we added caste, because YouTube has become so significant in India. Then, we also added victims of verified violent events. So, like saying the Holocaust didn’t happen, or Sandy Hook didn’t happen, also became violations of our policies. And so, this was happening on Wednesday, and we launched it on Wednesday. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"2iOWZJ\"\u003eThere were thousands of sites that were affected. And again, this is something that we had been working on ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Jx50lU\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis was coming already.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"PO3mSn\"\u003eIt was coming already. We had started briefing reporters about it in Europe over the weekend, because they’re ahead. You know, the train had left the station. And then at the same ... On Friday, there was a video. We heard the allegations from Mr. Carlos Maza, who uploaded a video on Twitter with a compilation ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"LV6par\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWorks at vox.com.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"dh7ZCI\"\u003eHe works at vox.com, yes. With a compilation of different video pieces from Steven Crowder’s channel, putting them together, right? And asked us to take action. Each of these videos had harassment ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"UeetgE\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSaying, “He’s directing slurs at me, and the people who follow him are attacking me outside of YouTube, as well.”\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"mKmVyr\"\u003eYes. So, he alleged that there was harassment associated with this, and we took a look at this. You know, we tweeted back and we said, “We are looking at it.” You know, Steven Crowder has a lot of videos, so it took some time for us to look at that and to really understand what happened, and where these different snippets had come from and see them in the context of the video. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"aejqO3\"\u003eActually, one of the things I’ve learned, whenever people say, “There’s this video and it’s violative. Take it down or keep it up,” you have to actually see the video, because context really, really matters. And so, we looked through a large number of these videos, and in the end we decided that it was not violative of our policies for harassment. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"UGE7xr\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, were you looking at this yourself, personally? Vox is a relatively big site. It’s a big creator. Were you involved in this directly?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"4TObuc\"\u003eI mean, I am involved whenever we make a really important decision, because I want to be looking at it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"4nFKW6\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, you were looking at the videos.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"zP73rl\"\u003eWell, so we have many, many different reviewers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"JfD1yo\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMm-hmm.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"CywOra\"\u003eThey will do a review. Again, there are lots of different videos produced by Steven Crowder. He’s been a longtime YouTuber.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"K3kNvO\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut in this case, did you weigh in personally? Did you look at the stuff?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"A0sOQd\"\u003eI mean, yes. I do look at the videos, and I do look at the reports and the analysis. Again, I want to say there were many videos, and I looked certainly at the compilation video. It was ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"BrY8WR\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, when the team said, “We believe this is non violative. This doesn’t violate our rules,” you agreed with that?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"AVGWR5\"\u003eWell, let me explain to you why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"0iFij3\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMm-hmm.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"gb6Kft\"\u003eWhy we said that. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"n7s43l\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut you agreed?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Fs4GIz\"\u003eI agreed that that was the right decision, and let me explain to you why I agreed that was the right decision. Okay? So, you know, when we got ... First of all, when we look at harassment and we think about harassment, there are a number of things that we look at. First of all, we look at the context. Of, you know, “Was this video dedicated to harassment, or was it a one-hour political video that had, say, a racial slur in it?” Those are very different kinds of videos. One that’s dedicated to harassment, and one that’s an hour-long ... So, we certainly looked at the context, and that’s really important. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"n6R7Uq\"\u003eWe also look and see, is this a public figure? And then the third thing that we look at is, you know, is it malicious? Right? So, is it malicious with the intent to harass? And for right or for wrong right now, malicious is a high bar for us. So the challenge is, like when we get an allegation like this, and we take it incredibly seriously, and I can tell you lots of people looked at it and weighed in. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"MrEl5n\"\u003eWe need to enforce those policies consistently. Because if we were not to enforce it consistently, what would happen is there would be literally millions of other people saying, “Well, what about this video? What about this video? What about this video? And why aren’t all of these videos coming down?” And if you look at the content on the internet, and you look at rap songs, you look at late-night talk shows, you look at a lot of humor, you can find a lot of racial slurs that are in there, or sexist comments. And if we were to take down every single one, that would be a very significant ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"g507SP\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, to stipulate that you take it seriously. I want to come back to the idea that there’s a ton of this stuff here. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"GDMIfA\"\u003eWell, so what we did commit to — and really, this is I think really important — is we committed, like, “We will take a look at this, and we will work to change the policies here.” We want to be able to ... When we change a policy, we don’t want to be knee jerk. We don’t want it to be like, “Hey, I don’t like this video,” or, “This video is offensive. Take it down.” We need to have consistent policies. They need to be enforced in a consistent way. We have thousands of reviewers across the globe. We need to make sure that we’re providing consistency. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"3seJID\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, your team spends a bunch of time working on it. They come to you at some point and they say, “We don’t think this is violative.” You say, “We agree.” You announce that. And then a day later you say, “Actually, we do have problems with this.”\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"43Y32O\"\u003eWell, so what ... Okay. So, we did announce it, and when we announced it, if you look carefully at the tweet, what we actually said at the end is, “We’re looking at other avenues.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Z2k5sD\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMm-hmm.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"BBPLM5\"\u003eThat’s because we actually have two separate processes. One of which is like, “Is this content violative,” from just the purely community guidelines. But then we also have monetization guidelines, and that’s because we have a higher standard for monetization. We’re doing business with this partner. Our advertisers also have a certain expectation of what type of content they are running on. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"1LpUxa\"\u003eAnd so, we had the first review. We said, “It doesn’t violate the community guidelines on harassment, but we’ll take a look at our harassment guidelines and commit to updating that.” Which actually had been on our plan anyway. I had actually put that in my creator letter that I had just done a few weeks ago, saying we were going to take a hard look at it. But we had been working so hard on the hate speech, and so our teams were caught up on that. But that really had been next on our list.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"B6rt5D\"\u003eSo, we have a higher standard for monetization, so then we did announce the monetization change. That Steven Crowder was, his monetization was suspended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Djow7I\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, was that in reaction to people reacting to you not reacting?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"cyydZR\"\u003eNo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"2nm56s\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOr was that something that you were already planning to do and just hadn’t gotten around to announcing?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"CuDAUz\"\u003eNo. We were in the process of looking at that, and there were ... When we look at these accounts, there are many different components that we look at, and that’s actually why we put the line, “There are other avenues that we’re still looking at.” And that might have been too subtle. If I were to do it again, I would put it all into one ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ubwywq\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDo it in one go.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"6UvR55\"\u003eYeah, I would do it all in one go. But we were also ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"eRtOsK\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo you said, “We’re not kicking you off, but we’re not going to help you make money on YouTube. It’ll be directly through ads.”\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"zzDvsU\"\u003eWe’re suspending monetization.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"AdRq0J\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMeaning, “We’re not going to run ads against your stuff. If you still want to sell racist coffee mugs or whatever you’re selling, that’s your business, but we’re not going to help you. We’re not going to put an ad in front of your stuff.” \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"kK1d1j\"\u003eWell, we said we’re not going to put an ad in front of it, but the conditions by which we will turn it on can be broader than just that. So, for example, if they’re selling merchandise and linking off of YouTube, and that is seen as racist or causing other problems, that’s something that we will discuss with the creator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"CPpmXT\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, one more question specific to this.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"WUxGqk\"\u003eBecause again, we’re putting advertising there, so we need to make sure that the advertisers are going to be okay with it, and we have a higher standard. And so, we can sort of look at all different parts of that creator and what they’re doing, and basically apply that higher standard there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"rkhG50\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, people I work with at Vox and other people are saying the one problem we’ve got with all this, in addition to what seems like a back and forth, is that we don’t understand why you made the decision you made. There’s not enough transparency. We can’t figure out what rules he did or didn’t break. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"jqgtTz\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd also, by the way, it seems clear that he did break these rules. But they’re asking for transparency, they’re asking for more understanding of what went on here in this specific case. Is that something that’s reasonable for someone to expect out of you and out of YouTube? To say, “Here’s exactly what happened. Here’s exactly what broke the rule for us. Here’s exactly why we’re demonetizing it”?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"XiXZhV\"\u003eWhich case are you talking about?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"6rHh9Q\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWell, in the case of the Crowder/Maza stuff. But for anything, right?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"TrFmP5\"\u003eSo, we tried to be really transparent. We communicated numerous times, including publishing a blog explaining some of the rationale for our decision. We try to be really transparent with our community, with our guidelines. We get that request actually a lot from our creators, because they want to know what’s allowed on our platform, what’s not allowed, from a monetization standpoint. And so, we do get the request for transparency, and we are working to continue to be more transparent and explain why something is a violation of our policies or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"kq3voe\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, you were talking earlier. You said, “We have to take this very seriously, because if we make a ruling here, someone else is going to say, ‘Look at this rap video where they use this slang term.’” \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"XDVsdg\"\u003eYes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"sbD7qz\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis, to me, seems like the actual issue you’ve got across YouTube, which is you’re doing this at scale, 2 billion users. What, it’s 500 hours of content uploaded every minute? It seems like no matter what decision you make at any particular case, someone is always going to come up and say, “What about this?” Or they’re going to say, “If this is the new rule, I’m going to figure out a way to skirt around it.” Or someone’s going to say, “By the way, you’re going to see content that you have never contemplated showing up.” \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"8KDpaR\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIt seems like at the scale you’re working, on an open platform where anyone can put anything up, that you guys are always going to be on this treadmill, and no matter how many humans you throw at it and how much AI you train up, you can’t actually solve this problem. Do you have confidence that this is something you can actually get a handle on?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"g7S2Qd\"\u003eWe can definitely do, and continue to improve, how we manage the platform. I see how much improvement we’ve already made. For example, if you just look a few years ago, two years ago, there were a lot of articles, a lot of concerns about how we handle violent extremism. If you talk to people today who are experts in this field, you can see that we’ve made tremendous progress. At the end of the day we’re an information company. We have the access to Google, some of the algorithms there. We have the resources to deploy. We’ve committed to, last year, we committed to having over 10,000 people who are working on controversial content, so I see how much progress that we have already made. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"cWTGvC\"\u003eLike I mentioned, we’ve made all these different changes to our policy. We actually have just made changes to our recommendation algorithms as well for not violative content, but borderline content. We announced that we’ve seen a 50 percent reduction in the views coming from recommendations from that. If you combine the combination of much better policies, tighter policies, and we consult with many third parties who try to make sure that we get them right, and we’re hearing from all parties, you combine that with technology to be able to do that at scale, I think you can be in a much better place. I’m not ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"7JDmju\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo you can get better, but can you get it to the point where we’re not seeing a story about something awful happening within YouTube on a sort of weekly basis? Can you get it where this thing is an exception to the rule?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"lrHh6i\"\u003eI mean, I think there’s always going to be ... At the scale that we’re at, there are always going to be people who want to write stories, but ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"4Wr8p5\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWell, there’s also people who want to put terrible things on your website. Right? You guys talk about the fact that you took down 8 million terrible pieces of content in the last quarter.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"stzjce\"\u003eMm-hmm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"uxZOe0\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRight? And that you’re proud of that because you were able to ... What was 75 percent of it, no human ever saw. If I ran a business where people dumping that much sludge onto my property on a quarterly basis, I would really rethink what I’m doing. It seems like, I mean, I just can’t fathom why there’s 8 million pieces of terrible things coming onto your site on a quarterly basis, but that would really upset me and worry me.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ZRjRwE\"\u003eWell, it matters what’s the denominator. You gave the numerator. Right? We have a large denominator, meaning we have lots of content who’s uploaded, and lots of users, and lots of really good content. When we look at it, what all the news and the concerns and the stories have been about this fractional 1 percent. If you talk about the other 99-point-whatever that number is, that’s all really valuable content of people who are sharing valuable points of view that we haven’t heard about, educational content, addressing really important issues. I think it’s important to remember that and put that in perspective. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"taznqT\"\u003eI say that not because we are not committed to solving the fractional 1 percent. We are very committed, and I’ve been really clear that that responsibility is my No. 1 priority. There is a lot of work for us to do. I acknowledge that, but I also know that we have tremendous tools at our fingertips that we can continue to invest in to do a better job. So, yes, while there may be something that slips through or some issue, we’re really working hard to address this, and I think we have some good tools to do so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"PvHO98\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat if YouTube wasn’t open? What if I couldn’t upload a video that I wanted to without asking you for permission? What would that do to YouTube? What if you had some sort of barrier to entry that required me to get some kind of permission to upload something before it went up there?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"HRY2tx\"\u003eI think we would lose a lot of voices. I don’t think that’s the right answer because we would lose a lot of voices and a lot of people who share content. Sometimes we hear from creators that they started sharing content like they started doing... I don’t know, you look at Sal Kahn. Right? He got started almost by accident, right, who now creates very valuable educational content. But what I think is the right answer that you’re alluding to but not quite ... I’m going to ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"SkT02o\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI haven’t got there yet.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"eoiNbF\"\u003eI’m going to improve a little bit your suggestion here, which is having more trusted tiers. In a sense, we’ve already started doing that with monetization, saying, “Look, you can’t just come onto the platform and have monetization on day one.” You have to have a certain number of views. You have to have a certain number of hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"y5JAic\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou have to earn your way into getting ads.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"lGQ2bB\"\u003eYou have to be in good standing. That’s an example of where we have more of a trusted relationship with them. We did a similar thing with livestreams in terms of certain number of views that you have to have ... Sorry, subscribers that you need to have. I think this idea of not everything is automatically given to you on day one, that it’s more of a ... We have trusted tiers, and ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"AGdrIV\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut there’s still, at bottom, you can put stuff on YouTube without asking for it.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"7GsYl3\"\u003eYeah. Everyone can start. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"fFLbQC\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYep.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ibvEyE\"\u003eEveryone can start. Everyone can be their own media provider, but in order to get some of the broader distribution or to have monetization, it’s something that you work your way up to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"U2Wszo\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIs this insistence that the platform has to be open, I can think of a business reason for that. I can think of legal reasons for that. Right? Section 230 gives you legal protections, but you have to not actually prevent someone from uploading something. I can think of ideological reasons why you want the platform to be open. Which one is most important to you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"vvU4cx\"\u003eSorry, I’m trying to remember them all. You said business reasons?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"SgR8od\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBusiness, legal, ideology, but you can add as ... I mean ...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Ds4MRm\"\u003eI mean, they all ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"9FcHR8\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI get that more voices is better, but if having unlimited voices has a problem that is always going to trouble you ...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"aRBezg\"\u003eLook, it’s a core issue. If you want to limit it and say, “Hey, we’re only going to have a select set of people,” but what are the factors that you’re determining that? How are you deciding who is getting to be on the platform and have speech, and who’s not? \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"xNOVq3\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut you are deciding, fundamentally, right? You have teams, and you have software, and you weigh in. You are fundamentally making the decision at some point.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"wCc8zU\"\u003eWe do, but that’s after they’ve been on the platform, and we have an understanding of what they’re doing. It’s based on the content that people have uploaded. Look, we see all these benefits of openness, but we also see that that needs to be married with responsibility. You do need to have more of this responsibility in place, and you need the different ways to understand what is the content that you should be putting in recommendations, what is the content that should be promoted for different use cases. YouTube deals with a lot of different cases. We deal with entertainment, music. Why should we say some people can, new musicians or old musicians, why would we want to close something like that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"cUGHpA\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut there is a world, right, where people make those decisions all the time. Traditional media does this. The New York Times or NBC or Vox knows what’s on their website because they said, “Yes, let’s publish this. Let’s distribute this.” You guys don’t know. That would, again, make me just fundamentally nervous to be running a platform with 2 billion people on it and I don’t know what’s happening on it.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"TtwXjv\"\u003eWell, we have a lot of tools. We work hard to understand what is happening on it and really work hard to enforce the work that we’re doing. I think that if you look across the work, I think you can see that we’ve made tremendous progress in a number of these areas. Again, I’m not saying we’re done, but I think you can see that we’ve made progress. If you were to fast-forward a couple years and say, “Well, what would that look like in 12 months and then another 12 months? What are all the different tools that have been built in place?” I think you’ll see that there’ll be a lot of progress from the perspective.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"vChaEl\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYour boss, Sundar, described the problem you guys are dealing with in an interview this week on Axios as a search problem. Is that the correct analogy to think about the problems you guys are facing?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"wgCoi2\"\u003eWell, I think what he ... I don’t want to interpret, necessarily, what he said, but if you look at Google, Google has done ... Google was first founded on delivering information. Right? That’s been the mission of the company, to organize the world’s information. You look at our first patent, it was about page rank. Page rank is actually about figuring out who is authoritative on the web. Who are the people that you should bring up for any different query? Being part of Google, for informational queries, is a really, really important part of how we’ll build some of those systems going forward. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"CE6d5N\"\u003eAgain, when you talk about music or you talk about cooking or you talk about DIY, these other categories, you want to discover new people. You want to discover those fresh ideas, and you want to see a variety of content, but when you’re dealing with really sensitive areas like news or medical, you want to get those from authoritative sources. I think there’s an opportunity ... That’s where we work with Google, and we learn a lot from Google, and we think we can do a better job that way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"qhK2CP\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThere’s a lot of discussion about regulation and what kind of regulation makes sense to use with tech companies, including yours. What regulation would be helpful to you, and what regulation would you not want to see at all?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"mCWXKZ\"\u003eWell, I agree there’s definitely more regulation in store for us. One of the groups I’ve been working, that we’ve been spending a lot of time, has been Article 13, which is the copyright directive in Europe, now named Article 17. I think what we have seen is that a lot of times regulation is really well-intended. People want to change society for the better, but it has all these unintended consequences. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"o2ywr5\"\u003eWhat I would say is really important is for us to be able to work closely with these different providers, the different governments, and be able to explain how can we really implement it in a reasonable way, how to make sure there aren’t unintended consequences that they didn’t think about that actually might make the situation worse that they just, because they’re not running our businesses, don’t necessarily have that visibility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"39fQGe\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThere’s a push to break up some of these companies. What would happen if you were split off from Google?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"LDJ7uj\"\u003eI don’t know. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ucg8R0\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThat’s a fair ...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"OVvstu\"\u003eI’ve been really busy this week working with all these other concerns. I mean, I don’t know. I’ll worry about it ... I don’t know. I mean, we would figure it out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"nhqQX8\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThat’s a good answer. One more specific video question. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"kPsTtS\"\u003eYeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ZEO2Vg\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBuzzFeed wrote about a creator with some popularity who’d made a series of problematic videos — I hate that I just used the word problematic — offensive videos. One of them was a death threat aimed at you. You took down that video and another video. Her channel is still up, which brings me back to this sort of whack-a-mole where you guys are sort of sifting through videos as they come to your attention and saying, “This one’s a problem. This one is okay. This one threatened to kill me, but she can still stay on the site.” How do you feel about having — so her name is Soph — how do you feel about having her on YouTube?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"vIdwO2\"\u003eWell, like I mentioned beforehand, every single time there is a controversial video, you really need to see the video, and you need to understand what’s happening. She has a large amount of political satire and political speech that’s in her channel. The video where she made the threat to me was struck, and we removed monetization from her channel because, like I said, we have a higher bar for monetization. That was an issue. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"7mR9aS\"\u003eLook, I think there’s certainly different levels of threats in the videos and different ways that we would interpret it depending upon the context of who is the person and what they’re saying. In many cases, we would terminate the channel if we thought it was a channel that was dedicated to a number of, I don’t know, hateful, harassment, etc. But in this case, it was a large amount of political speech. Seeing it in context, we struck the video, removed monetization, but left the rest of the channel up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"IG6xor\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThere’s been a lot of threats directed at you and other YouTube executives in the last few days since you announced your policy. I assume some of that, again, is ideologic, but some of it is that you’ve got these creators who are trying to make money on your platform. I think that’s a difference between what you do and what Google and Twitter do. Generally, most people aren’t making a living on Google or Twitter, and people can legitimately do that. Then you had a YouTuber who was angry about being demonetized, I think, and came onto your campus and killed someone a couple years ago. What’s that like to manage that teeming group of people that you don’t really actually manage?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"TqSF23\"\u003eWell, first of all it’s difficult, but I will say there was something in your question that I don’t totally agree with. I think it’s really important to clarify. You talked about, you made this association of creators who could be upset, or angry, or difficult and then you alleged, right, that it ties to monetization. Again, I want to ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"zgCicQ\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThey’ll often make that argument.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"XY6tv9\"\u003eWell, I want to just be clear that, again, it’s this 99 fractional 1 percent problem, but I also want to point out that because we have a higher bar for monetization that we’re really ... This isn’t a business problem from that perspective. Right? We’re focused on having high-quality content available as part of our ecosystem, but we also want to have a broad range because we wanted to keep it open and enable lots of different points of view to be on the platform. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ETsz4P\"\u003eIt’s certainly, I think like any time that you have a bunch of creators or people are upset, it’s difficult. Certainly, this year, this week it was unfortunate. We managed to upset everybody and we’re working really hard to try to do the right thing. It was really in our effort to be consistent that we wound up upsetting people. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"dsg2lM\"\u003eIt’s not an easy job. It’s a tough job, but I am encouraged by the fact that I hear so many good stories of people who have been able to pursue their passion, start a career, have a business on YouTube, talk about how they learned an instrument or learned something new they never thought they could do beforehand. And so it’s really all the good, it’s the 99 percent of good, valuable content that I’m really encouraged, that keeps me motivated and passionate about what I do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"jSkhJ7\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI have more questions but I want to open it up to the audience because I think they’re going to have questions, too. I assume there’s a microphone, maybe two microphones, lights? Can you introduce yourself?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Z0pfKX\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSteve Kovach: Yeah, I’ve Steve Kovach from CNBC. I was wondering what goals and metrics Sundar and your other bosses give you that you’re evaluated on and how or if those have changed over the years.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"oP3Gji\"\u003eYeah, well, so you know, I think like any company we use multiple metrics to evaluate our success. We have sort of at the top of our pyramid quality and responsibility right now. When we talk about quality we’re talking about recommendation quality, search quality, comment quality, etc. We talk about responsibility. We talk about ruling out changes to our recommendation services to make sure that we’re recommending the right content to our users. Those are the top-line metrics that we have and so we put that at the top of the pyramid because it’s really important to...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"4VtnxT\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSteve Kovach: Have those changed over the years?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"i9IgwI\"\u003eExcuse me, what?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"FSm7DX\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSteve Kovach: Has that pyramid changed over the years?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"70H2S8\"\u003eIt definitely has. It’s certainly evolved over time. There are lots of other metrics, to be fair, that we look at, like how many creators do we have on our platform, revenue, etc., how are users engaging with our videos, right, number, daily active users. So yes, there are many other metrics that we use. But we have been really focused on putting these at the top to be clear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"l7YwDM\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSteve Kovach: For a long time you guys were pushing for watch time, right? You wanted to get to a billion hours. In retrospect, was that emphasis on watch time a mistake?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"tElTA0\"\u003eWe definitely ... yeah, we’ve always had lots of different metrics, to be clear, not just one. When we actually introduced the watch time metric it was the goal of ... a quality one, at the time, because what we saw is that views a lot of times cause click spam, or people clicking on content that they didn’t really want. And we thought watch time was the best way to show our people really engaged. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"W1bl0P\"\u003eBut we have evolved in many different ways. We also started adding satisfaction into our recommendations, so after people watch a video, were they satisfied with those videos? That’s an example of how our metrics have evolved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"9o0Czq\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOkay, we’ve got a lot of folks. We’ll try to go quick.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"gfAxNz\"\u003eOkay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"72mVO8\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney: Susan, Mark Mahaney at RBC. Two questions, you pick which one you want, the near term and the long term. Near term, in the March quarter there’s a real sharp deceleration in growth, ad revenue growth at Google, some talk about product changes maybe that occurred at YouTube. Do you have anything you can share, any light you can shed on that?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"o7EbqQ\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThen the other question is bigger and it’s what Peter was asking you earlier, you’ve been at Google since the beginning of the beginning. Do you think the company has become too big that it really should be more, much more closely regulated than it ever was in the past? Google grew up against in a way one tech monopoly. Do you think it’s become another tech monopoly?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"6Z4OOm\"\u003eI’ll take the second question, given that you’ve given the two. I did just celebrate my 20-year anniversary at Google and it’s pretty amazing to see the way Google has evolved over time. I can tell you from my vantage on YouTube is if you look at all the people who are getting into video and big, well-resourced companies all getting into online video, this seems like an incredibly competitive time. I’m also often asked the question like, “What about X, Y, Z, all these other providers?” I see that competitiveness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Ua6hF1\"\u003eI also see some of the advantages. I mentioned beforehand, like if we are going to focus on some really hard computer science information problems. I think that’s what Sundar referred, like being part of Google really helps us because we’re able to use different signals and technology that they have to be able to figure out what the right way to do our recommendations and rank it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Dli2p7\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney: You need to be this big to solve the scale of the problem that you have because you’re so big?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"7Kv1Sx\"\u003eHaving enough scale does help us build systems that are world class to be able to address this. I do think there are some advantages of that and there are some technologies that we’re able to learn from Google and those techniques that really benefit us. I do see that there are some real advantages that we’re able to deliver a better product because we have some of the ... We run on shared infrastructure and there’s some technology that we can borrow or just even techniques that we can learn from on how to deliver the right information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"vM4VFJ\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe’ll take two more questions real quick.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"LVBy9H\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNilay Patel: Hi, Nilay Patel from the Verge. You’re CEO of YouTube. Do you think you’ve set a fair goal for your policy team to create a single, coherent content moderation policy that covers beauty influencers, tech YouTubers, and how-to channels, and political comedians? It feels like you’ve set them up to fail.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"hSJpkF\"\u003eWhen we think about ... First of all, we have many policies, right? One of the things I’ve learned from spending a lot of time on these different policies is that there could be certain areas that need a different set of policies, like I’ll just say news and information is a whole category in and of itself. This is actually why it hasn’t been so simple to solve because we need to be able to solve each of these different areas with a different set of experts, deep understanding, different technology. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"vgTO8K\"\u003eFor example, in news we have misinformation cards. We have authoritative ranking, breaking news shows, right, so we have a bunch of different product solutions. Then I think from a policy standpoint we also are going to have different policies as they appear in different verticals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"LZ12fT\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNilay Patel: Do your creators know that they fall under different policy regimes?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"SO0vDz\"\u003eWell, people know that if they create ... Look, there’s some standards like how we handle harassment or how we handle hate that applies to everyone, but what I’m trying to say is that if you’re in the news category and you’re producing misinformation we’re going to ... There could be a set of cases that really only relate to news. I’m just saying that we’re trying to understand how to cover everything from a policy standpoint. But when we identify, “Look, there’s a problem over here,” it’s specific to this area, specific to this industry, we’re also going to look and say, “Well, what policy should we change, make that will really affect this effectively?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"b9TGpc\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI’m going to change my policy. I’m going to let two more because I want to have Ina go and I’m going to let Kevin from the Times ask a question because he wrote a really good story this week.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ZFW74f\"\u003eSure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Denqk1\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, super quick, Ina?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Qsd2eY\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIna Fried: Yep, Ina Fried with Axios. You started off with an apology to the LGBTQ community but then you also said that you were involved and that you think YouTube made the right call. A lot of people don’t really feel like that’s an apology and are concerned that YouTube flags LGBT-positive content just for being LGBT as sometimes sensitive and yet slurs are allowed. I’m curious, are you really sorry for anything to the LBGTQ community or are you just sorry that they were offended?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"BgO4mM\"\u003eYeah, so first of all, I’m really personally very sorry and it was not our intent. Our goal was ... YouTube has always been a home of so many LGBTQ creators and that’s why it was so emotional and that’s why I think this really ... That’s why even though it was a hard decision, it was made harder that it came from us because it has been such an important home. Even though we made this hard, this decision which I’m going to get into a little bit more with your questions, I’m saying we’ve really, like YouTube, we have so many people on YouTube from the LGBTQ community and we’ve always wanted to support the community openly in spite of this hard issue that we’ve had right now. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"sn2iox\"\u003eI’m just saying people have gotten a lot of criticism like, “Why are you still ... Why did you change your logo to rainbows even though you made this hard decision?” It’s because as a company we really want to support this community. It’s just that from a policy standpoint we need to be consistent because if we ... Look, if we took down that content there would be so many other, so much other content that we would need to take down. We don’t want to just be knee jerk. We need to think about it in a very thoughtful way be able to speak with everyone. We’ll speak to people from the LGBTQ community, make sure that we’re incorporating that going forward in terms of how we think about harassment and then make sure that we are implementing that in a fair and consistent way going forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"DqFNuW\"\u003eI think that it was a hard week across the board and I am truly, truly sorry for the hurt that we caused that community. It was not our intention at all. I do want to ... Not that I want to take away in any way from the hurt or the challenge of what happened this week, but I do want to let you know that many changes that we made in the hate policy which, again, is a different set of policies we think will be really beneficial for the LGBTQ community and there are a lot of videos there and a lot of ways that that community is attacked where we will be taking down those videos going forward and we will be very consistent. If we see that we will take it down. So again, thank you for your question and I really do apologize for the hurt that we caused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"fryTA0\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKevin really does get the last question.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"MH3RgJ\"\u003eOkay.

As part of that story I got to ask a lot of people about YouTube and radicalization but I never got to ask you, so I wanted to ask you, do you think YouTube is having a radicalizing effect on our politics?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"6PGiRF\"\u003eUm, I mean, so, um ... We offer, as you know and you’ve researched, a broad range of opinions. We have looked in all of these different areas across the board and we see that we are offering a diversity of opinions, right? So when people go and they look up one topic — whether it’s politics or religion or knitting — we’re going to offer a variety of other content associated with it, but we have taken these radicalization concerns very seriously and that’s why at the beginning of January we introduced some new changes in terms of how we handle recommendations. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"pgD6pn\"\u003eI know you’re familiar with them. You’ve referenced them, but what we do just for background for the other people is that we basically have an understanding of what’s content that’s borderline and when that content is borderline we determine that based on a series of different raters that we use that are representative of different people across the US. And when we determine that we’re able to build a set of understanding of what’s considered borderline content and then reduce our recommendations. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"QfbZTa\"\u003eWe have reduced by 50 percent the recommendations that we’re making of borderline content and we’re planning to roll that out to all countries, to 20 more countries this rest of the year. I think the combination of the changes that we’re making of our policies as well as the changes that we’ve made to our recommendations are going to make a really big difference.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"vbhSyA\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJust to restate Kevin’s question, do you think YouTube helps radicalize people, particularly on the right?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"FFzBhQ\"\u003eI, I mean, I, it’s, like, you know, you’ve done lots and lots of research on this.

Bush to launch the war in Afghanistan, because the Taliban in Afghanistan at the time was harboring Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda, who planned the 9/11 attacks. (Congress passed a separate AUMF, in 2002, to authorize the war to oust Saddam Hussein in Iraq.) \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"DYmrpX\"\u003eBut because the 2001 AUMF gave the president such broad authority to go after anyone connected to the 9/11 attacks — and didn’t set a time limit for how long the authorization would stand — it opened the door to other conflicts as well. Presidents Bush, Barack Obama, and Donald Trump have used the AUMF to pursue terrorists across the globe in disparate places such as Niger, Somalia, and Syria, often based on flimsy (or even nonexistent) connections to al-Qaeda and 9/11.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Wyiht4\"\u003eButtigieg says he wants to “repeal and replace” that law to narrow the scope of the president’s authority to use military force around the world. However, he did propose that the US continue to provide “security assistance” to countries who fight terrorists — which often involves the use of US military forces — without specifying if he would do that before or after changing the law.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"XcUaQr\"\u003e2.

She’d pass that citation along to the US Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia or the Justice Department. Either the US attorney or the DOJ will likely say they don’t plan to move forward with prosecuting Barr or the other officials.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"b30CUc\"\u003eThat’s why Democrats also have to take a second step to enforce their subpoenas: passing a resolution authorizing Congress to go to court to enforce them. This is the very resolution they’re passing today, giving the committees the legal authority to move ahead with criminal contempt citations when they need to — rather than coming back and asking the full House to grant a contempt citation each time. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"eP9uUO\"\u003eDemocrats have had some legal success in recent weeks. Two federal judges have sided with Congress in separate cases, telling the Trump administration to comply with subpoenas from the House Oversight and Financial Services committees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"X28Kwa\"\u003eWith the Mueller report back in the spotlight, Democrats are making it a big focus for now. But they want to keep their options open. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ybyXNq\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ppWMf1\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"M4rxrs\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp

For Team Joe, the real race is against Trump and not against his fellow Democrats. It\u0026#8217;s part of the reason he\u0026#8217;s not rushing to these come-one-come-all events, such as a forum focused on African-American issues at the end of the week in Charleston, S.C.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other Democratic candidates are pinning their hopes on the fact that, historically, the early frontrunner rarely maintains the lead all the way to the start of the primary season. Just ask Presidents Jeb Bush or Rudy Giuliani. A stumble by Biden, a viral social media moment or a stronger performance at the upcoming primary debates could provide a breakout moment for rivals.

And it\u0026rsquo;s hard to find good field organizers,\u0026rdquo; said Grant Woodard, a Des Moines attorney with experience as a Democratic strategist. \u0026ldquo;If all these campaigns are all looking for some big breakout moment, their moment in the sun \u0026hellip; you need to actually have organizational capacity to capitalize on that because it\u0026rsquo;s all fleeting.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmong Iowa Democratic operatives, the clear consensus is that the two candidates doing the best on that front are Warren and Booker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Those two are in a class of itself in terms of boots on the ground,\u0026rdquo; said Sean Bagniewski, the chair of Polk County Democrats. \u0026ldquo;The problem that you\u0026rsquo;re seeing is that Booker and Warren came in and scooped up [the talent].\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSanders is also often name-checked as one of the candidates with an extensive ground operation currently in the works, and he remains the candidate closest to Biden in polling. In \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/brianneDMR/status/1137509927596040193\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003ethe latest Des Moines \u003ci\u003eRegister\u003c/i\u003e poll\u003c/a\u003e, he trailed the vice president by eight points in a poll with a 4-point margin of error. That puts Sanders in a virtual tie with Warren and Buttigieg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBiden is certainly thought to have the potential to catch up in Iowa in measures outside of polling, where the stakes are high for someone who is such a recognizable Democratic figure. Biden is betting big on his electability argument, that he alone is best positioned to make Donald Trump a one-term President. Biden\u0026#8217;s first stop Tuesday? One of the 32 counties in Iowa\u0026#8217;s 99 counties that Trump flipped from red to blue in 2016.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;I would say that Biden has to win Iowa. I mean, being the former vice president of the United States, I think if he doesn\u0026rsquo;t win Iowa, I think that could be the death knell of his campaign,\u0026rdquo; Woodard said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside Biden\u0026#8217;s inner-circle, that is their nightmare scenario, evoking memories of his 1988 bid that ended before Iowa and 2008, when he dropped out late the night of the caucuses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn Tuesday, Biden rolled out a round of endorsements, including an operative who proved pivotal to Barack Obama\u0026#8217;s Iowa victory in 2008. Still, he was playing catch up to several of the candidates who are on his heels in various ways. Harris, for example, announced her first local elected official endorsement more than two weeks ago, and Booker rolled out an Iowa steering committee at the start of this month. Still, Biden is running at his own pace. And although he has yet to open his headquarters in Philadelphia, he\u0026#8217;s making inroads in the early states. For instance, Biden recruited Jake Braun to run his Iowa operations. Braun has worked in Iowa politics since 2002 and has three presidential caucuses under his belt. And Biden lured away Julia Krieger, who had been Rep. Tim Ryan\u0026#8217;s national communications director, to serve as his Iowa communications strategist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, some candidates are very much banking their investment in Iowa ends up paying off. Delaney, for example, has been running for president since 2017 and fighting an uphill battle against low name recognition. He has visited all 99 counties, started airing ads during the Super Bowl way back in February of 2018, has made 29 trips to Iowa, and has eight offices in the state. He notes he has \u0026#8220;similar efforts\u0026#8221; in New Hampshire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsked whether he was counting on Iowa, Delaney, in a recent interview with TIME in his Des Moines headquarters, said, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m banking on early states, yes, absolutely.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeantime, fellow longshot candidate Marianne Williamson, a self-help author calling for a \u0026#8220;spiritual awakening\u0026#8221; in the country, has moved to a Des Moines condo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of this action can be wearying for even the most committed voter. The Des Moines \u003cem\u003eRegister\u003c/em\u003e reported that the likeliest of caucus-goers \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/IAStartingLine/status/1138240365411127296\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003esay there are simply too many candidates\u003c/a\u003e on the Democratic side, and voters at several recent events had said they aren\u0026#8217;t ready to commit to any of them just yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;The people that I\u0026rsquo;m talking to, they\u0026rsquo;re still very much in the gathering knowledge stage,\u0026rdquo; Madalyn Anderson, chair of the Story County Democrats, said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor that reason, the field isn\u0026#8217;t likely to shrink much anytime soon. Biden may still be the frontrunner, but he has 23 reasons to watch his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/time/topstories/~4/hQFk4xBz3ws\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/hQFk4xBz3ws/","published":"2019-06-11T19:08:59Z","guid":"https://time.com/?p=5604413"},{"title":"New Government Estimates Offer Early Hope That Drug Overdose Deaths Are Waning","content":"\u003caside class=\"right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad\" id=\"right-rail__ad-5604693\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module video-2\" data-src=\"https://time.com/5604693/drug-overdose-deaths-declining/\" data-widget-id=\"SB_4\" data-ob-template=\"timemag\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter years of sharp increases in fatal drug overdoses in the U.S., provisional federal data provide reason for cautious optimism.

The Task Force is an independent panel of experts that reviews available data and makes recommendations on various health issues. Many medical organizations rely on this advice for treating patients. Based on the studies it analyzed, the USPSTF now recommends that people who are not yet infected with HIV but are at high risk of becoming infected start taking\u003ca href=\"https://time.com/4114402/aids-hiv-drug-prep/\" \u003e PrEP, or Pre Exposure Prophylaxis\u003c/a\u003e, a daily medication most commonly made up of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate paired with emtricitabine (sold under the brand name Truvada), or composed of tenofovir alone.

Currently, he says, there are up to 1.2 million people in the U.S. who are potentially at higher risk of getting an HIV infection than the general population, but fewer than 30% of them are taking advantage of PrEP.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite numerous studies supporting PrEP\u0026rsquo;s effectiveness, many physicians who aren\u0026rsquo;t HIV experts are still reluctant to prescribe the drug since they would be giving it to otherwise healthy people, and exposing them to potential side effects, which include kidney and digestive system problems, as well as bone loss, although these are relatively rare. Not all insurers cover the entire cost of PrEP either, leaving patients with high co-pays, but with the USPSTF\u0026rsquo;s new guidance, more payers should be convinced that the drug is worth reimbursing. \u0026ldquo;I consider this a significant advance toward our quest to get as many people on prevention as we possibly can,\u0026rdquo; says Fauci. \u0026ldquo;We are not going to bring the incidence of new infections down significantly unless PrEP is maximally utilized.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe task force evaluated 12 rigorous studies, and found that PrEP lowered the risk of getting HIV by 54% in follow-up periods of anywhere from four months to four years, compared to those receiving either a placebo or nothing at all. The studies showed that even when people in the studies used PrEP more intermittently\u0026mdash;for example only during periods when they would be engaging in higher risk behaviors\u0026mdash;their risk of acquiring HIV was still lower than among those not using PrEP. And the more faithfully people took the daily pills, the higher the likelihood that they would be protected from HIV. Based on these results, the task force determined that the benefits of protection from HIV outweighed the potential risks of the medication.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuch strong evidence doesn\u0026rsquo;t always lead to changes in practice, notes Dr. Diane Havlir, professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, who was not part of the task force. With PrEP, she says, the evidence needs to be part of a broader, community-based effort to reach people who might benefit and help them to trust in the benefits that PrEP can provide. \u0026ldquo;So much in health happens outside the doors of the clinic,\u0026rdquo; she says. \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s why community outreach ambassadors, people who talk about using interventions such as PrEP, are one of the most important parts of making something like PrEP uptake happen.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn San Francisco, Havlir, along with Dr. Susan Buchbinder, director of Bridge HIV at the San Francisco Department of Public Health, has pioneered a program called \u0026ldquo;\u003ca href=\"https://time.com/3596979/the-end-of-aids/\" \u003eGetting to Zero San Francisco\u003c/a\u003e,\u0026rdquo; aimed at making the city the first in the U.S. to have zero new infections over a year. To do so, they have worked with city officials to initiate universal HIV testing for anyone treated in the emergency room of San Francisco General Hospital. \u0026ldquo;Testing is the gateway to prevention, and testing is the gateway to treatment,\u0026rdquo; says Havlir. (In its latest guidelines, the USPSTF also confirmed its previous advice that all people between the ages of 15 years and 65 years be tested for HIV.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHavlir and Buchbinder have also launched an innovative treatment program that immediately connects people who are diagnosed with HIV to the hospital\u0026rsquo;s treatment clinic and set up with their first dose of anti-HIV pills.

When the Ghana-born, Stanford Business School-educated entrepreneur Fred Swaniker opened the Mauritius campus in 2015, he not only pledged to build 25 more like it in Africa, he also promised to produce 3 million young African leaders over the next 50 years.

It is also the solution to an unanticipated problem that sprung up when he first sought to disrupt African education. In 2008, Swaniker launched his African Leadership Academy in Johannesburg, recruiting high school students from across the continent and promising to prepare them for the best universities the world had to offer. But once they got into those Ivy League and European universities, they rarely came back. \u0026ldquo;I realized we were actually contributing to the brain drain,\u0026rdquo; says Swaniker. \u0026ldquo;So I said it\u0026rsquo;s time that Africa had its own Stanford and MIT and Harvard. But instead of replicating the universities that were built for another era, we should build a university that looks to the future, that educates the leaders Africa needs.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"inline-portrait_small_2x aligncenter \"\u003e\u003cimg data-attachment-id=\"5603935\" data-permalink=\"https://time.com/5603886/african-leadership-university-mauritius-fred-swaniker/time-100-gala-2019-dinner-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/fred-swaniker-time-100.jpg?quality=85\" data-orig-size=\"1024,720\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"Dimitrios Kambouris\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D4S\",\"caption\":\"NEW YORK, NEW YORK - APRIL 23: Fred Swaniker attends the TIME 100 Gala 2019 Dinner at Jazz at Lincoln Center on April 23, 2019 in New York City.

Each classroom is dedicated to a influential African leader or artist \u0026mdash; the Sankore wing, referencing one of the oldest universities in the world, in Timbuktu, Mali, features classrooms named after Ethiopian runner Haile Gebrselassie, U.N. general-secretary Boutros Boutros-Ghali and South African writer Bessie Head; the faculty lounge celebrates South African anti-apartheid activist Steve Biko. The four dormitories are dedicated to the great African civilizations, such as Axum, Kongo, and Songhai. Even the cafeteria aspires to pan-African cuisine, though Nnadi, the Nigerian computer-science student, says the attempt to create his nation\u0026rsquo;s national dish, jollof rice, \u0026ldquo;needs a lot of help.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eComplaints about cafeteria food being a universal college constant, the real difference at ALU can be found in the classrooms. ALU emphasizes real-world problem solving, starting on day one. Incoming students are presented with a list of challenges currently facing African countries, from climate change to health care, education, urban growth or immigration. For the rest of the year they are expected to research the issue, discuss it with classmates, teachers and outside specialists, and present concrete solutions. Developing leaders for the 21st century, says Swaniker, goes beyond academics. \u0026ldquo;The whole idea is to create problem solvers who have learned how to learn, rather than regurgitate knowledge. That means developing vital skills: critical thinking, leadership, communication, entrepreneurship, data analysis\u0026mdash;this is what we need to develop Africa.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of majors, students have missions. Last year, one student established\u0026mdash;and found funding for\u0026mdash;a shelter for the island\u0026rsquo;s street dogs. Another team developed a campus-to-town transport system, vital for co-eds itching to get away from the sugar-cane fields surrounding the university for something more lively. Group work is encouraged because it develops leadership skills, says Nnadi, 20. \u0026ldquo;Going into real life from this point, I feel like there is no problem I won\u0026rsquo;t be able to deal with because I have seen it all: slackers, fights, conflict.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eAnd summer internships are mandatory. \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eThe school coaches students through the rigorous internship research and application process; by the time they graduate, most will have at least a year\u0026rsquo;s worth of work experience\u003c/span\u003e in Africa,\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003e and have applied to multiple jobs, giving them a head start in the real world.

Neither liberalism nor conservatism makes people kinder or meaner. But this is not the case with leftism. With the handful of exceptions that accompany every generalization, leftism makes people meaner, even crueler.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTake the transfer of Manafort, the one-time Trump campaign manager, from a federal prison to New York\u0026#8217;s Rikers Island prison. Rikers Island is universally regarded as a wretched place. As Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz wrote:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cblockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe decision to move Paul Manafort \u0026#8230; from the decent federal prison to which he was sentenced to solitary confinement to the dangerous hell hole that is New York City\u0026#8217;s Rikers Island seems abusive and possibly illegal. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI know Rikers well having spent time there visiting numerous defendants accused of murder and other violent crimes. It is a terrible place that no one should ever be sent to.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMass murderers and torturers are among those incarcerated at Rikers Island. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMoreover, Manafort, found guilty solely for white-collar crimes, will be placed in solitary confinement—“for his own safety.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eVirtually everyone who has written about solitary confinement, both on the right and the left, deems it torture. Manafort will therefore be tortured after being sentenced to seven years\u0026#8217; imprisonment for fraud and, in the words of The Daily Wire, \u0026#8220;a little-known law that requires lobbyists to report that they are working on behalf of a foreign government (in Manafort\u0026#8217;s case, Ukraine).\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAngry over the possibility that Manafort may be pardoned by President Donald Trump, the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus Vance, charged Manafort with additional crimes based on state law. That way, if found guilty of state offenses, he cannot be pardoned by Trump, as the president\u0026#8217;s power to pardon applies only to federal—not state—crimes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone knows this prosecution is politically motivated. Vance hates the president and wants to use solitary confinement in a hellhole with violent criminals to squeeze Manafort into testifying against the president.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs Dershowitz said to me on my radio show, what Vance is doing reminds him of Stalin and Beria—the infamous state prosecutor, a man Stalin referred to as \u0026#8220;my Himmler.\u0026#8221; Dershowitz, a lifelong liberal Democrat and supporter of Hillary Clinton, does not use Stalin analogies loosely. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo her credit, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted: \u0026#8220;A prison sentence is not a license for gov torture and human rights violations. That\u0026#8217;s what solitary confinement is. Manafort should be released, along with all people being held in solitary.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI might add that my opposition to Manafort\u0026#8217;s treatment is not partisan or new. On a number of occasions over the years, I have cited favorably New York Review of Books articles describing the horror of solitary confinement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eDespite its history of opposition to solitary confinement, The New York Times article reporting the plan to relocate Manafort said nothing against the unnecessary transfer but did comment on the expensive suits Manafort used to wear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSolitary confinement is \u0026#8220;basically a deathtrap,\u0026#8221; former New York City Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik wrote when Manafort was placed in solitary at his federal prison. Manafort should never have been sentenced to solitary confinement. But Robert Mueller (and Judge Amy Berman Jackson) sought it for the same political reason Vance has: to break the man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs former federal prosecutor Sidney Powell wrote: \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cblockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen a witness or defendant from whom prosecutors want \u0026#8216;cooperation\u0026#8217; does not do as they demand, they put him in solitary confinement. And it works. It literally breaks people.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSolitary does have a place in our prison system, but only for those people who are simply too dangerous to be placed around others at all. However, the torture of solitary confinement should never be used as it is now to break people to prosecutors\u0026#8217; will—to torture them until they will say or do anything to get out.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSolitary is also called the \u0026#8216;hole.\u0026#8217; It\u0026#8217;s a small space, barely large enough to stand, with a slit for light, to which prisoners are confined/caged for 23 hours a day. \u0026#8230;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePaul Manafort, seventy years old, has endured this torture for eight months. He\u0026#8217;s now in a wheelchair, while Judge Amy Berman Jackson mocks his rapidly deteriorating health. Where is the outcry from the ACLU?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo, then, what enables Vance, Mueller, and Jackson to engage in such evil?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe only answer is their politics—the politics of the Trump-hating left. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eVance, Mueller, and Jackson may well be good parents, loving spouses, loyal friends, and charitable individuals. But leftism has given them permission to act vilely and mercilessly while thinking of themselves as fine people—just as evil doctrines have done throughout history.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs noted at the beginning of this column, when I was at Columbia, I witnessed this leftist mean-spiritedness firsthand in the personal cruelty of left-wing agitators against professors and others with whom they differed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHere\u0026#8217;s a question perhaps millions of parents will be able to answer: If your child returned home from college a leftist, was he or she a kinder or meaner person than before he or she left for college?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe question is rhetorical.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eCOPYRIGHT 2019 CREATORS.COM\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe post \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.dailysignal.com/2019/06/11/leftism-makes-people-meaner-reflections-on-the-torture-of-paul-manafort/\"\u003eLeftism Makes People Meaner: Reflections on the Torture of Paul Manafort\u003c/a\u003e appeared first on \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.dailysignal.com/\"\u003eThe Daily Signal\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://www.dailysignal.com/2019/06/11/leftism-makes-people-meaner-reflections-on-the-torture-of-paul-manafort/?utm_source=rss\u0026utm_medium=rss\u0026utm_campaign=leftism-makes-people-meaner-reflections-on-the-torture-of-paul-manafort","published":"2019-06-11T17:09:52Z","guid":"https://www.dailysignal.com/?p=528859"},{"title":"House Democrats Appeal Court Ruling That Rejected Their Bid to Stop Trump’s Wall","content":"\n\u003cp\u003eHouse Democrats asked the D.C.

Here\u0026#8217;s what he told CNBC.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDonald Trump:\u003c/strong\u003e But I just want to say to the United States Chamber of Commerce, if we didn\u0026#8217;t have tariffs, we wouldn\u0026#8217;t have made a deal with Mexico. We got everything we wanted and we\u0026#8217;re going to be a great partner to Mexico now because now they respect us. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThey didn\u0026#8217;t even respect us. They couldn\u0026#8217;t believe how stupid we were with what\u0026#8217;s going on, where somebody comes in from Mexico and just walks right into our country and we\u0026#8217;re powerless to do anything, whereas they have very strong immigration laws. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThey don\u0026#8217;t have to take anybody. They can say, \u0026#8220;Out, you get.\u0026#8221; So we\u0026#8217;re going to be essentially using, to a large extent, the very powerful immigration laws of Mexico.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Mexico wants to do a good job. They\u0026#8217;re moving 6,000 soldiers to their southern border. Do you think they agreed to do that before? And they\u0026#8217;re paying them. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0026#8217;re moving 6,000 soldiers to their southern border. That means that people from Guatemala, the people from Honduras and El Salvador, in theory, if they do it right, they\u0026#8217;re not going to be able to get through. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNobody\u0026#8217;s going to be able to get through.

Is Trump right that this was a major win for him?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAna Quintana: \u003c/strong\u003eI think this new deal with Mexico is a huge deal. It\u0026#8217;s a pretty big win. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI think it\u0026#8217;s significant what the Mexicans have agreed to do. Time will tell if they actually fulfill their obligations and they actually have the capacity to do so. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut they actually now have a timeline by which they need to deliver. They have measurable outcomes they need to achieve. So yeah, this is big.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTrinko: And for our listeners who haven\u0026#8217;t been following this as closely, what exactly did Mexico agree to?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQuintana: \u003c/strong\u003eMexico has agreed to strengthen their southern border, their border specifically with Guatemala. It\u0026#8217;s about a 600-mile-long border. They\u0026#8217;ve agreed to deploy 6,000 National Guard troops. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis National Guard is a new unit that was created by the current president back in February. And the National Guard is a fusion of army, navy, and federal law enforcement. So it\u0026#8217;s a mixed bag of Mexican security officials. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThey will now be strengthening their southern border to act as a deterrent against Central Americans crossing the border.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMexico has also agreed to deepen collaboration with the United States on countering trafficking networks inside of Mexico, specifically the trafficking networks and drug cartels that are involved with the moving of migrants and human smuggling and human trafficking. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI think that\u0026#8217;s an incredibly important point because that allows the U.S. to increase oversight, increase presence within Mexico and within Mexican government institutions to specifically look at which cartels are doing this dirty work and how better to map this threat not just in Mexico but also inside the United States and in Central America.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eA few weeks ago, also, there was an agreement to send a few hundred CBP officials to Guatemala. So that\u0026#8217;s another significant uptick in presence. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhat else has been agreed upon? Let me see because there was just so much that was done in this new agreement. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, the U.S. and Mexico have agreed that if the numbers do not significantly decline within the next 90 days, both countries will meet again to revisit this agreement and see what can be fixed. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut more broadly than that, I think you now see the Mexican government looking at the issue of illegal immigration from Central America as a national security challenge. Before, they would view it as a humanitarian issue. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI think the shift in paradigm, the shift in perspective will now enable and strengthen Mexico\u0026#8217;s resolve to really deal with this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDaniel Davis: So a week ago the Mexico\u0026#8217;s foreign minister was in D.C. saying, \u0026#8220;We\u0026#8217;re not going to obey your commands. We\u0026#8217;re not going to fold.\u0026#8221; \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBasically, they complied after it was clear that Trump was going to drop these tariffs. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you think made them do that? It kind of makes them look weak, but clearly, they thought it was worth it for them.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQuintana: \u003c/strong\u003eI don\u0026#8217;t necessarily think that [Marcelo] Ebrard, that the foreign minister said that. \u0026#8230;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWith the U.S. media with the way that things are being translated—I think what Ebrard was saying was that the tariffs were being put on the table and that they wanted to come to negotiate in peace. And this is Mexican typical diplomatic speak, right? \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you look at this from a Google translate perspective, which is what The New York Times and others have been doing, you\u0026#8217;re going to misinterpret, you\u0026#8217;re going to lose a lot of meaning rather. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo Ebrard and other Cabinet-level officials from Mexico spent all of last week inside of the United States negotiating. It was a high-level summit. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut I don\u0026#8217;t necessarily think that it makes the Mexicans look weak. I think is that it finally gets Mexico to highlight a few inconsistencies and hypocrisy within their own policy. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eCentral American migration through Mexico, even though it ends up in the United States, Mexico by not deterring it is facilitating it and they\u0026#8217;re creating problems for the United States. So if they actually want to be a partner to America, they need to stop it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTrinko: And do you think the threat of tariffs is what drove this agreement to come into place?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQuintana:\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0026#8217;m not a fan of using tariffs. \u0026#8230; The use of tariffs, the use of an economic penalty for a noneconomic issue, particularly with a country like Mexico that is a partner country, it\u0026#8217;s unwise long term. But I think something pretty significant was achieved. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I got to give the president credit on the fact that he was able to pull this off because, frankly, I don\u0026#8217;t see many other tools in the U.S.\u0026#8217; toolkit that really could have achieved this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDavis: The New York Times reported over the weekend:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cblockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe deal to avert tariffs that President Trump announced with great fanfare on Friday night consists largely of actions that Mexico had already promised to take in prior discussions with United States over the past several months, according to officials from both countries who are familiar with the negotiations.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePresident Trump took issue with that and he tweeted: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cblockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhen will the Failing New York Times admit that their front page story on the New Mexico deal at the Border is a FRAUD and nothing more than a badly reported \u0026#8216;hit job\u0026#8217; on me, since that has been going on since the first day I announced for the presidency! \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, Ana, is The New York Times correct that Mexico had already committed to do this and that Trump is just claiming victory?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQuintana: \u003c/strong\u003eNo. \u0026#8230; One point that I forgot to bring up was the expansion of the \u0026#8220;Remain in Mexico\u0026#8221; policy where Mexico will agree to hold more Central Americans that are applying for asylum in the United States. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo there are small elements of previous agreements that are now a component of this new agreement. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut again, this goes back to The New York Times not having people on their staff that speak Spanish because within that article there are many factual errors.

There\u0026#8217;s just blatant lies. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so no. I think this is a significant escalation, this is an exponential increase in cooperation between both countries and Mexico\u0026#8217;s willingness to do more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTrinko: So Mexico, they came out on Monday, they\u0026#8217;re planning to evaluate whether this worked.

What do you think?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQuintana: \u003c/strong\u003eYes. \u0026#8230; If you are part of a trafficking network, it\u0026#8217;s your job to bring people across the border illegally from Mexico to Guatemala, right? \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis border is 500 miles, almost 600 miles of jungle. There\u0026#8217;s barely any military or government presence there. There\u0026#8217;s barely any presence there from the Guatemalan side and now you hear there\u0026#8217;s going to be 6,000 new troops there at the border making sure people don\u0026#8217;t cross. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026#8217;s a deterrent factor, right? \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you now know that the Mexican government and the U.S. are increasing collaboration and mapping out these trafficking networks and undercutting their illicit financing mechanisms and undercutting so many of the other kind of factors and conditions that allow these people to thrive. Yeah, this is going to do a lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAre we going to see an immediate decline? I think it\u0026#8217;s going to take some time. I don\u0026#8217;t necessarily think 45 days is a sufficient window.

I think when people think of Hong Kong nowadays, a lot of folks think, \u0026#8220;Hong Kong, China.\u0026#8221; Why is it such a big deal that Hong Kong residents could be extradited to the mainland?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGonzalez:\u003c/strong\u003e Hong Kong has a special status, and Hong Kong was promised this special status. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHong Kong was actually created by the British in the very sad circumstances of the 1840s because of the Opium War, but then it became a very successful place. It was a British colony until 1997 when it was handed over to China. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo China promised [Prime Minister] Margaret Thatcher during the negotiations in the 1980s that it would respect Hong Kong\u0026#8217;s special status, and would respect Hong Kong\u0026#8217;s way of life and the liberties of the people of Hong Kong for 50 years after the handover. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis idea of extraditing people to\nChina, where you don\u0026#8217;t have the rule of law—in Hong Kong you do have the rule\nof law—is obviously a violation of that promise, and the people of Hong Kong\njust completely reject this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDavis: So, 50 years, that’s supposed to be from 1997 to 2047?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGonzalez:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, 2047, and until then it\u0026#8217;s supposed to be “one country, two systems.” Hong Kong will keep its way of life, its capitalist economy, its freedoms. They have the rule of law. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eA trial in Hong Kong is a legitimate thing. It\u0026#8217;s not like a kangaroo court as it is in China. So nobody wants to be tried in a Chinese court in mainland China, whereas Hong Kong, the 7 million people who live in Hong Kong, expect a fair trial. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026#8217;s the reason why they don\u0026#8217;t want to be kidnapped. Basically, that\u0026#8217;s what it would be, being kidnapped out of the lobby of the Mandarin Oriental in downtown Hong Kong and sent over to China to the tender mercies of the Chinese Communist Party, which is the equivalent of medieval Europe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDavis: Well, we\u0026#8217;ve seen this in other contexts where China will make a deal, but then try to get away with as much as it can despite that deal. What mechanism is there for enforcing this?

If you put your name on something, if you\u0026#8217;ve given your word—and now it\u0026#8217;s an international treaty entered into the United Nations—it\u0026#8217;s between the United Kingdom and the People\u0026#8217;s Republic of China. So, China gave its word, and now it is going back on it. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow, there\u0026#8217;s a pretense. Carrie Lam, the chief executive [of Hong Kong], which is the equivalent of governor—under China they don\u0026#8217;t have a governor, they have a chief executive—but none of the chief executives under Chinese rule since 1997 have been freely chosen … by the people of Hong Kong in a free election. They have been chosen by a committee handpicked by Beijing. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe current chief executive is Carrie Lam. She says that, A, she\u0026#8217;s doing this with \u0026#8230; and it\u0026#8217;s not been ordered by China to do this, and, B, she\u0026#8217;s doing this also because she doesn\u0026#8217;t want Hong Kong to become a place for fugitives. None of these two assertions pass the laugh test.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is clear that if she\u0026#8217;s doing this on her own. Then you have to ask why a Hong Kong person would be consigning her 7 million compatriots to the unruly, ruled-by-fiat, kangaroo courts of the PRC, of the People\u0026#8217;s Republic of China. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd, B, nobody thinks that Hong Kong is going to become a haven for international fugitives. It hasn\u0026#8217;t become one till now. Why would it now all of a sudden become a \u0026#8230; on the contrary, Hong Kong truly \u0026#8230; there\u0026#8217;s very little or no corruption in Hong Kong. They have a very good record on this. There\u0026#8217;s no administrative corruption. It\u0026#8217;s like Singapore in that sense \u0026#8230; but whereas in China, businesses have to pay protection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eImagine, let me pause at a scenario here, an American businessman whose partner in China is demanding outlandish intellectual sharing or outlandish payments, does not want to pay and goes to Hong Kong, and all of a sudden he\u0026#8217;s going to be grabbed out of Hong Kong and sent to China to be tried. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOr an American journalist, who\u0026#8217;s reporting freely in Hong Kong, all of a sudden is going to be sent to mainland China. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn mainland China, \u0026#8220;libel,\u0026#8221; quote-unquote, is an imprisonable offense, and libel could be anything. Any criticism of the Chinese Communist Party or China\u0026#8217;s unelected leaders or of Chinese businesses, any criticism could be termed \u0026#8230; it could be considered libel. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then all of a sudden an American journalist who\u0026#8217;s writing for The New York Times or for whomever is sent to China to be tried for this.

Hong Kong has LegCo, the Legislative Council, [which] is divided between a group that is freely elected and a majority that is elected by, quote-unquote, \u0026#8220;functional constituencies.\u0026#8221; \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat means, for example, that fishermen, of whom there\u0026#8217;s a teeny-tiny portion of the Hong Kong people are fishermen to this day \u0026#8230; it started out as a fishing colony, but very few people are \u0026#8230; but the fishermen have functional representatives in Hong Kong. The lawyers have functional representatives. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMany of these are controlled by China, so of the people who are freely elected, nearly all of them, if not all of them, want democracy and want to continue to have Hong Kong\u0026#8217;s way of life. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHong Kong\u0026#8217;s opposition completely overwhelms the section of LegCo that is freely elected.

That is all to its credit, but it also cares about the things that contribute to business success, which is freedom of speech, freedom of actions, freedom of conscience, all these natural rights that China just plainly does not respect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTrinko: You spent many years in Hong Kong.

But that\u0026#8217;s not really 1 out of 7 because the grannies who don’t demonstrate … this is a very long march, the children could not do it, so this is really, perhaps, half of the city. Half of the city that can take to the streets, taking to the streets. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThese are bankers. These are street sweepers. These are teachers. These are union members.

Virginia\u0026#8217;s House of Delegates is so rigidly gerrymandered to benefit Republicans that Democratic candidates won the statewide popular vote by \u003ca href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/the-virginia-wave-would-have-been-so-much-worse-for-republicans-if-it-wasnt-for-gerrymandering-9e4259dae69b/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003emore than 9 percentage points in 2017\u003c/a\u003e, yet Republicans kept a narrow majority in the statehouse. In Wisconsin, Democratic candidates won 54% of the popular vote in the 2018 state assembly races, yet Republicans \u003ca href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/wisconsin-skewed-2018-results-anthony-kennedy-98060a6a19e9/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003econtrol an astounding 63%\u003c/a\u003e of the assembly seats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThus, unless Democrats win the states of Virginia and Wisconsin in a crushing tidal wave that washes Republicans into the sea, the GOP will likely control the Virginia House of Delegates and the Wisconsin state assembly in 2020, when new maps must be drawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut early polling data suggests that such a wave is possible in 2020, as under-performing presidential candidates tend to drag down their entire party. And if 2020 is a recession year, a Democratic wave might be inevitable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUp until this point, the Supreme Court\u0026#8217;s Republicans have been quite hostile to partisan gerrymandering challenges \u0026#8212; although, oddly enough, Brett Kavanaugh appeared \u003ca href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/supreme-court-kavanaugh-kagan-nations-worst-gerrymanders-643fc7d62132/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003emore open to these challenges\u003c/a\u003e than his four Republican colleagues during oral arguments last March. The smart money suggests that the court will split 5-4 along party lines, quite possibly holding that federal courts aren\u0026#8217;t even allowed to consider partisan gerrymandering cases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat would be the wrong answer under the law \u0026#8212; the First Amendment \u003ca href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/supreme-court-takes-on-gerrymandering-56f545f8ca02/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eprohibits viewpoint discrimination\u003c/a\u003e, and gerrymandering is a way of discriminating against voters based on their support for one party or the other. But it\u0026#8217;s easy to see why Republicans would want such a result. After all, Republicans walloped Democrats in 2010, the last redistricting year. And, if 2020 is an ordinary election, Republicans are likely to emerge from it well-positioned to keep their gerrymanders in place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut if 2020 is a Democratic wave election, Kavanaugh and his fellow partisans may come to regret taking partisan gerrymandering challenges off the table. After ten years of watching Republicans win elections regardless of what the voters preferred, Democrats are not likely to be in a conciliatory mood in 2020. If they trounce the GOP, Democrats will undoubtedly use their new legislative power to draw the most spiteful, meticulously gerrymandered maps the nation has ever seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, it is likely that any Republican on the Supreme Court could prevent such an outcome by joining with their Democratic colleagues to declare partisan gerrymandering unconstitutional.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eThe death of neutrality\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe flip-side of this argument is that it is an open question whether Democrats should want this Supreme Court to hand down a decision striking down gerrymandering. That\u0026#8217;s not just because Democrats may stand to unfairly benefit from gerrymandering, but because a Republican Supreme Court could potentially apply an anti-gerrymandering precedent selectively to benefit the GOP.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When, in writing for the majority of the Court, I adopt a general rule, and say, ‘This is the basis of our decision,’” the late Justice Antonin Scalia once warned, “\u003ca href=\"https://cyber.harvard.edu/bridge/Philosophy/rollor.txt.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eI not only constrain lower courts, I constrain myself as well\u003c/a\u003e.” That\u0026#8217;s because “if the next case should have such different facts that my political or policy preferences regarding the outcome are quite the opposite, I will be unable to indulge those preferences.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026#8217;s an accurate description of how judges \u003cem\u003eshould \u003c/em\u003ebehave, but it\u0026#8217;s hardly an accurate description of how this Supreme Court does behave.

Aqueous film forming foams (AFFF) used in fighting fires of flammable liquids or flammable gases, oils, solvents and alcohols can containsodiumalkyl sulfate, fluorotelomers, perfluorooctanoicacid(PFOA) or perfluorooctanesulfonicacid(PFOS).\\nThe United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is expected to release updates on tests of per- and polyfuoroalkyl substances or PFAs pollution in public water supplies for 16 million Americans in 33 states, including Pennsylvania. The federal report is delayed due to January 2019 shutdown. Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick, Republican of Bucks County in Eastern Pennsylvania and Democrat Dan Kildee, of Michigan cochair a bipartisan task force in the House of Representatives, formed to take on the growingPFAS ContaminationCrisis. The usage of foam at nearby former military bases is linked to tainted drinking water, affecting tens of thousands of residents in Bucks and Montgomery Counties in Eastern Pennsylvania.

Rowhammer attacks work by rapidly accessing—or hammering—physical rows inside vulnerable chips in ways that cause bits in neighboring rows to flip, meaning 1s turn to 0s and vice versa. The attacks work because as capacitors become closer together, they more quickly leak the electrical charges that store the bits. At one time, these bit flips were little more than an exotic crashing phenomenon that was known to be triggered only by cosmic rays. But when induced with surgical precision, as researchers have demonstrated over the past four years, Rowhammer can have potentially serious effects on the security of the devices that use the vulnerable chips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eA new side channel\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRAMBleed takes Rowhammer in a new direction. Rather than using bit flips to alter sensitive data, the new technique exploits the hardware bug to extract sensitive data stored in memory regions that are off-limits to attackers. The attacks require only that the exploit hammers memory locations the exploit code already has permission to access. What's more, the data extraction can work even when DRAM protected by \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECC_memory\"\u003eerror correcting code\u003c/a\u003e detects and reverses a malicious bit flip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1520383#p3\"\u003eRead 22 remaining paragraphs\u003c/a\u003e | \u003ca href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1520383\u0026comments=1\"\u003eComments\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"feedflare\"\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=5ab_RrOBlOI:p8BKCkmjwJM:V_sGLiPBpWU\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=5ab_RrOBlOI:p8BKCkmjwJM:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=5ab_RrOBlOI:p8BKCkmjwJM:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=5ab_RrOBlOI:p8BKCkmjwJM:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=5ab_RrOBlOI:p8BKCkmjwJM:qj6IDK7rITs\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=5ab_RrOBlOI:p8BKCkmjwJM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","url":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1520383","published":"2019-06-11T17:00:46Z","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1520383"},{"title":"Switch Zelda sequel, Animal Crossing headline Nintendo’s E3 event","content":"\u003cdiv id=\"rss-wrap\"\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ca name=\"page-1\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n      \u003cul class=\"gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide\"\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n        \u003cdiv class=\"gallery-item-content\"\u003e  \n        \u003cdiv class=\"gallery-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screenshot-2026-980x653.png\" alt=\"\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n        \u003cp\u003e\n          Zelda's dominance in this trailer may hint to her inclusion as a playable character, if not an outright two-player mode, but Nintendo did not offer \u003cem\u003eany\u003c/em\u003e gameplay details in this reveal.                  \u003c/p\u003e\n        \u003c/div\u003e\n      \u003c/li\u003e\n      \u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLOS ANGELES—Nintendo announced during a Nintendo Direct presentation Tuesday morning that a sequel to \u003ca href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/03/refreshing-new-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-is-an-instant-classic/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e is now in development. No release date or target window was announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA short teaser trailer for the game showed Zelda and Link exploring a dark cave together, lit only by torchlight, in an art style that seemed extremely similar to the \u003cem\u003eBreath of the Wild\u003c/em\u003e engine.

A new study takes a careful look at bat aging and finds, at a time when most species are shutting down genes that help keep cells and tissues healthy, bats are cranking them up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eMini-Methuselahs\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo an extent, bats have an advantage, in that flight selects for minimizing body weight. But even by that standard, some bat species are extraordinarily long-lived. The Irish-French team behind the new study notes that a species called Brandt's bat weighs only about seven grams, yet lives for over 40 years in the wild. There have been some hints as to how they manage this exceptional aging. For example, bats maintain the ends of their chromosomes, preventing cells from slipping into senescence, yet they do this while managing to keep cells from growing out of control and turning cancerous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1520279#p3\"\u003eRead 9 remaining paragraphs\u003c/a\u003e | \u003ca href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1520279\u0026comments=1\"\u003eComments\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"feedflare\"\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=rjsNwPVy66U:qIN1MamP1TQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=rjsNwPVy66U:qIN1MamP1TQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=rjsNwPVy66U:qIN1MamP1TQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=rjsNwPVy66U:qIN1MamP1TQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=rjsNwPVy66U:qIN1MamP1TQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=rjsNwPVy66U:qIN1MamP1TQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","url":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1520279","published":"2019-06-11T13:31:56Z","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1520279"},{"title":"Where will the world’s first autonomous rocket factory be built?

The PlayStation 4-exclusive JRPG will launch on March 3, 2020.

The latter will only activate once players have built up enough of their fighters' ATB meters, which grow as players pull off more successful weapon swipes and dodges.

One of her ATB special attacks, a flurry of punches followed by a flashy bicycle kick, fit in nicely with Cloud's barrage of sword swipes within a Japanese kanji character, a massive lighting-ball blast from Barret's machine gun, and a green, particle-filled explosion of healing power from Aerith. Barret's standard attacks will largely revolve around gun shots, not melee swipes, so he will be able to control real-time combat from a distance—and that likely means other popular \u003cem\u003eFFVII\u003c/em\u003e characters will work the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1519979#p3\"\u003eRead 8 remaining paragraphs\u003c/a\u003e | \u003ca href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1519979\u0026comments=1\"\u003eComments\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"feedflare\"\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=kMcEAeChyVs:7yYFS_NNhGg:V_sGLiPBpWU\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=kMcEAeChyVs:7yYFS_NNhGg:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=kMcEAeChyVs:7yYFS_NNhGg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=kMcEAeChyVs:7yYFS_NNhGg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=kMcEAeChyVs:7yYFS_NNhGg:qj6IDK7rITs\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=kMcEAeChyVs:7yYFS_NNhGg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","url":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1519979","published":"2019-06-11T02:20:45Z","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1519979"},{"title":"Microsoft working to get “every single Xbox One game” working on Scarlett","content":"\u003cdiv id=\"rss-wrap\"\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ca name=\"page-1\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"video\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"wrapper\" style=\"display:block\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HDhh8jy1YQI?start=0\u0026amp;wmode=transparent\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLOS ANGELES—When Microsoft announced \u003ca href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/06/microsoft-reveals-first-details-on-project-scarlett-game-console-for-2020/\"\u003ethe first details of its next game console\u003c/a\u003e Sunday, it said that \"thousands of games across four console generations will look and play best on Project Scarlett.\" In \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDhh8jy1YQI\"\u003ea video follow-up focused on backward compatibility\u003c/a\u003e posted Monday, the company clarified that its goal is that \"every single game you play on Xbox One today [will] work on the Scarlett device.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat would be a change from previous Xbox console generations, which have only supported \u003ca href=\"https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/backward-compatibility\"\u003ea significant subset of previous generations' titles\u003c/a\u003e through software updates.

At 1080p and 60 fps, \u003cem\u003eDoom Eternal \u003c/em\u003eworked pretty much flawlessly, and I played it using Google’s custom Stadia controller that comes bundled with its Founder’s Edition for $130 (with a Chromecast Ultra and three months of service) or sold separately for $69. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ceR6Tv\"\u003eFor me, the experience was quite impressive. I could not detect any noticeable input lag, and there was no discernible on-screen effects indicating the visuals were being streamed from a cloud server to the Pixelbook, and then from the Pixelbook to the Samsung TV. Granted, I wasn’t playing an online game, so there’s no telling what types of latency issues you might run into there. But had you not told me I was playing a \u003cem\u003eDoom Eternal\u003c/em\u003e streamed over the internet, I wouldn’t have been able to tell. \u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\"Google Makes Gaming Announcement During Keynote At Gaming Industry Conference GDC\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RAfEkdu--2DV_nt9YcJ6-1NCDvI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16333701/1136866758.jpg.jpg\"\u003e\n      \u003ccite\u003ePhoto by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\u003c/cite\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"GmkYC3\"\u003eNow, there were a couple issues I encountered. At one point, my Stadia stream stopped receiving inputs from the Stadia controller, leaving my unfortunate \u003cem\u003eDoom Eternal \u003c/em\u003echaracter squashed up against a wall while I got pounded on by angry demons. Instead of rebooting the stream, we just waited for my character to die, unplugged the controller, and re-synced it. I was good to go again in about two to three minutes. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Z2xFGv\"\u003eAt another point about 25 minutes into the demo, the stream did crash. There was no telling what the culprit was; Google says the platform is about six months out from launch, so it’s reasonable to expect some issues while it irons out these kinks. That said, we were up and running again in less a minute after simply reloading the Chrome browser window and resuming full-screen mode. I only lost progress after my most recent checkpoint, but a crash like that could be much more annoying for online games\u003cem\u003e \u003c/em\u003elike Bungie’s \u003cem\u003eDestiny 2\u003c/em\u003e, which right now is the only title confirmed to come bundled with Stadia’s $10 per month Pro subscription. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-float-left\"\u003e\u003caside id=\"8Eij3e\"\u003e\u003cq\u003eMy Stadia stream was blazing fast, but I did experience a crash\u003c/q\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Eu8eG5\"\u003eThose speed bumps aside, my Stadia experience felt no different than using an at-home console, and that’s the point.

For \u003cem\u003eDoom Eternal\u003c/em\u003e, the loading times were speedy, and being able to reboot the game from a crash as quickly as we did is strong evidence of the sizable jump in processing power you can access with a cloud service like this. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"t3w5Bf\"\u003eI can see a point at which Stadia really is delivering a next-gen experience through devices as varied as Chromebooks and Mac laptops to Pixel phones and Chromecast-equipped TVs. We’re not there yet, of course. Stadia has its bugs as I experienced firsthand, and there’s no telling whether Google’s proposed business model of a free platform with subscriptions built on top of it will take off. Most gamers may still want to buy full titles outright, and Stadia will likely be one of the last places most existing Xbox, PS4, or PC fans will want to do that, so long as the selection remains limited and the player populations of big online games remain tiny. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"v1S30y\"\u003eBut from a technical perspective, Stadia feels like its approaching prime time.

One of the most common is that the training data used to create algorithms often reflects the life and background of the engineers responsible. As these individuals are often white men from high-income countries, so too is the world they teach their programs to identify. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"h1lIUf\"\u003eOne of the most well-known examples of AI bias is with \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/11/17001218/facial-recognition-software-accuracy-technology-mit-white-men-black-women-error\"\u003efacial recognition algorithms\u003c/a\u003e, which regularly perform worse when identifying female faces, particularly women of color.

This might mean entire categories of items are missing or that the same items simply look different in different countries.

Well, for a start, it means that any system created using these algorithms is going to perform worse for people from lower-income and non-Western countries.

We talked a bit about the future of consoles, the importance of the cloud, the impending ubiquity of subscription services, and why he doesn’t care what kind of Xbox you buy. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"1M9BsV\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"jiWc1L\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWith Scarlett, can you talk a bit about the strategy of announcing a console so early? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/13/11890842/microsoft-xbox-project-scorpio-virtual-reality-e3-2016\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIt reminds me a lot of Scorpio\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e. Was there something about the experience with Scorpio that made you think, “This is how we should do it”?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"YrGp7j\"\u003eI definitely think doing the announcement of Project Scorpio 18 months-ish before we launched X was good learning and background for us this year. I think that’s definitely true. I think that gave us some confidence that we could keep buzz. We also know that we’re going to have dev kits out, developers building games, and I’d rather not have to pretend that something is not happening when everybody knows it is happening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ob9uUr\"\u003eSo it puts you in this position of people asking you, “What’s the name?” and I say, “We don’t have the name yet.” They ask me about price points and everything else, so you’re in this position of talking about the things that you set. Most importantly, you’re going to talk about what your goals are for the platform. Give people something to look to, so when they hear there’s a game in development that’s launching at a certain date, is it going to support X? And I think our experience with Scorpio gave us the confidence to talk about Scarlett on Sunday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"nqx8oO\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Xbox One X came out not that long ago, and you call it the most powerful console. How do you know when to release something that’s even more powerful? It’s not a huge gap in time between the two.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"7WzYtF\"\u003eWe did the same thing with X where we set a design goal for ourselves. In the case of X, it was about a 4K console. We looked at: could we do a 4K console a year earlier? We didn’t think we could. So we waited a year after the competitors did their thing because we felt we could give a true 4K console with the Xbox One X. I think the end result is a device that, if a developer so chooses, they can do so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-float-right c-float-hang\"\u003e\u003caside id=\"YQa8Dr\"\u003e\u003cq\u003e“I’d rather not have to pretend that something is not happening.”\u003c/q\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"WKuFHo\"\u003eWith Scarlett, our goal was to increase the visual fidelity of the games. But equally or even more over what we have today was the feel of the games. Can we really start to get to frame rates where the visuals that are great on-screen are matched by the way the game feels and how smooth it plays? Which was really looking at CPU performance and the growth in CPU and what we could put in. Traditionally, consoles have been heavy GPU, very light CPU. So we were working with AMD on technologies and what their CPU road map looked like. You can see this on X and even S, experimenting with variable refresh rates. So much of your refresh rate, your game loop, and having this synchronization between those things really helps create buttery controls in a game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"EtsLID\"\u003eWorking with AMD, we were able to hit CPU, memory, bandwidth, and even SSD that was going to allow us to stream data fast enough to get to frame rates where we felt like the increased visual fidelity would be matched by the feel that we would be able to bring. And that was a design goal that we set for ourselves with Scarlett.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"dPHHlW\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo is Scarlett one console? Or is it like the Xbox One where you have a high-end, a middle class, and a cheaper one?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"MRLKvn\"\u003eThe video that we showed is talking about Project Scarlett. That’s the focus that we have, on that console and hitting that specification. That’s the console that we’re talking about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-wide-block\"\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"hE20Ga\"\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"\u003e\u003ciframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-ktN4bycj9s?rel=0\" style=\"border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Gs8Hnu\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRight now, there are only a few variations of the Xbox One, and now Scarlett is coming. As you have more of these devices, does it make it harder to hit your goal of having games that work across everything?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Hx11Yp\"\u003eNot really. If you think about games that are in development today, most of the studios out there are using engines that span multiple platforms, whether it’s Unreal or Unity. Many of the games are using engines that are on multiple platforms. You’re probably shipping your game on four or five platforms if you’re trying to reach as many customers as possible anyway. You’re going to ship on PC, which means multiple GPUs. You’re obviously going to ship on PlayStation, you’re going to ship on Xbox, you’re going to ship on Switch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"9VBQPG\"\u003eSo I think the developer pipeline today has figured out how to build highly immersive, great games on different specs and different platforms. Frankly, the highest fidelity game that we usually find today is on PC, which is the most variable of platforms. But when you think about buying a greatly tuned game on PC, it usually has more resolution options and more frame rate options than any other ecosystem. It’s the ecosystem that has the most CPU and GPU options than anything. This has just become a skill that studios have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"NVrYw8\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo you don’t see it as being similar to smartphones where, a couple of years later, your phone can’t play new games?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"nOtx7U\"\u003eI do think — and, again, we can use PC as an example — at some point, what we find, is usually driven by player behavior. You end up with a platform that doesn’t have enough activity on it for developers to focus on it because there aren’t enough players there. It’s really a business decision. I was looking at the stats last week, and we still have millions of players on Xbox 360 — which is surprising to me, but they’re still playing. They log in, they play \u003cem\u003eWorld of Tanks. \u003c/em\u003eThey love it. You don’t find any new games coming to 360 anymore. It’s not like the developer community is still there, but we like that people still love to play. As long as you’re playing, I’m happy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-float-right c-float-hang\"\u003e\u003caside id=\"usD3BW\"\u003e\u003cq\u003e“As long as you’re playing, I’m happy.”\u003c/q\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"70XsRi\"\u003eWhen I think about where platforms go, I think, at some point, platforms lose enough player interest that studios will probably move on. But I’d rather not have that dictated by decisions that we make. I’d rather that be driven by player behavior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"fwcPnM\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDo you think you can release these too quickly? If the Xbox One X is the most powerful console, and then, two years later, there’s a \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003enew\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e more powerful console, doesn’t that diminish what that means?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"fUzaz4\"\u003eWhat I want you to think about in this is the players, not the specific version of a console they have. I think the question there is, “Is there a customer for the highest performing console, and are there enough customers where that makes sense?” If somebody bought an Xbox One X yesterday, I want them to feel completely that they can have a great experience for years and years. I also want to be as transparent as I can with them about the road map. So if somebody is sitting on the original Xbox One now, and they’re thinking about an X, they can make their own decision about what platform they want to have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"7oyjNn\"\u003eI don’t need to sell any specific version of the console in order for us to reach our business goals. The business isn’t how many consoles you sell. The business is how many players are playing the games that they buy, how they play. So if somebody bought an original Xbox One from us on launch day, and they’re buying and playing games, I don’t need to sell them an S. I don’t need to sell them an X. If they want to stay on the Xbox One they have and stay as a great member of our community or subscribe to Game Pass, that’s a great business for us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"acQu3D\"\u003eI think it’s easy from the outside to judge the health of our business around how many consoles any company sells. In the end, how many subscribers you have to something like Game Pass, how many games people are buying, those are much better metrics on the health of the business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-wide-block\"\u003e  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Rpg2au6eyj8Pzd6OyhmA-J2WsEE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16328957/microsoft_xbox_e3_2019_4.jpg\"\u003e\n      \u003ccite\u003ePhoto by Nick Statt / The Verge\u003c/cite\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"e2gP3Y\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCan you explain in simple terms what xCloud is? There seems to be some confusion around it and how it’s split into different parts with streaming and Remote Play-like functionality.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"F8kTtM\"\u003eThere are two things we’ll talk about: console streaming and xCloud. xCloud is us putting Xbox motherboards, in an Azure data center, and allowing you to connect to those motherboards and play games on hardware that is ours. So if you don’t own an Xbox or your Xbox isn’t available, you can connect to xCloud and play those games. xCloud is us putting Xboxes in the cloud, and you’re accessing those through a phone, which is our first focus. That allows you to take the gaming experience wherever you are. That’s xCloud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"26kxAJ\"\u003eNow if you already own an Xbox One, you’ve already effectively bought the same hardware that we’re putting in the cloud. So we challenged ourselves and said, “Well, can we allow you to turn your Xbox into your own data center, your own xCloud.” So then you can stream the games you own from the console that you already bought to your phone for free. So that’s what console streaming is. It is streaming from your console out of your home, the games that you own to your phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"a45xMw\"\u003eIn the end, how you play is going to be the same. You’re going to be sitting there on a phone, you’re going to have a controller in your hand, and you’ll be able to play those games. Console streaming means the source of those games is your Xbox at home; for xCloud, the source of those games is us. The end user experience, I want to be the same. I want to connect to Xbox Live, the games that I have access to, my friends, and I want to play wherever I go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"eMhWqH\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo game streaming is free... \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Z21V2A\"\u003eYes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"qC1peC\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd xCloud is a subscription?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"McnJGD\"\u003eWe haven’t talked about the business model yet. We’re here with the public preview to let people try it out, which is cool. It’s the first time we’ve had a hands-on for people who don’t work at Microsoft, so we’re learning a lot and listening a lot. We announced a date for when it’s coming, and we will be talking about a business model before it comes so people know what to do to sign up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-float-right c-float-hang\"\u003e\u003caside id=\"iwtQOp\"\u003e\u003cq\u003e“I do think the idea of Game Pass and an xCloud-like subscription makes a ton of sense.”\u003c/q\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"wPNZ6R\"\u003eAs you think about a subscription like Game Pass, I do think the idea of Game Pass and an xCloud-like subscription makes a ton of sense. Think about what the convergence of those two things looks like. I think it’s smart to think about. We haven’t announced anything there, but I’d say that idea makes a ton of sense. How do I build my library? Game Pass is a great way for you to secure a bunch of content. Then, how do I get access to that library wherever I go? Do I use hardware that’s Microsoft’s or hardware that’s my own in my home?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"efRxtD\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI’m mostly curious about the subscription idea because it feels like, and not just in games, there’s now an overwhelming number of content subscriptions either out there now or coming soon. You just announced Game Pass on PC, Ubisoft announced its subscription service. How do you think about that when you’re creating these services?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ZRaMpr\"\u003eI think you will find that the things that get to scale and offer the most value early will be the long-term players. I don’t think there’s one, but I also don’t think there are 100 different subscriptions [that will be successful]. One of the reasons we launched Game Pass two years ago, and we now have millions of subscribers, is we grow that so that we are getting great games, so that, as creators, you look at this community of people playing and say, “If I put my game on to Game Pass, I instantly know that millions of people will be able to play it.” As it rises in popularity on streaming sites and on things like Xbox Live, it’s going to get more exposure and more people will go buy the game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-float-right c-float-hang\"\u003e\u003caside id=\"f8vuSs\"\u003e\u003cq\u003e“We’re uniquely positioned.”\u003c/q\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"La05eo\"\u003eI agree with you. I don’t think we’re going to end up with 100 successful subscriptions out there. I think, as a platform holder, we’re in a unique position where we can offer a subscription like Game Pass Ultimate that gives you access to both Xbox Live Gold and Game Pass on PC and console. So for one subscription, you’ve effectively built your library on console and PC. And we think, as Microsoft, as Xbox, we’re uniquely positioned to do that since we are the Xbox company and Windows company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"EKXUM0\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo xCloud sounds like a pretty big deal for you, and it’s coming soon. Is there a reason it was such a small part of your E3 presentation?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ErgRUr\"\u003eIt was more about showing than telling on this one. I can do fancy videos or something, or I could just put it on the show floor and let thousands of people try it and then write what they feel. It’s a hard thing because the skepticism is: “How is it going to feel to play these games streamed from a data center?” How a game feels is a difficult thing for me to portray onstage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Me39MN\"\u003eI will also say, others out there might be trying to tell you that streaming is the solution to all gaming ills today. We look at xCloud as a long-term solution. Today, it’s really going to be: when you’re not in front of your console or Windows PC and you want to play those games, it gives you the ability and freedom to play games when you’re away. It’s really about choice and convenience. It’s not about replacing what you do today. I don’t need to create more hype around what it is. I’d rather just put it in your hands and have you experience it. If it’s something that fits in your lifestyle, that’s great.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Eh8wDD\"\u003eI do think as we look at the next decade of gaming, as we think about reaching the over 2 billion people on the planet who play games, many of those people won’t be buying consoles and gaming PCs. It’s going to be an important technology. But that’s years of investment on our part to enable the infrastructure to get there. The most important thing for us is going to be listening to our customers and what they want, and not saying, “We know what you want, and here it is.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-wide-block\"\u003e  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VPS5pOSaLUpnmoioIZoY6A7_NHs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16331061/nstatt_190610_3473_0020_2.jpg\"\u003e\n      \u003ccite\u003ePhoto by Nick Statt / The Verge\u003c/cite\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"t9i9Rq\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou mentioned cloud gaming with Scarlett.

As we look to define Project Scarlett, we said we know that cloud usage is going to grow, so let’s define the core architecture and plan for this platform knowing that it’s going to be a hybrid gaming / cloud scenario where there will be millions of consoles in homes and millions of motherboards sitting in the cloud. Let’s make sure the common architecture is really built for that. The biggest strength we have in cloud today are the thousands of things that already run on that platform and the thousands in development.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"KsaCXU\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat’s your philosophy when it comes to all of the game studio acquisitions you’ve been making? A studio like Ninja Theory is going to make Xbox games no matter what, so what’s the benefit of having them under the Microsoft Game Studios umbrella?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"8Ts8uv\"\u003eWe think about the talent in a studio, the track record of a studio in building great games over time. Honestly, we think a lot about if we can add value to the studio that helps them be the best version of the studio they can be. That’s always a very good discussion with the founders and the people running the studios. Ninja Theory is a good example. They posted a video at the time of the acquisition, talking about, when you’re running a small, midsized, or really any size studio independently, you’re always doing multiple jobs. One is making games, the other is drumming up business for the next thing that’s going to happen, and then building some kind of buffer in case bad things happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-float-right c-float-hang\"\u003e\u003caside id=\"hVOYBt\"\u003e\u003cq\u003e“Having a great flow of games coming to Game Pass is really important.”\u003c/q\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"fN3rky\"\u003eWhen we can come in and provide financial stability to these studios that have a track record of creating high-quality games, give them the freedom to focus on the games that they’re creating today and in the future, and take away that need to figure out what work-for-hire work they need to do, that’s been the most liberating thing that we add to the equation. So I think we will end up with better games and better output from these studios, just from the stability that we’re able to bring.

That means that not everyone who subscribes is going to get the same videos delivered to their inbox. Under the new system — at least in theory — in order to receive notifications about every video a creator releases, people have to click subscribe, hit the golden bell icon, and ensure notifications are enabled on their account. If they don’t do this — and just hit the red subscribe button — they may not receive notifications for creators’ new videos, although all subscribed videos should still show up in the subscriptions tab. The product change is supposed to make this easier for users to understand. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"cUfKnY\"\u003eBasically YouTube is acknowledging that if you’re confused, you’re not alone. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"AA0UGk\"\u003e“Through a series of \u003ca href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7367023\"\u003etests\u003c/a\u003e and user research, we’ve found this updated name and visual design improves overall understanding of the default bell setting and makes it more clear that you won’t be notified about every new video upload,” the blog post reads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"muRd1v\"\u003eWhen YouTube’s product team first clarified why some people may not receive notifications and others might, the community had one main question — shouldn’t everyone who’s subscribed to a channel get a notification? No one really understood how notifications worked before. Research conducted by YouTube’s team discovered that people became overwhelmed by the number of notifications they were getting from subscribing to multiple channels, and turned them off completely. The new change will allow people to personalize notifications across every channel they subscribe to on YouTube. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-float-right\"\u003e\u003caside id=\"d7eaIm\"\u003e\u003cq\u003e“Sometimes we’ve dropped notifications and we haven’t delivered them, and that’s on us.”\u003c/q\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"XlQ0lp\"\u003eThe incoming change is a direct response to growing frustration among creators who claim to have suffered from \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLJQ0gFHM8s\"\u003e“subscriber ghosting.”\u003c/a\u003e There was \u003ca href=\"https://www.polygon.com/2018/3/27/17168762/subscribers-youtube-missing-videos-bell-jesse-wells\"\u003eoutcry from creators in March 2018\u003c/a\u003e, which YouTube has since responded to with incremental updates to the notification system and updates on user research that may influence further change. Creators have constantly told YouTube via Twitter that the first wave of viewers when videos go live are super important to their channel and advertising revenue. The more viewers that appear, the more ad revenue (CPM) creators can receive. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"I0Ilws\"\u003e“Sometimes we’ve dropped notifications and we haven’t delivered them, and that’s on us,” James, a member of YouTube’s notifications team, said in a video about the product change. “If you’re sending billions of these things to billions of users, even a small percentage gains can affect a lot of people.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ftEw1s\"\u003eTo speak more directly to creators, YouTube is introducing new metrics that YouTubers can use to better understand how many of their subscribers are getting notifications. One new metric will show creators how many subscribers have signed up to receive all notifications, but may not have notifications enabled on their account or device. The second metric is for people who have subscribed for all notifications, but have notifications enabled. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-float-right\"\u003e\u003caside id=\"Rr13mo\"\u003e\u003cq\u003e“If you’re sending billions of these things to billions of users, even a small percentage gains can affect a lot of people.”\u003c/q\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"JoxaCq\"\u003eCreators have started talking about the update on Twitter, and the reception is mixed. While people appreciated the transparency YouTube has showcased — something that \u003ca href=\"https://youtube-creators.googleblog.com/2019/04/addressing-creator-feedback-and-update.html\"\u003eCEO Susan Wojcicki told creators in one of her blog posts\u003c/a\u003e the company was committed to doing more of — they were frustrated because the notification system was still difficult to navigate. Others complained the update doesn’t address individual users’ subscription feeds, which was part of the problem. YouTube users have spoken about having all the right settings enabled, but still not receiving notifications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"6GiwU7\"\u003e“I think one big thing we’re pissed about is that people can subscribe twice and the default setting for that is still not ‘show me whenever this dude uploads,’” one \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/UberDanger/videos\"\u003ecreator tweeted\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"aezIjQ\"\u003eThe product changes are currently being rolled out. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"BiODry\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp

But earlier this month, the group extended its wall onto government land — without asking first for government permission.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe extension is a wall with a locking gate that has closed a federal road next to the Rio Grande, at the intersection of Mexico, Texas, and New Mexico. Beyond the gate is a storied monument celebrating binational cooperation known as Monument One. For decades, it has been visited by locals who’ve enjoyed the area as a park. A We Build the Wall supporter last week said that the only people allowed to unlock the gate would be employees of the Border Patrol, the owner of the adjacent American Eagle Brick Company, and the International Boundary and Water Commission.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe Build the Wall adviser Steve Bannon bragged last month that the private border wall, which now snakes for almost a half-mile up a mountain, had for months been planned in secret, so as not to give protesters or civil rights groups like the American Civil Liberties Union time to mount challenges. Heavy equipment started rumbling onto the property in late May, as land co-owner Jeff Allen forbade the media and the curious from getting near enough to see what was going on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen did permit a group of armed vigilantes known as the United Constitutional Patriots to freely roam his property, where they captured and harangued immigrants, and livestreamed \u003ca href=\"https://theappeal.org/border-patrol-in-new-mexico-stood-by-as-right-wing-militia-terrorized-migrants/\"\u003etheir sadistic activities\u003c/a\u003e on Facebook.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"promote-embed\" data-promo=\"immigrants\" data-crop=\"promo\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe Build the Wall’s secrecy allowed it to erect the wall without performing environmental impact studies or receiving building permits.

After nine days of waffling, the federal agency took action Monday to keep the gate open. In response, We Build the Wall has begun a bullying campaign against IBWC.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eA Sensitive, Historic Site\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn May 31, the new wall was feted on site by right-wing supporters, including anti-immigration politicians Kris Kobach and Tom Tancredo. The next day, Jim Benvie — formerly a leader of the United Constitutional Patriots vigilante group and now active in a spinoff called the Guardian Patriots — livestreamed migrants walking past the wall. They were headed into New Mexico to surrender to Border Patrol agents and request asylum. “A group of illegals just pushed across our construction site!” tweeted Brian Kolfage, founder of We Build the Wall. Benvie told his Facebook audience that We Build the Wall would soon be blocking the road that the migrants had used — the IBWC road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn June 2, according to IBWC public affairs spokesperson Lori Kuczmanski, employees working near the Rio Grande saw the extension being prepared. That afternoon, IBWC received an emailed request for a permit to block the road. The permit application was incomplete, and IBWC Commissioner Jayne Harkins told the construction company that “the gate needs to stay open.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut building began immediately. Kuczmanski said the agency asked We Build the Wall to halt construction, but the next day the construction on the gate was completed, locking the IBWC off its own land. Mike Furey, a construction foreman, told the media that Harkins had approved it. For several days thereafter, the IBWC asked We Build the Wall to keep the gate open, but it remained closed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHistorically, the IBWC has promoted binational friendship and cooperation. Founded in 1889, the agency works with its Mexican counterpart, the Comisión Internacional de Límites y Aguas, to manage irrigation and drinking water for both countries. The U.S. and Mexican commissioners meet regularly to discuss their shared stakes in the Rio Grande and Colorado and Tijuana rivers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIBWC’s management of rivers entails stewardship of the larger environment. But the potential environmental ramifications of the new wall remain unclear. With We Build the Wall failing to complete an environmental assessment, scientists and policymakers can only estimate the potential damage to the area from mudslides, erosion, and air and water pollution caused by the displacement of contaminated soil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFurey, the foreman, was quick to point out how close the new wall is to the Rio Grande. What he ignored are the risks associated with a massive build directly uphill from the American Dam, which diverts drinking and irrigation water to Mexico and West Texas farmland. According to the World Wildlife Fund, the Rio Grande is highly endangered. It suffers from over-extraction of water, pollution, and high usage. To further complicate things, the remains of the ASARCO smelter, an EPA-declared Superfund site, sit a stone’s throw from the new wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eASARCO processed lead, zinc, silver, and copper from 1887 through 1999 in El Paso. Sulfur dioxide and heavy metals billowed out of the company’s giant smokestacks, with lead and arsenic contaminating soil and groundwater throughout the area. At one point, the Centers for Disease Control found that more than half of the children living within a mile of the smelter had blood lead levels dangerously higher than the acceptable limit. The American Eagle Brick Company, site of the wall, sits less than a third of a mile from ASARCO’s former plant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2007, the Environmental Protection Agency named the American Dam site a spot of high contamination. A 2015 study demonstrated that the force of demolishing the ASARCO smokestacks enlarged the contaminated area, and found higher levels of lead in 2015 than had been recorded in 1993 and 2001. These findings suggest that bulldozing contaminated dirt releases toxins into the air and water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, thanks to We Build the Wall’s construction work, tons of dirt from the contamination zone have been bulldozed. Environmental experts agree that the dirt will make its way into the Rio Grande, although it is too early to fully assess hazardous effects. Without an environmental impact assessment, one El Paso-based hydrologist told The Intercept, the long-term repercussions are \u0026#8220;anyone\u0026#8217;s guess.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-bleed large-bleed width-auto' style='width: auto;'\u003e\n\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-article-large wp-image-254397\" src=\"https://prod01-cdn05.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/06/20190606-_DSC5809-1560188877.jpg\" alt=\"20190606-_DSC5809-1560188877\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"caption overlayed\"\u003eMonument One, which marks the boundary between the U.S. and Mexico, on June 6, 2019.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class='caption source pullright' style=''\u003ePhoto: Jordyn Rozensky/Frontera Studio\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eDecades of Community History\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe natural environment is not the only aspect of the border region that is endangered by the private wall. Border society is also an ecology. Binational human culture, people’s ease with living in and loving two countries, is seriously endangered by the increasing depredations of border militarization.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonument One, also known as International Boundary Marker No. 1, was established more than 160 years ago, before the Civil War. It defined the first surveyor’s point on the land border from New Mexico to California.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLocal historians and policymakers began lobbying for a binational park on the marker site as early as 1938, and their efforts paid off in December 1972, when a landscaped park was dedicated much to the delight of Mexican and American citizens. Two bronze plaques, one in English and one in Spanish, were placed among flowers and trees planted by community garden groups. Dignitaries from Juarez, El Paso, and Sunland Park spoke of the importance of unity over division, marveling at the shared land and pointing toward a future of continued solidarity and partnership.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn recent years, the monument has been known as a quiet piece of history. It’s famous as a unique spot to snap a photo of oneself in two countries while also enjoying the stark beauty of the high desert mountains. In the summer, Mexican families travel there after spending the afternoon splashing and fishing in the Rio Grande. On the U.S. side, hikers and naturalists have used the federal levee road to watch birds, fish, and visit Monument One.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe road partly belongs to the IBWC, but other sections are owned by George Cudahy and Jeff Allen, who are now the hosts for We Build the Wall’s construction. At least since 2017, the two have been intermittently chasing visitors off the road. On June 7, a local ACLU lawyer tried to visit the monument, but was \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/ACLUNM/status/1137132269364162560\"\u003eturned away by Allen\u003c/a\u003e amid a stream of epithets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe IBWC has been slow to challenge this private blockade. When it finally took action this week, We Build the Wall and its militia allies launched a vicious attack on the agency, using tactics similar to those they lobbed against Sunland Park.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn Monday, IBWC, accompanied by sheriff deputies, opened the gate and, according to Kuczmanski, told We Build the Wall that any tampering with the gate would be “considered trespassing and further action will be taken.” We Build the Wall reacted with outrage. The group called for the firing of Commissioner Harkins and mobilized supporters. Kolfage fulminated on his Twitter feed that the opening of the gate was due to the IBWC’s being “half owned by Mexico,” and Benvie live-streamed on Facebook that if the IBWC and the ACLU “want a war, they’ll get war.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the agency has called only for the gate to remain open – it has taken no action to tear it down. Nor has the IBWC shown regard for the surrounding community’s history.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A lot of people keep asking me and calling me,” Kuczmanski, the agency’s public affairs officer, told The Intercept. She said they are insisting that Monument One is a park. “It’s not a park,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince the wall was erected, tourists have continued to visit Monument One on the Mexico side, said Mexican police who patrol the area. But if they step too close to the wall, they are intimidated by people just over the line on the U.S. side. There have been incidents, according to Mexican authorities, of verbal harassment shouted through the slots of the bollards by construction workers and others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDays after the wall went up, congressional Rep. Veronica Escobar of El Paso spoke to the El Paso Times and condemned the wall’s hosts for “furthering this xenophobic narrative.” She called the wall “necessary fuel” for Trump’s further political ambitions. El Paso City Rep. Peter Svarzbein evoked the wounding of the binational psyche, saying that he was concerned that public access to Monument One would be interrupted. He called the monument a “federal park that highlights the best of the values, culture, and history of our community here on the border.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"shortcode\" data-shortcode=\"newsletter\" data-campaign=\"\" data-cta=\"\" data-headline=\"\" data-layout=\"\" data-subhead=\"\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, We Build the Wall promotes its multimillion-dollar structure as a model alternative to Trump’s stymied, public-works wall project. That rhetoric has seduced Democratic presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke, a border native who staunchly opposes publicly funded walls. CNN recently asked him about the wall and the people who erected it. “What you do on your private property, including building a wall, is your business,” O’Rourke \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/debbie.nathan.31/videos/vb.705307034/10156021036432035/?type=2\u0026amp;theater\u0026amp;notif_t=video_processed\u0026amp;notif_id=1560174090862\"\u003esaid\u003c/a\u003e. “Good for them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBorder residents who do know the area and hold it dear have tried to explain why few organizations so far have protested the new wall or the blocking of Monument One. Some cite safety concerns, knowing of We Build the Wall’s connection to an armed militia. Only the ACLU of New Mexico has taken action, asking the public to call and write to the IBWC. “You have a private group that is allowed to appropriate federal land to carry out a political purpose,” said director Peter Simonson. He said the ACLU is still analyzing the situation to determine its next steps. Meanwhile, the public\u0026#8217;s access to Monument One remains fraught.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA public middle school teacher, Tom Wilson, said he has hiked and bicycled the area with his family for over 30 years and is now furious and grief-stricken at the prospect of being banished from Monument One.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For a long time now,” Wilson said, “Trump’s sons of bitches have declared this area ground zero in the war on immigrants.

But is the company capable of doing so without just creating more problems?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClose observers of Veritas and Facebook, including one at a research lab that works with the social network, said the testimony shows the group is clearly violating policies against what Facebook refers to as “coordinated inauthentic behavior.” The company formally defined such behavior in a \u003ca href=\"https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/12/inside-feed-coordinated-inauthentic-behavior/\"\u003eDecember 2018 video\u003c/a\u003e featuring its cybersecurity policy chief Nathaniel Gleicher, who said it “is when groups of pages or people work together to mislead others about who they are or what they’re doing.” The designation, Gleicher added, is applied by Facebook to a group not “because of the content they’re sharing” but rather only “because of their deceptive behavior.” That is, using Facebook to \u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/womans-effort-to-infiltrate-the-washington-post-dates-back-months/2017/11/29/ce95e01a-d51e-11e7-b62d-d9345ced896d_story.html?utm_term=.bc12e8cee3b1\"\u003edupe people\u003c/a\u003e is all it takes to fit the company’s institutional definition of coordinated inauthentic behavior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn practice, “coordinated inauthentic behavior” has become a sort of catchall label for untoward meddling on Facebook, snagging everyone from Burmese military officers to Russian meme spammers. But curbing such activity has become a very public crusade for Facebook in the wake of its prominent role as a platform for the spread of disinformation, propaganda, and outright hoaxes during the 2016 presidential campaign. This past January, Gleicher \u003ca href=\"https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2019/01/removing-cib-iran/\"\u003eannounced\u003c/a\u003e the removal of coordinated inauthentic behavior from Iran, which spread when operatives “coordinated with one another and used fake accounts to misrepresent themselves,” thus triggering a Facebook ban. Similarly, in a 2017 update on Facebook’s internal investigation into Russian online propaganda efforts, the company’s then-head of security Alex Stamos \u003ca href=\"https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/09/information-operations-update/\"\u003eassured the world’s democracies\u003c/a\u003e the company was providing “technology improvements for detecting fake accounts,” including “changes to help us more efficiently detect and stop inauthentic accounts at the time they are being created.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThroughout all of this, coordinated inauthentic behavior has remained more or less synonymous with “foreign actors” and “nation-states,” the cloak-and-dagger stuff of an increasingly militarized internet filled with enemies of the Western Democracy who seek to subvert it from abroad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProject Veritas, a hybrid of an opposition research shop and a ranting YouTube channel, has taken pride in its ability to deceive since its creation in 2010.

O’Keefe has long attempted to position himself in the context of dogged, daring, traditional journalism, describing Veritas’s efforts as “investigative” reporting executed by “undercover journalists.” But his efforts are often executed by what the New Yorker has called “amateurish spies” — their efforts against the Post and Soros resembled a Three Stooges bit — and packaged with \u003ca href=\"https://www.npr.org/2011/03/14/134525412/Segments-Of-NPR-Gotcha-Video-Taken-Out-Of-Context\"\u003emendacious editing\u003c/a\u003e, duplicitous production, and outright lying, making Veritas’s audience as much a victim of its productions as the subjects. Debates over who or what is to be considered “real journalism” are almost always counterproductive and contrived, but Veritas stands out for the shamelessness with which it pursues nakedly partisan ends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is, of course, a proud tradition of undercover journalism executed unequivocally in the name of informing the public. Writers like Barbara Ehrenreich and Shane Bauer have taken jobs they were not otherwise interested in in order to reveal injustices in society\u0026#8217;s margins, and some of the most damning details of the Cambridge Analytica scandal were \u003ca href=\"https://www.channel4.com/news/exposed-undercover-secrets-of-donald-trump-data-firm-cambridge-analytica\"\u003eexposed\u003c/a\u003e by a reporter with the UK\u0026#8217;s Channel 4 posing as a foreign politician interested in the company\u0026#8217;s services. This reporting involved lying, sure — or at least the withholding of true intent, and a willingness to let others deceive themselves — but only as a means to a truthful end.

This past December, a federal judge overturned the rule. But in the course of the lawsuit, Joe Halderman, a member of the Project Veritas inner circle who was previously convicted of trying to extort late night television host David Letterman in 2010, sat for a deposition. In it, Halderman was compelled to submit to a sworn interrogation of Veritas methods. Just how does one go about duping savvy politicos and the politico-adjacent in the 21st century?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring his deposition, Halderman, Project Veritas’s self-described “executive producer,” stated under oath that the organization falsifies Facebook accounts as part of its overall strategy of deceiving the targets of its investigations. Halderman, characterizing himself as “integrally involved in [Project Veritas’s] investigations and have been since I started four years ago,” describes the work that went into setting up Robert Creamer, a Democratic operative recorded by Veritas in a 2016. That video attempted to portray Creamer as complicit in a Hillary Clinton-led campaign to violently disrupt Donald Trump\u0026#8217;s campaign events with counterprotests and engaging in counter-Trump voter fraud — both regular, unfounded talking points repeated by Trump on the campaign trail. Last year, the Wisconsin Department of Justice concluded an investigation into the videos, determining that they “reveal no evidence of election fraud,” the Associated Press reported.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut before Veritas could get Creamer on camera, they needed to make contact via a fake persona, Halderman explained.

I talked to the undercover journalist who was the person who met with Foval. We between us sort of created this story of this person. I got some business cards made. I got an e-mail. I set up an e-mail account. What else did I do?

We\u0026#8217;ve even gone so far in the past of creating LLCs, offshore bank accounts.

Army commissions new fully-digitalized armoured fighting vehicle","content":"\u003cp\u003eThe Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) has announced on 11 June that commissioned a new fully-digitalized tracked armoured fighting vehicle, called the Hunter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to a statement, commissioned today by Minister for Defence Dr Ng Eng Hen, the Hunter Armoured Fighting Vehicle (AFV) is the Singapore Army\u0026#8217;s first fully-digitalized platform and will provide greater firepower, protection, mobility and situational awareness for the Singapore Armed Forces operations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe new vehicle was developed by the Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA), in collaboration with Singapore-listed defense conglomerate Singapore Technologies Engineering and the Singapore Army. The project was announced in March 2017.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eSpeaking at the parade, Dr Ng hailed the commissioning of the Hunter as a centrepiece of the Singapore Army\u0026#8217;s transformation into the Next-Generation Army. The Hunter AFVs are tougher and more capable than the Ultra M113s they replace, enabling the Singapore Army to be a stronger, faster, smarter and more lethal advanced fighting force. Dr Ng said, \u0026#8220;The Hunter replaces the Ultra M113 but represents a significant step-up in all areas – better firepower, mobility and protection. The Hunter fleet will require less manpower to operate, but with increased potency through the use of advanced technology.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eDr Ng also said that the Hunter is the Singapore Army\u0026#8217;s first fully digitalised platform with its suite of C4 (Command, Control, Communications and Computers) systems that will enhance the Army\u0026#8217;s networked warfighting capabilities and increase its operational effectiveness. He said, \u0026#8220;The Hunter is the Singapore Army\u0026#8217;s first fully digitalised platform with C4 systems, which enables it to fight alongside other platforms in the SAF\u0026#8217;s orbat. These network synergies allow the Hunter to sense more accurately and quicker, to strike fast with deadly precision across all terrains.\u0026#8221; The design and development of the Hunter locally also attest to the professionalism and maturity of Singapore\u0026#8217;s Defence Technology Community and defence industry. \u0026#8220;The Hunter is born locally, through the collaboration between Army, the Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA) and ST Engineering. The Hunter will be bred locally too, as the core capability of Armour, replacing the Ultra M113 that many Armour soldiers use\u0026#8221;, said Dr Ng.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThis year marks the Armour Formation\u0026#8217;s golden jubilee, celebrating five decades of Armour\u0026#8217;s stellar contribution to the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF). Addressing the soldiers on parade, Dr Ng reiterated the central role of Armour to the SAF.

Except, perhaps, when it comes to the library. Here you will find no silent temple to books and knowledge; in fact, the university\u0026rsquo;s Pure Learning Library has no books at all. Instead there\u0026rsquo;s a cacophonous din of competing ideas, as students convene in animated groups around communal tables, shouting out solutions while feverishly diagramming them on the whiteboards that panel the walls. \u0026ldquo;We aren\u0026rsquo;t really encouraged to be quiet here,\u0026rdquo; explains Jeremiah Nnadi, a second year Computer Science student from Nigeria, with a shrug. \u0026ldquo;We believe that the best way to learn is from our colleagues.

When the Ghana-born, Stanford Business School-educated entrepreneur Fred Swaniker opened the Mauritius campus in 2015, he not only pledged to build 25 more like it in Africa, he also promised to produce 3 million young African leaders over the next 50 years. The first class of those leaders, made up 79 people hailing from more than 40 countries across the continent\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003e, graduate on June 12. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003c/b\u003eFor Swaniker, this graduation serves as the first milestone in an ambitious program to reinvent education for a new generation in a uniquely African context. It is also the solution to an unanticipated problem that sprung up when he first sought to disrupt African education. In 2008, Swaniker launched his African Leadership Academy in Johannesburg, recruiting high school students from across the continent and promising to prepare them for the best universities the world had to offer. But once they got into those Ivy League and European universities, they rarely came back. \u0026ldquo;I realized we were actually contributing to the brain drain,\u0026rdquo; says Swaniker. \u0026ldquo;So I said it\u0026rsquo;s time that Africa had its own Stanford and MIT and Harvard. But instead of replicating the universities that were built for another era, we should build a university that looks to the future, that educates the leaders Africa needs.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"inline-portrait_small_2x aligncenter \"\u003e\u003cimg data-attachment-id=\"5603935\" data-permalink=\"https://time.com/5603886/african-leadership-university-mauritius-fred-swaniker/time-100-gala-2019-dinner-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/fred-swaniker-time-100.jpg?quality=85\" data-orig-size=\"1024,720\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"Dimitrios Kambouris\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D4S\",\"caption\":\"NEW YORK, NEW YORK - APRIL 23: Fred Swaniker attends the TIME 100 Gala 2019 Dinner at Jazz at Lincoln Center on April 23, 2019 in New York City.

Each classroom is dedicated to a influential African leader or artist \u0026mdash; the Sankore wing, referencing one of the oldest universities in the world, in Timbuktu, Mali, features classrooms named after Ethiopian runner Haile Gebrselassie, U.N. general-secretary Boutros Boutros-Ghali and South African writer Bessie Head; the faculty lounge celebrates South African anti-apartheid activist Steve Biko. The four dormitories are dedicated to the great African civilizations, such as Axum, Kongo, and Songhai. Even the cafeteria aspires to pan-African cuisine, though Nnadi, the Nigerian computer-science student, says the attempt to create his nation\u0026rsquo;s national dish, jollof rice, \u0026ldquo;needs a lot of help.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eComplaints about cafeteria food being a universal college constant, the real difference at ALU can be found in the classrooms. ALU emphasizes real-world problem solving, starting on day one. Incoming students are presented with a list of challenges currently facing African countries, from climate change to health care, education, urban growth or immigration. For the rest of the year they are expected to research the issue, discuss it with classmates, teachers and outside specialists, and present concrete solutions. Developing leaders for the 21st century, says Swaniker, goes beyond academics. \u0026ldquo;The whole idea is to create problem solvers who have learned how to learn, rather than regurgitate knowledge. That means developing vital skills: critical thinking, leadership, communication, entrepreneurship, data analysis\u0026mdash;this is what we need to develop Africa.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of majors, students have missions. Last year, one student established\u0026mdash;and found funding for\u0026mdash;a shelter for the island\u0026rsquo;s street dogs. Another team developed a campus-to-town transport system, vital for co-eds itching to get away from the sugar-cane fields surrounding the university for something more lively. Group work is encouraged because it develops leadership skills, says Nnadi, 20. \u0026ldquo;Going into real life from this point, I feel like there is no problem I won\u0026rsquo;t be able to deal with because I have seen it all: slackers, fights, conflict.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eAnd summer internships are mandatory. \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eThe school coaches students through the rigorous internship research and application process; by the time they graduate, most will have at least a year\u0026rsquo;s worth of work experience\u003c/span\u003e in Africa,\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003e and have applied to multiple jobs, giving them a head start in the real world. Nnadi has two internships lined up this summer\u0026mdash;one at the Bank of Kigali in Rwanda developing an online platform for mobile banking, and another back home in Nigeria, mostly, he admits, so he can fill up on jollof rice before starting another school year.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe laser focus on problem solving means that graduates should be well prepared to tackle whatever comes their way, from finding a job to taking on some of the continent\u0026rsquo;s biggest issues. But the ALU experience has also raised the bar, making it harder for some students, like 25-year-old Kaone Tlagae from Botswana, to go back home. \u0026ldquo;I left home with the idea that I would come back and create change, but now that I have seen what the other countries [in Africa] have to offer, the other opportunities out there, I\u0026rsquo;m not sure it\u0026rsquo;s the right place for me anymore.\u0026rdquo; Maybe, she admits with a twinge of guilt as she contemplates taking a job in Kenya instead, ALU isn\u0026rsquo;t so good at stopping the brain drain after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwaniker disagrees. The point of ALU, he says, is to create a cadre of African leaders and entrepreneurs who are trained to solve African problems, not just local ones. \u0026ldquo;We want a generation of Africans who are thinking on a continent-wide scale, who have networks across the continent, who can build pan-African businesses and grow economies and drive trade.\u0026rdquo; It\u0026rsquo;s not a brain drain, he says, but cross-pollination. \u0026ldquo;If someone from Botswana wants to develop a project in Zimbabwe, then there is probably someone from Zimbabwe who sees opportunity in Botswana.\u0026rdquo; A major part of entrepreneurship, after all, is spotting opportunities others might have missed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/time/world/~4/KcQAu0RcQSE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/world/~3/KcQAu0RcQSE/","published":"2019-06-11T16:31:50Z","guid":"https://time.com/?p=5603886"},{"title":"Botswana’s High Court Overturns Laws Criminalizing Homosexuality","content":"\u003caside class=\"right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad\" id=\"right-rail__ad-5604567\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module video-2\" data-src=\"https://time.com/5604567/botswana-overturns-ban-gay-sex/\" data-widget-id=\"SB_4\" data-ob-template=\"timemag\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"s1\"\u003eBotswana has scrapped laws criminalizing same-sex relations on Tuesday, in a victory for LGBT rights in Africa. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"s1\"\u003eThe country\u0026rsquo;s high court overturned the law dating back to colonial times that criminalized consensual same-sex relations. \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"s1\"\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s a big step for LGBT rights in Africa, where more than \u003ca href=\"https://time.com/5456826/tanzania-anti-gay-world-bank/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003e30 out of 54 countries across the continent\u003c/a\u003e have laws criminalizing gay sex. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"s1\"\u003eJudges voting to revoke the laws said they were unconstitutional.

I always wanted to be overseas and sort of chase the stories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"NK59j6\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy? What did you do in high school that made you want to do this?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"T7FmbF\"\u003eWell, I’ll tell you. The origin story, and it’s interesting because we, having just passed the 30th Anniversary of Tiananmen Square ... I was a freshman in college, the end of my freshman year in May 1989. I had a sister, I have three sisters, but another sister was interested in China, she was living over there at the time, and my parents and another sister went to visit her. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"0wbu8T\"\u003eAnd they found themselves in Beijing in late May 1989, taking family pictures inside the pro-democracy protest there. They left the day that martial law was declared and then in the succeeding days, they of course read about, and saw on television, the horrible events that took place afterwards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"hfWxeJ\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMm-hmm, which was very critical to happen on television, too.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"wSZqKD\"\u003eAbsolutely. And those images, they were heartbreaking for them because they’d met many of these young students and it was such an exhilarating time to be there. In fact, I found these the other day. My mom saved all these newspapers from around the region reporting the news of the events of the early morning, June 4th, 1989. So I choose my major, and a lot of folks looking at American political history this or that and I said, you know what, I’m gonna study China, because there’s something going on over there and I wanna know about it. That turned out to be my major. And after college, I went out to Asia ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"SifWle\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStudy China meaning learn Chinese, or what was the ...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"wKIdDy\"\u003eWell, study Chinese history and politics and culture. And then after college, I decided I wanted to go live there. I did a Fulbright Scholarship that took me out there, and then I ended up staying out there as a reporter traveling around the region, this was in the early ’90s, mid ’90s. And it just gave me a bug on the country, the region, the culture, but also a bug for getting paid to travel the world and bring back stories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"cokIQs\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMm-hmm.

Kinda lousy when I’m not in the country, but when I returned recently and I did a stint in government, that I dove right right back into it and I was decent, I was pretty decent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Cn8cVV\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEarly to that.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Oxu0BA\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd so you wanted to be a foreign correspondent, you didn’t want to go into diplomacy or the state department. I wanted to be in the state department, you know that? I went to the Foreign Service School in Georgetown.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"J39ruV\"\u003eYou did?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"5Ri0Hy\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYes.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"CqT460\"\u003eWell you, okay.

It’s the longest con in history, but go ahead.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"N80u2g\"\u003eI would believe it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"MMJnPo\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThink about it.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ZeFp3d\"\u003eWhen I was in college I did think about foreign service but I looked at the folks who took the foreign service exam and felt like I couldn’t pull it off. I just didn’t feel like I knew enough and I was intimidated by it. Later in my career, the only other path that I considered following, besides journalism, was government in some way. And that would come up years later when I was offered this job as chief of staff to the ambassador of China, this is just in 2011, and I took that job and I explored that for a couple years and I’m glad I did, and I learned a lot. But I still think my nature is a journalist so I came back to the fold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"dElhCt\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo you’re doing foreign correspondent ... what got you into national security?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"44ELoM\"\u003eSo I went over to London for ABC, after 9/11 basically. 9/11 happened, I went to cover the attacks at the Pentagon, I was based in Washington at the time, but immediately afterwards I raised my hand I said, “I wanna go cover, I wanna cover the aftermath of this. I wanna go to Afghanistan, and I wanna go cover the region.” And I did. I went there in early 2002 and ended up staying and I was based in London but staying covering the region for a decade to follow. I went to Iraq a dozen times, went to Afghanistan a dozen times, Iran a dozen times, all over there, Israel, Palestine, you name it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"95wgNy\"\u003eAnd that, covering the wars, covering the intelligence behind the wars, covering the terror attacks that followed, and efforts to prevent terror attacks, that got me into the national security space. And I sort of never gave it up, it was just interesting to me and substantive, and a little bit exciting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"t6QJrM\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd so what brought you to CNN, then? You were at the major networks, and then of course lots of people moved back and forth between them.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"qwAsGo\"\u003eSo I did more than a decade with ABC, principally overseas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"xMZCwE\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThat’s right.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"6Laq6p\"\u003eCame back to Washington in 2010-11, was really bored to be back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"SyxhWY\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCovering Washington.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"mcX1QG\"\u003eAt home, covering Washington. I didn’t have that excitement of hopping on a plane every couple of weeks to go somewhere new or exotic. And I went to the White House Correspondents dinner in 2011.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"KKz3fZ\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI’m so sorry.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"b9tHn4\"\u003eAnd I found myself ...

Oh no, I never liked that thing, it was all too close with their sources. It always made me nervous.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"VZ02Ey\"\u003eAnd a little too many celebrities to look at, they got down there. But I went there and I got lucky because sitting next to me was the new ambassador to China, Gary Locke. Just appointed, and he was about to be sent over, and we got to talking about China, we talked the whole dinner about China. And then that followed with a lunch and then another dinner, and he came to offer me a job as his chief of staff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"QZKRHT\"\u003eHe said, “Listen, I’ve been looking for someone, not a typical candidate for this job, someone a little outside the box, who can give me a different perspective of these things, how would you like to go?” And the first question I asked was to my wife. We had two young kids, and she said, “I’m game.” And she’s a journalist as well, she still works for ABC news, so she was excited by it and the prospect of taking our kids over there to absorb the place and learn something. So once I had her approval, I said yes, I’ll take a risk and dive in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"nCJHyE\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd how was that stint?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"zQIYgY\"\u003eSo, on the good side, I learned a lot, I was right in the middle of this country and this relationship with this country that I’d studied for a number of years. I had a high level security clearance, so reading the intelligence. I was in the room for many tense high-level meetings and in the midst of difficult decisions between the US and China. I was literally a fly on the wall, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"aJInxR\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo how was that different to being a journalist, how bad are we at doing our job?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"jyGR7Q\"\u003eWell it’s funny, I think that we have the impression that the folks on the inside know everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"2iNrXA\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOh, I don’t have that impression.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"3hVjlU\"\u003eWell, or that they have access to knowing so much, they have access to the intelligence and surveillance satellites and intercepted communications and all this kind of stuff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"WHGqVM\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOh I think it’s a goat rodeo, but go ahead. Because I’ve been on the inside of internet companies, so that’s why ...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"s6qOWj\"\u003eFair enough. You know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"zZlg4O\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNo, I just assume it’s the same in government and everywhere else.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"yG6mEx\"\u003eAnd I learned that lesson. I think that at the end of the day, you realize just like in companies, it’s imperfect people with imperfect information, making imperfect decisions. Often doing their darnedest, right? But you know, there’s no all-knowing anyone in these circumstances, so I certainly learned that. And I’m not questioning motivations, because I met a lot of dedicated Americans who really love their country and they’re fighting hard to do the best they can.

You take the initiative, it’s your product, you’re developing a product every day. And government is a top-down kind of structure, it’s like a military organization, chain of command, and that’s slow and frustrating and a little confining, so I did it for a couple years, learned a lot and said, “You know what, I’m a journalist, I’m going back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"SBp0L8\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRight.

But they knew that I had the chops for it because I’d spent a lot of time on the ground in these countries. And I think that kind of on-the-ground experience is often lacking in Washington. One, yes, you can operate under any circumstances and make it happen, but two, I’d been to Iran. If we’re talking about Iran, I’ d been there, I’d been inside the government plans, I’d been inside the wars, you know, I wasn’t dealing with theoretical knowledge of this stuff, I was dealing with first-hand knowledge, so that helped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"wwa83N\"\u003eI don’t know if you found in your career, I do often find in a career, that your best opportunities, I don’t wanna say they come out of the blue, but I was lucky at that point that I wanted to come back, that there was a position, and they were looking for someone like me, and I went for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Q9SLf2\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNo. No, I do, I do think it’s important to have on-the-ground things, some of the times, everyone’s like, “That’s your opinion,” I’m like, “No I covered it for years, I really am right.” I mean, I’m actually accurate as opposed to, you just are sayin’ it and stuff like this.

There’s always a tweet.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"m5kGc8\"\u003eExactly. And I think the day, when I was at ABC and you had the old-school evening news broadcast, very scripted. You knew what they were gonna say. Cable news in this era, when you have a lot of live interviews with newsmakers, you have news breaking during your hour, very little of it is scripted. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"R0xo0s\"\u003eWe do our homework. Poppy and I work hard, we know the issues before we go in. But you’re reacting in the moment and you gotta do it with some intelligence and knowledge and respect and that can be challenging, but it’s fun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ojs7H7\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhen you think about the impact … just previously, ‘cause I was telling you about the corrosive effects of cable sometimes and it’s true, how do you look at that?

You know, this week there’s been like 10 things, right? So, talk about that concept of what’s happening now. Because you’d worked at broadcast and this is not that.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"3zNEqV\"\u003eYou’re right. People ask me a lot, do we have an editorial line at CNN, am I encouraged to follow an editorial line? And the answer is no, we’re encouraged to follow the news. Our bosses care about getting it right, whenever we’re accused of fake news or making stuff up, or making sources up, and you know where that criticism comes from, I say guys, you don’t know how vetted our reporting is. Particularly in this era, the stories I do, particularly when it’s sensitive stuff, never been more vetted than anything I’ve worked on in my life. What are the sources, multiple sources, let’s make sure the language is precise, let’s go back to them, I want more clarity on this or that. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"m1tXLm\"\u003eThe level of vetting in editorial, not control but editorial standards, higher than I’ve ever experienced in the business. So, one, we gotta get it right. Two, we do our best to avoid an editorial slant. I think the bigger challenge is, and one reason I wrote a book, is that you don’t often get the opportunity to connect the dots and provide context.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"YRLjjs\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRight. Right. It’s the next ...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"yc1wCK\"\u003eIt’s the next thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"jyNmJt\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIt’s the hot take, it’s the twitchy culture, it’s Twitter, twitchy culture really.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"9OrppA\"\u003eExactly. So, that’s one thing I think we could do better, we could do better for people. And when I talk to my sort of unscientific focus group of friends and family, I think that’s what people are clamoring for, it’s like okay, I know it’s happening but I’m hearing it from 27 different angles, tell me why I care, how this fits into the bigger picture, why is this different, how should I prioritize? And that’s something that we try to do every day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"XGQpFZ\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy can’t it be like that on cable? This is why I do a podcast, because it’s long in substance, you’re bringing substantive to discussion, even our short ones are substantive.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"TCLFE6\"\u003eYes. We do. I mean listen, we do, we try. Of course, you could be doing that and then, heck, something else happens, right? Some guy walks out of the committee, it is reactive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"nhxssu\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRight, that’s what I mean. It’s reactive, reactive, reactive.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"U15pOe\"\u003eI try to look at it from my career, just as a journalist, that you’re a voice over time, and you just do your best to add value over time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"7jtPOl\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRight. Right. How do you operate under the pressure of being called things? CNN is the one that’s most targeted, again this week he just targeted y’all. What do you do in those ... and sometimes, some of your evening anchors really get a little emotional. You don’t, it’s really interesting, you don’t have a lot of opinion, it doesn’t feel like it, you don’t shade it as much. Whatever it is, I think they shade more on Fox News, but they shade a lot on CNN and MSNBC, they definitely shade.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"YDV1Hk\"\u003eI think just with primetime broadcast, a little bit different, it’s just not my style. I try to play it as much ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Qf8R3S\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut you still suffer from the consequences.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"JQDmB4\"\u003eI do. So, big picture, we do our best to ignore it, because the only direction, like I said, I get from my boss is just get it right and work hard. Frankly, it encourages the mission of journalism, when you’re under attack with purpose, because the fake news attacks are with purpose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Y6atw9\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOh no. On purpose, yes. You’re being used for an end.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Dtokrt\"\u003eSo that, and Trump even said it, in the famous Leslie Stahl interview he said, I attack you because when you have critical information, I can then undermine the source. I mean, Trump said it in so many words. So that makes you know even more so what your role is, expose wrongdoing, shine light on issues that don’t have light shone on them. And that’s, on the positive side, mission affirming, so that’s one thing. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"lWXqLC\"\u003eTwo, ignore the BS. I just ignore it, ya know, because I, at the end of the day, I actually think that his attacks have less impact over time, I think people are getting more numb to them, to some degree. There is the very serious side to it, is that some people do listen, and there’s a reason why we have armed guards at CNN today. And there’s a reason why you have guards at Trump events guarding the press pen, because some people \u003cem\u003edo\u003c/em\u003e listen to those attacks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Q7crWj\"\u003eThere’s a reason why, when Poppy and I were on the air in September and CNN had received the bomb, that guy was listening. So, it’s important, but our reaction is to just put the nose down and move forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"bQbaA2\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDo you think journalists should pull back a little bit? Some people think ... No, don’t.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"8Uzzsz\"\u003eAbsolutely not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"DiFpdQ\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRight.

All right so, getting into substance. In the next section we’re gonna talk about, how you decided to do this book and what you’re thinking about it. When did you write this book?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"5RI9IK\"\u003eI wrote it on planes, trains, and in coffee shops. I didn’t take time off, I wrote it between January of last year and July, 80,000 words, and I just said I’m gonna write 10,000 words a month, 2,500 words a week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"qhF16T\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat was the impetus for writing it, what were you trying to do?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"iLMzev\"\u003eThe impetus was that I spent years covering these countries — China and Russia — on multiple fronts of what I would perceive as this shadow war. And it struck me that folks weren’t connecting the dots on this, not just members of the public, journalists, the way we write about these stories, but also our leaders weren’t connecting the dots on what, when you look at the full picture, is a strategy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"oBMI4q\"\u003eIt’s a strategy by both Russia and China to undermine the US on multiple fronts and the fact is, both of them are very explicit in that strategy, they write about it. And I wrote it, my motivation was, as a concerned American. That I spent all these years in these places, and I feel that my country is being undermined in a way that is worrisome. I want my kids to experience a world as free as the one I grew up in, or a country as prosperous as the one I grew up in, and you have two countries that are intent on undermining that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"JtdIKB\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNow let’s be clear, these two countries have always been trying to undermine the United States, right?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"aUTiyf\"\u003eTrue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"qkOubr\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut one of the things I find interesting, is, look, Russia lost the Cold War, lost it cold, like completely lost it. China, same thing, was never able to make the kind of incursions that they had hoped. But they’ve used technology to do so. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"3sMu0C\"\u003eYes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Gn6tcz\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou know what I mean? But first talk about the history of their attempts, the non-shadow war, because it went on and on, and largely they lost to our economic vitality, the freedom/democracy just worked better for a lot more people, and a lot more people lived better.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"zrJcNh\"\u003eWell that’s going back to the Cold War. So the Cold War ends in ’91, the Soviet Union collapses, and at the same time ... I’m not entirely equating Russia and China, but there are parallels to the development of this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"3GzMKu\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNo, they’re different.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"gVP3Uo\"\u003eAt the same time, China is liberalizing its economy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"EEVU8k\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEconomics.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"XQ7fdp\"\u003eEconomically, making enormous strides.

End of history, Russia and China want to play by our rules now. And if we engage them and bring them into the international fold, not only are we going to make friends with them, but they’re going to liberalize at home and modernize, democratize, all this kind of stuff, even in the face of years of contradictory evidence and information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"fxEoCQ\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDecades.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"gzlkFb\"\u003eThat delusion persisted.

Russia ... and again, there’s some generalizing going on here, but the way folks will describe it: Russia’s a zero-sum gameplayer. They see it as an advantage, any way they pull us down: politically, election interference, militarily, etc. China really wants to supplant us. Right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"iH8Gr6\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYes. That’s right.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"U42abo\"\u003eAs the dominant power in the world.

That’s a good way to put it.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"teBDXF\"\u003eAnd one of the consistent themes of the book, though, is that the constant missed signals, the constant misreading ... And another point I make — and again, it’s not a political book because there’s a lot of blame to go around, Democratic and Republican administrations — but each president comes in and says, “I can get this right.” George W. Bush looked into Putin’s eye, “I see a guy could work with.” Things go pear-shaped afterwards. Obama, “reset button.” Things go pear-shaped. Of course, Donald Trump is still in that space. He’s like, “\u003cem\u003eI \u003c/em\u003ecan get this right.” But it hasn’t worked out so well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"l9b8Dz\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYeah.

And I make that point, for both Russia and China, that neither is anything close to a democracy, but they both have domestic politics. But Putin and Xi are good at appealing to those domestic politics of, “\u003cem\u003eNow\u003c/em\u003e is our time. Don’t let America keep us under their thumb. We’re pushing back. This is our time to regain our place in the world.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"tcbGl6\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRight. So Russia, discord.

They think about it. Election interference. Okay, no question. We’re talking about that. We’re having a national conversation. Do they know that Russia has deployed weapons in space? They’re up there right now. Kamikaze satellites can take out our satellites. There are directed-energy weapons in space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ehqwry\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIs that what they’re called? Kamikaze ...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"a4jzNP\"\u003eThat’s what the Space Command calls them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"rzGTPa\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRight, right. And they’re designed to hurt our communication systems?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"SvytgR\"\u003eThey’re designed to take them out. And not just communications: surveillance satellites, nuclear early-warning satellites, GPS, on which a whole host of military technologies depend. Smart bombs aren’t smart. Drones don’t fly. Etc. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"5QU7W1\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI’m assuming we have the same weapons up there?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"WVlGmh\"\u003eWell, no. Not deployed. We have those capabilities, but we haven’t deployed them to the degree that China and Russia had. And that’s a decision that has to be made: Is that the best deterrent? Or does that lead to a space arms race? That’s part of the calculation that has to be made today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ZPpjGc\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSpace Force! But go ahead.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"FtHOL4\"\u003eSpace Force, exactly. So, they do that because they know we’re dependent on it. It’s classic asymmetric warfare. And in the event of war, they take that away from us. And it’s also civilian technologies, as you know better than me, depending on space assets. GPS timestamps keep the financial markets going. That’s space. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"fyjYzI\"\u003eUnder the waves, you have a new submarine arms race that’s been underway for years. Russia deploying faster, quieter submarines. Why does that matter? With a submarine that’s faster and quieter, it can pop up off our coastline in the event of war and rain down nuclear warheads, without warning. And they show off that capability. You’ve seen stories about Russian subs popping up off the coast of Florida. US submarine commanders — and I spent time on a US sub under the Arctic where they’re training to track Russian subs — will grant that they can’t track them as well as they used to. And that’s a military change, a technology change, with intent, by Russia. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"aACVs3\"\u003eSo you’ve got the information ops kind of stuff, election interference. You’ve got space weapons, with military intent. You’ve got an arms race under the waves, again with military intent. And as in any sort of asymmetric battlefield, these are the spaces where Russia, and China too, calculate that they can compete with us. They can’t build 12 aircraft carriers tomorrow ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"dFKVvC\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNot anymore.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"W8Stpe\"\u003e... but they’ve got very good submarines. And then you have the broader cyber issue, which I know you’ve covered extensively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"O4eVOO\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDisinformation.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"TjDjN4\"\u003eDisinformation, but also going after critical infrastructure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Xp7h9T\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eInfrastructure.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Yk6YjA\"\u003eThey already have the ability to go after water treatment, power grids, etc. So coming back to why I wrote this book, I’ve been covering each of these fronts and I’m not hearing folks — certainly in the White House, but elsewhere — talking about how those fronts fit together. And it is an explicit strategy. And although Russia and China are very different countries, in a thousand different ways, they’ve struck on a similar strategy for undermining the US.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"zsLc5D\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAll right. So that’s Russia. China?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"0gDFO0\"\u003eSo China, active in those same fronts. It’s got space weapons. Its innovation is what US Space Command calls a “kidnapper satellite.” It’s got a grappling arm that can snatch satellites out of orbit, Moonraker-style. They’re up there, they’re active.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"0VDZmy\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo they’re stealing them?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"WcCzgM\"\u003eThey can. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"N7kSVs\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThey can.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"TPjAcf\"\u003eThey haven’t done it yet. But in the event of a war, they can. And they’ve tested this capability right up to geostationary, so right up to 20,000 miles. To be able to do that, you’ve got to have fantastic maneuverability, situational awareness, etc. They’ve demonstrated that capability. So, China’s in space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ifzMTL\"\u003eChina is also under the waves. They don’t do nuclear subs as much as diesel-electric. Diesel-electric is quieter. There was a Chinese sub that popped up in the midst of a US carrier group, without warning, a number of months ago, that scared the bejeezus out of US naval commanders because they didn’t know it was coming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"14ffKc\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIt just popped up?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"yuqGLG\"\u003eAnd when you can pop up in the middle of them, of course, you could have already launched the torpedoes and they’re dead. So they’re there. China also does election interference.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"dCQWOM\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo China hasn’t been known for this, right?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"pNPgdY\"\u003eNo. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"xAs5Z2\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThey’ve been known for space, obviously.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"8sQDob\"\u003eThey’ve been known for space.

It’s a missile test, yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"6wpPxK\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOf course. Whenever there’s an accident I’m like, “That wasn’t an accident.”\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"0xyzc7\"\u003eNo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"QJK3CX\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIt’s covering up something else, or they were \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003etrying\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e to do it.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"MFgwRA\"\u003eExactly. China’s missiles are designed to destroy US aircraft carriers. And they’ve had enormous success. If you ever hear anti-access/area denial, that’s a whole ... They create kind of a web of fire that keeps US carriers off the coast. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"KlQA18\"\u003eChina, by the way, does election interference too. Australia has had particular experience with this. But when China is reducing soybean purchases from Iowa, amidst this trade war, that is trying to maximize pain on Iowa farmers, with political effect in the US, it’s basically election interference. And China has also done probing attacks, like Russia has, of election systems. So they all operate ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"c1jsrQ\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut not as much disinformational?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ux3ivT\"\u003eNot Russian-troll-farm level stuff. They have the capability of doing it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"PGTMCD\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOf course they do.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"lKUcIX\"\u003eThey haven’t done it. Of course, the other aspect that China has had enormous success — I have a whole chapter on this — is just straight-up stealing state secrets, national security intellectual property and private sector intellectual property. And I tell the story of just a single spy, Stephen Su, who over the course of four years stole hundreds of gigabytes of data on the F-35, the F-22, and the C-17. And today, Russia is flying three jets that look a heck of a lot like the F-35.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"uYurf0\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRussia is?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Qo8lLw\"\u003eSorry, China is. F-35, the F-22, and the C-17, because he was so successful, over four years. He was caught by the FBI, but only four years in. And I interviewed the former head of counterintelligence for the FBI, Bob Anderson, who says, “We’re aware of about 10 percent of what China’s doing.” 10 percent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"n9XJSb\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOf what they’re stealing. They’re also, to give them credit, doing a lot of their own technology and spreading it all over the world. And so becoming ... just the way they’re buying up mining, rare earth minerals, everything else. They’re also deploying their technology in places … facial surveillance, they’re giving them to other countries to try to become the dominant technology force in the world, the way the US has been. Huawei is a good example of this.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"etP9uo\"\u003eHuawei. Absolutely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"hI174N\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI think it’s easy to say they steal everything. They don’t just steal everything. They actually are innovating their way into dominance.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"U50yHB\"\u003eI’ve actually been to Huawei’s headquarters in Shenzhen, and credit where credit’s due. They do a good job stealing and that is expressly to catch up to the US, but China is ahead of the game, you know this better than me ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"PsnsaC\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIn artificial intelligence.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Ijwznr\"\u003e... in artificial intelligence, quantum computing, this kind of thing.

But it’s an interesting question, “Who’s going to dominate the next phase?” is something that’s interesting, that’s been debated. And of course Silicon Valley people are saying, “Let us stay large so that we can compete against China.” It’s never Russia. It’s never Russia. They’re just irritating. Russia’s just irritating. It’s China that, “We need to be big in order to fight China.”\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"TNbxdL\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy answer’s always, “Do we really want to get in an arms race with China over facial recognition?” for example. Do we? Or will there be two internets? There’ll be two systems. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"CMCldC\"\u003eYeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"A8AfhK\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThat’s what’s going to happen. There’s going to be their system and our system. And then it will be a global race to compete on who dominates in other countries. Is it a western democracy system or is it a Chinese technology-dominated system? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"AZm3tH\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe make a lot of things in China.

Rick Ledgett, former deputy director of the NSA, on this he makes the point that China has laws that require their technology companies to work with their security services, beyond the fact that ... Listen, there’s no real firewall between the industries there. You’ve got the straight-up state-owned enterprises and the other ones, but they still have a tight relationship, and directors on the board, whatever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"4pz4pG\"\u003eSo they’ve got to do it. They’ve got to do it. And that’s a problem. And that’s why when you look, for instance, we spoke about Huawei ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"fmcJZl\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis is going to deploy 5G. But go ahead.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Q38iWK\"\u003eYou understand why US security services are concerned about it. I remember that moment during Hill testimony when all the intelligence chiefs were there and they were asked about ZTE: Would they use a ZTE phone? And they all said, “No,” because they’re concerned about a back door in a ZTE phone. You look at the Russia thing, too. Why does no government agency use Kaspersky Labs now, right? Because they were worried about ... what was a good technology product ... do you trust that to screen your computer? Probably not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"918wMf\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what do you as an American? I don’t agree with Donald Trump on much, but I’ve got to say, I don’t think we should be using Huawei. I’m kind of like, “Yeah, Huawei’s a problem,” from a national security point of view. I’m not sure that’s why he’s doing it. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"NXxx8b\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow can we be working with them? Because obviously China is going to be a technological leader, and so there has to be global cooperation between technology ... Obviously, Apple makes a lot of things in China. Obviously, Google does. Google’s trying to go in there. How do we work with them and at the same time, protect our national security interests?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"S24Ch2\"\u003eIt’s a question. Just beginning with Trump’s addressing this issue ... Credit where credit is due. He’s confronting China on what is a genuine issue, not just trade misbehavior but national security, a true national security threat. So, \u003cem\u003ecan\u003c/em\u003e you work together on these essential technologies when you have enterprises that abide by government rules, and a country that has calculated that its survival — well, the \u003cem\u003eleadership\u003c/em\u003e of that country has calculated that its survival is dependent on control of its own people?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"O0zgha\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhich, a lot of the funding ... I was just at an event where a China expert was telling me about how much money they spend on internal ... The reason they’re so into facial recognition and AI combined is because they need to control this population.

Because they’ve calculated, essentially — that’s a bigger conversation, I guess — it’s a crisis of legitimacy because they’ve calculated that they can’t keep this population of 1.4 billion in check without having that kind of control. And that’s a sad fact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"D72Kz7\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWell, when you see the numbers, the estimates on how much they spend on internal surveillance, that’s all it says to me is it’s ...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"zsf7Pv\"\u003eIt’s remarkable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"D7iu23\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThey’re worried about dissent.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"jpYV7H\"\u003eThey are.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"b9oqTp\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThey can’t have dissent.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"PejXk2\"\u003eNo. I remember when I went to the Huawei headquarters, and this is a number of years ago, I remember walking through — I’m sure they wouldn’t let us do this again — but walking through the quarters, and any door that was open, I felt like there were about a thousand people in there at a terminal. And that’s Huawei, it’s a company that makes a lot of products, that kind of thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"5OLKNv\"\u003eBut Bob Anderson, again, former head of counterintel at the FBI, in the chapter on stealing the state secrets, he talks about how China does a great job of just enlisting its intellectual and technological firepower in the service of the government. You’ve got the people who are expressly working for the security agencies; but he says they have, he called it a “national service program” for highly capable technological students to do the work of hacking for the government.

And some make the argument to me that AI is already in play, in some ways. Because in cyberspace, of course the decisions are made in microseconds that human beings can’t complicate. So already those tools are operating somewhat independently from human control, to some degree, at least in the moment. Also, when you speak of drone technology, the systems that manage those swarms of drones, that kind of thing, will have some artificial intelligence and ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"0MZNrZ\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEverything.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"j4G0S1\"\u003eYeah, fair enough.

We will debate the diversity in it, and they won’t, at all. They don’t.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"04Rhwm\"\u003eWell, that’s true. No, that’s true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"5h7VMe\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd that’s why we’ll be hindered.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Qs9Bxq\"\u003ePerhaps, perhaps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"3kmmNG\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThat’s the argument is that we shouldn’t ... The argument is still well yes, let’s not debate it, let’s just go full steam ahead, which I think is wrong because look where it’s gotten us with social media.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"PHGcIA\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what are the biggest threats right now from each of these countries, and what does defeat look like to them? What’s their goal?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"iw6pGW\"\u003eSo both of them speak in terms of permanent conflict, that this is over time. That there’s no signing ceremony on the Missouri in this. Well, because it’s happening over time, insidiously. And again, with them calculating what is our threshold that they can operate under without sparking a decisive response, right? So it just goes on forever. Just eating away at American advantages, that kind of thing. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"pi8QP2\"\u003eSo for China, though, the ambition is that, to supplant the US economically and militarily, will we know it? I mean, you’re sort of like the frog in the boiling water. The temperature keeps going up. Will we not recognize it until, “Wait a second. We’re no longer the world power.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"J4xhkM\"\u003eYou know, it’s not going to happen in a day. It’ll happen over the course of many days and years. So they may achieve victory without us realizing it. And that’s, again, part of the reason I write the book is that we’re already in a war without realizing it, right? And certainly the public’s not aware of it, and our leaders are not speaking of it in those terms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"oA8qR1\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWell, they’re a little more, with the election interference with the ...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"bm13ky\"\u003eYeah, for sure, but without realizing that at the same time, you’re getting attacked on other fronts and losing ground on other fronts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"oWRNh2\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRight. So what is the US doing? What is the US doing to this? We’re not just sitting here?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"gMcow8\"\u003eNo, we’re not. I mean, first it started with recognition, and speaking in terms of a shadow war, though they don’t use that exact term, is something that US military commanders do. It’s something that folks in Cyber Command do, etc. Making piecemeal decisions of consequence, but without a clearly articulated vision. And I’ll give you an example. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"2UQRxI\"\u003eI mean, again, we talked about this, the Trump administration enabling some offensive cyber weapons in response to intrusive attacks by Russia and China. You know, in other words, meet them out on the battlefield here. So you’ve had that happen. The US has not made a decision exactly how to respond to threats in space, although we are starting to send satellites into space that have greater maneuverability so they could get out of the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"I635nL\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo they’re kamikaze, they’ve got grapplers, what are we going to do?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"jpyTZQ\"\u003eWell ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"tvVezi\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJust shoot them.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"feuKOa\"\u003eYou could, I mean, a couple of things you’re talking about. Sending satellites up with some shielding so that they could resist the effects of directed energy weapons. The former head of Space Command, he talks about sending satellites up with the equivalent of carrier escorts, right? So other satellites that could help push off, even lay depth charges in space terms to, you know. So you’re talking in those terms, they haven’t made the decision on offense, but they are making decisions on defense in space. In terms of tying it together and responding with a contiguous national strategy, it hasn’t been articulated yet. And one point ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"sPr0eD\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy, in any of these administrations?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"rVCXzJ\"\u003eWe don’t have leadership.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"GR6aBz\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIs it just this administration, or is it previous?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"G69ebB\"\u003ePrevious administrations didn’t recognize it sufficiently. They were at least willing to identify Russia as a threat, particularly. You can give this administration credit for identifying China as a greater threat, you know, the trade space, stolen state secrets, etc. But you need a whole-of-government response, which requires focus from the very top, articulation of a strategy from the very top. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"2gCrFF\"\u003eIn this administration focusing on China, but still will not identify Russia as the threat that it is. You can’t have that leadership. And don’t take my word for it. The sub commanders want the leadership, the space commanders want the leadership, the folks in the NSA want the leadership.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"7i5qiw\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThere is only partisanship. They can’t make basic decisions together. Do you imagine the political climate changing so that happens? Or is Russia, has it worked?

He says that America does not do future threats well. He imagines this scenario where George Tenet in August of 2001 says, “We’re getting a lot of chatter about terrorists targeting aviation in the US, I’m going to require all Americans to take their shoes off and not carry liquids on planes and go through an extra level of screening.” And he said, “Americans would have said, ‘no way.’” 9/11 happens, you get woken up. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"nDsGud\"\u003eThe trouble is, you can argue the US \u003cem\u003edid\u003c/em\u003e have it’s sort of Pearl Harbor, with the election interference in 2016, or should have, because that was a consequential attack on our most sacred institution. But it had been politicized by one side, by Trump. So that you can’t identify it in a unified way and therefore respond to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"e7YJi2\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what happens?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Za313f\"\u003eWell, without getting together and thinking about a national strategy to respond, and taking actual steps, they’re going to continue to win, right?

Can you do it when you have a president who’s had only one cabinet-level meeting on election security? And you can’t bring it up in his presence, according to the chief of staff, because he doesn’t want to talk about it? No. You got to get over that hurdle. You have to set clear red lines about where the US will not allow Russia and China to attack, whether it’s invade a country in Europe, create territory in the South China Sea, mess with our elections, deploy space satellites.

We don’t have treaties for them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"GM4A45\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe do not.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"NnUPj0\"\u003eAnd you need to set, you know, we ... Listen, we have negotiated treaties without enemies before. We did it during the Cold War. We got a red phone, right? So to reduce the chances of nuclear conflagration, you need something similar for space and for cyber. Difficult to sit across the table from these people. But there is mutual interest in establishing some sort of parameters around this, because everybody would suffer from a space conflict. Listen, you blow up some satellites in space, that you can’t use those orbits for years afterwards. So everybody pays. You’ve got to find a way to avoid that kind of scenario.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"6C9hs2\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRight, right, so mutually assured destruction. Which of the two countries do you think is most reasonable? I would think China because of their economic interest. They love their economic interest.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"9KpJup\"\u003eThe general view you get is that Russia is maybe the more aggressive short-term threat, but China is the much longer term, more capable existential threat over time. Just bigger economy, bigger population, greater capability, greater knowledge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Udd4TS\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAlso capability of working with them, correct?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"kxtYL4\"\u003eWell, yes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"t2Or1S\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou have things at stake.

Basically nothing. We’ve got $600 billion a year now. So there are mutual interests in maintaining a relationship. And actually, in the midst of this trade war we’re seeing ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"jYtlXM\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what’s the impact of this trade war now?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"EZB8hv\"\u003eWell, it could be pretty darn bad, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"2nLmGJ\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFor who?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"G54gMD\"\u003eWell, for both of us. I mean, I always say to people, “Okay, you want to stop buying stuff from China. Look around your living room. How much stuff is made in China? Are you willing to pay two or three times as much for your flat screen TV, or your furniture?” It’s actually, you know, most Americans can’t afford that. You may be, but that’s a consequence of cutting off that kind of trading relationship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"6cGsb3\"\u003eYou could say the same about Mexico, I suppose, in a lot of circumstances. So you have the potential here of exacting punishment from both sides of it. Another one is ... You mentioned rare earths earlier, right? The US stopped mining the stuff. China is now using that as a cudgel against us, saying “we’ll stop exporting that to you” or ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"vV0d6m\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMercury.

I was like, “What?” \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"BHr4vp\"\u003eYeah, isn’t that incredible?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"YE9VCR\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI know, he’s like, “No, this is really bad.

All these things you’ve talked about, what’s the critically most important thing we need to watch out for? And what would, besides Trump educating himself on some of this stuff, what is ... Does it have to be from Trump, or can it be from other leaders?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"qkDkul\"\u003eWell, it could be from, I mean Congress can ... You speak about it in these terms, we haven’t heard it. Military leaders, our intelligence officials are speaking about it, but they need the resources and they need to mobilize us, right? Because we have to be involved. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ni5zVl\"\u003eI will say that there is a public element to this as well. I spent a lot of time in Estonia on this because I love Estonia. But here’s a little tiny country of 3 million people who’s been beaten up by Russia repeatedly, and yet they’ve stood up. They’ve stood up and the president of Estonia, who I interview, they talk a lot about cyber hygiene. I know you’ve talked about it on your broadcast that, you know, we’re only as good as our weakest link, any system, in terms of these kinds of attacks, particularly the blunt force kind of stuff. I tell the story in here about how John Podesta lost his emails ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"rb1Ucu\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOh man, that was too easy.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"xQLiGZ\"\u003eAnd you know, the fake Gmail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"5vBKOr\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI could have hacked John Podesta.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Ri0VjZ\"\u003eI know!

impact of militias on local governance in the Middle East and North Africa","content":"\u003cp\u003eMilitia groups have become an increasing feature of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). Often sponsored by rival outside powers, they have profound impact on local stability, internal politics, humanitarian access, and economic development, as well as on regional security and geopolitics. In Iraq, such paramilitary groups have mobilized and, in some cases, remobilized to counter the Islamic State (IS). Yet, even after territorial control was wrestled away from IS, the political and economic power of Al Hashd al-Shaabi, as the paramilitary groups are known in Arabic, has continued to grow. During the spring of 2019 tension between the United States and Iran, Iraq’s paramilitary groups became a key flashpoint. In Lebanon, Hezbollah, too, has been at the epicenter of regional rivalries and counterterrorism. And in Libya, infighting among the country’s militias has plunged the country into another phase of civil war.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn June 28, the Brookings Institution will host a panel conversation on the impact of militias in MENA and ways to address the paramilitary groups with Brookings Senior Fellows Shadi Hamid and Vanda Felbab-Brown; Richard E. Behrman Professor of Child Health and Society at Stanford University Paul Wise; Brookings John C. Whitehead Visiting Fellow in International Diplomacy Jeffrey Feltman; and Senior Fellow Suzanne Maloney, who will moderate the event.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the introductory comments, panelists will take questions from the audience.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://www.brookings.edu/events/the-impact-of-militias-on-local-governance-in-the-middle-east-and-north-africa/","published":"2019-06-11T19:43:49Z","guid":"https://www.brookings.edu/?post_type=event\u0026p=589272"},{"title":"Advancing U.S. interests through security cooperation","content":"\u003cp\u003eBy Adam Twardowski\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEvery day, the U.S. manages 14,000 open foreign military sales cases with 185 countries. Recent attempts by near-peer competitors to erode U.S. technological advantages has made security cooperation between the U.S. and these countries even more significant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn \u003ca href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/events/how-security-cooperation-advances-us-interests/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eJune 4\u003c/a\u003e, Senior Fellow \u003ca href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/experts/michael-e-ohanlon/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eMichael O’Hanlon\u003c/a\u003e hosted Lieutenant General Charles Hooper, director of the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA), to discuss these dynamics and the role of the DSCA in supporting allies and promoting U.S. interests abroad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eO’Hanlon asked Hooper to discuss regional examples of DSCA’s approach to security cooperation. Hooper argued that American security cooperation with Colombia has been highly successful, as demonstrated by Colombia’s self-sustaining defense capability with U.S. assistance. More contentious regional topics include the sale of F-35 fighter jets to Turkey, weapon transfers to Saudi Arabia amidst the ongoing war in Yemen, and cooperation with the Afghan National Security Forces. With all three, Hooper acknowledged ongoing tensions. While the U.S. strives to achieve common security goals through partnerships with allies, there can be difficulty in guaranteeing that weapons are used responsibly. Despite this tension, Hooper underscored that the DSCA’s key objectives are strengthening alliances and attracting new partners, providing allies and partners with defense services and articles faster, and ensuring the consistent application of U.S. values.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the end of the event, Lt.
