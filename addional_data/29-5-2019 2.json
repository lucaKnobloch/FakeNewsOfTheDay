I reach for my podcasts whenever I’m commuting, whenever I’m doing a long walk between offices, or if I’m doing random stuff around the house. No wonder the consumer investment team ended up digging into this trend by doing a market map report \u0026#8212; the analysis led by Li Jin and including work from myself, Connie Chan, and others.

I’m looking for startups that can change the game there.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe bigger idea is actually “audio”, not specifically podcasting. And in fact, the combined revenue of Headspace and Calm are more than half of the entire podcasting market. Whoa! I’d be interested in other products that tap into the trends around AirPods, Alexa, voice assistants, etc., but may not directly sound like podcasting\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAfter this analysis, I’m looking for really differentiated verticals of audio. Meditation is one, but what about something that’s at a much higher price point? For example, something that’s very business-focused and can be put on a corporate credit card? It could create a strong advantage around paid marketing if a product has high subscription retention or ARPU, allowing them to make higher bids in the various ad networks.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe report covers things in more detail at the end, but that’s the tldr; from an investment standpoint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other quick plug I want to give \u0026#8212; get a copy of the PDF version of the deck by joining the a16z newsletter:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://pages.a16z.com/Podcasting-Ecosystem-Slides.html?utm_campaign=acpromo\u0026amp;utm_medium=website\u0026amp;utm_source=acweb\u0026amp;utm_content=podcastlandscape\"\u003eSubscribe to the a16z newsletter here.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://pages.a16z.com/Podcasting-Ecosystem-Slides.html?utm_campaign=acpromo\u0026amp;utm_medium=website\u0026amp;utm_source=acweb\u0026amp;utm_content=podcastlandscape\"\u003e\u003cimg class=\"alignnone wp-image-4629\" src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Ad-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"599\" height=\"169\" srcset=\"http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Ad-3.jpg 886w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Ad-3-300x85.jpg 300w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Ad-3-768x217.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe a16z team uses the newsletter to circulate resources, including podcasts, op-eds, presentations, and more.

While podcasts differ widely in terms of content, format, production value, style, and length, they’re all distributed through RSS, or Really Simple Syndication, a standardized web feed format that is used to publish content. For podcasts, the RSS feed contains all the metadata, artwork, and content of a show.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo listen to a podcast, a user adds the RSS feed to their podcast client (such as Apple Podcasts, Spotify, etc.), and the client then accesses this feed, checks for updates, and downloads any new files. Podcasts can be accessed from computers, mobile apps, or other media players. On the podcast creator side, creators host the RSS feed as well as the show’s content and media on a hosting provider, and submit the shows to various directories, such as Apple’s podcast directory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePodcast content is typically available for free, though creators can choose to set up private RSS feeds that require payment to access.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCurrent headlines about podcasts today hail them as the next major content medium, describing them as “suddenly hot”, as the next battlefield for content, and as an “antidote” for our current news environment:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg class=\"alignnone wp-image-4660\" src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/podcast_news-1024x956.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"560\" srcset=\"http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/podcast_news-1024x956.png 1024w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/podcast_news-300x280.png 300w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/podcast_news-768x717.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow did this “suddenly” happen?

New devices made it easier to listen: Alexa launched in 2015, Google Home and AirPods in 2016. And an explosion of new content — ranging from daily news to narrative to talks shows — met the growing listener appetite.

However, its market share has fallen in the last few years, from over 80% to 63%.

Most of these apps all have roughly the same content, given widely open directories of podcast RSS feeds. And there’s hundreds more listening apps out there. The barriers to entry for creating a new podcast app are quite low, since content is all distributed via RSS feeds and anyone can access them. There are also tools for creators to create their own podcast app from their own RSS feed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA note on comparing listening apps: metrics between apps are not entirely an apples-to-apple comparison, as some apps (like Apple Podcasts, Overcast, and Stitcher) auto-download shows that users subscribe to, whereas others (e.g. Spotify, Castbox) don’t continuously download new episodes. This affects comparisons between apps and may overstate the traction of listening apps that auto-download shows.

We estimate that Apple Podcasts has 27M monthly active users in the U.S., based on App Annie, so a sizeable absolute number but relatively small compared to the total install base. Though Apple accounts for the majority of podcast listening, the company currently doesn’t monetize podcasting at all — all ads that you hear on podcasts are a result of advertisers and podcasters connecting off-platform.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor some users, the app is a basic, functional listening app, as compared to other media apps and products, with rudimentary categorization and discovery features. For some creators, the features it currently lacks include native monetization capabilities, in-depth analytics, demographic information for listeners, or any attribution for where listeners come from. Since Apple Podcasts launched in 2012, the app itself has changed very little.

The strategies for these companies are mostly centered around leveraging their existing audiences to cross-promote podcasts; using listener data to personalize listening experiences or to help surface relevant podcasts; and leveraging their reach and existing monetization mechanisms to help creators earn more revenue. Google, which launched a standalone Podcasts app last year, has \u003ca href=\"https://blog.pacific-content.com/exclusive-inside-the-new-google-podcasts-strategy-that-could-double-audiences-worldwide-b556cdc26e43\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003etalked\u003c/a\u003e about making podcasts a first-class citizen in terms of surfacing podcast content in search results, as well as the growth opportunity that Google users worldwide represent in terms of potential podcast listeners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, there’s the long tail of podcast apps. These are comprised of startups and a fair number of non-VC funded companies. These apps are predominantly competing on the basis of better user-facing features such as improved discovery, search, and social capabilities, as well as creator monetization including their own ad networks or direct user monetization features.

Though we’ve heard anecdotally from advertisers that podcast ads are effective — and are unique in their ability to reach a hard-to-access, attractive demographic — the ad buying experience is manual and tedious.

Examples include The Mission, which is selling to enterprises to create branded podcasts — for instance, a podcast called The Future of Cities, sponsored by Katerra; and Gimlet, which has collaborated on shows like The Venture with Virgin Atlantic. By removing dependence on ads for monetization, branded shows like these are able to go deeper into a subject matter and create more niche content that doesn’t rely on listening volume to generate revenue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s also a lot of activity happening right now in the subscription and membership space. Recently-launched podcasting app Luminary Media (which bills itself as the “Netflix for podcasts”) charges $8 a month for access to a slate of more than 40 exclusive podcasts, and the app also has a free listening experience. The launch has been bumpy, with issues ranging from podcasters \u003ca href=\"https://podcastbusinessjournal.com/luminary-does-a-belly-flop-on-twitter/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003etaking offense at their tweet\u003c/a\u003e that “Podcasters don’t need ads”; to controversy about \u003ca href=\"https://hotpodnews.com/luminary-cleans-up-the-show-notes-links-situation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eremoving links in show notes\u003c/a\u003e, including donation and affiliate links that help podcasters monetize; to \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/25/18515840/luminary-podcast-startup-proxy-server-show-takedown\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eusing a \u003c/a\u003eproxy server to serve podcasts, which made it challenging for podcasters to receive accurate analytics. Luminary’s launch serves to signal a few things — that the golden age of investing in podcasting is underway in terms of dollars flowing in, but also that getting the buy-in of creators is just as important as winning over consumers in building a new platform.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe model of subscription premium audio content is popular in China, where Ximalaya, a unicorn consumer audio platform, has a subscription feature for $3 monthly that enables users to access over 4000 e-books and over 300 premium audio courses or podcasts. Audio content is also available a la carte starting at $0.03 per short, serialized book chapter, or anywhere from $10 to $45 for paid audio courses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther monetization models we’ve seen include grants or foundation support, ticket sales for live events, and merchandise sales. There’s also licensing deals happening with the likes of HBO, Amazon, Fox, and other content companies who view podcasts as a source of intellectual property and want to adapt them into movies and TV shows. For instance, Gimlet’s scripted podcast \u003cem\u003eHomecoming\u003c/em\u003e debuted as an Amazon Original Series in November 2018. The directionality of influence goes both ways: some podcasts are offshoots of other content — such as HBO’s \u003cem\u003eChernobyl\u003c/em\u003e podcast which discusses each episode of the mini-series — or written content — like \u003cem\u003eBinge Mode\u003c/em\u003e’s deep dive into Harry Potter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003ePodcast ad revenue is growing but is still tiny compared to other content formats\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2019, the podcast industry ad revenue is estimated to hit over $500 million dollars, having doubled each year for the past few years.

You’re probably familiar with ads on podcasts with hosts talking about a product and verbally sharing a discount code. Podcast ad attribution is very rudimentary: the common methods of attribution are vanity URLs (for instance, \u003ca href=\"http://www.ecommercewebsite.com/%3Cpodcastname\u0026amp;gt\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.ecommercewebsite.com/\u0026lt;podcastname\u0026gt;\u003c/a\u003e); promo codes entered at checkout; and surveys asking users, “How did you hear about us?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite all these issues and barriers to monetization, podcasts are still able to command a premium CPM of $25 to $50, based on downloads, due to their efficacy.

Most of these exits have been “acquihires” of small listening apps that were subsequently shut down post-acquisition. More recently, podcast studios with expertise producing popular content have also been a target of acquisition, including Stuff Media (to iHeartRadio) and Parcast (to Spotify).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eStartup trends: new apps, monetization experiments, production experiments\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s been a flurry of funding activity in podcasting — so much so that some publications are wondering if we are in a “podcast bubble” (see for example \u003ca href=\"https://www.cjr.org/the_new_gatekeepers/podcast-bubble-burst.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003ethis\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://jacobsmedia.com/podcasting-a-bubble-about-to-burst-a-slow-leak-or-just-a-chance-to-catch-our-breath/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003ethis\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2019/03/are-we-in-a-podcast-bubble.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003ethis\u003c/a\u003e).

Consumer listening apps for general podcast content\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA lot of startup activity is happening on the consumer side of listening apps: Many startups are capitalizing on the opportunity to create a better listener experience, given that Apple Podcasts is relatively simple and bare-bones, and until recently, there has been no default listening app for Android users. Issues these apps are addressing include better discovery of podcasts through algorithms, curation, or social signals; more effective ways to search for relevant content (e.g. by automatically transcribing podcasts so as to be able to search within them); or improved social features.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe on the consumer team tend to believe that better podcast discovery, recommendations, and other user-facing features alone aren’t sufficient to draw a large listener base. The core of what users are interacting with on a listening app is the content itself — after all, it’s normal for listeners to start playing audio content, then to background the app or put their phones away, so the listening app becomes secondary to the content. As a result, many podcasting startups have expressed interest in offering some flavor of exclusive content, as well as monetization options for creators, in order to further differentiate themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere’s a small sample of the approaches some of these new listening apps are taking:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCharging consumers directly for podcasts — these apps’ exclusive podcasts account for a relatively small share of all of the content available in these apps. Examples include Luminary and Brew, both of which have subscription models for access to exclusive content, in addition to allowing users to listen to widely available free podcasts.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAdding a social layer onto podcasts — to help with discovery and/or to capture the conversation happening around podcasts. Some early companies in this space include Breaker, Swoot, and others.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOffering translation and transcription — essentially enabling \u003ca href=\"https://a16z.com/2019/04/02/podcast-about-podcasting-industry-ecosystem-state-of-podcasting-2019/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eepisode-level rather than show-level discovery\u003c/a\u003e. Castbox, for instance, offers podcasts in multiple languages, as well as the ability to search within podcasts by transcribing content. The app also recently launched live audio broadcasting that allows anchors to interact with listeners via voice, text, and call-in and to earn tips from followers.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAdding context — Since podcasts expose listeners to so much new information and prompt questions, these could be more seamlessly explored without disrupting the listening experience. Entale, for example, is a “visual podcast app” that uses AI to showcase relevant information to users as the podcast is playing — this could be displaying the Amazon link to a book that someone mentions, or linking to the Wikipedia page about a speaker’s biography.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSpecializing by vertical — For parents growing increasingly cognizant of exposing kids to screen time, having a curated selection of audio content targeted towards kids, suitable for entertainment and learning, can be valuable. Leela Kids, for example, is a children’s podcast app that curates kids-safe content.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e2. Vertical consumer audio apps\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond general and for-kids podcasts, there’s also a number of adjacent audio apps with more focused content, including those targeting education, audio books, fiction, health and wellness and fitness. By focusing on a specific subject matter and going very deep, these apps aim to create \u003ca href=\"https://a16z.com/2015/01/22/the-full-stack-startup/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003efull-stack\u003c/a\u003e listening experiences that combine original content around that particular vertical; user monetization mechanisms; and other value-added features that enhance the user experience and help users achieve their goals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo give a few examples, Calm and Headspace are both guided audio meditation apps, which offer both free and subscription-only content that’s exclusive to their own platforms. Both have features beyond just the content itself that help users with mindfulness — for instance, daily reminders, streaks, visualizations and videos, etc. In the ASMR (autonomous sensory meridian response) vertical, Tingles is an app where fans can watch or listen to videos of ASMR content, filter by specific categories, and support creators through subscriptions. In the fitness category, Aaptiv, ClassPass Go, and MoveWith are examples of companies offering audio fitness classes across a variety of exercise types.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e3. Podcast production companies\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLastly, there’s a surge of venture-backed podcast production companies creating podcast content and distributing it through third-party listening platforms. Examples of these include Wondery, the studio behind a number of hit shows including \u003cem\u003eDirty John\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eDr. Death\u003c/em\u003e, and \u003cem\u003eAmerican History Tellers\u003c/em\u003e; and WaitWhat, the content incubator that developed \u003cem\u003eMasters of Scale\u003c/em\u003e with Reid Hoffman and \u003cem\u003eShould This Exist\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost podcast producers are creating entertainment-focused, general interest content that appeals to a wide audience, likely because of their monetization model, which is primarily ad-supported. Since these content studios distribute through other platforms and don’t have direct relationships with end users, they need to monetize through advertising, which necessitates content that appeals to a wide audience and promotes lengthier consumption times and ongoing listening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuccessful production studios could be prime acquisition targets for media companies as efficient sources of IP, or for consumer listening apps as a way to differentiate based on content — and a number of startups in this space have already been acquired. Another possibility is that once these content companies generate enough listener traction, they could create distribution platforms of their own, and use these as a way to deepen listener relationships and diversify revenue, for instance by charging users for, say, early access to content, back catalogs, exclusive content, or other features.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eSo what are we interested in investing in?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven the challenges with monetization, how can startups create a path to becoming a sustainable business? With the distribution and capital advantages that incumbents have — coupled with the fact that Apple and Google own the end mobile platforms, where are the opportunities for startups? And how do we evaluate these opportunities?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo understand startup opportunities, it’s important to consider where the incumbents and large audio companies like Spotify, Pandora, and iHeartRadio are uniquely advantaged:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eConsumer traction and awareness, and a large audience to which podcasts can be cross-promoted\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLarge budgets for content production and acquisition\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eUser data on preferences and existing media consumption\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eExisting monetization mechanisms, such as through ads, subscription\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo how to navigate creating a large opportunity, given the above advantages?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe think the most promising players will combine the following aspects:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFocus on \u003ci\u003eaudio\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e content broadly, rather than exclusively podcasts.\u003c/strong\u003e Just as the lines between blogs, articles, and other written content online have blurred, the same is happening with all audio content, and so we are interested in all types of content delivered via listening. As outlined above, podcasting was historically synonymous with audio distributed via RSS — now, with the rise of exclusive, paid podcasts, \u003ca href=\"https://a16z.com/2019/04/02/podcast-about-podcasting-industry-ecosystem-state-of-podcasting-2019/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003ethe distinction\u003c/a\u003e between podcasting and other audio content is becoming less meaningful.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe potential for network effects.\u003c/strong\u003e We’ve written extensively about \u003ca href=\"https://a16z.com/2016/03/07/all-about-network-effects/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003enetwork effects\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://a16z.com/2018/12/13/16-metrics-network-effects/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003ehow to measure them\u003c/a\u003e; the consumer team loves businesses with network effects! Network effects in audio could take different forms. Like many content platforms, there’s a two-sided marketplace network effect, where more high-quality content makes the platform more valuable to consumers, and more users makes it more appealing for content producers to distribute their content there. All things being equal, most users would prefer to use the platform that has the largest, best inventory of audio content. A social audio app could also have direct network effects, where the experience becomes better with more users/friends.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWhile we prefer full-stack startups that own the experience end to end (positive feedback loops from listening app to content to monetization), we wouldn’t rule out breakout apps that are strong on any one aspect.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHigh-quality differentiated and deeper content vs. broad, free libraries of shallower content.\u003c/strong\u003e Since the large incumbents seek content that appeals to their large user bases, they’re less focused on seemingly niche, in-depth content. We also believe that for certain high-value content verticals, there’s potential to shift the burden of payment to businesses, schools, or other organizations — rather than on to end consumers.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConsumption experience that enhances the experience of the audio content.\u003c/strong\u003e This could be through live, social audio, or other features that increase stickiness and engagement. For instance, Headspace’s meditation streaks, animations, multi-level categorization, and session length options differentiate and enhance the experience, compared to listening to meditation audio content on general podcast listening apps.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAlternative monetization \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ebeyond solely ads\u003c/strong\u003e (Connie Chan \u003ca href=\"https://a16z.com/2018/12/07/when-advertising-isnt-enough-multimodal-business-models-product-strategy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003ehas written\u003c/a\u003e a lot about this). Given the dominance of existing large platforms like Google and Facebook for ad targeting, it’s becoming increasingly challenging to build a new large company based on advertising alone. We are bullish about audio companies that are aiming to monetize users directly — this could be accomplished through charging for content that has higher perceived ROI, or by introducing payments as a way to alter the content experience (e.g. social recognition after tipping in live streams). More importantly, it’s also a way to align incentives of consumers with content creators.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWhat could some examples of these startups look like?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e1. Vertical audio platforms\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’re excited about startups that are going deep within a particular vertical and building a full-stack audio experience tailored to that vertical. There’s less chance of incumbents competing directly here, given the more niche focus and fundamental differences in feature sets needed to enhance the user experience. We also see greater willingness for users to pay for content that has higher perceived ROI — for instance, various fitness and meditation/wellness audio apps have already gained high levels of traction in usage and monetization.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e2. Interactive, social audio… finally\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile people have been talking about it for years, we think there’s still an opportunity to finally have truly interactive, social audio. Without being too prescriptive on what this looks like (we want founders to tell us!), the fact is, audio content today is still largely broadcast in nature, with a one-directional flow of information from creator to listener. While there are some conversations happening around audio content (including on Twitter, Reddit, and other forums), they happen in a fragmented, isolated way, and on platforms that aren’t designed for that purpose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCall-ins to radio and live talk shows are two current forms of interactive audio, with the social element fundamentally contributing to the content itself. Twitch also has podcasters who use the platform to live stream themselves while recording, sometimes responding to user comments which become part of the show’s content. There’s a number of startups enabling users to comment on static podcast content, but the social experience needs to become even more interactive to attract a wider audience and pull users off existing platforms. In China, live audio broadcast, group karaoke, and even audio dating products are flourishing, and there may be an opportunity to create an audio product that is more interactive and social for U.S. audiences, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e3. Platforms that helps creators own their end users and monetize content\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost creators are disintermediated from their end listeners, since they produce content that is distributed solely through various third-party platforms. Given the brand equity and large followings that some creators have established, we believe that there’s an opportunity to give these creators a way to distribute their own content, own their customers, and to monetize through alternative sources besides advertising and off-platform donations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome influential podcast publishers have developed their own solutions to engage and/or monetize their own audiences, including Slate Plus, \u003ca href=\"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2014/04/what-is-slate-plus-editor-david-plotz-on-slates-new-membership-program.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003ea paid membership program\u003c/a\u003e from Slate with podcast benefits including ad-free and bonus podcast; The Athletic, which \u003ca href=\"https://www.axios.com/the-athletic-launches-podcast-network-65f115a8-da39-409b-98df-80d74a325966.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003elaunched over 20 exclusive shows\u003c/a\u003e behind a paywall in April; and BBC Sounds, an app \u003ca href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/help/sounds-intro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003ethat puts music, podcasts, and radio\u003c/a\u003e from BBC into one personalized destination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut for creators who don’t have the technical or financial resources to develop their own apps or piece together various third-party solutions to accept payments or manage members, there could be a turnkey platform for creators.

According to Danny O'Brien of the digital civil rights group Electronic Frontier Foundation, the sort of censorship tools deployed by China were enormously expensive and labor--intensive. But now, as the tools become cheaper and more efficient, other countries are willing to try them too.

In 2010, when China and Japan clashed over ownership of islands in the East China Sea, \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/23/business/global/23rare.html\"\u003eBeijing halted shipments\u003c/a\u003e of rare earths to its rival, disrupting supply lines for major manufacturers like Toyota and Panasonic. But Beijing emerged weaker for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blockade was enough to alert the rest of the world to China's unchecked power over the precious minerals. A coalition of countries led by the U.S. appealed to the WTO which, in 2014, ruled that \u003ca href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-wto-rareearths/china-loses-trade-dispute-over-rare-earth-exports-idUSBREA2P0ZK20140326\"\u003eChina can't put limits\u003c/a\u003e on rare earth exports. That year, \u003ca href=\"https://cfrd8-files.cfr.org/sites/default/files/pdf/2014/10/Energy%20Report_Gholz.pdf\"\u003ean article\u003c/a\u003e published by the Council on Foreign Relations, a U.S. think tank, said \"even in the apparently most-dangerous case of rare earth elements, the problem rapidly faded.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat China can do\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeijing sets a quota for rare earth production twice a year. In the first half 2019, the cap was placed at 60,000 tons--up from 45,000 the preceding half. \"If China wanted to reduce exports of rare earths, the logical step would be to lower the mining quota,\" says Helen Lau, a metals and mining analyst at Argonaut Securities. Quotas for the remainder of the year are due in June and will be the first indicator of whether authorities are making good on their threats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeijing could claim to be lowering the quota for environmental reasons, Lau says, and a lower quota would naturally reduce the amount of rare earth available, which would limit supplies and increase costs for the U.S. But even this approach carries risk: a reduced quota limits supplies for China's more significant customers too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe U.S. \u003ca href=\"https://prd-wret.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/palladium/production/atoms/files/mcs-2019-raree.pdf\"\u003eimports 80%\u003c/a\u003e of its rare earth needs from China, but overall demand for rare earths in the U.S. is low. American demand accounted for just 4% of China's rare earth shipments, totaling around $160 million in 2018.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePartly, that's because most U.S. manufacturers that require rare earth metals have already moved to China. America's remaining industries tend to import finished rare earth products, such as magnets, which are a trickier target for China to hit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf China limits the export of finished components, the impact would affect China's domestic industry first. That might be a sacrifice Beijing is willing to make, but it would be a peculiarly forward approach. Beijing prefers indirect measures that afford the government deniability-- the recent halt of Canadian canola imports due to a \u003ca href=\"https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/2188824/china-blocks-canadian-canola-exporter-tension-sabrina-meng\"\u003ephantom pest infestation\u003c/a\u003e is proof. However, the fiery rhetoric of China\u0026#8217;s state media suggests Beijing might be desperate enough to forego pretenses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThere's ore in them thar hills\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, the U.S. is seeking alternative supplies. At a site called Mountain Pass in California's San Bernardino county, the only rare earth mine in the U.S. is back in operation. Once the world's leading supplier of rare earths, today the mine simply ships unrefined ore to China for final processing. A conglomerate called MP Materials bought the mine in 2017 after the site's previous owner, Molycorp, filed for bankruptcy, beaten on prices by China's competitiveness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"inline-image-default-width aligncenter\"  \u003e\u003ca href=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/gettyimages-566037373.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg data-attachment-id=\"2640660\" data-permalink=\"http://fortune.com/2019/05/29/china-rare-earth-metals-trade-war/september-11-2009-mountain-pass-ca-john-espinoza-looks-down-on-ground-water-that-has-accumulate/\" data-orig-file=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/gettyimages-566037373.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1024,686\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{\u0026quot;aperture\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;20\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;credit\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;Don Bartletti\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;camera\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;Canon EOS-1D Mark III\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;SEPTEMBER 11, 2009.

Venture capitalists, looking to wind down their outstanding funds, have at long last dug their heels into the fattened flanks of their portfolio companies, compelling them to list on stock exchanges, though years later than usual. The urgency to raise money from public investors had been forestalled by a new breed of deep-pocketed private investors ready to shower firms with ample, late-stage funding. The trend is perhaps best epitomized by the mega-sized cash injections of Softbank impresario Masayoshi Son, the Don Corleone of Silicon Valley, whose offers, doled out of a $100 billion, Saudi-soaked \u0026#8220;vision fund,\u0026#8221; are not to be refused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rise of Goliaths has made life more difficult for the Davids.

This is what a Bluetooth device does when it discovers that the spectrum it wants is being used by a Wi-Fi router: It jumps to a new frequency. But Bluetooth's frequency hopping works, in part, because Wi-Fi acts in a predictable way (that is, it broadcasts on a specific frequency and won't change that behavior). However, in our competition, each team's radios behave very differently and not at all predictably, making a sense-and-avoid strategy, well, senseless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, we're seeing that a better approach is to predict what the spectrum will look like in the future. Then, a radio could use those predictions to decide which frequencies might open up--even if only for a moment or two, just enough to push through even a small amount of data. More precise predictions will allow collaborating radios to capitalize on every opportunity to transmit more data, without interfering by grabbing for the same frequency at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"listicle-item\" id=\"listicle-item-2640701-3\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"listicle-content\"\u003e\u003ch2 class=\"listicle-title\"\u003eIN CASE YOU MISSED IT\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"social-icons article-byline-social article-social\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"listicle-body\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/2019/05/29/china-rare-earth-metals-trade-war/\"\u003eChina's Rare Earth Metals Aren't the Trade War Weapon Beijing Makes Them Out to Be\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cem\u003eBy Eamon Barrett\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/2019/05/29/splinternet-online-censorship/\"\u003eThe Splinternet Is Growing\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cem\u003eBy Jeff John Roberts\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/2019/05/28/trade-war-green-china/\"\u003eWhy the U.S. Should Embrace 'Green China Inc.,' Not Fight It\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cem\u003eBy Jeffrey Ball\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/2019/05/28/apple-new-ipod-touch/\"\u003eApple's Refreshed iPod Touch Is a Throwback to the $200 iPhone--Minus Its Phone\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cem\u003eBy Don Reisinger\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/2019/05/28/chips-computex-amd-nvidia-intel/\"\u003eChip Wars 2019: What Nvidia, AMD, Intel, and Dell Announced at Computex\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cem\u003eBy Aaron Pressman\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/2019/05/28/malware-laptop-auction/\"\u003eSomeone Just Paid $1.3 Million for a Laptop Infested With Malware\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cem\u003eBy Chris Morris\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/2019/05/29/hollywood-talent-giant-endeavor-board-of-directors/\"\u003eEndeavor IPO Filing Shows What the Firm is Missing: Women\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cem\u003eBy Lucinda Shen\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"listicle-item\" id=\"listicle-item-2640701-4\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"listicle-content\"\u003e\u003ch2 class=\"listicle-title\"\u003eBEFORE YOU GO\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"social-icons article-byline-social article-social\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"listicle-body\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFlying anywhere this summer\u003c/strong\u003e?

But on the flip side, she says the experience improved teamwork and employees' problem-solving skills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe execs themselves admit it was hard to unplug; to stop lurking on Slack. But, of course, there was ultimately an upside on their end too. COO Matt Pizzimenti says he gained confidence in his own parenting abilities, found new empathy for the mental burden of full-time parenting, and set firmer boundaries between home and work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe benefits of taking paternity leave are pretty undeniable, with an 11-nation study in 2016 finding that leave of one month or more makes fathers more assertive as parents, and results in them doing more housework that's usually shouldered by mothers. Yet without a direct endorsement of an extended leave, few men take it, the study says. \u003ca href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9b6cd2b6-9724-11e8-b67b-b8205561c3fe\"\u003eThat's backed up by data in the U.K.\u003c/a\u003e, where the government offers shared parental leave (though it is not fully-paid), and as few as 2% of eligible parents take advantage of it each year. The financial penalty is thought to be a factor, as are cultural barriers and the fear of workplace discrimination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Olark execs' simultaneous leaves were meant to fight back against those forces, Mandy Smith, director of people operations, told the \u003cem\u003eWSJ\u003c/em\u003e. \"When employees see the CEO and COO use our parental-leave policy and have faith that it's going to work, they think, 'Hey, I can do the same thing if I need to.'\" [bs_link link=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-bosses-who-walk-the-walk-on-paternity-leave-11558949400?mod=hp_featst_pos1\" source=\"Wall Street Journal\"] [ceo_attribution author=\"Claire Zillman\" email=\"claire.zillman@fortune.com\" twitter=\"clairezillman\"]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"listicle-item\" id=\"listicle-item-2640285-2\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"listicle-content\"\u003e\u003ch2 class=\"listicle-title\"\u003eALSO IN THE HEADLINES\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"social-icons article-byline-social article-social\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"listicle-body\"\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003e[bs_bullet_primary] \u003cstrong\u003eNetflix and defend abortion access.\u003c/strong\u003e On both the policy and corporate side, some major efforts yesterday to counter restrictive state legislation on abortion.

The original \u003cem\u003eDetective Pikachu\u003c/em\u003e game released for the Nintendo 3DS in Japan back in 2016, and worldwide in the spring of last yer. And obviously the Detective Pikachu movie has done pretty well at the box office after launching earlier this month, so a new game makes total since. The 3DS game ended on a cliffhanger and this Nintendo Switch sequel will pick up right where that last game ended and will provide a conclusion to that story. No more details have been revealed just yet but I\u0026#8217;m sure it won\u0026#8217;t be long until we\u0026#8217;re hearing more about the new \u003cem\u003eDetective Pikachu\u003c/em\u003e game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother really cool announcement from this press conference was \u003cem\u003ePokemon HOME\u003c/em\u003e, which is a new cloud-based service that will let you transfer and contain your captured Pokemon from other games in one central location. You can then trade with other Pokemon Trainers globally over the internet or with other players in your same location. \u003cem\u003ePokemon HOME\u003c/em\u003e will be able to connect with the \u003cem\u003ePokemon Bank\u003c/em\u003e, which is a similar type of service for the Nintendo 3DS, as well as \u003cem\u003ePokemon Let\u0026#8217;s Go Evee\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eLet\u0026#8217;s Go Pikachu\u003c/em\u003e which are out now on the Switch, \u003cem\u003ePokemon Sword\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eShield\u003c/em\u003e which are coming soon for the Switch, and \u003cem\u003ePokemon GO\u003c/em\u003e on smartphones. \u003cem\u003ePokemon HOME\u003c/em\u003e is expected to launch on iOS, Android, and Switch in early 2020.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/pokemonhome2.png\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/pokemonhome2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1739\" height=\"983\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-253376\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/pokemonhome2.png 1739w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/pokemonhome2-300x170.png 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/pokemonhome2-768x434.png 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/pokemonhome2-1024x579.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/pokemonhome3.png\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/pokemonhome3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1748\" height=\"978\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-253377\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/pokemonhome3.png 1748w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/pokemonhome3-300x168.png 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/pokemonhome3-768x430.png 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/pokemonhome3-1024x573.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter these pretty cool announcements, the Pokemon press conference veered into a more weird territory. First up they announced a new game (or, experience?) called \u003cem\u003ePokemon Sleep\u003c/em\u003e. They touted how \u003cem\u003ePokemon GO\u003c/em\u003e made walking into entertainment, and had the idea to do the same thing with sleep. Because we all sleep quite a bit, and might as well make use of that otherwise pointless time spent, right? \u003cem\u003ePokemon Sleep\u003c/em\u003e will track things like how long you sleep and when you wake up and somehow gamify that in a Pokemon-like way. \u003cem\u003ePokemon Sleep\u003c/em\u003e will be a smartphone app and is being developed in conjunction with Select Button who made the \u003cem\u003ePokemon Magikarp Jump\u003c/em\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://toucharcade.com/link/http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1162679453?mt=8\"\u003e(Free)\u003c/a\u003e mobile game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo how will \u003cem\u003ePokemon Sleep\u003c/em\u003e track your sleep? With a new device called the Pokemon Plus… Plus. Or rather, the Pokemon Plus+. The odd name is because it\u0026#8217;s actually a successor to the Pokemon Plus fitness tracker-style accessory that was \u003ca href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2016/09/16/pokemon-go-plus-on-sale-today-good-luck-finding-it/\"\u003ereleased back in the fall of 2016\u003c/a\u003e and enhanced your \u003cem\u003ePokemon GO\u003c/em\u003e experience. This extra-plus version will also work with \u003cem\u003ePokemon GO\u003c/em\u003e exactly like the single-plus version, so you can take it out and use it to play \u003cem\u003ePokemon GO\u003c/em\u003e like normal. But the Pokemon Plus+ actually comes equipped with an accelerometer functionality that, when placed on your bed when you go to sleep, can track some very basic sleep statistics. If you don\u0026#8217;t, like, knock it off your bed in your sleep. \u003cem\u003ePokemon Sleep\u003c/em\u003e is set to launch sometime in 2020. Oh, and for a very limited time, you can find a sleeping Snorlax inside \u003cem\u003ePokemon GO\u003c/em\u003e so be sure to pop in there right now for you chance to capture it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Pokemonsleep.png\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Pokemonsleep.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1737\" height=\"984\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-253379\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Pokemonsleep.png 1737w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Pokemonsleep-300x170.png 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Pokemonsleep-768x435.png 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Pokemonsleep-1024x580.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/pokemonsleep2.png\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/pokemonsleep2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1742\" height=\"982\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-253380\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/pokemonsleep2.png 1742w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/pokemonsleep2-300x169.png 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/pokemonsleep2-768x433.png 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/pokemonsleep2-1024x577.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/pokemonsnorlax.png\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/pokemonsnorlax.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1415\" height=\"805\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-253382\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/pokemonsnorlax.png 1415w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/pokemonsnorlax-300x171.png 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/pokemonsnorlax-768x437.png 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/pokemonsnorlax-1024x583.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the final bit of pretty weird news out of the Pokemon press conference today is… drumroll?… Pokemon Shirts.

It’s to preserve Congress’s traditional, constitutionally sanctioned role in overseeing the executive—an essential task for countering abuse of executive power regardless of the party identification of the president. And House Democrats would be doing exactly what the Framers \u003ca href=\"http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed58.asp\"\u003eenvisioned\u003c/a\u003e when they assigned to the legislature exclusive authority over borrowing and spending. For the Democrats, the only effective response to the norm-busting aggression of the Trump administration is to bust some norms themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe stakes are high.

But the interbranch battle is about more than any specific document or witness appearance. Without the power to compel testimony and obtain documents, Congress cannot fulfill its role in overseeing the executive.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCongress’s traditional tools to enforce its subpoenas are either symbolic or archaic. Refusing to comply with a congressional subpoena is a federal crime, but no one expects Trump’s Justice Department to prosecute Trump-administration officials for defying Democrat-controlled committees. The House can file a federal lawsuit to enforce a subpoena, but those cases can take \u003ca href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/09/fast-and-furious-documents-holder-1313120\"\u003eyears to resolve\u003c/a\u003e. In an earlier era, the House might have dispatched its sergeant-at-arms to arrest a subpoena scofflaw, but that option hasn’t been used in more than a half century.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRealistically, the House will not lock any administration official in jail anytime soon. What it can do is force federal agencies to shutter their doors on October 1, when the federal government’s fiscal year 2019 budget expires. Or the House could up the ante and refuse to raise the debt ceiling, in which case the federal government’s fiscal slack will likely run out in \u003ca href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/finance/444918-congress-white-house-near-deal-on-spending-debt-limit\"\u003eSeptember or October\u003c/a\u003e. Unless both chambers of Congress vote to lift the debt cap, the United States will default.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSome House Democrats realize they can capitalize on these looming deadlines. Representative Adam Schiff of California \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/30/us/politics/trump-democrats-impeachment.html\"\u003esuggested\u003c/a\u003e last month that House Democrats might tie funding for federal agencies to compliance with congressional subpoenas. A bolder move would be to add the debt ceiling to the pot. House Democrats might tell Trump: \u003cem\u003eCooperate with reasonable oversight demands, or out go the lights come autumn.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe problem, of course, is that Trump may refuse to give in to the Democrats’ threats. He will know that if the Democrats follow through, the consequences will be felt by ordinary Americans who depend upon government safety-net programs, federal workers who rely on regular paychecks, and savers who will see the value of their Treasury bonds tumble. While voters overwhelmingly faulted Trump—not congressional Democrats—for the last government shutdown, the source of the last shutdown was Trump’s insistence that Congress pay for a border wall that Trump had previously promised Mexico would fund. If they tied these bills to compliance with subpoenas, Democrats might be seen as the instigators.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, the politics are more favorable to Democrats than they might seem at first sight. House Democrats, more so than Trump, would face significant political costs if they entered a budget showdown and then folded. Many of their members—especially from solidly blue districts—could face tough primary races if they bowed to the president. The ghost of Joe Crowley, the Queens congressman deposed by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in a 2018 Democratic primary, looms large. Trump, meanwhile, has the Republican Party in a stranglehold and faces no credible primary challenge. Both sides know that if Trump blinks, most of his base will forgive him.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHouse Democrats and the president also face different constraints from their donors. If Democrats are seen as soft on Trump, the spigot of campaign cash from contributors such as the billionaire Tom Steyer may be turned off—\u003ca href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/445142-steyer-plans-impeachment-push-targeting-democrats-over-recess\"\u003eor start to flow against them\u003c/a\u003e. The last thing Republican funders want is for budget gridlock to unsettle markets. And if there is any lesson from the last shutdown, it’s that Trump will cave once an impasse inconveniences his biggest financial backers. What brought Trump to the table in January was a stoppage at \u003ca href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-25/laguardia-chaos-may-have-helped-push-trump-to-end-shutdown\"\u003eLaGuardia\u003c/a\u003e, the airport closest to Wall Street.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd Trump—as an incumbent president—is the one whose political fortunes are most closely tied to the overall economy. If a shutdown or default slows growth, or sends the stock market into a tailspin, Trump’s \u003ca href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/03/21/trump-economy-election-1230495\"\u003ebiggest electoral advantage\u003c/a\u003e entering 2020 will be lost. While he will blame the Democrats, voters tend to blame the president for adverse economic conditions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFinally, Democrats may get an assist from Trump, who \u003ca href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/12/11/trump-border-wall-congress-budget-1055433\"\u003eannounced\u003c/a\u003e last December that he was “proud to shut down the government.” His bravado helped ensure that he took the blame. This time, he has already \u003ca href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-state-union-address-2/\"\u003esaid\u003c/a\u003e that “if there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation,” an idea he amplified by blowing up last week’s meeting with top Democrats on infrastructure legislation. And yet he left himself room for maneuver—dodging a question last week from a reporter who \u003ca href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-supporting-americas-farmers-ranchers/?utm_source=link\"\u003easked\u003c/a\u003e Trump whether he would refuse to sign budget and debt bills if Congress continued its investigations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll this offers a path forward for the Democrats. The key, for them, is to make clear that congressional oversight is an established part of the American system that Trump seeks to overthrow, and to tie themselves to this mast—insisting they have no choice but to withhold funds and authorizations until the president cooperates with the investigations. And by laying out their demands for subpoena compliance early and building support among their voters and their donors, Democrats can put themselves in a position where backing down at a late date is more politically costly than following through.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf Trump recognizes that Democrats are committed to their course of action, he may see that his options have narrowed: Comply with their subpoenas or else brace for a shutdown, or an even more devastating debt default. At that point, backroom negotiations could lead to a face-saving compromise in which Congress’s oversight powers are recognized and preserved.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt is, no doubt, a risky gamble. But the alternative—allowing the president to evade congressional oversight entirely—is even riskier. House Democrats hold the better hand in this game of constitutional poker. But they can’t win the game unless they play their best cards.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/e7UPOifELXI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/e7UPOifELXI/","published":"2019-05-29T10:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-590416"},{"title":"The Presidential Tell-All Is Dead","content":"\u003cp\u003eHere we go again: another juicy book about the White House, early leaks, a round of flat denials, shortly to be followed—in all likelihood—by a set of fevered interpretations and recriminations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe book is \u003cem\u003eSiege\u003c/em\u003e, by Michael Wolff. \u003cem\u003eThe Guardian \u003c/em\u003eobtained an early copy of the book, which is due out next week, and the first details suggest that it will provide fodder for days of news coverage and debate—following in the path of Wolff’s previous book, 2018’s \u003cem\u003eFire and Fury\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYet it’s hard to imagine \u003cem\u003eSiege \u003c/em\u003eachieving the same impact as its predecessor.

It featured a president who disregarded all norms, a public that couldn’t look away, and lots of current and former staffers with axes to grind, making them the perfect sources for, or authors of, exposés.

During the Cold War, the U.S. agenda was how do we get Hafez Assad on our side? When the civil war started in Lebanon, the Americans wanted him to protect the Christians. And in the early 1990s, the American agenda was to amass this coalition to go after Saddam. Bashar was cooperating with the U.S on intelligence sharing before the invasion of Iraq, after 9/11. But when he realized they might be going after him he calculated that he had better start a pre-emptive war in Iraq to protect the regime. American calculations changed again because they needed to save face in Iraq, so there was a re-engagement period between 2007 and 2010. The Assad regime knows how the West deals with this part of the world and it can wait because it figures it\u0026rsquo;s not going anywhere.

The regime understands there\u0026#8217;s only so far it can go with rehabilitating Bashar\u0026rsquo;s image, even domestically. What they\u0026#8217;re doing instead is relying on their old trick: brute, naked fear. I\u0026#8217;ve heard from a number of Syrians that the regime\u0026rsquo;s message to them\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eis \u0026#8220;we\u0026#8217;re on top of you again.\u0026#8221; They\u0026#8217;ve re-instated a lot of the statues of Hafez, the \u003c/span\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eMukhabarat\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003e [secret police] is telling people we\u0026#8217;re back, you\u0026rsquo;d better watch what you say. In terms of the West, some countries have re-engaged with the regime but it\u0026rsquo;s mainly intelligence sharing at this point. I don\u0026#8217;t see Bashar and Asma being able to pull off a rehabilitation of their image.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cb\u003eRussia and some Western commentators have suggested there is more public support for Assad than has been acknowledged. What sense do you have of Syrian public sentiment toward the regime after Assad\u0026rsquo;s victory?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003ePeople are making pragmatic choices but I don\u0026#8217;t think that tells the whole story. You have to remember that half of the population is either internally displaced or abroad and most of these people do not support Assad.

But for many, they were not defending Assad, they were defending themselves against an existential threat. The same applies to other minorities: many Christians and Druze [a religious minority] sympathized with the protesters and took part in at least the peaceful period of the protests before they realized, yes, the regime may be awful but look at the other side. Even the Sunnis came to that conclusion\u0026mdash;but it was more like resignation than support. A lot of urban Sunnis are now questioning the benefits of Assad\u0026rsquo;s victory and starting to have second thoughts. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhether it\u0026rsquo;s Saudi Crown Prince Mohamad bin Salman (MBS), Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el Sisi, or Libya\u0026rsquo;s Khalifa Haftar, the notion of \u0026#8220;a man we can do business with\u0026#8221; seems to persist. Have any lessons have been learned from Syria?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eI\u0026#8217;m glad you brought up MBS because the script has been pretty much the same as it was with Bashar. In the late 1990s, all these articles were written before Bashar took power, touting him as a young reformer. There was actually a headline for a story\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eon Bashar in a Saudi-owned newspaper, \u0026#8220;reform under the umbrella of continuity and stability\u0026#8221;, that was almost exactly the same as the one they used for MBS years later. The leverage that the Saudis have are contracts and money and oil. The leverage the likes of Assad have is terrorism and refugees: always reminding Europe and the U.S. that if you come after us it\u0026#8217;s going to be the refugees and the terrorists again. So, these countries calculate that they had better just shut that door. You hear statements from Europe like, let the Syrians figure it out for themselves, it\u0026rsquo;s not our problem. With Iran and Russia behind him, Bashar\u0026rsquo;s grip on the country is too tight for that to work, unfortunately.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cb\u003eOne of your most important sources was Manaf Tlass, who defected in 2012. How did that relationship come about?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eI first met Manaf in Paris in 2014 for an article I was writing for the Wall Street \u003c/span\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eJournal\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003e. I was aware he was a controversial figure but I think he offers invaluable insights into the regime. The Tlass family, alongside the Assads, helped build the regime that has been at the helm of Syria for 50 years. It was certainly a difficult process. Manaf sees himself as a hero who was misunderstood and wasn\u0026#8217;t given a chance by the West, somebody who challenged Bashar and refused to participate in the killing of Syrians. He thought the book was going to help people understand his motivations. I made it clear that I would be looking at the full picture rather than trying to clear his family name. His wife was completely against him talking to me. She even asked to meet with me to dissuade me from pursuing this.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhat\u0026rsquo;s the key message you\u0026rsquo;d like readers to take away from \u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eAssad or We Burn the Country\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003e?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eThe Assad family\u0026rsquo;s atrocities and crimes concern the whole world not just Syrians.\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eThe most important element for me is the similarity between what Bashar did and what his father did. Under the pretext of fighting terrorism Hafez massacred civilians in Hama in 1982 and later Bashar used the same excuse to go after those who were defying him. Both went after the peaceful activists first, vilifying them and putting them all together in the same category as terrorists, then there was the collective punishment. It\u0026#8217;s the same playbook. Even the torture methods were similar. So were the reactions of some other countries. During the Hafez era the U.S. was saying, OK, this is an awful regime, look at what they\u0026#8217;re doing to their people, they\u0026#8217;re sponsoring terrorism abroad, but we have all these other problems to deal with so maybe we shouldn\u0026#8217;t make as much of a big deal out of it. We heard variations of this after 2011 especially as the conflict became bloodier. The book also helps people understand the methodology behind the regime\u0026rsquo;s image-making, the tools of its deception. I think that aspect is not well understood\u0026mdash;how they have gotten away with murder so far.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eAssad or We Burn the Country: How One Family\u0026rsquo;s Lust for Power Destroyed Syria (Little, Brown) is published May 28 \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/time/topstories/~4/A1Si9kPPCJY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/A1Si9kPPCJY/","published":"2019-05-29T09:53:14Z","guid":"http://time.com/?p=5595411"},{"title":"Australia’s ‘Egg Boy,’ Who Assaulted a Senator, Is Giving Legal Defense Funds to Mosque Shooting Victims","content":"\u003caside class=\"right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad\" id=\"right-rail__ad-5597431\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module video-2\" data-src=\"http://time.com/5597431/australia-egg-boy-will-connolly-donation-christchurch-mosque-shooting/\" data-widget-id=\"SB_4\" data-ob-template=\"timemag\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeenage protester \u003ca href=\"http://time.com/5553381/australia-egg-boy-fundraiser/\" \u003eWill Connolly\u003c/a\u003e, dubbed \u0026#8220;egg boy\u0026#8221; after video of him smashing an egg on the head of an Australian senator went viral, announced Tuesday that he was donating the $70,000 raised for his legal expenses to victims of the New Zealand mosque attacks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA day after the Christchurch massacre that killed 51 people in March, Connolly smashed an egg on the back of Senator Fraser Anning\u0026#8217;s head while the politician was talking to reporters.

Michelle Carras, an independent contractor on public mental health issues who has published research on gaming behavior, does not rule out that some gaming behavior can be problematic, but notes that some of the studies highlighting the addictive and all-consuming nature of gaming, include not just gaming but general internet and smartphone use, and therefore may not measure gaming\u0026rsquo;s specific effect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;The problem with gaming and other\u0026#8230;new media is that they produce a different culture,\u0026rdquo; says Carras, who also considers herself a gamer. \u0026ldquo;But clinicians are approaching this behavior from an understanding of a disorder based on a continuum of normative, recreational and problematic use rather than from the setting or context of a unique, new culture.\u0026rdquo; Carras, for example, points out that gaming fulfills a participatory and social need for some.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRather than singling out gaming, Carras and others support the idea of researching internet use and potentially problematic dependence on technology more broadly, to better understand some of the commonalities that patterns of gaming, social media and internet use might share.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the very least, however, the inclusion of gaming disorder in the ICD may raise awareness about potentially concerning ways that people rely on gaming, and trigger new research on it as well as other technology-related behaviors that will only continue to grow as devices and internet access reach more and more people around the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/time/topstories/~4/N1Wq0UxHyuQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/N1Wq0UxHyuQ/","published":"2019-05-29T09:00:58Z","guid":"http://time.com/?p=5597258"},{"title":"Experts Say ‘How Much’ is the Wrong Way to Assess Screen Time","content":"\u003caside class=\"right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad\" id=\"right-rail__ad-5592329\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module\" data-src=\"http://time.com/5592329/experts-say-how-much-is-the-wrong-way-to-assess-screen-time/\" data-widget-id=\"SB_2\" data-ob-template=\"timemag\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWay back in the late 1990s\u0026mdash;not long after home Internet use became widespread in the U.S.\u0026mdash;researchers started turning up links between time spent on computers and poor mental health.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/cpb.1998.1.25\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003eA 1998 study\u003c/a\u003e in the journal \u003cem\u003eCyberPsychology and Behavior\u003c/em\u003e found heavy internet use\u0026mdash;defined as 38 hours or more of non-work, non-school online activity\u0026mdash;was associated with \u0026ldquo;significant social, psychological, and occupational impairments.\u0026rdquo; The study authors wrote that such use \u0026ldquo;caused detrimental effects such as poor grade performance among students, discord among couples, and reduced work performance among employees.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlash forward two decades, and researchers continue to find connections between heavy screen use and negative outcomes.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5574844/\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003eA 2017 study\u003c/a\u003e of U.S. adults found spending six hours or more a day watching TV or using computers was associated with a higher risk for depression.

While it sounds like a simple question, experts say the \u0026ldquo;just right\u0026rdquo; amount depends on what type of screen a person is looking at, why they\u0026rsquo;re looking at it, and\u0026mdash;maybe most importantly\u0026mdash;what they\u0026rsquo;re forgoing in order to spend time on screens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Content and context matter,\u0026rdquo; says Doreen Dodgen-Magee, an Oregon-based psychologist and author of \u003ca href=\"https://doreendm.com/coming-soon-1\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eDeviced!

Democrats took the governor’s mansion in Colorado, Michigan, New Mexico, and Wisconsin. In Colorado and New Mexico, they now have a “trifecta” — governor and both legislative houses. Running for governor in Colorado, Jared Polis supported a new renewable energy standard of 100 percent by 2040; with Democratic majorities in the state legislature, he might get it passed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ENiGbY\"\u003eRenewables are on the rise in the West, popular with politicians, cities, corporations, and ordinary ratepayers. It is to Xcel’s benefit to get ahead of the curve and give the people what they want. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"pRmVkY\"\u003eFourth, Xcel would very much like to build more stuff. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"pQ4zML\"\u003eIt is a vertically integrated monopoly. The areas in which it operates have not been “restructured,” i.e., generation has not been split off from transmission and distribution. Xcel owns and runs all of that stuff. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"pT2VA4\"\u003eRegulated monopoly utilities, as I’ve explained in \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/9/9/9287719/utilities-monopoly\"\u003eprevious stories\u003c/a\u003e, do not make money on the power they sell or the fuel they buy. They make money by drawing a rate of return on investments in power infrastructure. These “rate-based” investments are the utility’s bread and butter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"v74bj4\"\u003eIn a broad sense, the shift to renewables is good for such utilities. When they shift from existing fossil fuel plants to new renewable energy, they shift from fuel (coal and natural gas) costs, which they make no money on, to investments in new renewable energy power plants, new batteries to store power and electric car chargers to help electrify the vehicle fleet, and tons of new transmission lines, much of which they can rate-base.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"fPmWCj\"\u003eThese goals (perhaps combined with a new, more stringent RPS in Colorado) will help Xcel get permission from regulators to depreciate lots of uneconomic old fossil-fuel assets (which activists have been hassling it about anyway) and build, build, build a bunch of new stuff. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"lu0FYr\"\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"\u003e\n\u003cp lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003eRate base!

(Many ratepayer advocates worry that utilities like Duke are taking advantage of this dynamic, using clean energy as an excuse to build stuff that local, distributed energy could handle better — but that’s a different post.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"UhummV\"\u003eA more interesting question is how this might affect Xcel’s monopoly status. On one hand, riding a political wave as a climate champion allows it to stay ahead of grumbling or desire for restructuring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"r7qHic\"\u003eOn the other hand, Xcel suddenly needing so much clean energy might help grease the skids for \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/7/31/17611288/california-energy-grid-regionalization-caiso-wecc-iso\"\u003eregionalization\u003c/a\u003e, i.e., the creation of a restructured Western wholesale power market run by a regional transmission operator (RTO).

And the announcement leaves many, many details unspecified, including plans to shut down fossil fuel plants and transition plans for affected communities. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"JyJWJH\"\u003eNonetheless, it shows that incentives are beginning to align in a hopeful way.

Kamala Harris (D-CA)\u003c/a\u003e reminded voters and was reminded herself that the United States Senate is a sizable obstacle to any Democratic agenda.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"PF8lTa\"\u003e“2020 is about the White House but it’s also about the United States Senate,” Harris told the audience in Spartanburg, South Carolina.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"WMX98T\"\u003eThe California senator made the case for her 2020 presidential candidacy. Harris defended \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/5/28/18642558/kamala-harris-abortion-voting-rights-act\"\u003eher plan to stop states from restricting abortion rights\u003c/a\u003e, called the family separation crisis “a human rights abuse being committed by the United States government” and promised to prosecute the case against Donald Trump and his associates if elected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"mQdQJY\"\u003eBut the specter of the United States Senate — and the difficulty Democrats will have securing a bare majority, much less a 60-vote filibuster-proof supermajority that can pass everything without Republican buy-in — hung over much of the conversation. It would be a barrier to Harris’s plan to require states to get preclearance from the Justice Department before they could institute new abortion restrictions. It makes impeachment exceedingly unlikely unless there is a dramatic shift in Republican leadership’s political calculus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"iuDv51\"\u003eThe town hall discussion was meandering, to put it generously. Harris fielded vague questions from MSNBC host Lawrence O’Donnell about the news of the day, including Mitch McConnell’s comments about filling a Supreme Court vacancy in an election year and GOP Rep. Justin Amash’s call for impeachment. The show ended with a (perhaps tongue-in-cheek) audience query about whether Harris would make MSNBC host Rachel Maddow her vice president. It was not the deepest policy debate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"U3mXbH\"\u003eBut there were a few notable moments, starting with a question about the plan to protect abortion rights that Harris rolled out earlier the same day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"dLEu6V\"\u003e1) Harris says her abortion preclearance proposal can pass SCOTUS muster\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"QMpXYf\"\u003eAs states pass new restrictions that would outlaw all but the very earliest abortions, Harris’s campaign announced Tuesday her proposal to prevent states from interfering with women’s ability to get an abortion. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"wfksAH\"\u003eStates with a history of restricting abortion access would have to receive permission, or preclearance, from the US Justice Department in order to enact new abortion laws. Her plan is explicitly based on the Voting Rights Act, which had required states with a history of systematic racial discrimination get the DOJ’s okay before they instituted new election laws.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"SuT477\"\u003eBut that part of the VRA was invalidated by the Supreme Court in 2013, with Chief Justice John Roberts saying the days of Jim Crow laws were too far in the past to be held against the states now. O’Donnell — after noting such a proposal would somehow need to pass the Senate — asked how Harris’s plan would navigate that precedent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"NkHPze\"\u003eHarris noted that her plan would require states to seek preclearance based on the last 25 years, a stipulation that explicitly caters to the standard Roberts set in his VRA decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"hxDQIH\"\u003eAfter that, she said the Justice Department would evaluate new state laws on one question: “Are they conforming with the Constitution as interpreted by the Supreme Court?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"Zxpn2W\"\u003e2) Harris says the family separations crisis was “a human rights abuse”\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"TFfAPZ\"\u003eHarris used the strongest possible language to condemn the Trump administration’s policy of separating migrant parents from their children when they try to enter the United States, which sparked an outcry in 2018.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"T7CtUi\"\u003e“That was a human rights abuse being committed by the United States government,” Harris said, “and it’s against the moral and values of who we are as a nation.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"7EJXYR\"\u003eLater, she endorsed comprehensive immigration reform, although she didn’t explain exactly what that would mean except to say there should be a pathway for undocumented immigrants to become United States citizens. She did note that such a plan had received bipartisan support in the past; an immigration bill passed with 68 votes back in 2013. (It went on to die in the Republican-held House.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"5TRaCw\"\u003eIn terms of a major bill that could conceivably get buy-in from both parties to clear the Senate’s 60-vote threshold, immigration would rank high. But Trump won the Republican primary running on a virulently anti-migrant campaign and some of the GOP supporters of that 2013 bill (John McCain, Lamar Alexander) will no longer be in the Senate in 2021. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"d6uTka\"\u003eOnce again, the difficulty of the Senate for Democrats sneaks up on Harris’s (and any other Democrat’s) plans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"XDqCuu\"\u003e3) “The evidence supports the prosecution of that case.”\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"5MmAZG\"\u003eA Democratic voter asked Harris if she would support impeaching Donald Trump and seeing the process through to the very end, no matter what the outcome in the Senate, which would be left to decide whether or not to remove Trump from office if the House did vote to impeach him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"MmAXXi\"\u003eHarris, who already urged the House last month to start impeachment proceedings, said she would. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"rXekhW\"\u003eThe voter also asked if Harris as president would prosecute Donald Trump or any of his close associates for any wrongdoing uncovered by federal investigators or Congress. (A lot of inquiries are ongoing, even with special counsel Robert Mueller finished.) This is starting to become a regular subject for Democratic candidates; Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, who is also running for the nomination, said recently he would not pardon Trump if elected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"yhrIj1\"\u003e“The evidence supports the prosecution of that case,” Harris said. “There needs to be transparency, accountability ...

You were talking about people who have done terrible things on \u003cem\u003eThe Americans\u003c/em\u003e, but they were fictional, so there was that added layer of remove. How does the question of depicting bad things while not endorsing them change when you’re dealing with real people, as opposed to if you’re dealing with purely fictional creations like Philip and Elizabeth?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"t2Repc\"\u003eJoel Fields\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"nxZTEu\"\u003eYour question goes to the \u003cem\u003ewhy now\u003c/em\u003e. It’s an interesting story, it’s a fascinating marriage, it’s exciting to see them do what they did, but why tell the story now? And your question to me really goes to the answer to that, which is this moment when we’re reconsidering the role of power in society and power in the creation of art, and particularly considering the perception of powerful men, and how they have used and abused that power over time. This is a chance to look at that and to ask the question, “Why is Bob Fosse remembered, but Gwen Verdon isn’t?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"OZIs45\"\u003eI’m sitting in my office, and literally I am under a \u003cem\u003eCan-Can\u003c/em\u003e poster that has been with me since day one of \u003cem\u003eThe Americans\u003c/em\u003e. I love \u003cem\u003eCan-Can\u003c/em\u003e. It’s the show that made Gwen Verdon famous. But unless you’re a pretty serious theater geek, you don’t know about her extended standing ovation in the middle of that show, and you don’t know that when you’re looking at Bob Fosse’s work, in many ways you’re looking at her work. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"XqI3Kw\"\u003eSo the dual question is: Why do we perceive these men to be the sole creators when so often there’s a team of people, or often there’s a woman standing so close behind them, just out of frame? And why were these men allowed to behave the way they did, and how was it accepted? Those are important questions to ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"aQpO4q\"\u003eYou do that by trying to be truthful — not trying to lay out every fact, because you can arrange a series of facts to tell any story you want, but to try to be truthful to who the characters were and to what they experienced. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"dOgHlH\"\u003eThat was challenging on this [show] because the story of their lives is very complicated, and the story of the genesis of their characters is complicated, and one wants to try to build it in as honest a way as possible without using the facts to explain away the behavior, but rather to try to pick the right way to tell the story that will provoke discussion about the behavior.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\"Fosse/Verdon\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A0SLsCJ9el-A2NCwk8Mdd7j22CQ=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16304991/FV_257.jpg\"\u003e\n      \u003ccite\u003eFX\u003c/cite\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003eNights on Broadway.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"OBlanI\"\u003eTodd VanDerWerff\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"twXAoO\"\u003eYou bringing up the idea of how art is collaborative makes me think about how, with Gwen, we’re almost seeing her through three different spheres on this show. There’s the writers’ conception of her, the director’s conception, and then what Michelle Williams brings to the part, which is some of the best acting I’ve ever seen on television. And it’s interesting to parse out the question of how those three separate lenses affect what we in the audience see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"0FlHxd\"\u003eJoel Fields\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"yAtake\"\u003eI’ll broaden the lens even further for you just for fun. In success, the hand of the artist doesn’t really show. So you’re looking at the brilliance of Michelle’s performance, or Sam’s performance, of course. They’re there, so you remember them. Maybe you think about the director, maybe you think about the showrunners or the writers because that’s what’s culturally cool to think about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"x2T83a\"\u003eBut how many times when you watch a show do you think about the costume design, and what that does to define the way you’re experiencing the characters? If you’re thinking about it, the costume designer hasn’t done a very good job, but if you’re not, then he or she has. The same with the production designer, and the same with the cinematographer, and every member of that lighting crew, and the post-production team, and the editor, and on, and on, and on. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"lK22T3\"\u003eWe who work in television or theater know that anything we put out there is the work of an incredible team of artists collaborating. When it works well, we’re all rowing in the same direction, magic happens, and then a couple people get the credit, which we know is a lie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"EJ8Waj\"\u003eTodd VanDerWerff\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"BJt2mR\"\u003eYes! I have \u003ca href=\"http://www.ardenpodcast.com\"\u003ethis scripted podcast I work on\u003c/a\u003e, and to me, I only see the flaws and then the ways our actors cover up those flaws. But when I read positive reviews of it, people are often, like, “Oh, the writers did this,” or “The writers did that,” and I’m always saying, “No, the actors saved our skins so many times!” And what that experience and \u003cem\u003eFosse/Verdon\u003c/em\u003e have made me think about is how the way we talk about art needs to change, but also how hard it is to change the way we talk about art.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"6VSBMl\"\u003eJoel Fields\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Tfahu6\"\u003eThat’s right, because one cannot have an objective truth about art. First of all there is too much input in the system, and the system is too complex, so even if you’re there every moment, you have everybody’s different experience of things. What you can note, is that it’s a complex system. You \u003cem\u003ecan\u003c/em\u003e see a consistent throughline to any one person’s work. But that doesn’t mean each piece of work isn’t a collaboration. Really, what you may be learning about is the way that artist collaborates, and maybe there’s a unity to that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"2fblIE\"\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.2493%;\"\u003e\u003ciframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/03HPo0vqq54?rel=0\" style=\"border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"3DXfZc\"\u003eTodd VanDerWerff\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"rldvp9\"\u003eBut when you, as a writer and a producer, when you see a moment like when \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03HPo0vqq54\"\u003eMichelle is on the phone\u003c/a\u003e, pretending to have had throat surgery, so she can’t talk, and all she can do is rasp, and it ends up being so amazing, are you a little, like, “Our work here is done!”?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"HFKEEk\"\u003eJoel Fields\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"rkh09r\"\u003eOh my God. It’s so beautiful. That episode was filled with so many scenes that one feels so incredibly safe writing for Tommy Kail to direct and Sam Rockwell and Michelle Williams to perform. There are often scenes that come out very differently than what is imagined, and you see an actor completely transform something, and then there are other times when an actor just sinks into what you’ve written in a way that’s so beautifully true. Either way you feel like you’re in safe hands with that kind of thing. We loved writing that scene, but boy, it was great to watch the dailies on that scene.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"2BjT5p\"\u003eTodd VanDerWerff\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"R93rCW\"\u003eI talked to you a lot while you worked on \u003cem\u003eThe Americans\u003c/em\u003e, and you were always bringing up the people at every level of that show where you trusted them and knew they were going to do great work. But when you only have eight episodes for something like \u003cem\u003eFosse/Verdon\u003c/em\u003e, how do you assemble that team you trust so quickly?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"4CuOEv\"\u003eJoel Fields\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"nIoxe7\"\u003eSometimes, you try to pick people you know, or you pick people whom other people you respect recommend. And you try to create an environment which allows people to do their best. For me that involves a combination of knowing exactly what direction you want to pursue creatively, all the while being very open to other collaborators having other points of view, or having different ways to get there. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"JOIteK\"\u003eIt’s a funny thing. It’s like a big group marriage. You’ve got to navigate everybody’s personalities.

I think it’s notable that Neil Simon was Bob Fosse’s best friend, and that they met on a show but then Neil absolutely refused to work with him again because he said “I want to stay friends.” Paddy Chayefsky absolutely refused to work with him because he wanted to stay friends. One can say all one wants that “you have to be crazy to be a genius,” but that wasn’t true of Neil Simon, apparently. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Hwa7Mr\"\u003eIt’s very easy to use those things as excuses for bad behavior, but in my experience they’re really not connected. I think again in terms of the moment in time in which we’re living, that’s a valuable lesson and it’s an important one to remember.

Sam, the way he’s chosen to play Bob, it’s a much slower burn. I love that the fact you’re really feeling the heat in six and seven, as it were. The fact he has been courageous enough to go as an actor to a place where you don’t know whether to love him or hate him; you don’t know whether it’s from insecurity or certitude; you don’t know whether it’s because he desperately needs another success, or because he believes in something artistic and he’s being manipulative, or because he’s just being a vindictive SOB. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ga1HOL\"\u003eProbably the truth is all of those things at once, and Bob probably can’t even know for sure.

At Common’s Williamsburg Brooklyn location, a private bedroom in a suite with a shared bathroom and other roommates starts at $2,130. The median price for a full one-bedroom apartment elsewhere in Williamsburg is a bit more, at $2,840.

Prime minister Scott Morrison\u0026#8217;s ruling coalition remained in power, despite all expectations to the contrary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the surprise outcomes of the Brexit referendum and the election of Donald Trump as US president, what now feels like the most predictable outcome of any election is that the pollsters will be wrong. There are many reasons why they keep getting it wrong, including \u003ca href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-fivethirtyeight-gave-trump-a-better-chance-than-almost-anyone-else/\"\u003econfirmation bias\u003c/a\u003e, when journalists and pollsters looking for data that validates their prior beliefs. It could also be the nature of some of these events is so unusual they were impossible to predict.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForecasts rely on data from the past, and while we now have better data than ever—and better techniques and technology with which to measure them—when it comes to forecasting, in many ways, data has never been more useless. And as data become more integral to our lives and the technology we rely upon, we must take a harder look at the past before we assume it tells us anything about the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo some extent, the weaknesses of data has always existed. Data are, by definition, information about what has happened in the past. Because populations and technology are constantly changing, they alter how we respond to incentives, policy, opportunities available to us, and even social cues. This undermines the accuracy of everything we try to forecast: elections, financial markets, even how long it will take to get to the airport.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there is reason to believe we are experiencing more change than before. The economy is undergoing a major structural change by becoming more globally integrated, which increases some risks while reducing others, while technology has changed how we transact and communicate. I\u0026#8217;ve \u003ca href=\"https://qz.com/1579785/why-hollywood-makes-so-many-bad-movies/\"\u003ewritten before how\u003c/a\u003e it\u0026#8217;s now impossible for the movie industry to forecast hit films. Review-aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes undermines traditional marketing plans and the rise of the Chinese market means film makers must account for different tastes. Meanwhile streaming has changed how movies are consumed and who watches them. All these changes mean data from 10, or even five, years ago tell producers almost nothing about movie-going today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe are in the age of big data that offers to promise of more accurate predictions. But it seems in some of the most critical aspects of our lives, data has never been more wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eCan we trust polls anymore?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTake this \u003ca href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-fivethirtyeight-gave-trump-a-better-chance-than-almost-anyone-else/\"\u003eexplanation from Nate Silver\u003c/a\u003e about what went wrong in the 2016 election, where he gave Trump a 29% chance of winning the election, much higher odds than almost everyone else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eFiveThirtyEight’s probabilities are based on the accuracy of polling averages in presidential elections dating back to 1972. That is, our models are based on how accurate polls have or haven’t been historically, instead of making idealized assumptions about them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is the best practice. You need to ground your projections in something, and data from the past is the best we\u0026#8217;ve got. Elections forecasts are estimates are based on polling a small subset of potential voters. Models make predictions about who will actually turn out and how undecided and swing voters will vote. But those projections are based on how they behaved in the past; often on elections in a completely different climate with two fairly standard candidates. Many models failed in 2016 because they assumed past elections would be somewhat like the 2012 or 2008 or earlier elections. Normally that would be a fair assumption, but not in 2016, nor with Brexit, nor in Australia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eHas economic policy become less effective?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis isn\u0026#8217;t just undermining polling. Economic policy markers also operate under the assumption the present will be like the past. In a video on the \u003ca href=\"https://www.nber.org/#\"\u003ewebsite of the National Bureau of Economic Research\u003c/a\u003e, economist Laura Veldkamp discussed the low-interest rate environment in the years following the financial crisis. She argues the world has changed since the crisis. People are now more risk averse and will pay more for risk-free assets, which she speculates is why interest rates have stayed so low. Interest rates are a market price, set at auction. When more investors want low-risk assets, like government bonds, there are more bidders driving prices higher, and rates lower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf it\u0026#8217;s true that investors fear risk more and will pay a higher price for safety, the old relationships around risk taking will no longer apply. Take the Federal Reserve\u0026#8217;s policy of trying to boost the economy by cutting rates, based on the hope lower rates will induce investors to speculate with their money. But if investors are more risk-averse, they\u0026#8217;ll tolerate lower rates and not take more chances. This means monetary policy tools will be less predictable or effective for the foreseeable future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThe way forward\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese challenges will become more apparent in the coming years as we become more dependent on data. Big data—enormous sets of information based on many observations—can be a valuable tool, shaping how corporations make business decisions and how they market their products and ideas. Data also powers artificial intelligence, so it can learn, update, and be more accurate. Data may be heralded as the \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/platform/amp/the-highlight/2019/5/14/18520783/harvard-economics-chetty?utm_campaign=vox\u0026amp;utm_content=entry\u0026amp;utm_medium=social\u0026amp;utm_source=twitter\u0026amp;__twitter_impression=true\"\u003eanswer\u003c/a\u003e to \u003ca href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/digital-mckinsey/our-insights/big-data-the-next-frontier-for-innovation\"\u003eeverything\u003c/a\u003e but even if the information is newer and bigger, how do you know if your data provides useful insights about the future?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe answer may come from the same place it did in the past: theory. Because data rarely speaks for itself, it needs a story to guide it. For example, in the case of long-term interest rates, if you relied on all previous interest-rate data, they may lead you to assume interest rates will rise soon. But if you had a theory that told you investors now value low-risk assets more, you\u0026#8217;d know to put a larger weight on more recent data. The successful data users of the future—pollsters, economists, or even pure data scientists—will require more than training about how to use that information, but an intellectual framework to understand and make sense of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://qz.com/1623596/what-if-all-the-data-we-use-is-wrong/","published":"2019-05-29T11:00:27Z","guid":"https://qz.com/1623596//"},{"title":"Plastic bags are killing the deer in Japan’s ancient capital of Nara","content":"\u003cimg width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/RTS1HRPK.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;w=1024\" class=\"attachment-medium_10 size-medium_10 wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/RTS1HRPK.jpg 4000w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/RTS1HRPK.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/RTS1HRPK.jpg?resize=50,33 50w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/RTS1HRPK.jpg?resize=160,107 160w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/RTS1HRPK.jpg?resize=320,213 320w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/RTS1HRPK.jpg?resize=640,427 640w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/RTS1HRPK.jpg?resize=940,627 940w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/RTS1HRPK.jpg?resize=1600,1067 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe famous and sacred deer of Nara, Japan\u0026#8217;s former imperial capital, attract tourists from the world over.

They are insidious, creeping up on you slowly until you don’t even notice the damage they’re causing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBad habits slow you down, decrease your accuracy, make you less creative, and stifle your performance. Getting control of your bad habits is critical, and not just for productivity’s sake. A University of Minnesota study found that people who exercise a high degree of self-control tend to be much happier than those who don’t, both in the moment and in the long run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome bad habits cause more trouble than others, and the nine that follow are the worst offenders.

Impulsively surfing the internet.\u003c/strong\u003e It takes you 15 consecutive minutes of focus before you can fully engage in a task. Once you do, you fall into a euphoric state of increased productivity called flow. Research shows that people in a flow state are five times more productive than they otherwise would be. When you click out of your work because you get an itch to check the news, Facebook, a sports score, or what have you, this pulls you out of flow. This means you have to go through another 15 minutes of continuous focus to reenter the flow state. Click in and out of your work enough times, and you can go through an entire day without experiencing flow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2. Perfectionism.\u003c/strong\u003e Most writers spend countless hours brainstorming characters and plot, and they even write page after page that they know they’ll never include in the book. They do this because they know that ideas need time to develop. We tend to freeze up when it’s time to get started because we know that our ideas aren’t perfect and what we produce might not be any good. But how can you ever produce something great if you don’t get started and give your ideas time to evolve? Author Jodi Picoult summarized the importance of avoiding perfectionism perfectly: “You can edit a bad page, but you can’t edit a blank page.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3. Meetings.\u003c/strong\u003e Meetings gobble up your precious time like no other. Ultra-productive people avoid meetings as much as humanly possible. They know that a meeting will drag on forever if they let it, so when they must have a meeting they inform everyone at the onset that they’ll stick to the intended schedule. This sets a clear limit that motivates everyone to be more focused and efficient.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e4. Responding to e-mails as they arrive.\u003c/strong\u003e Productive people don’t allow their e-mail to be a constant interruption. In addition to checking their e-mail on a schedule, they take advantage of features that prioritize messages by sender. They set alerts for their most important vendors and their best customers, and they save the rest until they reach a stopping point in their work. Some people even set up an autoresponder that lets senders know when they’ll be checking their e-mail again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cspan class=\"pull-quote\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"quote-line\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“By constant self-discipline and self-control you can develop greatness of character.”—Grenville Kleiser\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"quote-line\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e5. Hitting the snooze button.\u003c/strong\u003e When you sleep, your brain moves through an elaborate series of cycles, the last of which prepares you to be alert at your wake up time. This is why you’ll sometimes wake up right before your alarm clock goes off—your brain knows it’s time to wake up and it’s ready to do so. When you hit the snooze button and fall back asleep, you lose this alertness and wake up later, tired and groggy. Worst of all, this grogginess can take hours to wear off. So no matter how tired you think you are when your alarm clock goes off, force yourself out of bed if you want to have a productive morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e6. Multitasking.\u003c/strong\u003e Multitasking is a real productivity killer. Research conducted at Stanford University confirms that multitasking is less productive than doing a single thing at a time. The researchers found that people who are regularly bombarded with several streams of electronic information cannot pay attention, recall information, or switch from one job to another as well as those who complete one task at a time. When you try to do two things at once, your brain lacks the capacity to perform both tasks successfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what if some people have a special gift for multitasking? The Stanford researchers compared groups of people, based on their tendency to multitask and their belief that it helps their performance. They found that heavy multitaskers—those who multitasked a lot and felt that it boosted their performance—were actually worse at multitasking than those who liked to do a single thing at a time. The frequent multitaskers performed worse because they had more trouble organizing their thoughts and filtering out irrelevant information, and they were slower at switching from one task to another. Ouch!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e7. Putting off tough tasks.\u003c/strong\u003e We have a limited amount of mental energy, and as we exhaust this energy, our decision-making and productivity decline rapidly. This is called decision fatigue. When you put off tough tasks till late in the day because they’re intimidating, you save them for when you’re at your worst. To beat decision fatigue, you must tackle complex tasks in the morning when your mind is fresh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e8. Using your phone, tablet, or computer in bed.\u003c/strong\u003e This is a big one that most people don\u0026#8217;t even realize harms their sleep and productivity. Short-wavelength blue light plays an important role in your mood, energy level, and sleep quality. In the morning, sunlight contains high concentrations of this blue light. When your eyes are exposed to it directly, the blue light halts production of the sleep-inducing hormone melatonin and makes you feel more alert. In the afternoon, the sun\u0026#8217;s rays lose their blue light, which allows your body to produce melatonin and start making you sleepy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the evening, your brain doesn’t expect any blue light exposure and is very sensitive to it. Most of our favorite evening devices—laptops, tablets, televisions, and mobile phones—emit short-wavelength blue light, and in the case of your laptop, tablet, and phone, they do so brightly and right in your face. This exposure impairs melatonin production and interferes with your ability to fall asleep as well as with the quality of your sleep once you do nod off. As we’ve all experienced, a poor night’s sleep has disastrous effects upon productivity. The best thing you can do is to avoid these devices after dinner (television is okay for most people as long as they sit far enough away from the set).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e9. Eating too much sugar.\u003c/strong\u003e Glucose functions as the “gas pedal” for energy in the brain. You need glucose to concentrate on challenging tasks. With too little glucose, you feel tired, unfocused, and slow; too much glucose leaves you jittery and unable to concentrate. Research has shown that the sweet spot is about 25 grams of glucose. The tricky thing is that you can get these 25 grams of glucose any way you want, and you’ll feel the same—at least initially. The difference lies in how long the productivity lasts.

The team works with the farmers on a contract basis, gives them food and accommodation, provides them with seeds and trains them in natural farming techniques, such as using cow urine, cow dung, sugarcane juice, sugarcane pulp, and chickpea flour to grow plants. Finally, the produce is bought at market price and sold directly to the customers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the last year and a half, the Keerai Kadai team has delivered fresh greens and herbs to over 25,000 customers across Coimbatore. “Our USP is that post-harvest, we deliver the greens within two to three hours,” said Prasad. The greens are harvested twice a day and are sold in the store as well through the website and the Keerai Kadai app.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApart from Coimbatore, Keerai Kadai is also present in Madurai, where it has a store and a restaurant, which was opened in October 2018.

And its gender ratio is skewed towards males, because of female infanticide and selective abortions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet, before prime minister Narendra Modi became India\u0026#8217;s favourite strongman, only one leader had ever managed the same kind of power and charisma: Indira Gandhi, the former prime minister and standard of comparison for all leaders in the country. She isn\u0026#8217;t alone: India\u0026#8217;s political history counts several powerful women, and two female heads of state (Gandhi, and former president Pratibha Devisingh Patil). That\u0026#8217;s two more women holding the country\u0026#8217;s highest positions of power than in the United States.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen there is Sonia Gandhi, who for years was the president of the Congress party. Observers believed she was the puppeteer behind its every move. Jayalalithaa, the chief minister of Tamil Nadu, was elected to six terms and died while in office. Voters elected Mayawati four times as chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, India\u0026#8217;s largest state and one of the worst for women\u0026#8217;s rights. Mamata Banerjee has been chief minister of West Bengal since 2011. The country welcomed Priyanka Gandhi—heir of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty alongside her brother—into the world of high-powered politics with much more enthusiasm than her brother ever was. In the latest election, in fact, he lost his seat to a woman, Smriti Irani.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese aren\u0026#8217;t women who necessarily adhere to female stereotypes. They are strong figures who don\u0026#8217;t seem to worry much about being disliked, or try to soften their ways to appear more feminine. Although they are not completely safe from sexist stereotypes and treatment, Indian female politicians aren\u0026#8217;t judged as much as they may be in other countries by their appearance, or by social roles such as being a good wife, or mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is especially true of the ones who rise to prominent positions, where people seem to accept their power more than they would elsewhere. They are just fierce leaders, and more often than not, controversial ones who don\u0026#8217;t hesitate to test the limits of legality and democracy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow can a country that is routinely \u003ca href=\"https://qz.com/1618836/whatsapp-is-driving-women-in-india-to-vote-like-never-before/\"\u003edismissive of its women\u003c/a\u003e, diminishing and threatening them in the private sphere, be so comfortable with this kind of female power? A clue may be in its mythology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eA Goddess-worshipping culture\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;India is one of the last surviving ancient pagan cultures,\u0026#8221; Amish Tripathi, the bestselling author of six books on Indian mythology, told Quartz. Unlike other cultures, he said, Indians still carry the memories of the country\u0026#8217;s ancient ways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;We are one of the last surviving Goddess-worshipping cultures,\u0026#8221; he said, noting that India used to be a lot more progressive when it comes to women\u0026#8217;s place in society than it is now, maybe even more-so than in the West these days. As evidence he points to a small, telling detail: in English, God is often spelled with a capital \u0026#8216;G,\u0026#8217; but goddess never is. In Vedic Sanskrit, the language of the ancient Indians, he said, \u0026#8220;there is no grammatical difference in the status of Gods and Goddesses.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWomen and men had equivalent religious status thousands of years ago as well. Both men and women in contact with divine leaders translated their message and wrote the Rig Veda, India\u0026#8217;s oldest scripture. Power, too, was more evenly spread. Women rulers and army leaders, like Rudramadevi (13th Century) and Abbakka Rani (16th Century), were role models that continue to influence the understanding of power in India.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis history is reflected in the many examples of \u0026#8220;strong women political leaders that predate and outnumber those in Western society,\u0026#8221; Tripathi said, adding that it\u0026#8217;s very common for such women to be unmarried, too, and for that not to be an obstacle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, Tripathi added, this attitude (which extended to LGBTQ people as well as women), was lost as a consequence of the many invasions India endured in medieval times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;Whenever any society suffers repeated invasions and random acts of violence for long periods of time, it tends to become defensive, rigid and, yes, patriarchal,\u0026#8221; he said. \u0026#8220;Parts of India which suffered the most invasions, like North and Northwest India, are the most patriarchal to this day; while those that suffered less invasions, like South India, are less patriarchal.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWho gets to be a goddess?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFemale power—traditionally known as \u003cem\u003emahila shakti—\u003c/em\u003emay find its roots in Hindu mythology. But then again, so does, in many ways, a patriarchal rule.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo thinks Asha Mukherjee, a professor of philosophy and religion and former director of women\u0026#8217;s studies at Visva-Bharati University, Santiniketan, whose view of the influence of mythology on the social roles of women in India differs from Tripathi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn traditional Hindu mythology, she says, a woman is typically confined to two roles: She is either a \u003cem\u003edasi\u003c/em\u003e (mistress) or a \u003cem\u003edevi\u003c/em\u003e (goddess). This dichotomy can help explain the contradiction experienced in seeing powerful women in politics, in a country that doesn\u0026#8217;t otherwise prioritize women\u0026#8217;s rights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen it comes to the domestic realm, Mukherjee said, \u0026#8220;women are supposed to be like Sita,\u0026#8221; the devout wife of Lord Ram. She sacrificed herself to prove her virtue and chastity. She is the paragon of conjugal behaviour and an embodiment of the secondary role of a woman, whose value is determined on the basis of how she behaves for her man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven in the rare exceptions in which the role of a woman is instead informed by the idea of female goddesses, there is a form of discrimination. The avatars of the female goddesses—such as Parvati, Laxmi, Saraswati—embody certain virtues and values, such as power, wealth, knowledge. But they are not depicted as having real, human-like lives in the way Ram does.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese goddesses\u0026#8217; existences operate on an entirely different level, so the narratives that pertain to them don\u0026#8217;t actually influence the way the role of a woman is perceived in day to day life. \u0026#8220;Kali or Durga hardly have a human side, but Sita does,\u0026#8221; Mukherjee said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMukherjee also rejects that female political power is more easily accepted in India these days. She argues that prominent female politicians in India today are an aberration in a system that otherwise does not recognise female agency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMilan Vaishnav, the director of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in South Asia, also noted that while it\u0026#8217;s easy to embrace the narrative of the powerful Indian female politician, the optics may be better than the substance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;These women have been able to develop a sort of cult of personality, becoming goddess-like figures,\u0026#8221; he said of the high-powered female politicians of India. \u0026#8220;They are taken out of the day-to-day dynamics, almost like deities.\u0026#8221; Yet, he said, these are rather infrequent cases. These are all women who came to power in unusual circumstances and, by and large, deriving their power from the men in their lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIndira Gandhi, he noted, was the daughter of the first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru. Sonia and Priyanka Ghandi are respectively the wife and daughter of the Nehru dynasty heir Rajiv. Jayalalithaa was inducted into politics thanks to her personal relationship with fellow actor-turned-politician MG Ramachandran. Mayawati was the protégée of Dalit leader Kanshi Ram.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe organic rise through political parties is much more infrequent. Female representation in the Lok Sabha not only shows a lack of equality, but stands as evidence that—even with laws reserving 33% of seats to women in local assemblies—it isn\u0026#8217;t as easy for female politicians to emerge on the national scene. With 78 newly elected female Lok Sabha members, significantly up from 62 in the previous election and the highest in Indian history, the women\u0026#8217;s representation in the Indian parliament is still only 14%.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://qz.com/india/1623080/how-hindu-goddesses-explain-the-power-of-female-politicians-in-india/","published":"2019-05-29T05:45:29Z","guid":"https://qz.com/1623080//"},{"title":"Will probe against Naresh Goyal hurt Jet Airways’ revival hopes?","content":"\u003cimg width=\"1024\" height=\"609\" src=\"https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Jet-Airways--e1559093030589.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;w=1024\" class=\"attachment-medium_10 size-medium_10 wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Jet-Airways--e1559093030589.jpg 2611w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Jet-Airways--e1559093030589.jpg?resize=768,457 768w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Jet-Airways--e1559093030589.jpg?resize=50,30 50w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Jet-Airways--e1559093030589.jpg?resize=160,95 160w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Jet-Airways--e1559093030589.jpg?resize=320,190 320w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Jet-Airways--e1559093030589.jpg?resize=640,380 640w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Jet-Airways--e1559093030589.jpg?resize=940,559 940w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Jet-Airways--e1559093030589.jpg?resize=1600,951 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe prospect of finding an investor who can revive India\u0026#8217;s grounded private carrier Jet Airways is fading fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBesides the airline\u0026#8217;s mounting debt and \u003cspan style=\"float: none; background-color: transparent; color: #333333; cursor: text; font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; display: inline !important;\"\u003etruncated fleet, a new buyer may now have to deal with accusations of financial irregularities at the airline.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn May 27, reports emerged that India\u0026#8217;s serious fraud investigation office (SFIO) and the enforcement directorate (ED), \u003ca href=\"https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/jet-airways-funds-siphoned-off-fdi-rules-violated-before-collapse-ed-sfio-probes-launched-2043662\"\u003ehave initiated separate probes\u003c/a\u003e against Jet\u0026#8217;s former promoters, including ex-chairman Naresh Goyal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe SFIO, part of India\u0026#8217;s ministry of corporate affairs (MCA), is inquiring if the promoters had siphoned off funds from the airline, according to media reports.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ED, part of the finance ministry, meanwhile, is looking into allegations that foreign investment rules were violated when Abu Dhabi\u0026#8217;s Etihad Airways invested $150 million (Rs1,050 crore), in 2012, for a 50.1% stake in Jet Privilege—the firm that manages the airline\u0026#8217;s loyalty and rewards programme.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;No ECIR (Enforcement Case Information Report, the equivalent of an FIR in a criminal case) has been registered yet in this matter, only a preliminary inquiry has been started,\u0026#8221; a senior ED official told the news channel NDTV.

But soon, he caught the brewing bug himself. Waiting for his imported beers proved tedious; the journey from the US to Japan is by ship, and takes weeks. “I thought that we need more fresh, more high-level. And at the same time, I can adjust the taste,” he says. “So that’s why I started [brewing] on my own.”\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThrough a little resourcefulness and ingenuity—Koichi purchased his steel tanks second-hand through online auctions, and built most of the equipment himself—he fashioned a rig for half the cost that most brewers spend. “At that time, the average cost to open a brewery was around 100,000,000 yen (US $1,000,000). But as I studied about brewing, I noticed that [a] simple system was enough to [build a] small-scale brewery,” he says.

He, too, sees Koichi as a truly unique figure—one deeply appreciated by the many heshers in the international beer circuit.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e“[Koichi] really is a pioneer,” Dodge told me over the phone. As Dodge sees it, the crossover between the craft beer and heavy music scenes is natural. “[Thrash Zone] shows me that there are people like me who are excited about both extreme music and good beer.

People got into the Syria story through the Arab Spring and the revolt but it was a very simplistic narrative: it happened in Tunisia, it happened in Egypt, now the Syrians are rising up and when the regime refused to go so it became a civil war. Then attention shifted to ISIS and the refugee issue. What was missing was a deeper understanding of why Syrians rose up in the first place, how this family ruled over them for 50 years, and the role of its allies, particularly Iran. I felt there was a need to step back and look at the whole picture if we wanted to address the problems emanating from Syria.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhat have Western countries most consistently misunderstand about Syria?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eWestern countries relationships with Syria have largely been driven by whatever interests they had in the region at any given moment. During the Cold War, the U.S. agenda was how do we get Hafez Assad on our side? When the civil war started in Lebanon, the Americans wanted him to protect the Christians. And in the early 1990s, the American agenda was to amass this coalition to go after Saddam. Bashar was cooperating with the U.S on intelligence sharing before the invasion of Iraq, after 9/11. But when he realized they might be going after him he calculated that he had better start a pre-emptive war in Iraq to protect the regime. American calculations changed again because they needed to save face in Iraq, so there was a re-engagement period between 2007 and 2010. The Assad regime knows how the West deals with this part of the world and it can wait because it figures it\u0026rsquo;s not going anywhere. I\u0026#8217;m not advocating military intervention to topple the regime. I\u0026#8217;m just saying that all these countries have to take history into account when they decide to engage with Syria.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"image-wrapper no-caption\"\u003e\u003cimg data-attachment-id=\"5595452\" data-permalink=\"http://time.com/5595411/syria-bashar-assad-sam-dagher/assad-cover-image/\" data-orig-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/assad-cover-image.jpg?quality=85\" data-orig-size=\"1849,2850\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{\u0026quot;aperture\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;credit\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;camera\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;created_timestamp\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;copyright\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;focal_length\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;iso\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;shutter_speed\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;title\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;orientation\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;1\u0026quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Assad Cover Image\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/assad-cover-image.jpg?quality=85\u0026amp;w=195\" data-large-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/assad-cover-image.jpg?quality=85\u0026amp;w=389\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-5595452\" src=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/assad-cover-image.jpg?w=300\u0026#038;quality=85\" alt=\"\"  align=\"right\" srcset=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/assad-cover-image.jpg?w=300\u0026amp;quality=85 300w, https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/assad-cover-image.jpg?w=600\u0026amp;quality=85 600w, https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/assad-cover-image.jpg?w=97\u0026amp;quality=85 97w, https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/assad-cover-image.jpg?w=195\u0026amp;quality=85 195w, https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/assad-cover-image.jpg?w=389\u0026amp;quality=85 389w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cb\u003eTowards the end of the book you show how a regime that killed activists who posted anti-Assad messages on social media is now using those same platforms to rebuild Bashar\u0026rsquo;s image.

But for many, they were not defending Assad, they were defending themselves against an existential threat. The same applies to other minorities: many Christians and Druze [a religious minority] sympathized with the protesters and took part in at least the peaceful period of the protests before they realized, yes, the regime may be awful but look at the other side. Even the Sunnis came to that conclusion\u0026mdash;but it was more like resignation than support. A lot of urban Sunnis are now questioning the benefits of Assad\u0026rsquo;s victory and starting to have second thoughts. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhether it\u0026rsquo;s Saudi Crown Prince Mohamad bin Salman (MBS), Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el Sisi, or Libya\u0026rsquo;s Khalifa Haftar, the notion of \u0026#8220;a man we can do business with\u0026#8221; seems to persist.

In the late 1990s, all these articles were written before Bashar took power, touting him as a young reformer. There was actually a headline for a story\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eon Bashar in a Saudi-owned newspaper, \u0026#8220;reform under the umbrella of continuity and stability\u0026#8221;, that was almost exactly the same as the one they used for MBS years later. The leverage that the Saudis have are contracts and money and oil. The leverage the likes of Assad have is terrorism and refugees: always reminding Europe and the U.S. that if you come after us it\u0026#8217;s going to be the refugees and the terrorists again. So, these countries calculate that they had better just shut that door. You hear statements from Europe like, let the Syrians figure it out for themselves, it\u0026rsquo;s not our problem.

I was aware he was a controversial figure but I think he offers invaluable insights into the regime. The Tlass family, alongside the Assads, helped build the regime that has been at the helm of Syria for 50 years. It was certainly a difficult process. Manaf sees himself as a hero who was misunderstood and wasn\u0026#8217;t given a chance by the West, somebody who challenged Bashar and refused to participate in the killing of Syrians. He thought the book was going to help people understand his motivations. I made it clear that I would be looking at the full picture rather than trying to clear his family name.

Under the pretext of fighting terrorism Hafez massacred civilians in Hama in 1982 and later Bashar used the same excuse to go after those who were defying him. Both went after the peaceful activists first, vilifying them and putting them all together in the same category as terrorists, then there was the collective punishment. It\u0026#8217;s the same playbook. Even the torture methods were similar. So were the reactions of some other countries. During the Hafez era the U.S. was saying, OK, this is an awful regime, look at what they\u0026#8217;re doing to their people, they\u0026#8217;re sponsoring terrorism abroad, but we have all these other problems to deal with so maybe we shouldn\u0026#8217;t make as much of a big deal out of it. We heard variations of this after 2011 especially as the conflict became bloodier. The book also helps people understand the methodology behind the regime\u0026rsquo;s image-making, the tools of its deception.

Michelle Carras, an independent contractor on public mental health issues who has published research on gaming behavior, does not rule out that some gaming behavior can be problematic, but notes that some of the studies highlighting the addictive and all-consuming nature of gaming, include not just gaming but general internet and smartphone use, and therefore may not measure gaming\u0026rsquo;s specific effect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;The problem with gaming and other\u0026#8230;new media is that they produce a different culture,\u0026rdquo; says Carras, who also considers herself a gamer. \u0026ldquo;But clinicians are approaching this behavior from an understanding of a disorder based on a continuum of normative, recreational and problematic use rather than from the setting or context of a unique, new culture.\u0026rdquo; Carras, for example, points out that gaming fulfills a participatory and social need for some.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRather than singling out gaming, Carras and others support the idea of researching internet use and potentially problematic dependence on technology more broadly, to better understand some of the commonalities that patterns of gaming, social media and internet use might share.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the very least, however, the inclusion of gaming disorder in the ICD may raise awareness about potentially concerning ways that people rely on gaming, and trigger new research on it as well as other technology-related behaviors that will only continue to grow as devices and internet access reach more and more people around the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/time/topstories/~4/N1Wq0UxHyuQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/N1Wq0UxHyuQ/","published":"2019-05-29T09:00:58Z","guid":"http://time.com/?p=5597258"},{"title":"Experts Say ‘How Much’ is the Wrong Way to Assess Screen Time","content":"\u003caside class=\"right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad\" id=\"right-rail__ad-5592329\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module\" data-src=\"http://time.com/5592329/experts-say-how-much-is-the-wrong-way-to-assess-screen-time/\" data-widget-id=\"SB_2\" data-ob-template=\"timemag\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWay back in the late 1990s\u0026mdash;not long after home Internet use became widespread in the U.S.\u0026mdash;researchers started turning up links between time spent on computers and poor mental health.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/cpb.1998.1.25\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003eA 1998 study\u003c/a\u003e in the journal \u003cem\u003eCyberPsychology and Behavior\u003c/em\u003e found heavy internet use\u0026mdash;defined as 38 hours or more of non-work, non-school online activity\u0026mdash;was associated with \u0026ldquo;significant social, psychological, and occupational impairments.\u0026rdquo; The study authors wrote that such use \u0026ldquo;caused detrimental effects such as poor grade performance among students, discord among couples, and reduced work performance among employees.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlash forward two decades, and researchers continue to find connections between heavy screen use and negative outcomes.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5574844/\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003eA 2017 study\u003c/a\u003e of U.S. adults found spending six hours or more a day watching TV or using computers was associated with a higher risk for depression.

Forsythe wrote in his book \u0026#8220;The Globalist,\u0026#8221; \u0026#8220;The fact remained that at the beginning of the nineteenth century an estimated three-quarters of all people alive were trapped in bondage against their will either in some form of slavery or serfdom.\u0026#8221; \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSlavery was common among ancient peoples—Egyptians, Babylonians, Assyrians, Hittites, Greeks, Persians, Armenians, and many others. Large numbers of Christians were enslaved during the Ottoman wars in Europe. White slaves were common in Europe from the Dark Ages to the Middle Ages. It was only during the 17th century that the Atlantic slave trade began with Europeans assisted by Arabs and Africans. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSlavery is one of the most horrible injustices. It posed such a moral dilemma at our 1787 Constitutional Convention that it threatened to scuttle the attempt to create a union between the 13 colonies. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eLet\u0026#8217;s look at some of the debate. George Washington, in a letter to Pennsylvania delegate Robert Morris, wrote, \u0026#8220;There is not a man living who wishes more sincerely than I do, to see a plan adopted for the abolition of it.\u0026#8221; \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn a Constitutional Convention speech, James Madison said, \u0026#8220;We have seen the mere distinction of color made in the most enlightened period of time, a ground of the most oppressive dominion ever exercised by man over man.\u0026#8221; \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn James Madison\u0026#8217;s records of the convention, he wrote, \u0026#8220;[The convention] thought it wrong to admit in the Constitution the idea that there could be property in men.\u0026#8221; \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eJohn Jay, in a letter to R. Lushington: \u0026#8220;It is much to be wished that slavery may be abolished. The honour of the States, as well as justice and humanity, in my opinion, loudly call upon them to emancipate these unhappy people. To contend for our own liberty, and to deny that blessing to others, involves an inconsistency not to be excused.\u0026#8221; \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePatrick Henry said, \u0026#8220;I believe a time will come when an opportunity will be offered to abolish this lamentable evil.\u0026#8221; George Mason said, \u0026#8220;The augmentation of slaves weakens the states; and such a trade is diabolical in itself, and disgraceful to mankind.\u0026#8221; \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNorthern delegates to the convention, and others who opposed slavery, wanted to count only free people of each state to determine representation in the House of Representatives and the Electoral College. Southern delegates wanted to count slaves just as any other person. That would have given slave states greater representation in the House and the Electoral College. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf slaveholding states could not have counted slaves at all, the Constitution would not have been ratified and there would not be a union. The compromise was for slaves to be counted as three-fifths of a person when deciding representation in the House of Representatives and Electoral College. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMy question for those who condemn the Three-Fifths Compromise is: Would blacks have been better off if northern convention delegates stuck to their guns, not compromising, and a union had never been formed? \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo get a union, the northern delegates begrudgingly accepted slavery. Abolitionist Frederick Douglass understood the compromise, saying that the three-fifths clause was \u0026#8220;a downright disability laid upon the slaveholding states\u0026#8221; that deprived them of \u0026#8220;two-fifths of their natural basis of representation.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHere\u0026#8217;s my hypothesis about people who use slavery to trash the Founders: They have contempt for our constitutional guarantees of liberty. Slavery is merely a convenient moral posturing tool they use in their attempt to reduce respect for our Constitution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eCOPYRIGHT 2019 CREATORS.COM\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe post \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.dailysignal.com/2019/05/29/the-lefts-favorite-tool-to-attack-our-founding-principles/\"\u003eThe Left’s Favorite Tool to Attack Our Founding Principles\u003c/a\u003e appeared first on \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.dailysignal.com/\"\u003eThe Daily Signal\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://www.dailysignal.com/2019/05/29/the-lefts-favorite-tool-to-attack-our-founding-principles/","published":"2019-05-29T07:01:09Z","guid":"https://www.dailysignal.com/?p=522317"},{"title":"Podcast: Christopher Scalia on the Faith of His Dad, Antonin Scalia","content":"\n\u003cp\u003eAntonin Scalia was a towering Supreme Court justice who left an indelible mark on America.

The copper-colored scrap greets you in the reception area of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety's Vehicle Research Center, an automotive safety testing facility nestled between farms in the bucolic Virginia countryside a couple of hours from Washington DC. IIHS was set up in 1959 by the insurance industry to work on improving the safety of our vehicles, and to celebrate its 50th anniversary, the institute crashed the Bel Air into its then-current equivalent—a 2009 Chevrolet Malibu. The institute did this to prove conclusively that \"they don't build them like they used to. They build them better,\" to quote IIHS's then-president Adrian Lund.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"video\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"wrapper\" style=\"display:block\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"980\" height=\"550\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/C_r5UJrxcck?start=0\u0026amp;wmode=transparent\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"\u003eIIHS crashed these two cars into each other as a 50th-birthday present. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mangled remains of the Bel Air aren't pretty. A wheel and tire mostly occupy the space that should be the driver's footwell. The metal dashboard to the left of the steering wheel is covered in pink and blue greasepaint from where the dummy's head made contact. The 2009 Malibu, while also a wreck, left its dummy in much better shape, thanks to seatbelts, airbags, and energy-absorbing crash structures. And yet, it too is eclipsed in the safety stakes by almost every vehicle on sale in 2019, in no small part thanks to the work conducted at the institute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIIHS opened the Vehicle Research Center in 1992, and since then it's been smashing cars into things (and things into cars) in the name of improved safety. The institute is constantly studying real-world crash data and designing new crash tests as a result, and its tests make automakers sit up and pay attention.

This concept is called Prime Utopia, and demonstrates what might be possible if we move away from the ATX standard that has dominated full-size desktop motherboard design since Intel introduced it in 1995.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"FOGH5O\"\u003ePrime Utopia rearranges various components for greater efficiency. The PCIe slots are on the back, so the GPU can free up space while moving into a more stable position. There are four M.2 slots with a dedicated heatsink. Asus has also designed a proprietary “Hydra Cortex” fan header that lets individual fans be controlled independently.  \u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FTx3KMohYxgKjkNBjQWwf7Wy7BE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16305490/IMG20190529141347.jpg\"\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"D8WM7A\"\u003eAsus envisions I/O moving to Mini-PCIe modular components, so features like USB and Ethernet ports could be easily hot-swapped at will.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U2-M1kcaazzKGMFjX278Zdee3k8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16305492/IMG20190529141358.jpg\"\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"qryeEi\"\u003eThe motherboard also features a 7-inch OLED touchscreen that offers various readouts.

Kretz’s work is intended as a protest of the Trump Administration’s racist policies, but earlier this month, Facebook removed her work for violating its community guidelines against hate speech:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"J5zilu\"\u003eIn early May, Facebook removed Kretz’ images of her latest work for violating community standards.

Both are protected under the First Amendment. Whether they are protected under Facebook’s community guidelines is more debatable. The spirit of Facebook’s rules would seem to exclude a distorted propaganda video, and to include photos of some fairly literal political art. But in practice, Facebook made the opposite judgment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"EKUYIH\"\u003eThe reason is that, for all of the consequences it has on politics, Facebook is determined to stay above the fray. (Or maybe right \u003cem\u003enext\u003c/em\u003e to the fray, where people might more easily post about it on Facebook.) The company doesn’t understand the difference between a propaganda video and a piece of art because, in a very serious way, it does not \u003cem\u003ewant\u003c/em\u003e to. To understand would be to take on expensive new responsibilities, and open itself up to new lines of political attack, at a time when it faces significant new regulatory threats around the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"r6EcLW\"\u003eAmong top Facebook executives, this posture of strained neutrality is the only one that feels possible, whatever brickbats it may face in the press as a result. A policy that enables the maximum amount of political speech, save for a small number of exemptions outlined in a publicly posted document, has a logical coherence that “take down stuff I don’t like” does not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"45AXpl\"\u003eThat’s one reason why the take-it-down brigade might consider developing an alternate set of Facebook community standards for public consideration. I have no doubt that there are better ways to draw the boundaries here — to swiftly purge malicious propaganda, while promoting what is plainly art. But someone has to draw those boundaries, and defend them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"zMYU98\"\u003eAlternatively, you could \u003ca href=\"https://www.getrevue.co/profile/caseynewton/issues/more-democrats-consider-breaking-up-facebook-178091\"\u003ebreak Facebook up\u003c/a\u003e into its constituent parts, and let the resulting Baby Books experiment with standards of their own. Perhaps WhatsApp, stripped of all viral forwarding mechanics, would find a slowed-down Pelosi video acceptable when shared from one friend to another. Meanwhile Instagram would rapidly detect the video’s surging popularity and ensure that nothing like it appeared on the app’s Explore page, where the company could unwittingly aid in its distribution the way Facebook’s News Feed algorithm did this time around. Making communities smaller can make it easier to craft rules that fit them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"S4KGQK\"\u003eIn the meantime, TED’s Alexios Mantzarlis \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/Mantzarlis/status/1132749765630935042\"\u003eoffers four good suggestions\u003c/a\u003e for Facebook to implement, which I’d like to echo here in my own words. It should act faster — if centralization is the company’s big virtue, it should use that power to detect videos like these and apply fact-checking resources before they get millions of views. Two, it should write its warning pop-ups in plain English. Say goodbye to “additional reporting is available,” and hello to “this video has been distorted to change its meaning.” Three, follow up users with videos who shared the post before you identified it as fake, and offer them the chance to un-share it. And finally, share more data with the public and with researchers on the effectiveness of fact-checking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"zbAFNF\"\u003eI don’t think the Pelosi video heralds the end times for our information sphere. But I do think that debates like this, over what Facebook leaves up and what it takes down, are only going to grow more fractious as bad actors find new ways to hijack our attention. I understand why Facebook wants to avoid making editorial judgments on political videos. But doing nothing is an editorial judgment, too — and one that social platforms are increasingly going to be held to account for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"TLPfIP\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDemocracy\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"lgcPWt\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://click.revue.email/mpss/c/_QA/cM9xAA/t.2s0/R_cInf18TMC77D3yc6hsJA/h17/mb-2FqhNwiPwHg26xxrzU0i-2Bn9A759hzsF7bFCDS2ohCp44Zhh-2BBVFDbvzUBK76DzsJzBNL7wP9Lt9xlF3gY-2FX2BAss8-2B-2FSJbVQMQRul0ZApvl3Y7zxUah6Ln8-2FYvA9yZFlZZO5cUPEOnOxIagrce-2FqT8SMzhV1GNIVeiMvQUs9ThUHfJKN7yXzbgZ7o5KCHfZ4hMAqe7fPrMkOpYFDPRldlNDngWt7ORZPmgsYv21I-2BbuOVMimwbYIoE2SkqoWPhKZr6BrH5gF9-2FTvUfuQDyyuQ-3D-3D\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFacebook and Twitter disable new disinformation campaign with ties to Iran\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ffPLH4\"\u003e“The disabled accounts include two on Twitter [that] mimicked Republican congressional candidates in order to push pro-Iranian political messages,” Tony Romm reports:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"iuhnJu\"\u003eFacebook and Twitter each said on Tuesday they had disabled a sprawling disinformation campaign that appeared to originate in Iran, including two accounts on Twitter that mimicked Republican congressional candidates and may have sought to push pro-Iranian political messages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"FIy8fC\"\u003eSome of the disabled accounts appeared to target their propaganda at specific journalists, policymakers, dissidents and other influential U.S. figures online.

It’s particularly relevant at a time when Apple faces antitrust challenges in \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/14/18618127/apple-pepper-supreme-court-loss-kavanaugh-opinion-app-store-antitrust-explainer-vergecast\"\u003eboth the US\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/6/18530894/apple-music-monopoly-spotify-app-store-europe\"\u003ethe EU\u003c/a\u003e over its management of the App Store. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"7ZTAoF\"\u003eIn the interview, Shoemaker says that Apple has long feared that rival apps from companies like Google and Facebook would replace core iOS features like calling and messaging.

China’s “already at a point where growth rate is not an output, it’s an input,” meaning the government sets the goal it wants to hit each quarter and banks lend to hit that number. Beijing has done more monetary expansion, he says, than the US Fed, the Bank of Japan, and the EU combined. This has spawned a number of toxic asset bubbles — such as in housing, which has had trickle-down consequences of people taking on debt backed by overpriced real estate.

Lee-Makiyama notes that because the country lacks a social safety net, it cannot afford to ever take its foot off the gas, which is what the Huawei setback inevitably represents.

If you struggled to wait a few weeks for those sweet new \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/10/18563329/apple-powerbeats-pro-review-wireless-fitness-headphones-price\"\u003ePowerbeats Pro\u003c/a\u003e to go on sale, try waiting months and months for an alternative source of magnets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"TTc9vj\"\u003eAnd yet, as my colleague James Vincent has already set out, \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/23/18637071/rare-earth-china-production-america-demand-trade-war-tariffs\"\u003erare earths are not the secret weapon China imagines them to be\u003c/a\u003e. They’re not all that rare, the response to Beijing hoarding its supply would be production becoming economically viable and ramping up elsewhere, and the ultimate outcome would be fewer jobs and fewer exports for China. Lee-Makiyama sees this as an untenable scenario and points to China’s ill-fated attempts to use rare earths as a trade cudgel in its dealings with Japan and the US in the past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-float-left\"\u003e\u003caside id=\"9kJUsx\"\u003e\u003cq\u003eBoth countries would suffer from severing their symbiotic relationship, but China is more vulnerable to the effects\u003c/q\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"FfTuU7\"\u003eFinally, and most obviously, the Chinese government could just do the tit-for-tat response of imposing sanctions on American businesses operating within its borders. Even with some older-model \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/15/18624571/apple-iphone-6s-made-in-india-marketing-ad\"\u003eiPhone assembly in India\u003c/a\u003e, the vast majority of Apple’s smartphone business is built on Chinese land. Chipmakers are even more dependent, as an \u003ca href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/06/here-are-the-companies-wall-street-is-worried-most-about-if-a-full-blown-trade-war-breaks-out.html\"\u003eanalysis from HSBC\u003c/a\u003e finds that Apple compatriot Qualcomm has 65 percent of its revenue vulnerable to disruption in trade with China. Other US tech firms with similar exposure include Broadcom at 54 percent, Micron at 51 percent, and AMD, Intel, and Texas Instruments all pinning at least a quarter of their revenues on continuing trade with China.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"yXOgl4\"\u003eUS consumers can also be hit through impositions on brick-and-mortar retailers. Chinese imports account for 26 percent of Walmart’s merchandise, which is on the low end compared to a more typical number like Target’s 34 percent, \u003ca href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/16/business/walmart-earnings-stock-tariffs-trump-china/index.html\"\u003eaccording to UBS\u003c/a\u003e. Additional \u003ca href=\"https://eu.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/05/20/us-china-trade-war-tariffs-could-lead-12-000-store-closings/3688010002/\"\u003eresearch by UBS\u003c/a\u003e says the Trump administration’s tariffs imposed on Chinese imports “could put $40 billion of sales and 12,000 stores at risk.” The American Apparel \u0026amp; Footwear Association \u003ca href=\"https://www.aafaglobal.org/AAFA/AAFA_News/2019_Press_Releases/AAFA_Deems_New_Tariffs_Catastrophic_for_US_Economy.aspx\"\u003ecalls the next round of tariffs\u003c/a\u003e “a self-inflicted wound that will be catastrophic for the nation’s economy.” If tariffs are catastrophic, what would a total ban from China look like? This is arguably the most effective weapon Beijing could wield in its negotiations with Washington, but the corresponding hit on Chinese trade would be every bit as disastrous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"XnjpwH\"\u003eIn Lee-Makiyama’s estimation, no scenario that involves China cutting off or constricting business with the outside world will be palatable to the country economically. Even with its rapidly growing national consumer market, China is still in need of more consumers for its goods and services. And with Apple and its compatriots like Nike, General Motors, and Walmart employing millions of Chinese workers, Trump has the leverage he needs to play hardball. That situation won’t last long, the diplomat warns, and now might prove to be the last good chance for the US to lean on the mutual dependency it has with China. If the trade relationship remains as it is, China will eventually grow its way to be colossal both as producer and consumer, and then American influence would be null.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-float-right\"\u003e\u003caside id=\"NY3sxz\"\u003e\u003cq\u003eBeijing was “caught off guard” by the brusqueness of Trump’s trade stance\u003c/q\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"HVb6k1\"\u003eFor the US, what’s at risk are company revenues and profits. The country’s broader economy may suffer, but Lee-Makiyama says few people would notice if the GDP growth rate dipped from 3 to 2 percent. The same contraction for China’s economy, he contends and Zaagman agrees, would be disastrous. This asymmetry is at the heart of why the Trump administration can afford to be self-destructive in its tariff regime while China cannot indulge in similar costs to score trade negotiation points.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GR6_gm-CiZ2f_P9D0XnUdEGuiVQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/15986658/huawei_p30pro_vladsavov19_14.jpg\"\u003e\n      \u003ccite\u003ePhoto: Vlad Savov / The Verge\u003c/cite\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cem\u003eHuawei P30 Pro.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"lDtcO6\"\u003eThe Chinese government was “definitely caught off guard” by the brusqueness of Trump’s actions, says Zaagman, which was “not anticipated at all.” That might explain why Beijing didn’t make fuller or better contingency plans for a situation like today. Then again, Xi might find consolation in the fact that the same surprise must also be reverberating inside the offices of US tech giants, as Asia economic observer Tony Nash, formerly of the Economist Intelligence Group, questions \u003ca href=\"https://www.realvision.com/tv/shows/trade-ideas/videos/trade-wars-the-cautious-view-on-china\"\u003ewhy American companies hadn’t diversified their manufacturing sooner\u003c/a\u003e. Their lack of preparedness may give China some reassurance that hostilities won’t escalate much beyond their current point without China firing back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-float-left\"\u003e\u003caside id=\"OQYiFj\"\u003e\u003cq\u003eThe damage has already been done, and things will not be the same again\u003c/q\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"vaGtxG\"\u003eWithout having a clear and coherent plan for its reaction, which neither Lee-Mikayama nor Zaagman believe Beijing is even close to right now, the best strategy for China is to do nothing material and maintain a “strong and silent” posture — which is exactly what the country is doing, commenting only to say that it “\u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/china-will-not-flinch-in-the-face-of-us-pressure-top-negotiator-says-after-talks/2019/05/11/8545c974-7361-11e9-9331-30bc5836f48e_story.html?utm_term=.2caf51e8d021\"\u003ewon’t flinch\u003c/a\u003e.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"c-end-para\" id=\"PgAWvn\"\u003eThe damage, “the stuff that saps one percent off GDP growth every year,” says Zaagman, has already been done. Silicon Valley investors are now looking for startups with reduced China exposure; big US tech manufacturers are exploring Vietnam, Mexico, and other potential production outlets; and China has found its prejudices that it can’t trust the US confirmed. Now that Trump has pulled the big red Huawei lever, China is wise to avoid hurriedly mirroring the move. Then again, it’s not like it has much choice.\u003c/p\u003e","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/29/18637291/huawei-ban-trump-trade-war-china-united-states-tariffs","published":"2019-05-29T12:00:00Z","guid":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/29/18637291/huawei-ban-trump-trade-war-china-united-states-tariffs"}]},{"url":"https://feeds.feedburner.com/lifehacker/vip?format=xml","items":[]},{"url":"https://www.wired.com/feed","items":[{"title":"Don’t
