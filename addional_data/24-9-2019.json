Monday to tout what her company has done to curb terrorism since the Christchurch, New Zealand attacks in March. She made sure to tamp down expectations in the next breath. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u0026#x201C;We\u0026#x2019;ve invested hugely in people, hugely in AI, but we know that whatever we\u0026#x2019;ve done today will never be enough,\u0026#x201D; she told reporters Monday evening. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn response to global outcry over the Christchurch attacks, where a far-right extremist used Facebook Live to broadcast his murder of 51 people at two mosques, the social media giant says it\u0026#x2019;s sharpened its policies and automated detection tools to zero in on white supremacist terrorism. On Monday, Facebook and other tech companies announced the creation of an independent, industry-backed organization to study and fight online extremism. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMicrosoft, Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter previously formed the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism in 2017 to share data on propaganda and best practices for finding it. With Facebook chairing the group this year, Sandberg told leaders at the U.N. General Assembly Monday that it will soon break off as a standalone group, with a dedicated staff, funded by tech firms. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u0026#x201C;When terrorists try to use one platform, they try to use all the platforms,\u0026#x201D; she said, sharing few details about the size of the independent group or timetable of its launch. \u0026#x201C;So when one of us finds them, we can take them down across multiple platforms.\u0026#x201D;\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe Facebook executive spoke alongside New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern at a joint event Monday evening. The prime minister has led an international push to improve accountability for Big Tech following Facebook\u0026#x2019;s role in the attack. Facebook users attempted to share versions of the Christchurch video at least 1.5 million times in the 24 hours after the rampage, and the company\u0026#x2019;s sensors failed to preemptively detect 300,000 of them. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe tech industry\u0026#x2019;s new counterterrorism group aims to prevent such lapses from happening again, Ardern said, improving real-time communication during crises and engaging academics, civil society groups, and government officials to better understand emerging threats. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u0026#x201C;In a sense, we\u0026#x2019;re trying to create a civil defense-style mechanism,\u0026#x201D; Ardern said. \u0026#x201C;In the same way we respond to natural emergencies like fires and floods, we need to be prepared and ready to respond to a crisis like the one we experienced.\u0026#x201D; \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThere is one elephant in the room, however: Facebook\u0026#x2019;s upcoming pivot toward additional privacy features.

These new high-resolution phone sensors, however, work a little differently. In low light situations they combine four pixels together, which in this case should produce a 10.9-megapixel image with the light sensitivity of 1.4μm pixels — still not huge, but reasonably large by smartphone standards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"48ZlFB\"\u003eIn practice, of course, resolution and pixel size aren’t the most important factors when it comes to overall smartphone photo quality.

Instead, they have tiny HD projectors that fire towards a retroreflective surface, and — the same way a stop sign catches your car’s headlights — that light bounces right back to you, where the glasses filter it into stereo 3D images. That, plus a camera for head-tracking that lets you lean right down to the game board and check out the game up close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"0EbLrB\"\u003eAnd Ellsworth’s latest glasses no longer look like \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2013/10/16/4845440/ex-valve-teams-augmented-reality-glasses-blow-past-kickstarter-goal\"\u003ea heavy, hot mess of glue and chips\u003c/a\u003e — the company’s polished prototypes, which it recently \u003ca href=\"https://uploadvr.com/hands-on-tilt-five-tabletop-ar/\"\u003eshowed off at PAX West\u003c/a\u003e, are down to just 90 grams in weight, similar to those \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/1/9/18176083/nreal-augmented-reality-ar-smart-glasses-features-pricing-release-date-ces-2019\"\u003efrom Chinese startup Nreal\u003c/a\u003e and roughly 2-3 times the weight of a pair of Ray-Bans.

E isso requer maior representatividade da ordem mundial atual, na qual países em desenvolvimento contribuem significativamente para o crescimento mundial, mas carecem de poder decisório. Enxergamos essas mudanças como urgentes, sobretudo diante de ameaças protecionistas e guerras comerciais que se acirram em meio à falta de respeito pelas normas internacionais.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOs arranjos regionais também têm um papel fundamental na promoção da multipolaridade cooperativa. A América Latina não pode se tornar um cemitério de organizações regionais. Além de propor a reforma da OEA de forma a fortalecer seu papel na prevenção e resolução de conflitos, o Brasil irá lançar novas iniciativas para reforçar a Organização do Tratado de Cooperação da Amazônia, que enxergamos como um espaço cada vez mais estratégico para a região.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReafirmar a soberania brasileira sobre a nossa parte da Amazônia e rechaçar a ideia da sua internacionalização não exclui reconhecer sua importância global.

The agreement was announced on Friday but details were not made public at the time. The text of the agreement — which The Intercept requested and obtained from the Department of Homeland Security — purports to uphold international and domestic obligations “to provide protection for eligible refugees,” but immigration experts see the move as the very abandonment of the principle of asylum.

Meanwhile, though homicide rates have gone down in recent months — since outsider president Nayib Bukele took office in June — September has already seen an increase in homicides. Bukele’s calculus in accepting the agreement is still opaque to Salvadoran observers (Guatemala’s version was deeply unpopular in that country), but he has courted U.S. investment and support. The legal status of nearly 200,000 Salvadorans with temporary protected status in the U.S. is also under threat from the administration. This month also saw the symbolic launch of \u003ca href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/el-salvador-border-patrol-trump/\"\u003eEl Salvador’s Border Patrol\u003c/a\u003e — with U.S. funding and support.

That would mean that these Central American cooperation agreements go further than the recent asylum ban, which still allows people to apply for those other protections.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother major difference between the asylum ban and these agreements is that with the asylum ban, people would be deported to their home countries. If these agreements go into effect, the U.S. will start sending people to Guatemala or El Salvador, regardless of where they may be from. In the 1980s, the ACLU documented over 100 cases of Salvadorans who were harmed or killed after they were deported from the U.S. After this agreement goes into effect, it will no longer be just Salvadorans who the U.S. will be sending into danger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe post \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\"
