It was a good time to move over.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs CCO, Willits will help Saber shape its overarching creative vision, helping the company expand its existing player base and working with the studio\u0026#8217;s 400-plus employees in five studios around the world to come up with new intellectual properties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA multi-national studio with that many employees might not sound like most independent developers, but Willits says the work style is much the same as—and drastically different from—how things work at a large developer/publisher like Bethesda or Activision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was an appeal in returning to that sort of environment for him. Until 10 years ago, id was an independent development studio that was able to chase impulses and pivot quickly. The company (and Willits) worked with Saber on \u003cem\u003eQuake Champions \u003c/em\u003eyears ago, and he says he was impressed with their operation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;The agility of small teams and the opportunity to get stuff done quickly can\u0026#8217;t be overstated,\u0026#8221; says Willits. \u0026#8220;I\u0026#8217;m not saying anything bad about Bethesda—I love them—but smaller teams are exciting and fun. When someone has a good idea, we jump on it. If it doesn\u0026#8217;t work out, we change it quick.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSaber\u0026#8217;s looking to keep that design philosophy, but it\u0026#8217;s not planning to stay stagnant. Willits says the company is actively looking for new teams and studios in which to invest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSaber Interactive got its start in 2001 when Matt Karch and Andrey Iones bonded over a shared love of games and the fact that they both spoke Russian. The company is based in New Jersey (though Willits will remain in Texas) and has studios in St. Petersburg, Russia; Madrid, Spain; Belarus; Sweden; and Liverpool, U.K.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSaber has gotten a lot of attention lately for \u003cem\u003eWorld War Z\u003c/em\u003e, which sold nearly 2 million copies in its first month. That\u0026#8217;s a third-party action game, which would seem to be in Willits\u0026#8217; wheelhouse. But \u003cem\u003eNBA Playgrounds,\u003c/em\u003e another Saber title, has a strong following among sports game fans and isn\u0026#8217;t something he has worked on before. The chance to explore new genres, he says, was another lure of the new job.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;I sat down with my kid, who\u0026#8217;s 13, and said we need to play this game,\u0026#8221; he says. \u0026#8220;And I said \u0026#8216;why is this fun? what do you see in this?\u0026#8217; because he loved it. It\u0026#8217;s really exciting to try something new.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWillits notes that there are other sports where Saber is investigating taking the \u003cem\u003ePlaygrounds\u003c/em\u003e franchise already.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComing from a company that literally invented the first person shooter might not seem to lend itself to sports games—or other genres Saber might explore in the future. But Willits says his experiences in creating those sorts of games can be invaluable in amping up the fun factor of titles in other genres.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;It comes down to the attention to precise detail,\u0026#8221; he says. \u0026#8220;In a \u003cem\u003eQuake\u003c/em\u003e or \u003cem\u003eDoom\u003c/em\u003e game, everything has to be perfect—every microsecond. The games I\u0026#8217;ve made in the past, they\u0026#8217;re not the easiest games to play, but I’ve learned a lot on how to bring people in. And I do think there’s a lot of crossover. Even in \u003cem\u003eWorld War Z\u003c/em\u003e, a lot of the mechanics are similar, but I do really believe I can bring some of that intensity and action into new genres.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile there\u0026#8217;s plenty he\u0026#8217;s excited about, Willits acknowledges the decision to leave id was a hard one. He\u0026#8217;s irrevocably tied to the company\u0026#8217;s legacy. Ultimately, he says, the move to Saber came down to him deciding what he would enjoy most.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;At my age, you\u0026#8217;ve got to work with people you like,\u0026#8221; he says. \u0026#8220;You\u0026#8217;ve got to work on fun stuff. I don’t have anything to prove. I’ve been successful. I’ve made good games. … At the end of the day, I’m literally going to travel around the world to cool as places to work with awesome teams and make video games.

The 38-year-old playwright, on whose script \u003cem\u003eIn Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue\u003c/em\u003e the movie was based, wasn’t as much the public face of the film as its breakout director Barry Jenkins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut the themes McCraney explored in his uniquely intimate story—the first with an all-black cast and LGBTQ themes to win film’s top prize—were born of a very personal, raw expression of what it feels like to grow up black and queer in the projects of Miami.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMcCraney has another story to tell in the Oprah Winfrey Network (OWN) drama \u003cem\u003eDavid Makes Man\u003c/em\u003e, which premieres Aug. 14 at 10 p.m. ET/PT. (Winfrey has raved about the series, calling it “\u003ca rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"poetry on TV (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OQpnDkuHZg\" target=\"_blank\"\u003epoetry on TV\u003c/a\u003e.”) McCraney’s first outing as a series creator, alongside showrunner Dee Harris-Lawrence, David is an unfiltered glimpse inside the foot-in-both-worlds life of David (Akili McDowell), a 14-year-old prodigy from the South Florida projects who attends a magnet school.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMcCraney chatted with \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e in July about moving on after the Oscars, creative growing pains, and crafting a story for TV that explores the “dexterity you learn in one socialized environment and the total new morality you learn in another.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eFortune:\u003c/em\u003e How did winning the Oscar for best adapted screenplay, and \u003cem\u003eMoonlight\u003c/em\u003e’s win for best picture, impact the way you thought about your career?

Most people want to know “How did it feel to win?”—and I still don’t know. I was still very much processing that I had an Academy Award in my hand for a script I’d written when I was 23, in the wake of my mother’s death. That’s really what I was thinking that night. I know some people were upset about the results, but I thought, “Well we’re here now. The best thing to do is to move on,” which for me meant going home and reading applications. I run the Yale School of Drama’s playwriting program and I had to read all the applications by March in order to accept a new class by April.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou’re likely the only Oscar-winner in history who had that on his to-do list after leaving the stage.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e(\u003cem\u003eLaughs\u003c/em\u003e) Probably, yes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHad \u003cem\u003eDavid Makes Man\u003c/em\u003e taken shape at that point?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI’d been working on it with [executive-producers] Mike Kelly and Melissa Loy at Warner Brothers. We’d been rejected by HBO for a 30-minute version of the show and were figuring out where to pitch next. I’d also started talking to Michael B. Jordan about exec-producing. To be fair, the show is still a half-hour in my mind—but a half-hour in theater terms rather than TV. In theater, a half-hour is one act.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo you always think in theater terms, no matter the medium?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI think of a beginning, middle, and end. \u003cem\u003eDavid\u003c/em\u003e is a series that has no kind of finality to it. So in that way I know it’s TV, and not theater.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI heard Winfrey herself was in the room when you pitched at OWN.

Jordan and Mike Kelly ask her to stay. And she sat right in front of me. I’m a bit of an anomaly, especially in the presence of Michael, who is very effusive, in that I’m a little dour. I said, “Hello Miss Oprah” and tried to shake her hand. She pushed my hand away and gave me a great big hug. “\u003cem\u003eMoonlight\u003c/em\u003e was fantastic, thank you for being here. I’m going back to my meeting now.” It was another day in my life that will live in infamy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSimilarly, when I was 16, some friends and I were downtown Miami doing auditions for college. This woman comes down the street yelling and says to me, “Little faggot boy, you’re not going to get into Juilliard. But you’re going to get to Broadway one day.” She told my friends they weren’t going to get into Pratt and Juilliard, and then walked away. And all of that came true. The language that lady used was harsh, but it was one of those times when things felt bigger than me, and that I should stay ready. I remember telling Barry on Oscar night: “There’s no other way any of this could have gone. This is how my life works.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIn a lot of ways, \u003cem\u003eDavid Makes Man\u003c/em\u003e is an extension of \u003cem\u003eMoonlight\u003c/em\u003e in terms of the setting, the visual style and the coming-of-age story you’re telling. To what degree do you see this as a companion piece, but also as distinct? Are you ever worried about repeating yourself?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI’m not worried about the similarities. I pitched the show from a place of personal anecdote and also curiosity: What are the mechanisms we put in place as young people that control and guide us? And when do we outgrow those mechanisms? Also, I love telling stories about young black people from my corner of the world. Most people can’t distinguish Homestead, Fla., where \u003cem\u003eDavid\u003c/em\u003e takes place, from Miami, where \u003cem\u003eMoonlight\u003c/em\u003e takes place. People say, “Oh, they both take place in Miami.” I’m like, “They’re not the same at all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe tropical setting of both \u003cem\u003eDavid\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eMoonlight\u003c/em\u003e creates almost a veneer of beauty because it’s in such stark contrast to the boys’ lives. I think we are more used to seeing these stories told against the backdrop of a concrete, urban environment.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eYes, and not only is there a veneer of beauty, but the character of David, unlike Chiron in \u003cem\u003eMoonlight\u003c/em\u003e, lives in a totally bifurcated word.

How important is it for you, if at all, to cast actors who can relate to the stories you’re depicting?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMy audition process never has anything to do with asking where people are from. Akili, who plays David, comes from a very supportive home and is a middle child; Nathaniel McIntyre, who plays Seren, is a Broadway baby and comes from a two-parent household in Long Island. They are both very different from their characters. What I do ask my actors is: What do you connect to? And when they got in front of the camera, the amount of respect and openness they had was incredible. I was a good actor at their age, but I could not do what they do. They have a level of generosity I just didn’t have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat has been the hardest part of making an hour-long drama that you didn’t expect? Have you felt artistic growing pains in segueing to TV from theater and film?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere have been a few. I am highly aware of what I don’t know about how TV series audiences engage, what those numbers mean, what gets paid for, and what doesn’t. I’m the type of person who, if you tell me on the outset what you want, I’ll do it. But if you wait until after I’ve already done something and then go, “Can we make it more like this?” then I get kind of manipulative. “All right! I’ll show you what you think you want because, until you understand the reasoning behind what I’m doing is, you’ll second-guess me. I’ll second-guess myself. And we won’t get the best work.” More often than not folks are like, “Oh okay, that’s the better way.” I think some people were nervous about that kind of collaboration because, again, I’m a theater person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAlso in theater you experience the real-time effects of your decision-making. TV requires a longer incubation period and there are more voices chiming in.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eYes. When you hear something in front of an audience, there’s an immediacy; you feel something different. On the show, we’re looking at monitors and figuring out what adjustments to make as a group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat stories, whether on TV, in film, or in books, gave you comfort or allowed you to escape when you were a kid?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s interesting that I became a playwright because I definitely saw more TV and film as a kid than I ever did plays—definitely reruns of \u003cem\u003eAll in the Family\u003c/em\u003e. I also loved \u003cem\u003eThe Carol Burnett Show\u003c/em\u003e. I was obsessed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat did you love about it?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e[Actress] Vicki Lawrence. And I followed her to \u003cem\u003eMama’s Family\u003c/em\u003e too. I thought it was an amazing group of people. I loved seeing them crack up and break on stage. And they didn’t care! It made all so much more endearing. My love for that type of collaboration definitely grew out of watching those shows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you could give your younger self advice, say when you were David’s age, what would you tell him?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“Stay calm. Keep calm.” Everything was an emergency for me at that age. I developed a kind of inability to enjoy the moment. Like when I was that 30-something-year-old at the Academy Awards whose movie won Best Picture and wasn’t able to go, “I won Best Picture, let’s get drunk!” Instead I was like, “Cool. I’m going to drop you all off at the party and go back to the hotel.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWait, so you really did skip Oscar parties to go home and read?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s absolutely what I did. I stopped at Vanity Fair, took a picture with [actress] Halle Berry. Then [actress] Ruth Negga asked, “Can I have a picture too?” \u0026nbsp;I was like, “Of course.” Then I got into the SUV, went back to the Four Seasons and read those applications.

Its dominance of the retail sector rests on a foundation of having the lowest prices, which are typically about 10% below traditional supermarket chains like \u003ca href=\"http://content.fortune.com/fortune500/kroger-17/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eKroger\u003c/a\u003e Co. and 5% lower than rival \u003ca href=\"http://content.fortune.com/fortune500/target-38/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTarget\u003c/a\u003e Corp., according to Gordon Haskett.

But the HBO series, which debuted its highly anticipated second season on Sunday night, is also very much a show about business: money, power, influence, ego, and the machinations of corporate America.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eAs such, it’s the perfect show for us at \u003c/em\u003eFortune \u003cem\u003eto recap as the saga of the Roy family, and the battle for their Waystar Royco media empire, unfolds over the weeks to come. In the first episode of the new season: bear hugs, cameras, and of course, succession planning.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eLogan Roy may be a dinosaur, but he’s not oblivious to the forces that are transforming the business he’s chosen. “Kodak was trading at about $100 a share back in ‘97,” the Roy family patriarch tells his gathered clan at their palatial Hamptons estate. “Yesterday, you could pick it up for about three bucks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eLogan, played masterfully by Brian Cox, spent much of \u003cem\u003eSuccession\u003c/em\u003e’s first season trying to reassert his authority over his Waystar Royco media empire via the kinds of moves that got him where he is—much to the chagrin of his underling sons Kendall (Jeremy Strong) and Roman (Kieran Culkin). While Kendall tried to make a name for himself by spearheading the acquisition of the digital media startup Vaulter, Logan—once he returned to the helm of the company after a brain hemorrhage at the start of season one—set about his tried-and-tested strategy of buying local TV stations by the handful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOther than the obvious, ego-driven desire for Logan’s kids to step out of their father\u0026#8217;s immense shadow, this old-versus-new dynamic represented the tension at the heart of the battle for Waystar Royco in season one. Kendall, Roman, and their sister Siobhan (Sarah Snook) may be driven by their own insecurities above all, but that manifests itself through the younger generation’s desire to prove that they know what’s best for the company in the 21st century—lest the old man lead the firm down the path of the point-and-shoot camera.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s how we got Kendall’s numerous desperate attempts to wrestle control of Waystar Royco from his father, which culminated in the attempted “bear hug” acquisition of the company by Kendall, his old private equity pal Stewy Hosseini (Arian Moayed), and his father’s bitter rival media baron Sandy Furness (Larry Pine). Of course, Kendall’s designs—at least as far as he’s concerned—went down with the Chappaquiddick-esque climax to last season, but season two finds Sandy and Stewy persisting with their strong-arm tactics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eKendall, now back on the family reservation, is pulled out of drug rehab painfully early; he’s ordered to go on TV to defend his father and discredit the bear hug bid—which, in essence, is an offer made at such a premium to Waystar Royco’s stock price that to refuse it would be against the best interests of the company’s shareholders. It works, for the time being; the stock climbs, and an almost catatonic Kendall—guilt-ridden and in withdrawal—makes his way back to New York to fill in his father on what Sandy and Stewy have planned for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor Logan, there are two options: he could \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2017/12/14/disney-fox-deal/\"\u003emake like Rupert Murdoch\u003c/a\u003e and sell up, allowing him and his family to walk away from their empire with an enviable fortune. That’s the course of action recommended to him by his banker friend, Jamie, over dinner. “There’s blood in the water,” Jamie informs him. “Tech is coming. Tech is here. Tech has its hands around your throat.” We’ve all seen the wave of consolidation that’s swept the mass media sector in recent years; in Jamie’s estimation, only one or two legacy media players will be large and strong enough to survive the digital-fueled transformation of the industry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe other option, of course, is a war of attrition: dig in, drag it out, and outlast your opponents. But that could be a vicious, yearslong fight, and one that would bring Logan back to one of the key conflicts at the heart of the show: the identity of his eventual successor. But with Kendall a broken man and Roman ever the jester, there’s really only one person for the job if Waystar Royco is to stay in the Roy family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSiobhan may be busy running the Bernie Sanders-esque Gil Eavis’ presidential campaign, but time and again, she’s shown that she’s the only one with the wits, nerve, and vision to handle the job. When the family gathers in the Hamptons to weigh the future (yet another of \u003cem\u003eSuccession\u003c/em\u003e’s brilliant set pieces that allow the writers to get all of their main characters in one room), she pitches her dad on a slimmer, smarter Waystar Royco: get rid of the video game consoles, independent films, exploding satellites, and other cash-burning verticals that are more trouble than they’re worth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eLogan knows that she’s “the one” for the job, and when Shiv eventually accepts, her steely veneer breaks with emotion. “Why did you never ask me?” she queries her father through tears, a tender moment that surely tweaked the heartstrings of anyone who’s followed the family’s tale. But after composing herself, she and her dad get down to the business of choreographing her ascent—one that also comes with a sweetener for her husband Tom (the hilarious Matthew Macfadyen), who will helm the company’s global broadcast news operations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eLater, Kendall meets with Sandy and Stewy while his dad hangs back in the car in a classic “1987 power move,” as Stewy notes. Waystar won’t sell, and while the company is willing to do a more limited “asset swap” deal, their corporate raiders want it all. Which leaves only one outcome.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re gonna bleed cash, he’s gonna bleed cash, it will never end,” Kendall tells Sandy. “Maybe you’ll kill him—but if you don’t, he aims to kill you. He will go bankrupt or go to jail before he lets you beat him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat all sounds fine to Sandy, and he tells Kendall as much—setting the stage for a most hostile of hostile takeovers to play out over the course of \u003cem\u003eSuccession\u003c/em\u003e’s promising second season.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJuicy Morsels\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe exterior shot of Waystar Royco’s offices establishes 28 Liberty St. (the old One Manhattan Chase Plaza) as the company’s headquarters. That’s somewhat curious; as regular Financial District dwellers may note, the show used the World Trade Center for similar shots in season one. Of course, this is a fictionalized universe.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e“I’ll tweet, the markets will move, and that’ll be that,” Logan tells Shiv of his plans to sell the company, after she initially turns down the CEO job.

With non-banking entities like private equity firms and debt funds now holding an unprecedented amount of assets—and those players not subject to the same capital requirement regulations that banks are—balance sheets aren’t as robust as they once were and banks find themselves unable to play in the same high-risk, high-reward markets that they once were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“The non-banks like Blackstone and Citadel, they don’t have the capital requirements that the banks do; they’re more nimble, they can hire a lot of people and take on riskier transactions,” according to Mayra Rodriguez Valladares, managing principal at capital markets consultancy MRV Associates.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHarte echoed that sentiment, adding that the amount of capital that banks now have to hold against many of their trading positions “has definitely changed the industry. You can’t lever up as much as you could pre-crisis.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat, coupled with investor risk-appetites that Harte says have yet to return anywhere near pre-recession levels, have forced the banks to adjust accordingly.

I’ve long been a fan of the spy novels of John Le Carre and some of the film and TV adaptations are almost as good as the books. I’m not sure I can even choose between, say, the PBS miniseries version of \u003cem\u003eTinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy\u003c/em\u003e starring Alec Guinness or the Hollywood film version starring Gary Oldman.

So when I found myself trapped on a three-hour flight to Chicago recently, I was delighted to discover a new addition to the oevre, \u003ca href=\"https://www.amc.com/shows/the-little-drummer-girl\"\u003ean AMC network six-part miniseries of the Le Carre classic\u003c/a\u003e, \u003cem\u003eThe Little Drummer Girl\u003c/em\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe first few episodes were delightfully diverting, with great performances from Florence Pugh in the title role and Alexander Skarsgård as her Israeli spy/lover. But I only got through two of the six episodes on the flight. Then commenced the nonsense of our current fragmented if still golden age of TV. How to find the rest of the episodes in time for my connecting flight…\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI started where I always start. As a premium home cable subscriber, I tried the mobile AMC app, signing in with my cable login and password. Turns out the show is not on the AMC network app. Maybe buy the last four episodes on iTunes? No dice, not there. A little Internet research indicated that the show could be streamed on the Sundance channel’s online service Sundance Now (I cannot tell you why). Subscribing in the iPhone app (with a free seven-day trial) seemed perfect. The shows were all there. But…no downloading. Only streaming. Ugh. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, messing around other apps, the \u003ca href=\"http://content.fortune.com/fortune500/amazoncom-18/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAmazon\u003c/a\u003e Prime video mobile app allows downloading and can connect with lots of premium cable channel services–including Sundance.

So with boarding coming up soon, as fast as I could type, I went to Amazon.com and searched for the Sundance channel. Subscribing this way, with the same seven-day free trial, shows were now available for downloading in the Prime app back on my phone. I hit the download icon and–nothing. Oops. The default settings prohibit downloading over cellular networks. Switch that and go. I managed to get a couple more episodes, enough to cover my next flight, before boarding. Phew.

In one, an off-duty pilot was charged with \u0026#8216;rioting\u0026#8217;—another contentious term among protesters—and in a second episode, two staff members leaked the flight schedule of a Hong Kong police football team flying to China. The pilot has been suspended and the two other staffers were sacked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe CAAC has also demanded that Cathay Pacific provide rosters of all future flight crew for approval, and warned that flights without approved staff members would be banned from China’s airspace. The threat carries significant weight since most of Cathay’s international flights have to travel over China.

Velo plans to charge transaction fees as low as 1% for its service and promises to complete transfers instantaneously; traditional methods can take up to five days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eVelo isn’t the only blockchain company in Southeast Asia’s remittance space. Ripple, the U.S.- based money transfer crypto-company, has partnered with Thailand’s Siam Commercial Bank as well as MoneyGram and others to bring its remittance scheme to Asia. \u0026nbsp;Alibaba’s AliPay recently launched blockchain remittances in Hong Kong, targeting the city’s 300,000 foreign domestic workers, many of whom come from the Philippines. Facebook, which has 577 million daily users across Asia and just launched its money service, Calibra, could be competition soon too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eVelo vice chairman Tridbodi Arunanondchai says Velo won’t compete directly with incumbents like \u003ca href=\"http://content.fortune.com/fortune500/western-union-468/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWestern Union\u003c/a\u003e, which is a business-to-consumer operation, or even newcomers like Ripple. Instead, he says, Velo will be positioned as a business-to-business service, providing the digital infrastructure to facilitate transfers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“Velo is the\nJP Morgan or Citibank that basically underwrites credit, being the ultimate guarantor, providing that trust for people around the world to transact without knowing each other,” says Arundanondchai. He describes the blockchain project as a clearing house, facilitating interoperability across Southeast Asia’s fractured remittance market.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eVelo works by issuing digital assets called Velo Tokens to companies that complete Velo’s “know your customer” process, verifying their identity and assessing their creditworthiness. To make a transaction, Velo-approved firms exchange their tokens for stablecoins, cryptocurrencies designed to minimize volality, also issued by Velo, then use the stablecoins to trade through Velo’s customer-facing payments service, Lightnet. The receiving party can exchange \u0026nbsp;stablecoins for Velo Tokens or use them to cash out in their local currency at one of Velo’s partnering payment shops. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo date, Velo has raised only $50 million in funding. But the company is counting on its association with CP Group to bolster trust with business partners and customers. CP Group is Thailand’s largest private conglomerate, with over 200 global subsidiaries and $54 billion in annual revenue. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eArundanonchai says Velo has “plugged into” CP Group’s internal money transfer service as a starting point and partnered with Seven-Eleven in Thailand, which is licensed by CP Group, to provide Lightnet customers with over 10,000 real world cash-in-cash-out locations. Velo claims to have 500,000 cash agents around Southeast Asia through other partnerships,\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“I expect Velo can get a lot of traction within CP Group’s vendor network and within companies that are close to them,” says Jehan Chu, managing partner of Hong Kong-based investment firm Kenetic Capital, which specializes in blockchain companies. “Liquidity attracts liquidity and when you have hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars per year going through CP Group’s network, that’s an incredible anchor for Velo.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eArundanonchai projects Velo will facilitate over US$50 billion worth of transactions annually within three years, with remittances from migrant workers accounting for $25 billion and the rest coming from transfers through Velo’s money management partners, such as those provided by CP Group. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eMore must-read stories from \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—What people get wrong about \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/07/09/china-data-artificial-intelligence/\"\u003eartificial intelligence and China\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—Will \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/05/apple-stock-tariff-china-trade-war/\"\u003eApple will absorb tariffs on Chinese-made products\u003c/a\u003e?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—Is it “only human” to feel anxious about money? \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/02/sofia-the-robot-finance-investing-interview/\"\u003eTalking finance with Sophia the Robot\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—The currency that’s quietly emerged as \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/06/thai-baht-currency-war-trade/\"\u003eAsia’s safest bet\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—Listen to our audio briefing, \u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/radio/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e 500 Daily\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://flipboard.com/@fortune\"\u003eFollow \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e on Flipboard\u003c/a\u003e to stay up-to-date on the latest news and analysis.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://fortune.com/2019/08/12/velo-blockchain-remittance-southeast-asia/","published":"2019-08-12T12:02:16Z","guid":"https://fortune.com/?p=2681023"},{"title":"Jeffrey Epstein’s Death Victimizes His Accusers—Again: The Broadsheet","content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eGood morning, Broadsheet readers!

After years of anticipation, the market for electric vehicles (EV) is shifting into high gear in America.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eEVs may still seem exotic to many shoppers on the car lot, but their sales are \u003ca href=\"https://electricdrive.org/index.php?ht=d/sp/i/20952/pid/20952\"\u003econsistently accelerating year over year\u003c/a\u003e.

The electric utility industry is at the intersection of both of these ambitions. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s essential that various stakeholders work together to help reduce vehicle emissions. This responsibility should not just fall on the automotive industry. I’m the president of an energy provider in Michigan, and my colleagues and I must play a major role in helping the U.S. turn the corner on EVs, from passenger vehicles to buses. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMy company, Consumers Energy, and other energy providers are already offering our expertise to support the Big Three automakers in growing the EV market. First, we’re helping make it more convenient for drivers of electric vehicles to cover long distances. People will be more likely to buy electric vehicles only if they’re confident they can find charging stations when they’re miles away from home, whether they’re at work or on road trips. That charging infrastructure has to be in place, even if the EVs aren’t yet on the road in large numbers. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis year, Consumers Energy\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eand Michigan’s other major electricity provider, \u003ca href=\"http://content.fortune.com/fortune500/dte-energy-274/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDTE Energy\u003c/a\u003e, started making progress toward that goal by providing rebates to consumers who install electric vehicle charging stations. An electric vehicle owner who wants a home charging station can receive a rebate, and businesses and municipalities can receive rebates for charging stations in public locations. This will pave the way for EV charging to become more common, not just in people’s garages, but in their office parking lot or along highways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSecond, we need to help automakers design the best customer experience for electric transportation drivers. Consumers Energy\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003ehas partnered with our hometown automakers to enable smart charging, which takes advantage of excess power availability to give drivers the chance to charge in off-peak hours. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis makes sense both for drivers and for utility companies. EVs have the potential to add significant electric demand to the electric system, therefore better utilizing a significantly oversized electric grid. By assuring that vehicle charging occurs outside peak hours, the unit cost of electricity actually drops every time someone charges an electric vehicle. That is a win for drivers due to lower charging costs, and for society in the form of lower energy costs and lower vehicle emissions. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAutomakers and energy providers are natural allies as the next generation of cars hits our streets. We both are managing new leaps forward in technology that challenge traditional businesses, and we’re both taking stands that ensure our work protects the planet. We’ll know we’ve done our job well when we start seeing high numbers of drivers smoothly transition from gas to electric vehicles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003ePatti Poppe is the president and CEO of Consumers Energy, which provides electricity or natural gas to two-thirds of Michigan’s 10 million residents.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eMore \u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/section/commentary/\"\u003eopinion\u003c/a\u003e in \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—The \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/06/causes-us-china-trade-war/\"\u003eroot causes\u003c/a\u003e of the U.S.-China trade war\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—Bernie Sanders: \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/07/09/bernie-sanders-cancel-student-debt/\"\u003eAmerica is drowning in student debt.\u003c/a\u003e Here’s my plan to end it\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—\u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/03/youth-unemployment-summer-job-programs/\"\u003eYouth employment is still declining.\u003c/a\u003e How summer jobs programs can help\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—Most states still enforce \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/06/26/states-noncompete-agreements-innovation/\"\u003enoncompete agreements\u003c/a\u003e—and it’s stifling innovation\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—Why \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/07/16/antitrust-regulation-consumer-protection/\"\u003erecent antitrust regulation\u003c/a\u003e isn’t really about consumer protection\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eListen to our audio briefing, \u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/radio/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e 500 Daily\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://fortune.com/2019/08/12/consumers-energy-electric-vehicles-charging/","published":"2019-08-12T20:30:23Z","guid":"https://fortune.com/?p=2681311"},{"title":"New Line Beats Out Most of Hollywood to Make Olivia Wilde’s ‘Booksmart’ Follow-Up","content":"\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia Wilde has selected New Line as the home of her next directorial venture, period thriller \u003cem\u003eDon\u0026#8217;t Worry, Darling\u003c/em\u003e, following one of the most competitive auctions likely to be seen in Hollywood this year. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eComing off critically adored high-school comedy \u003cem\u003eBooksmart\u003c/em\u003e, Wilde\u0026#8217;s next project was always going to attract some eyeballs.

The regulation, which takes effect in 60 days, has been a priority of Trump’s hard-line aide Stephen Miller.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eLast week, the administration said more than 30,000 migrants had been sent to Mexico to await immigration court proceedings as part of a program expanded under a June 7 deal between Mexico and the U.S.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eUnder the new rule, the U.S. will scrutinize applications for legal permanent residency from about 400,000 people a year to determine whether they’re likely to become a public charge, Cuccinelli said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe administration’s approach likely will reshape the racial and ethnic demographic of immigration to the U.S. The Migration Policy Institute, an advocacy group, released data Monday showing about 70% of recent legal immigrants from Mexico and Central America, the Caribbean and Africa had incomes below 250% of the federal poverty line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“This is really in my perspective an attack on working middle class immigrant families being able to live in the United States,” Ur Jaddou, who served as chief counsel of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in the Obama administration and is director of the non-profit DHS Watch said in an interview.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOpponents argue the new rule will both make it harder for lower-income immigrants to remain in the country and potentially scare people from using benefits to which they’re legally entitled. They said that because the government evaluates both whether someone has used public benefits in the past and whether they’re likely to in the future, even those who don’t rely on assistance could be denied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe text of the Trump administration’s rule said it wasn’t designed to “discriminate against aliens based on age, race, gender, income, health and social status.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eCuccinelli said the rule offers clarity to government agents who evaluate immigrants’ applications, and makes it easier for those seeking permanent residency in the U.S. to understand the consequences of using public benefits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eChallening the Rule\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eLegal challenges to the new rule are likely.

Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a group seeking to limit immigration, said the administration should limit the number of applications and increase education and skills standards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m skeptical this is going to have much of an effect,” Krikorian said in an interview. “We need Einstein-type immigration rather than people who just have a B.A.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eCuccinelli said there would be specific exemptions for the most vulnerable populations, including children and pregnant mothers. And some programs, including student loans, won’t be counted negatively for immigrants who use them.

The work is backbreaking, and the people who do it maintain that no other job on Earth is quite as demanding. I had labored long hours over other crops, but had to admit to Scott-White, a 60-something grandmother who’d grown up chopping, that I’d never done it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Then you ain’t never worked,” she replied.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe fields alongside us as we drove were monotonous. With row crops, monotony is good. But as we toured 1,000 acres of land in Leflore and Bolivar Counties, straddling Route 61, Scott-White pointed out the demarcations between plots. A trio of steel silos here. A post there. A patch of scruffy wilderness in the distance. Each landmark was a reminder of the Scott legacy that she had fought to keep—or to regain—and she noted this with pride. Each one was also a reminder of an inheritance that had once been stolen.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDrive Route 61 through the Mississippi Delta and you’ll find much of the scenery exactly as it was 50 or 75 years ago. Imposing plantations and ramshackle shotgun houses still populate the countryside from Memphis to Vicksburg. Fields stretch to the horizon. The hands that dig into black Delta dirt belong to people like Willena Scott-White, African Americans who bear faces and names passed down from men and women who were owned here, who were kept here, and who chose to stay here, tending the same fields their forebears tended.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut some things have changed. Back in the day, snow-white bolls of King Cotton reigned. Now much of the land is green with soybeans. The farms and plantations are much larger—industrial operations with bioengineered plants, laser-guided tractors, and crop-dusting drones. Fewer and fewer farms are still owned by actual farmers. Investors in boardrooms throughout the country have bought hundreds of thousands of acres of premium Delta land. If you’re one of the millions of people who have a retirement account with the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association, for instance, you might even own a little bit yourself.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTIAA is one of the largest pension firms in the United States. Together with its subsidiaries and associated funds, it has a portfolio of more than 80,000 acres in Mississippi alone, most of them in the Delta. If the fertile crescent of Arkansas is included, TIAA holds more than 130,000 acres in a strip of counties along the Mississippi River. And TIAA is not the only big corporate landlord in the region. Hancock Agricultural Investment Group manages more than 65,000 acres in what it calls the “Delta states.” The real-estate trust Farmland Partners has 30,000 acres in and around the Delta. AgriVest, a subsidiary of the Swiss bank UBS, owned 22,000 acres as of 2011. (AgriVest did not respond to a request for more recent information.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnlike their counterparts even two or three generations ago, black people living and working in the Delta today have been almost completely uprooted from the soil—as property owners, if not as laborers. In Washington County, Mississippi, where last February TIAA reportedly bought 50,000 acres for more than $200 million, black people make up 72 percent of the population but own only 11 percent of the farmland, in part or in full. In Tunica County, where TIAA has acquired plantations from some of the oldest farm-owning white families in the state, black people make up 77 percent of the population but own only 6 percent of the farmland. In Holmes County, the third-blackest county in the nation, black people make up about 80 percent of the population but own only 19 percent of the farmland. TIAA owns plantations there, too. In just a few years, a single company has accumulated a portfolio in the Delta almost equal to the remaining holdings of the African Americans who have lived on and shaped this land for centuries.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is not a story about TIAA—at least not primarily. The company’s newfound dominance in the region is merely the topsoil covering a history of loss and legally sanctioned theft in which TIAA played no part. But TIAA’s position is instrumental in understanding both how the crimes of Jim Crow have been laundered by time and how the legacy of ill-gotten gains has become a structural part of American life. The land was wrested first from Native Americans, by force. It was then cleared, watered, and made productive for intensive agriculture by the labor of enslaved Africans, who after Emancipation would come to own a portion of it. Later, through a variety of means—sometimes legal, often coercive, in many cases legal \u003ci\u003eand\u003c/i\u003e coercive, occasionally violent—farmland owned by black people came into the hands of white people. It was aggregated into larger holdings, then aggregated again, eventually attracting the interest of Wall Street.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"full-width\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" height=\"767\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/07/WEL_NewKirk_Tractor/905180ac6.jpg\" width=\"960\"\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"caption\"\u003eWillena Scott-White’s son Joseph White cutting grass at the edge of a field on Scott-family land, Mound Bayou, Mississippi (Zora J.

But what happened to black landowners in the South, and particularly in the Delta, is distinct, and was propelled not only by economic change but also by white racism and local white power. A war waged by deed of title has dispossessed 98 percent of black agricultural landowners in America. They have lost 12 million acres over the past century. But even that statement falsely consigns the losses to long-ago history. In fact, the losses mostly occurred within living memory, from the 1950s onward. Today, except for a handful of farmers like the Scotts who have been able to keep or get back some land, black people in this most productive corner of the Deep South own almost nothing of the bounty under their feet.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eII. “Land Hunger”\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=\"smallcaps\"\u003eLand has always been \u003c/span\u003ethe main battleground of racial conflict in Mississippi. During Reconstruction, fierce resistance from the planters who had dominated antebellum society effectively killed any promise of land or protection from the Freedmen’s Bureau, forcing masses of black laborers back into de facto bondage. But the sheer size of the black population—black people were a majority in Mississippi until the 1930s—meant that thousands were able to secure tenuous footholds as landowners between Emancipation and the Great Depression.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDriven by what W. E. B. Du Bois called “land hunger” among freedmen during Reconstruction, two generations of black workers squirreled away money and went after every available and affordable plot they could, no matter how marginal or hopeless. Some found sympathetic white landowners who would sell to them. Some squatted on unused land or acquired the few homesteads available to black people. Some followed visionary leaders to all-black utopian agrarian experiments, such as Mound Bayou, in Bolivar County.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1901/03/the-freedmens-bureau/308772/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eFrom March 1901: W.

In 1900, according to the historian James C. Cobb, black landowners in Tunica County outnumbered white ones three to one. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, there were 25,000 black farm operators in 1910, an increase of almost 20 percent from 1900. Black farmland in Mississippi totaled 2.2 million acres in 1910—some 14 percent of all black-owned agricultural land in the country, and the most of any state.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe foothold was never secure. From the beginning, even the most enterprising black landowners found themselves fighting a war of attrition, often fraught with legal obstacles that made passing title to future generations difficult. Bohlen Lucas, one of the few black Democratic politicians in the Delta during Reconstruction (most black politicians at the time were Republicans), was born enslaved and managed to buy a 200-acre farm from his former overseer. But, like many farmers, who often have to borrow against expected harvests to pay for equipment, supplies, and the rent or mortgage on their land, Lucas depended on credit extended by powerful lenders. In his case, credit depended specifically on white patronage, given in exchange for his help voting out the Reconstruction government—after which his patrons abandoned him. He was left with 20 acres.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn Humphreys County, Lewis Spearman avoided the pitfalls of white patronage by buying less valuable wooded tracts and grazing cattle there as he moved into cotton. But when cotton crashed in the 1880s, Spearman, over his head in debt, crashed with it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAround the turn of the century, in Leflore County, a black farm organizer and proponent of self-sufficiency—referred to as a “notoriously bad Negro” in the local newspapers—led a black populist awakening, marching defiantly and by some accounts bringing boycotts against white merchants. White farmers responded with a posse that may have killed as many as 100 black farmers and sharecroppers along with women and children. The fate of the “bad Negro” in question, named Oliver Cromwell, is uncertain. Some sources say he escaped to Jackson, and into anonymity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLike so many of his forebears, Ed Scott Sr., Willena Scott-White’s grandfather, acquired his land through not much more than force of will. As recorded in the thick binders of family history that Willena had brought along in the truck, and that we flipped through between stretches of work in the fields, his life had attained the gloss of folklore. He was born in 1886 in western Alabama, a generation removed from bondage. Spurred by that same land hunger, Scott took his young family to the Delta, seeking opportunities to farm his own property. He sharecropped and rented, and managed large farms for white planters, who valued his ability to run their sprawling estates. One of these men was Palmer H. Brooks, who owned a 7,000-acre plantation in Mississippi’s Leflore and Sunflower Counties. Brooks was uncommonly progressive, encouraging entrepreneurship among the black laborers on his plantation, building schools and churches for them, and providing loans. Scott was ready when Brooks decided to sell plots to black laborers, and he bought his first 100 acres.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnlike Bohlen Lucas, Scott largely avoided politics. Unlike Lewis Spearman, he paid his debts and kept some close white allies—a necessity, since he usually rejected government assistance. And unlike Oliver Cromwell, he led his community under the rules already in place, appearing content with what he’d earned for his family in an environment of total segregation. He leveraged technical skills and a talent for management to impress sympathetic white people and disarm hostile ones. “Granddaddy always had nice vehicles,” Scott-White told me. They were a trapping of pride in a life of toil. As was true in most rural areas at the time, a new truck was not just a flashy sign of prosperity but also a sort of credit score. Wearing starched dress shirts served the same purpose, elevating Scott in certain respects—always within limits—even above some white farmers who drove into town in dirty overalls. The trucks got shinier as his holdings grew. By the time Scott died, in 1957, he had amassed more than 1,000 acres of farmland.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eScott-White guided me right up to the Quiver River, where the legend of her family began. It was a choked, green-brown gurgle of a thing, the kind of lazy waterway that one imagines to be brimming with fat, yawning catfish and snakes. “Mr. Brooks sold all of the land on the east side of this river to black folks,” Scott-White told me. She swept her arm to encompass the endless acres. “All of these were once owned by black families.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"full-width\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/07/WEL_Newkirk_Family/5dff9b3fb.jpg\" width=\"960\"\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"caption\"\u003eMembers of the extended Scott family. \u003cem\u003eFrom the right\u003c/em\u003e: Isaac Daniel Scott Sr. and his wife, Lucy Chatman-Scott; Willena Scott-White; and Willena’s son Joseph White, with his daughter, Jade Marie White.

The Great Dispossession\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=\"smallcaps\"\u003eThat era of black ownership\u003c/span\u003e\u003cb\u003e, \u003c/b\u003ein the Delta and throughout the country, was already fading by the time Scott died. As the historian Pete Daniel recounts, half a million black-owned farms across the country failed in the 25 years after 1950. Joe Brooks, the former president of the Emergency Land Fund, a group founded in 1972 to fight the problem of dispossession, has estimated that something on the order of 6 million acres was lost by black farmers from 1950 to 1969. That’s an average of 820 acres a day—an area the size of New York’s Central Park erased with each sunset. Black-owned cotton farms in the South almost completely disappeared, diminishing from 87,000 to just over 3,000 in the 1960s alone. According to the Census of Agriculture, the racial disparity in farm acreage increased in Mississippi from 1950 to 1964, when black farmers lost almost 800,000 acres of land. An analysis for \u003cem\u003eThe Atlantic\u003c/em\u003e by a research team that included Dania Francis, at the University of Massachusetts, and Darrick Hamilton, at Ohio State, translates this land loss into a financial loss—including both property and income—of $3.7 billion to $6.6 billion in today’s dollars.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/02/jesmyn-ward-mississippi/552500/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eJesmyn Ward: Racism is ‘built into the very bones’ of Mississippi\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis was a silent and devastating catastrophe, one created and maintained by federal policy. President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal life raft for agriculture helped start the trend in 1937 with the establishment of the Farm Security Administration, an agency within the Department of Agriculture. Although the FSA ostensibly existed to help the country’s small farmers, as happened with much of the rest of the New Deal, white administrators often ignored or targeted poor black people—denying them loans and giving sharecropping work to white people. After Roosevelt’s death, in 1945, conservatives in Congress replaced the FSA with the Farmers Home Administration, or FmHA. The FmHA quickly transformed the FSA’s programs for small farmers, establishing the sinews of the loan-and-subsidy structure that undergirds American agriculture today. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy’s administration created the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, or ASCS, a complementary program to the FmHA that also provided loans to farmers. The ASCS was a federal effort—also within the Department of Agriculture—but, crucially, the members of committees doling out money and credit were elected locally, during a time when black people were prohibited from voting.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThrough these programs, and through massive crop and surplus purchasing, the USDA became the safety net, price-setter, chief investor, and sole regulator for most of the farm economy in places like the Delta. The department could offer better loan terms to risky farmers than banks and other lenders, and mostly outcompeted private credit. In his book \u003cem\u003eDispossession\u003c/em\u003e, Daniel calls the setup “agrigovernment.” Land-grant universities pumped out both farm operators and the USDA agents who connected those operators to federal money. Large plantations ballooned into even larger industrial crop factories as small farms collapsed. The mega-farms held sway over agricultural policy, resulting in more money, at better interest rates, for the plantations themselves. At every level of agrigovernment, the leaders were white.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMajor audits and investigations of the USDA have found that illegal pressures levied through its loan programs created massive transfers of wealth from black to white farmers, especially in the period just after the 1950s. In 1965, the United States Commission on Civil Rights uncovered blatant and dramatic racial differences in the level of federal investment in farmers. The commission found that in a sample of counties across the South, the FmHA provided much larger loans for small and medium-size white-owned farms, relative to net worth, than it did for similarly sized black-owned farms—evidence that racial discrimination “has served to accelerate the displacement and impoverishment of the Negro farmer.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn Sunflower County, a man named Ted Keenan told investigators that in 1956, local banks had denied him loans after a bad crop because of his position with the NAACP, where he openly advocated for voting rights. The FmHA had denied him loans as well. Keenan described how Eugene Fisackerly, the leader of the White Citizens’ Council in Sunflower County, together with representatives of Senator James Eastland, a notorious white supremacist who maintained a large plantation there, had intimidated him into renouncing his affiliation with the NAACP and agreeing not to vote. Only then did Eastland’s man call the local FmHA agent, prompting him to reconsider Keenan’s loan.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA landmark 2001 investigation by the Associated Press into extortion, exploitation, and theft directed against black farmers uncovered more than 100 cases like Keenan’s. In the 1950s and ’60s, Norman Weathersby, a Holmes County Chevrolet dealer who enjoyed a local monopoly on trucks and heavy farm equipment, required black farmers to put up land as collateral for loans on equipment. A close friend of his, William Strider, was the local FmHA agent. Black farmers in the area claimed that the two ran a racket: Strider would slow-walk them on FmHA loans, which meant they would then default on Weathersby’s loans and lose their land to him. Strider and Weathersby were reportedly free to run this racket because black farmers were shut out by local banks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnalyzing the history of federal programs, the Emergency Land Fund emphasizes a key distinction. While most of the black land loss appears on its face to have been through \u003ci\u003elegal \u003c/i\u003emechanisms—“the tax sale; the partition sale; and the foreclosure”—it mainly stemmed from \u003ci\u003eillegal \u003c/i\u003epressures, including discrimination in federal and state programs, swindles by lawyers and speculators, unlawful denials of private loans, and even outright acts of violence or intimidation. Discriminatory loan servicing and loan denial by white-controlled FmHA and ASCS committees forced black farmers into foreclosure, after which their property could be purchased by wealthy landowners, almost all of whom were white. Discrimination by private lenders had the same result. Many black farmers who escaped foreclosure were defrauded by white tax assessors who set assessments too high, leading to unaffordable tax obligations. The inevitable result: tax sales, where, again, the land was purchased by wealthy white people. Black people’s lack of access to legal services complicated inheritances and put family claims to title in jeopardy. Lynchings, police brutality, and other forms of intimidation were sometimes used to dispossess black farmers, and even when land wasn’t a motivation for such actions, much of the violence left land without an owner.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn interviews with researchers from the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History in 1985, Henry Woodard Sr., an African American who had bought land in the 1950s in Tunica County, said he had managed to keep up for years through a combination of his own industry, small loans from the FmHA and white banks, and the rental of additional land from other hard-pressed black landowners. Then, in 1966, the activist James Meredith—whose 1962 fight to integrate Ole Miss sparked deadly riots and a wave of white backlash—embarked on the famous \u003ca href=\"https://time.com/4356404/james-meredith-50th-anniversary-march-against-fear/\"\u003eMarch Against Fear\u003c/a\u003e. The next planting season, Woodard recalled, his white lenders ignored him. “I sensed that it was because of this march,” he said. “And it was a lady told me—I was at the post office and she told me, she said, ‘Henry, you Negroes, y’all want to live like white folks. Y’all don’t know how white folks live. But y’all are gonna have to be on your own now.’ ”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWoodard’s story would have been familiar to countless farmers in the Delta. In Holmes County, a crucible of the voting-rights movement, a black effort to integrate the local ASCS committees was so successful that it was subject to surveillance and sabotage by the Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission, an official agency created by Governor J. P. Coleman in 1956 to resist integration. Black landowners involved in running for the committees or organizing for votes faced fierce retaliation. In 1965, \u003cem\u003eThe New Republic\u003c/em\u003e reported that in Issaquena County, just north of Vicksburg, the “insurance of Negroes active in the ASCS elections had been canceled, loans were denied to Negroes on all crops but cotton, and ballots were not mailed to Negro wives who were co-owners of land.” Even in the decades after the passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, formal and informal complaints against the USDA poured out of the Delta.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese cases of dispossession can only be called theft. While the civil-rights era is remembered as a time of victories against disenfranchisement and segregation, many realities never changed. The engine of white wealth built on kleptocracy—which powered both Jim Crow and its slave-state precursor—continued to run. The black population in Mississippi declined by almost one-fifth from 1950 to 1970, as the white population increased by the exact same percentage. Farmers slipped away one by one into the night, appearing later as laborers in Chicago and Detroit. By the time black people truly gained the ballot in Mississippi, they were a clear minority, held in thrall to a white conservative supermajority.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/07/the-ghosts-of-freedom-summer-in-greenwood-mississippi/374106/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eNikole Hannah-Jones: Freedom Summer, 1964: Did it really change Mississippi?\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMass dispossession did not require a central organizing force or a grand conspiracy. Thousands of individual decisions by white people, enabled or motivated by greed, racism, existing laws, and market forces, all pushed in a single direction. But some white people undeniably would have organized it this way if they could have. The civil-rights leader Bayard Rustin reported in 1956 that documents taken from the office of Robert Patterson, one of the founding fathers of the White Citizens’ Councils, proposed a “master plan” to force hundreds of thousands of black people from Mississippi in order to reduce their potential voting power. Patterson envisioned, in Rustin’s words, “the decline of the small independent farmer” and ample doses of “economic pressure.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAn upheaval of this scale and speed—the destruction of black farming, an occupation that had defined the African American experience—might in any other context be described as a revolution, or seen as a historical fulcrum. But it came and went with little remark.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eIV. The Catfish Boom\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=\"smallcaps\"\u003eWorld War II\u003c/span\u003e\u003cb\u003e \u003c/b\u003etransformed America in many ways. It certainly transformed a generation of southern black men. That generation included Medgar Evers, a future civil-rights martyr, assassinated while leading the Mississippi NAACP; he served in a segregated transportation company in Europe during the war. It included Willena’s father, Ed Scott Jr., who also served in a segregated transportation company. These men were less patient, more defiant, and in many ways more reckless than their fathers and grandfathers had been. They chafed under a system that forced them to relearn how to bow and scrape, as if the war had never happened. In the younger Scott’s case, wartime service sharpened his inherited land hunger, pushing him to seek more land and greater financial independence, both for himself and for his community. One of his siblings told his biographer, Julian Rankin, that the family’s deepest conviction was that “a million years from now … this land will still be Scotts’ land.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUpon his return to the Delta, Scott continued down his father’s hard path, avoiding any interface with the FmHA and the public portions of the agrigovernment system, which by that time had spread its tendrils throughout Sunflower and Leflore Counties. He leaned on the friendships he and his father had made with local business owners and farmers, and secured credit for growing his holdings from friendly white bankers. Influenced by the civil-rights movement and its emphasis on community solidarity and activism, Scott borrowed from Oliver Cromwell’s self-sufficiency playbook too. He used his status to provide opportunities for other black farmers and laborers. “Daddy said that everyone who worked for us would always be able to eat,” Willena Scott-White told me. He made sure of more than that. Scott sent relatives’ and tenants’ children to school, paid for books, helped people open bank accounts and buy their own land. When civil-rights activists made their way down for Mississippi’s Freedom Summer, in 1964, he packed up meals and brought them to rallies.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen Scott-White thinks of her father, who died in 2015, she seems to become a young girl again. With allowances for nostalgia, she recalls a certain kind of country poorness-but-not-poverty, whereby children ran barefoot and worked from the moment they could walk, but ate well, lived in houses with solid floors and tight roofs, and went to high school and college if they showed skill. “We lived in something like a utopia,” Scott-White told me. But things changed at the tail end of the 1970s. Plummeting commodity prices forced highly leveraged farmers to seek loans wherever they could find them. Combined with the accelerating inflation of that decade, the beginnings of the farm-credit crisis made farming at scale without federal assistance impossible. Yet federal help—even then, two decades after the Civil Rights Act—was not available for most black farmers. According to a 2005 article in \u003cem\u003eThe Nation\u003c/em\u003e, “In 1984 and 1985, at the height of the farm crisis, the USDA lent a total of $1.3 billion to nearly 16,000 farmers to help them maintain their land. Only 209 of those farmers were black.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs Rankin tells it in his biography, \u003ci\u003eCatfish Dream\u003c/i\u003e, Scott made his first visit to an FmHA office in 1978. With the assistance of Vance Nimrod, a white man who worked with the black-owned Delta Foundation, a nonprofit promoting economic advancement for black Mississippians, Scott secured an operating loan for a season of soybeans and rice from the FmHA agent Delbert Edwards. The first time was easy—although, crucially, Nimrod accompanied him to the Leflore County office, in Greenwood. When Scott returned the next year without Nimrod, driving a shiny new truck the way his father used to, Edwards asked where Nimrod was. According to Rankin, Scott told the agent that Nimrod had only come to help secure that first loan; he wasn’t a business partner. When Edwards saw Scott’s vehicle, he seemed perplexed. “Who told you to buy a new truck?” he asked. Edwards ended up denying the requested loan amount.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, Edwards and the FmHA were moving to help local white farmers weather the storm, often by advising them to get into raising catfish. Commercial catfish farming was a relatively new industry, and it had found a home in the Delta as prices for row crops crashed and new legislation gave the USDA power and incentive to build up domestic fish farming. FmHA agents pushed white farmers to convert wide fields on the floodplain into giant catfish ponds, many of which would become contract-growing hubs for Delta Pride Catfish, a cooperative that quickly evolved into a local monopoly. The federal government poured millions of dollars into the catfish boom by way of FmHA loans, many of which were seized on by the largest white landowners, and kept those white landowners solvent. Mississippi became the catfish capital of the world in the 1970s. But the FmHA did not reach out to Scott, nor is there evidence that it supported the ambitions of any black farmers who might have wanted to get into catfish.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eScott decided to get into catfish anyway, digging eight ponds in fields where rice had grown the season before. He found his own catfish stocks and learned the ins and outs of the industry pretty much on his own. Scott finished digging his ponds in 1981, at which point, according to Rankin, Edwards of the FmHA visited the property and told him point-blank: “Don’t think I’m giving you any damn money for that dirt you’re moving.” The Mississippi FmHA would eventually compel Edwards to provide loans for Scott’s catfish operation for 1981 and 1982. But as court records show, the amount approved was far less than what white catfish farmers usually got—white farmers sometimes received double or triple the amount per acre that Scott did—and enough to stock only four of the eight ponds. (Edwards could not be reached for comment on any of the episodes recounted here.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"full-width\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" height=\"610\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/07/WEL_NewKirk_CatfishEDIT/f521aa922.jpg\" width=\"960\"\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"caption\"\u003eThe official opening of the processing plant for Scott’s Fresh Catfish, February 1983. \u003cem\u003eSeated, far left:\u003c/em\u003e Ed Scott Jr., founder and owner. \u003cem\u003eNext to Scott\u003c/em\u003e: Jim Buck Ross, Mississippi’s longtime commissioner of agriculture and commerce.

As a marker outside the old processing shed now indicates, it was the first catfish plant in the country owned by an African American. But discrimination doomed the enterprise before it really began. Without enough capital, Scott was never able to raise fish at the volume he needed. He claimed in court and later to Rankin that he had also been denied a chance to purchase stock in Delta Pride—a requirement to become a contract grower—because he was black. Without access to a cooperative, he had to do the processing and packaging himself, adding to the cost of his product. In 2006, Delta Pride and Country Select Catfish were combined into a new business entity, Consolidated Catfish Producers. When reached for comment, a spokesperson for Consolidated Catfish said that no employee at the new company could “definitively answer” questions about Scott or alleged discrimination against him.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eScott was in his 60s by the time his plant got off the ground. The effort took a toll. He slowly went blind. Arthritis claimed his joints. His heart began to fail. The plant limped quietly through the ’80s and then shut down. Lenders began the process of foreclosing on some of Scott’s cropland as early as 1983. In 1995, the FmHA approved a request from Scott to lease most of his remaining acres. The USDA itself had claimed most of his land by the late 1980s.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe downfall of the Scott catfish enterprise was proof of the strength and endurance of what the federal government would later state could be seen as a federally funded “conspiracy to force minority and disadvantaged farmers off their land through discriminatory loan practices.” The Scotts were not small-timers. They had the kind of work ethic and country savvy that are usually respected around the Delta. When the powers that be finally prevailed over Ed Scott Jr., they had completed something decisive, something that even today feels as if it cannot be undone.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eV. Farmers in Suits\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=\"smallcaps\"\u003eBut land is never really lost,\u003c/span\u003e not in America. Twelve million acres of farmland in a country that has become a global breadbasket carries immense value, and the dispossessed land in the Delta is some of the most productive in America. The soil on the alluvial plain is rich. The region is warm and wet. Much of the land is perfect for industrialized agriculture.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSome white landowners, like Norman Weathersby, themselves the beneficiaries of government-funded dispossession, left land to their children. Some sold off to their peers, and others saw their land gobbled up by even larger white-owned farms. Nowadays, as fewer and fewer of the children of aging white landowners want to continue farming, more land has wound up in the hands of trusts and investors. Over the past 20 years, the real power brokers in the Delta are less likely to be good ol’ boys and more likely to be suited venture capitalists, hedge-fund managers, and agribusiness consultants who run farms with the cold precision of giant circuit boards.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne new addition to the mix is pension funds. Previously, farmland had never been a choice asset class for large-scale investing. In 1981, what was then called the General Accounting Office (now the Government Accountability Office) released a report exploring a proposal by a firm seeking pension-investment opportunities in farmland. The report essentially laughed off the prospect. The authors found that only about one dollar of every $4,429 in retirement funds was invested in farmland.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"full-width\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/07/WEL_Newkirk_Bins/d88edd8cc.jpg\" width=\"960\"\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"caption\"\u003eGrain bins on Scott-family land, in Drew, once used for rice and now for soybeans.

Murff)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut commodity prices increased, and land values rose. In 2008, a weakened dollar forced major funds to broaden their search for hedges against inflation. “The market in agricultural land in the U.S. is currently experiencing a boom,” an industry analyst, Tom Vulcan, wrote that year. He took note of the recent entry of TIAA-CREF, which had “spent some $340 million on farmland across seven states.” TIAA, as the company is now called, would soon become the biggest pension-fund player in the agricultural real-estate game across the globe. In 2010, TIAA bought a controlling interest in Westchester Group, a major agricultural-asset manager. In 2014, it bought Nuveen, another large asset-management firm. In 2015, with Nuveen directing its overall investment strategy and Westchester and other smaller subsidiaries operating as purchasers and managers, TIAA raised $3 billion for a new global farmland-investment partnership. By the close of 2016, Nuveen’s management portfolio included nearly 2 million acres of farmland, worth close to $6 billion.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInvestment in farmland has proved troublesome for TIAA in Mississippi and elsewhere. TIAA is a pension company originally set up for teachers and professors and people in the nonprofit world. It has cultivated a reputation for social responsibility: promoting environmental sustainability and respecting land rights, labor rights, and resource rights. TIAA has endorsed the United Nations–affiliated Principles for Responsible Investment, which include special provisions for investment in farmland, including specific guidelines with regard to sustainability, leasing practices, and establishing the provenance of tracts of land.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe company has faced pushback for its move into agriculture. In 2015, the international nonprofit \u003ca href=\"https://www.grain.org/\"\u003eGrain\u003c/a\u003e, which advocates for local control of farmland by small farmers, \u003ca href=\"https://www.grain.org/article/entries/5336-foreign-pension-funds-and-land-grabbing-in-brazil\"\u003ereleased the results of an investigation accusing TIAA’s farmland-investment arm of skirting laws\u003c/a\u003e limiting foreign land acquisition in its purchase of more than half a million acres in Brazil. The report found that TIAA had violated multiple UN guidelines in creating a joint venture with a Brazilian firm to invest in farmland without transparency. The Grain report alleges that when Brazil tightened laws designed to restrict foreign investment, TIAA purchased 49 percent of a Brazilian company that then acted as its proxy. \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/17/world/americas/tiaa-cref-us-investment-giant-accused-of-land-grabs-in-brazil.html\"\u003eAccording to \u003ci\u003eThe New York Times\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, TIAA and its subsidiaries also appear to have acquired land titles from Euclides de Carli, a businessman often described in Brazil as a big-time \u003ci\u003egrileiro\u003c/i\u003e—a member of a class of landlords and land grabbers who use a mix of legitimate means, fraud, and violence to force small farmers off their land. In response to criticism of TIAA’s Brazil portfolio, \u003ca href=\"https://www.wnycstudios.org/story/tiaa-cref-accused-illegaly-investments-brazil\"\u003eJose Minaya, then the head of private-markets asset management at TIAA, told WNYC’s \u003ci\u003eThe Takeaway\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e: “We believe and know that we are in compliance with the law, and we are transparent about what we do in Brazil. From a title perspective, our standards are very focused around not displacing individuals or indigenous people, respecting land rights as well as human rights … In every property that we have acquired, we don’t just do due diligence on that property. We do due diligence on the sellers, whether it’s an individual or whether it’s an entity.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTIAA’s land dealings have faced scrutiny in the United States as well. In 2012, \u003ca href=\"https://www.nffc.net/Issues/Corporate%20Control/TIAA-CREF%20Backgrounder_2.3.13.pdf\"\u003ethe National Family Farm Coalition found\u003c/a\u003e that the entry into agriculture of deep-pocketed institutional investors—TIAA being an example—had made it pretty much impossible for smaller farmers to compete. Institutional investment has removed millions of acres from farmers’ hands, more or less permanently. “Pension funds not only have the power to outbid smaller, local farmers, they also have the long-term goal of retaining farmland for generations,” the report noted.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAsked about TIAA’s record, a spokesperson for Nuveen maintained that the company has built its Delta portfolio following \u003ca href=\"https://www.tiaa.org/public/pdf/how_we_invest_in_farmland.pdf\"\u003eethical-investment guidelines\u003c/a\u003e: “We have a long history of investing responsibly in farmland, in keeping with our corporate values and the UN-backed Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI). As a long-term owner, we bring capital, professional expertise, and sustainable farming practices to each farm we own, and we are always looking to partner with expansion-minded tenants who will embrace that approach and act as good stewards of the land.” The company did not comment on the history of any individual tract in its Delta portfolio.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut even assuming that every acre under management by big corporate interests in the Delta has been acquired by way of ethical-investment principles, the nature of the mid-century dispossession and its multiple layers of legitimation raise the question of whether responsible investment in farmland there is even possible. As a people and a class, black farmers were plainly targets, but the deed histories of tax sales and foreclosures don’t reveal whether individual debtors were moved off the land because of discrimination and its legal tools.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn addition, land records are spotty in rural areas, especially records from the 1950s and ’60s, and in some cases it’s unclear exactly which records the investors used to meet internal requirements. According to Tristan Quinn-Thibodeau, a campaigner and organizer at ActionAid, an anti-poverty and food-justice nonprofit, “It’s been a struggle to get this information.” The organization has tried to follow the trails of deeds and has asked TIAA—which manages ActionAid’s own pension plan—for an analysis of the provenance of its Delta portfolio. Such an analysis has not been provided.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat we do know is that, whatever the specific lineage of each acre, Wall Street investors have found a lucrative new asset class whose origins lie in part in mass dispossession. We know that the vast majority of black farmland in the country is no longer in black hands, and that black farmers have suffered far more hardships than white farmers have. The historian Debra A. Reid points out that “between 1920 and 1997, the number of African Americans who farmed decreased by 98 percent, while white Americans who farmed declined by 66 percent.” Referring to the cases studied in their 2001 investigation, Dolores Barclay and Todd Lewan of the Associated Press observed that virtually all of the property lost by black farmers “is owned by whites or corporations.” The foundation of these portfolios was a system of plantations whose owners created the agrigovernment system and absorbed thousands of small black-owned farms into ever larger white-owned farms. America has its own \u003ci\u003egrileiros\u003c/i\u003e, and they stand on land that was once someone else’s.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"full-width\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" height=\"619\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/07/WEL_NewKirk_Group/dffe87f84.jpg\" width=\"960\"\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"caption\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eClockwise from the left\u003c/em\u003e: Johnny Jackson, a seasonal worker employed by the Scott family; Willena talking with her brother Isaac—up in the tractor cabin—as he works a field in Mound Bayou; a Roundup sprayer (Zora J.

Gleaming steel silos had turned into rusting hulks. The ponds were thick with weeds and debris. The exterior walls of the plant itself had collapsed. Rusted beams lay atop ruined machinery. Fire ants and kudzu had begun nature’s reclamation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLate in Ed Scott Jr.’s life, as he slipped into Alzheimer’s, Willena and his lawyer, Phil Fraas, fought to keep his original hopes alive. In the \u003cem\u003ePigford v. Glickman\u003c/em\u003e lawsuit of 1997, thousands of black farmers and their families won settlements against the USDA for discrimination that had occurred between 1981 and the end of 1996; the outlays ultimately reached a total of $2 billion. The Scotts were one of those families, and after a long battle to prove their case—with the assistance of Scott-White’s meticulous notes and family history—in 2012 the family was awarded more than $6 million in economic damages, plus almost $400,000 in other damages and debt forgiveness. The court also helped the Scotts reclaim land possessed by the department. In a 1999 ruling, Judge Paul L. Friedman of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia acknowledged that forcing the federal government to compensate black farmers would “not undo all that has been done” in centuries of government-sponsored racism. But for the Scotts, it was a start.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“The telling factor, looking at it from the long view, is that at the time of World War I there were 1 million black farmers, and in 1992 there were 18,000,” Fraas told me. The settlements stemming from \u003cem\u003ePigford\u003c/em\u003e cover only specific recent claims of discrimination, and none stretching back to the period of the civil-rights era, when the great bulk of black-owned farms disappeared. Most people have not pushed for any kind of deeper excavation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAny such excavation would quickly make plain the consequences of what occurred. During my drive with Scott-White, we traveled through parts of Leflore, Sunflower, and Washington Counties, three of the counties singled out by Opportunity Insights, a Harvard University research group, as among the worst in the country in terms of a child’s prospects for upward mobility. Ten counties in the Delta are among the poorest 50 in America. According to new data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on all 74,000 U.S. census tracts, four tracts in the Delta are among the lowest 100 when it comes to average life expectancy. More than 30 tracts in the Delta have an average life expectancy below 70. (The national average is 79.) In some Delta counties, the infant mortality rate is more than double the nationwide rate. As if to add gratuitous insult to injury, a new analysis from ProPublica finds that, as a result of the Internal Revenue Service’s intense scrutiny of low-income taxpayers, \u003ca href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/graphics/eitc-audit\"\u003ethe Delta is audited by the IRS more heavily than any other place in the country\u003c/a\u003e. In sum, the areas of deepest poverty and under the darkest shadow of death are the ones where dispossession was the most far-reaching.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"full-width\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" height=\"767\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/07/WEL_NewKirk_GraveSiteEDIT/1e4888ffa.jpg\" width=\"960\"\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"caption\"\u003eThe Scott-family cemetery. (Zora J. Murff)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe consequences of dispossession had long been predicted. Fannie Lou Hamer, a Sunflower County activist whose \u003ca href=\"http://americanradioworks.publicradio.org/features/sayitplain/flhamer.html\"\u003e1964 speech to a Democratic National Convention committee\u003c/a\u003e galvanized support for the Voting Rights Act, spoke often of the need for land reform as a precondition for true freedom. Hamer’s utopian Freedom Farm experiment stressed cooperative landownership, and she said the concentration of land in the hands of a few landowners was “at the base of our struggle for survival.” In her analysis, mass dispossession should be seen as mass extraction. Even as the U.S. government invested billions in white farmers, it continued to extract wealth from black farmers in the Delta. Each black farmer who left the region, from Reconstruction onward, represented a tiny withdrawal from one side of a cosmic balance sheet and a deposit on the other side. This dynamic would only continue, in other ways and other places, as the Great Migration brought black families to northern cities.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis cosmic balance sheet underpins the national conversation—ever more robust—about reparations for black Americans. In that conversation, given momentum in part by the publication of \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/06/the-case-for-reparations/361631/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eTa-Nehisi Coates’s “The Case for Reparations”\u003c/a\u003e in this magazine in 2014, I hear echoes of Mississippi. I hear echoes of Hamer, the Scotts, Henry Woodard Sr., and others who petitioned the federal government to hold itself accountable for a history of extraction that has extended well beyond enslavement. But that conversation too easily becomes technical. How do we quantify discrimination? How do we define who was discriminated against? How do we repay those people according to what has been defined and quantified? The idea of reparations sometimes seems like a problem of economic rightsizing—something for the quants and wonks to work out.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEconomics is, of course, a major consideration. According to the researchers Francis and Hamilton, “The dispossession of black agricultural land resulted in the loss of hundreds of billions of dollars of black wealth. We must emphasize this estimate is conservative … Depending on multiplier effects, rates of returns, and other factors, it could reach into the trillions.” The large wealth gap between white and black families today exists in part because of this historic loss.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut money does not define every dimension of land theft. Were it not for dispossession, Mississippi today might well be a majority-black state, with a radically different political destiny. Imagine the difference in our national politics if the center of gravity of black electoral strength had remained in the South after the Voting Rights Act was passed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003caside class=\"callout-placeholder\" data-source=\"curated\"\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003cp\u003ePolitics aside, how can reparations truly address the lives ruined, the family histories lost, the connection to the land severed? In America, land has always had a significance that exceeds its economic value. For a people who were once chattel themselves, real property has carried an almost mystical import. There’s a reason the fabled promise that spread among freedmen after the Civil War was not a check, a job, or a refundable tax credit, but 40 acres of farmland to call home. The history of the Delta suggests that any conversation about reparations might need to be \u003ci\u003emore \u003c/i\u003equalitative and intangible than it is. And it must consider the land.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLand hunger is ineffable, an indescribable yearning, and yet it is something that Americans, perhaps uniquely, feel and understand. That yearning tugged at me hardest as Willena Scott-White rounded out her tour of the fields, the afternoon slipping away. Out among the Scotts’ fields is a clearing with a lone, tall tree. In the clearing is a small cemetery. A handful of crooked, weathered tombstones stand sentinel. This is where Ed Scott Jr. is buried, and where some of Willena’s older siblings now rest.

Normally I don\u0026#8217;t cover these because there are so many of them and the games tend to come out pretty quickly, but it\u0026#8217;s a slow day, so here we are. The latest confirmations came via a Famitsu livestream that was held in the middle of last week. Nintendo\u0026#8217;s \u003cem\u003ePinball\u003c/em\u003e and Taito\u0026#8217;s \u003cem\u003eWater Ski\u003c/em\u003e will be released on the Switch at some point in the relatively near future. No specific dates were given, unfortunately. Neither of these titles are what you would call barn-burners, but they\u0026#8217;re fun enough in short bursts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eReviews\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSubdivision Infinity DX ($14.99)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-256785\" src=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/subdivisioninfinity1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/subdivisioninfinity1.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/subdivisioninfinity1-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/subdivisioninfinity1-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/subdivisioninfinity1-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpace games really do run the gamut in terms of complexity. It\u0026#8217;s one of the earliest themes video games explored, though early efforts weren\u0026#8217;t much more than simple shooting galleries. In a sense, that\u0026#8217;s mainly what\u003cem\u003e Subdivision Infinity DX\u003c/em\u003e is, too. There are lot of other little bits and bobs attached to it, but the main business is in shooting things of various shapes and sizes. All the gravity-free thrills of interstellar dogfighting, and very little of the administrative work that goes into some games of that sort. I enjoyed the game quite a bit in its mobile form, and I still generally like it here. I\u0026#8217;m not sure if the improvements quite make up for the price being three times higher, but it is what it is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou play as a pilot who ends up in over his head after investigating a distress signal. You end up with a smart-aleck robot sidekick, and things keep on escalating as the game works its way through the 30 or so main story missions. But you\u0026#8217;ll probably check out on the actual plot early on. It\u0026#8217;s not very interesting. What is interesting is going into space and shooting hostile baddies. That\u0026#8217;s what you\u0026#8217;ll be doing, by and large, with the occasional diversion into space-mining and space-exploring. You\u0026#8217;ll earn resources and materials that can be rolled into new weapons, upgrades, and even new ships.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-256786\" src=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/subdivisioninfinity2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/subdivisioninfinity2.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/subdivisioninfinity2-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/subdivisioninfinity2-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/subdivisioninfinity2-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe combat is a lot of fun, and being able to play with buttons makes it that much easier. This is where the game shines its brightest, as twisting and turning around in space and picking off the overwhelming number of enemies gunning for you just feels great. Your skill can certainly overcome some wild odds, but eventually you\u0026#8217;re going to need to upgrade your ship, and that\u0026#8217;s where things go a little off the rails. The amount of resources you have coming in don\u0026#8217;t quite match up to your needs, so you\u0026#8217;ll have to spend some time grinding on the side missions. Those side missions are the least fun part of the game, so having to repeat them to get your equipment up to snuff for the bits that are fun to play is kind of exhausting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, this DX version doesn\u0026#8217;t offer much more than upgraded visuals, and even that\u0026#8217;s fairly meager. If you\u0026#8217;re looking for substantial new content or a serious re-balancing to smooth out the difficulty spikes, you won\u0026#8217;t find that here. This is largely the same game that the mobile original was, with all the good and bad that implies. It\u0026#8217;s a shame because what felt like a deal at five dollars feels a little thin for fifteen. Most people will reach the end within five or six hours of play, and there isn\u0026#8217;t a whole lot of replay value here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-256787\" src=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/subdivisioninfinity3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/subdivisioninfinity3.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/subdivisioninfinity3-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/subdivisioninfinity3-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/subdivisioninfinity3-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026#8217;re just looking for some cheap space shooting thrills, \u003cem\u003eSubdivision Infinity DX\u003c/em\u003e will definitely scratch the itch well. It\u0026#8217;s a nice-looking game with good controls that really gives you a strong feeling of battling in space. There\u0026#8217;s a bit of less-exciting grinding that you\u0026#8217;ll have to occasionally engage in if you want to keep up with the rising difficulty or simply want to enjoy all of the available ships and weapons, and the lack of extra missions over the mobile original means the party ends a little earlier than you might hope. Still, it\u0026#8217;s a solid game that suits the big-screen play and portability of the Switch in equal measures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSwitchArcade Score: 3.5/5\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTaimumari: Complete Edition ($14.99)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-256788\" src=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/taimumari1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/taimumari1.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/taimumari1-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/taimumari1-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/taimumari1-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eTaimumari: Complete Edition\u003c/em\u003e includes two games in one package. The first game is the main one, \u003cem\u003eTaimumari\u003c/em\u003e. It\u0026#8217;s a side-scrolling action-platformer designed to appeal to fans of classic games. The second is\u003cem\u003e Legend of Himari\u003c/em\u003e, and although it\u0026#8217;s really more of a mini-game than anything, it\u0026#8217;s pretty fun on its own. It\u0026#8217;s basically a straight combat mode where you battle until you drop. The controls and basic mechanics are quite different between the two games. It sounds like a compelling deal, but the first game isn\u0026#8217;t exactly brimming with content and the latter is effectively a simple spin-off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn \u003cem\u003eTaimumari\u003c/em\u003e you have to tackle several stages that each culminate in a showdown with a boss character. You can choose the order in which you take on the first four stages, but with difficulty varying wildly between them, it\u0026#8217;s better to leave certain ones for later. You start off with a basic set of moves. You can double-jump, cling to walls, dash, air-dash, swing a sword, and fire off a straight bolt of magical energy. As you progress, you\u0026#8217;ll uncover new magical powers that typically relate to the boss of the stage you find them in. You\u0026#8217;ll also collect lots of stars that can be exchanged at the hub town for upgrades to various parameters. With this system, you can upgrade your health, attack, and so on. You can also buy extra lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-256789\" src=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/taimumari2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/taimumari2.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/taimumari2-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/taimumari2-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/taimumari2-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0026#8217;ll need those lives, because should you run out during a stage, you\u0026#8217;ll get a choice to be kicked back to the beginning of the stage or the hub town. Stages are pretty long and often contain quite a few deadly challenges of their own, so running out of lives near the end or when facing the stage boss can be incredibly disheartening. Bosses have patterns that are easy enough to spot but rarely simple to dodge. Beating them is really just a matter of learning how they move and getting your licks in where you can. The stages themselves are unfortunately quite rife with one-hit kills in the form of spikes, pits, and crushers. The collision detection generally isn\u0026#8217;t too bad, but some of these hazards can be less than generous. Checkpoints are reasonably placed so long as your lives hold out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough \u003cem\u003eTaimumari\u003c/em\u003e claims it\u0026#8217;s reaching back to 8- and 16-bit classics, its level designs feel a lot more modern. You\u0026#8217;ll have to do all kinds of tricky mid-air moves with your air dash and wall jump just to get through the main path of each stage, and gathering up all the collectables is a big ask at times. The main character Himari moves around a lot like Mega Man X or Zero, but the obstacles you\u0026#8217;ll have to overcome feel more like they\u0026#8217;re drawn from the likes of\u003cem\u003e Super Meat Boy\u003c/em\u003e or \u003cem\u003eCeleste\u003c/em\u003e. It\u0026#8217;s a tough game, and you\u0026#8217;ll almost certainly have to try some of the stages multiple times to clear them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-256790\" src=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/taimumari3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/taimumari3.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/taimumari3-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/taimumari3-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/taimumari3-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat said, the controls are good, the boss patterns are fun to figure out, and the secrets are enjoyable to suss out even if they require a fair bit of skill to nab at times. It\u0026#8217;s a fine enough game, even if its difficulty curve sometimes feels like you\u0026#8217;re driving at full-speed down a road full of pot holes. There\u0026#8217;s definitely some enjoyment to be had here if you\u0026#8217;re not easily driven off by frustration. Sadly, the game wraps up after a short number of stages, making for a relatively brief romp on the whole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for the\u003cem\u003e Legend of Himari\u003c/em\u003e, it feels a lot like a mobile game. Your chosen character stands in the middle of the screen. Enemies will start to rush in from all directions, and you have to fend them off with a combination of sword strikes and screen taps. If you\u0026#8217;re not playing in handheld mode, there\u0026#8217;s a cursor you can move around and use to virtually tap things. Airborne enemies like birds needs to be tapped to be defeated, and items have to be tapped to pick them up. Anyway, survive as long as you can and you\u0026#8217;ll be awarded with some stars. Uses those stars to buy new characters, rinse and repeat. It\u0026#8217;s amusing and generally less aggravating than the main game, though it\u0026#8217;s obviously not a great experience if you\u0026#8217;re playing docked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-256791\" src=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/taimumari4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/taimumari4.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/taimumari4-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/taimumari4-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/taimumari4-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth games have their share of problems, and even as a set it\u0026#8217;s hard to say if you\u0026#8217;ll get what you\u0026#8217;d like out of it. I had some fun with both games, though the first was a bit too frustrating at times and the second got repetitive pretty quickly. I\u0026#8217;d be remiss if I failed to point out that you can buy both of these games for a much cheaper price on computer, if that\u0026#8217;s an option for you. If you somehow find yourself starved for a platformer on Switch, you can definitely do worse than \u003cem\u003eTaimumari\u003c/em\u003e, but you could easily do a lot better, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSwitchArcade Score: 3/5\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWordsweeper by POWGI ($7.99)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-256792\" src=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/wordsweeper1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/wordsweeper1.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/wordsweeper1-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/wordsweeper1-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/wordsweeper1-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLightwood Games has a niche that they serve consistently and quite well. \u003cem\u003eWordsweeper by POWGI\u003c/em\u003e is aimed squarely at that audience, and I imagine they\u0026#8217;ll be quite content with what it has to offer. Like many of the publisher\u0026#8217;s other games, this is a logic puzzle involving words. The presentation is spartan, the puzzle count is high, and the challenge level is just high enough to keep you occupied. It\u0026#8217;s a fine little thing to keep on your Switch for those moments when you don\u0026#8217;t want to get too involved with something but need to kill a few minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe basic idea here is to twist the familiar concept of \u003cem\u003eMinesweeper\u003c/em\u003e with a word puzzle. You\u0026#8217;re given what looks like a crossword grid but with some letters in the unused portions of the board. Those letters tell you the possible choices for the cells adjacent to them. You have to use logical deduction to determine which letters go where, making words as you go. Since the possible choice of letters for each cell is limited, you can kind of stumble your way through without even using the hints in some cases. It\u0026#8217;s really interesting initially, but once you understand the method it becomes rather easy to solve even the harder puzzles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-256793\" src=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/wordsweeper2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/wordsweeper2.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/wordsweeper2-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/wordsweeper2-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/wordsweeper2-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe game\u0026#8217;s 120 puzzles are broken up into four groups that are supposed to represent different levels of difficulty. Honestly, I didn\u0026#8217;t notice much of a difference in terms of how tough they were. But hey, 120 puzzles is a pretty good number. Each one takes at least a couple of minutes to clear, so you\u0026#8217;re looking at at least four or five hours of word-guessing fun. Beating each puzzle treats you to a joke from the POWGI dog, which is a fine reward if I ever saw one. Otherwise, it\u0026#8217;s as bare-bones as it gets as far as presentation goes. You get some simple music along with plain menus, but I do like that you can get into a game very quickly from start-up. In-game, there are a couple of nice touches like graying out used letters and indicating a letter conflict using a striking red color.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, you probably already know if this kind of game is your thing or not. The novelty of this one really had me keen on it early on, but over the course of playing its puzzles I found them starting to melt together, never really asking for anything new of me. After that, the game settled into the same sort of groove that most of Lightwood\u0026#8217;s titles live in. Like a box of crackers it\u0026#8217;s probably not going to be anyone\u0026#8217;s first choice, but once you\u0026#8217;ve opened it and popped the first cracker in your mouth, you probably won\u0026#8217;t stop until the box has been mysteriously emptied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSwitchArcade Score: 3.5/5\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSales\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh hey, the \u003cem\u003eTurok\u003c/em\u003e games are on sale.

Bugs, I guess. \n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"clear:both;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"video-responsive\"\u003e\n\t\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cM45LXUxcbk\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"float:left; padding-right:1em;\"\u003e\n\u003ccenter\u003e\n\t\u003ca href=\"http://toucharcade.com/link/http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id955705796?mt=8\" alt=\"MARVEL Future Fight\" title=\"MARVEL Future Fight\" width=\"65\" height=\"65\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28686\"\u003e\n\t\t\u003cimg style=\"border-radius:20px;\" src=\"https://toucharcade.com/wp-content/images/app/955705796/100x100bb.jpg\" /\u003e\n\t\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/center\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\t\u003ca href=\"http://toucharcade.com/link/http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id955705796?mt=8\" style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"\u003e\n\t\t\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eMARVEL Future Fight\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e, Free\n\t\u003c/a\u003e\n\tSpeaking of Marvel\u0026#8217;s 80th Anniversary, that seems to be the focal point of this update to \u003cem\u003eMarvel Future Fight\u003c/em\u003e. Three new characters have been added to the playable roster, each presumably representing a different era of the company\u0026#8217;s history. We\u0026#8217;ve got a Tier-3 Namor, a regular old Silver Surfer, and recently-created heroine Wave. The Fantastic Four can now suit up in their Future Foundation uniforms, and a new Heroic Quest associated with Wave has been added. Finally, there\u0026#8217;s a new Giant Boss Raid. The target?

Four new heroes get character-specific weapon skills that they can unlock, and the pieces have been put in place for the upcoming Lost Lore events. Those kick off tomorrow, and see players sending various heroes to scout other worlds in order to find lore for the Heroes Saga. Okay, enjoy the other dimension, Dorcas.

This update does not have those big things, but it has preludes to the big things, and that\u0026#8217;s rather nifty all on its own. A few things have been improved in the early beta for First Person mode. The lights have also been improved, and performance on the whole should be better as of this version. A screenshot mode has been added in camera settings that will clear the UI for a nice clean shot, and a search has been added to the start-up menu.

A new Sunset Canyon arena with an event that may well be finished by now, or at least close to it. The Osiris League has officially kicked off, complete with a league betting system. Let\u0026#8217;s see\u0026#8230; the Qixi Festival events should be off and running now, letting you pick up a special holiday theme and a new city decoration. Finally, the second season of The Lost Kingdom seems to be on the way, sporting some improvements over the first. I guess we\u0026#8217;ll see.

This update adds a new character named Mary in an event that should be kicking off soon-ish. If you can collect all of the decorations, you\u0026#8217;ll get a special summer mansion makeover. The Gardener contest continues, so go and make your finest summer garden to see how you fare. There\u0026#8217;s yet another new character here named Matthias, who is a tourist that is apparently hiding a secret of some kind. What could it be? Will we ever know? I mean, that would be cool, but I\u0026#8217;m also prepared for the game to drop the mystery like a hot potato, only picking it up years later in an effort to generate some buzz.

As usual, we\u0026#8217;ve got 50 new levels, and a little story behind their existence that may or may not be in the actual game itself. The idea here is that the toys are visiting a fashion boutique? It promises stylish clothing and fancy jewelry. I don\u0026#8217;t know. Like, I appreciate the effort.

Here\u0026#8217;s the first update in a little while for the game, and it adds a few things and fixes a lot of others. First, there\u0026#8217;s a new interactive scene to enjoy. The emissary flow has been reworked, and character-specific advice is now given more reliably. Are you still using an iPhone 4S? Well, this update makes it work better on that device. For people in 2019, you can enjoy a better experience on your iPad Pro. Healers are now less likely to be war leaders, which probably makes sense. Lots of bugs were fixed up, some calculations have been adjusted, and some minimal keyboard support has been added. Well, that all looks good enough for a coveted \u003cem\u003eUMMSotW\u003c/em\u003e award, if you ask me.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat about wraps it up for last week\u0026#8217;s significant updates.

Bringing the hurt to your adversaries is as simple as the pull of a trigger. Swap between your Long Gun for powerful, longer-range attacks or your Hand Gun for quicker, closer range damage.

Your every movement must be deliberate. Despite their ferocity, enemies will telegraph their attacks, giving survivors with a well-honed dodge instinct a chance to avoid almost anything thrown their way. Dodging and sprinting both consume stamina, so timing these actions is crucial. Well-timed dodges may be the difference between life and death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48489502786_3faf4160b7_o.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48489502786_0e05962a3d_h.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Remnant: From the Ashes\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eA Little Help From Your Friends\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough going it alone is a more than viable strategy, one of the most valuable assets a survivor has is their friends. If you need support in your struggle for survival, recruit up to two friends and head out together. Although outside assistance may prove invaluable, be forewarned: the game’s difficulty does scale based on party size. Survivors looking to team up can host a public game, invite their friends, or let the game matchmake you with other players. Remember, all loot drops in Remnant are instanced, so whatever is picked up by one player will be gained by the whole team. Except for ammo. Hoard that for yourself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48489671527_159c0cbfaa_o.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48489671527_f5b82eba0b_h.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Remnant: From the Ashes\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eProgress Makes Perfect\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Remnant: From the Ashes true growth comes mostly in the form of gear.

Epic Boss Weapons and supernatural Weapon Mods can also be crafted from materials you pick up along the way.

\u003cem\u003eWoW\u003c/em\u003e today.  Not that \u003cem\u003eWoW\u003c/em\u003e is ever above beating peons, but today the quest tracker would pop up on your screen and have a special item icon somewhere for you to click on in order to beat a peon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn \u003cem\u003eWoW Classic\u003c/em\u003e though, the club is just dropped into your bad\u0026#8230; I hope you had space\u0026#8230; and you have to know to target a peon, open your bag, and click on the club in order to administer the beating.  At least the club goes away when you turn in the quest.  Having leftovers from quests is part of the vanilla inventory management tradition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ran around the orc starter area.  It was crowded, but not as bad as the nigh elf starter area was the last time around.  Still, there was competition for mobs and the pain of quests that require drops vs simple kills was brought into focus.  I also explored a bit, just to look at a place I

visitors center to refresh myself on the idea of creating a guild.  The first thing I saw was that it costs 10 silver to create one.  That is a price trivial beyond belief in the current game, but I was standing there with a single silver in my pocket having felt lucky enough to have managed to pay for my skills.  I certainly didn\u0026#8217;t waste that coin on any of the trade skills.  Money is going to be tight for a while, though I suspect that the auction house will be hilarious until people settle down into the reality of how little cash people have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, of course, there are the signatures you need to form a guild.  I have already enlisted my daughter and her boyfriend to come sign for us, but we\u0026#8217;ll need some

(NB: The trailer is not entirely safe for workplace viewing.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoore claimed he got the idea for the Dolemite character while working in a Hollywood record store, where one of the locals used to tell obscene tall tales about a man named Dolemite. Moore adapted the persona into his act and released three albums of his frequently raunchy material accompanied by jazz and R\u0026amp;B musicians. Because of his delivery style (which typically involved rhyming lyrics), Moore is often called the \"Godfather of Rap.\" (Snoop Dogg, who has a cameo in the biopic, \u003ca href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/zap-rudyraymooreobit-story.html\"\u003ehas said\u003c/a\u003e, \"Without Rudy Ray Moore, there would be no Snoop Dogg, and that's for real.\")\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoore slowly built up a cult following, despite the fact that his albums (including the cover art) were much too vulgar to be publicly displayed in record stores. With the rise of \"blaxploitation\" films in the early 1970s, Moore saw an opportunity to bring the character Dolemite to the moviegoing masses. He financed his first film himself with royalties from his record sales. The result was the instant blaxploitation classic \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolemite\"\u003eDolemite\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e, released in 1975, about \"the ultimate ghetto hero\" in the tradition of \u003cem\u003eShaft\u003c/em\u003e. Dolemite knew kung-fu, was a sharp dresser, was known for his sexual prowess, and was committed to ridding his neighborhood of criminal influences. The film's success spawned several sequels, although Moore's material never really made it to the mainstream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1550019#p3\"\u003eRead 4 remaining paragraphs\u003c/a\u003e | \u003ca href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1550019\u0026comments=1\"\u003eComments\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"feedflare\"\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?a=M_rRFoTjgVE:5L0DNqQQ-cc:V_sGLiPBpWU\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?i=M_rRFoTjgVE:5L0DNqQQ-cc:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?a=M_rRFoTjgVE:5L0DNqQQ-cc:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?i=M_rRFoTjgVE:5L0DNqQQ-cc:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?a=M_rRFoTjgVE:5L0DNqQQ-cc:qj6IDK7rITs\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?a=M_rRFoTjgVE:5L0DNqQQ-cc:yIl2AUoC8zA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","url":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1550019","published":"2019-08-12T20:03:13Z","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1550019"}]},{"url":"https://www.indiegames.com/atom.xml","items":[{"title":"‘Simulacrum’ Pays a Gloomy Tribute to ‘Silent Hill’","content":"\u003cp\u003eAbigail finds herself trapped in an oppressive, unsettling world of concrete and rust as she struggles to uncover her past in \u003ca href=\"https://gamejolt.com/games/simulacrum_chapter_one/233384\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eSimulacrum \u0026#8211; Chapter One\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan id=\"more-26220\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbigail has found herself lost in a strange world of twisted puzzles and disturbing presences, and it\u0026#8217;s up to you to help her make her way through the cloying darkness and find her way back.

\u003cem\u003eWoW\u003c/em\u003e today.  Not that \u003cem\u003eWoW\u003c/em\u003e is ever above beating peons, but today the quest tracker would pop up on your screen and have a special item icon somewhere for you to click on in order to beat a peon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn \u003cem\u003eWoW Classic\u003c/em\u003e though, the club is just dropped into your bad\u0026#8230; I hope you had space\u0026#8230; and you have to know to target a peon, open your bag, and click on the club in order to administer the beating.  At least the club goes away when you turn in the quest.  Having leftovers from quests is part of the vanilla inventory management tradition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ran around the orc starter area.  It was crowded, but not as bad as the nigh elf starter area was the last time around.  Still, there was competition for mobs and the pain of quests that require drops vs simple kills was brought into focus.  I also explored a bit, just to look at a place I hadn\u0026#8217;t visited in many years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_72239\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\u003e\u003ca

New Clue to How Life Originated","content":"\u003cp\u003eWhen Caitlin Cornell looked down her microscope, she saw large bright spots against a black background. They resembled miniatures suns, blazing against the backdrop of space. And when Cornell showed the spots to her supervisor, \u003ca href=\"https://depts.washington.edu/chem/people/faculty/keller.html\"\u003eSarah Keller\u003c/a\u003e, a chemist at the University of Washington, “we got really excited,” she recalls. “It was a bit of an ‘Aha!’ moment.” Those spots, \u003ca href=\"http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1900275116\"\u003eshe realized\u003c/a\u003e, might help address a long-standing puzzle about the origin of life itself.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe cells that make up all living things, despite their endless variations, contain three fundamental elements. There are molecules that encode information and can be copied—\u003ca href=\"http://exploringorigins.org/nucleicacids.html\"\u003eDNA and its simpler relative, RNA\u003c/a\u003e. There are proteins—workhorse molecules that perform important tasks. And encapsulating them all, there’s a membrane made from\u003ca href=\"http://exploringorigins.org/fattyacids.html\"\u003e fatty acids\u003c/a\u003e. Go back far enough in time, before animals and plants and even bacteria existed, and you’d find that the precursor of all life—what scientists call a “\u003ca href=\"http://exploringorigins.org/protocells.html\"\u003eprotocell\u003c/a\u003e”—likely had this same trinity of parts: RNA and proteins, in a membrane. As the physicist Freeman Dyson once said, “Life began with little bags of garbage.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe bags—the membranes—were crucial. Without something to corral the other molecules, they would all just float away, diffusing into the world and achieving nothing. By concentrating them, membranes transformed an inanimate world of disordered chemicals into one teeming with redwoods and redstarts, elephants and \u003cem\u003eE. coli\u003c/em\u003e, humans and hagfish. Life, at its core, is about creating compartments. And that’s much easier \u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e much harder than it might seem.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/01/our-origins-in-asgard/512645/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: A break in the search for the origin of complex life\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirst, the easy bit. Early cell membranes were built from fatty acids—molecules that look like lollipops, with round heads and long tails. The heads enjoy the company of water; the tails despise it. So, when placed in water, fatty acids self-assemble into hollow spheres, with the water-hating tails pointing inward and the water-loving heads on the surface. These spheres can enclose RNA and proteins, making protocells. Fatty acids, then, can \u003cem\u003eautomatically\u003c/em\u003e create the compartments that were necessary for life to emerge. It almost seems too good to be true.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd it is, for two reasons. Life first arose in salty oceans, and salt catastrophically destabilizes the fatty-acid spheres. Also, certain ions, including magnesium and iron, cause the spheres to collapse, which is problematic since RNA—another key component of early protocells—requires these ions. How, then, could life possibly have arisen, when the compartments it needs are destroyed by the conditions in which it first emerged, and by the very ingredients it needs to thrive?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCaitlin Cornell and Sarah Keller \u003ca href=\"http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1900275116\"\u003ehave an answer to this paradox\u003c/a\u003e. They’ve shown that the spheres can withstand both salt and magnesium ions, as long as they’re in the presence of amino acids—the simple molecules that are the building blocks of proteins. The little suns that Cornell saw under her microscope were mixtures of amino acids and fatty acids, holding their spherical shape in the presence of salt.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI find that utterly magical. It means that two of the essential components of life, a protocell’s membrane and its proteins,\u003cem\u003e provided the conditions for each other to exist. \u003c/em\u003eBy sticking to the fatty acids, the amino acids gave them stability. In turn, the fatty acids concentrated the amino acids, perhaps encouraging them to coalesce into proteins. From the very beginning, these partners were locked in a two-step dance that continued for 3.5 billion years, and helped create all the richness of biology from a starting place of mere chemistry. “I agree completely,” Keller tells me. “It’s completely magical. You need those two parts together.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“It’s fantastic work,” says \u003ca href=\"https://www-chem.ucsd.edu/faculty/profiles/devaraj_neal_k.html\"\u003eNeal Devaraj\u003c/a\u003e, of UC San Diego. “Their suggestion that membranes could promote the synthesis of [proteins] is really fascinating.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis discovery happened almost by accident. Originally, Keller set out to address a different problem, posed to her by her colleague Roy Black. He noted that no one had good ideas about how exactly the protocell trinity—RNA, proteins, and membranes—actually assembled in the first place. It seemed that people were just waving their hands and attributing this crucial convergence to some random event. Black, instead, suggested that the membranes themselves were key. If fatty acids can stick to the constituents of both proteins and RNA, they could have gathered these building blocks together as they themselves assembled.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCornell tested that idea by incubating \u003ca href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Decanoic-acid\"\u003ea fatty acid\u003c/a\u003e with three different amino acids, all of which are thought to have existed on the primordial Earth. Sure enough, as Black had suspected, the molecules interacted with one another. But when she looked under the microscope, Cornell realized something special was happening.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn their own, the fatty acids predictably self-assembled into hollow spheres. “They looked like jellyfish: clear insides with opaque edges, floating around,” she says. If she added salt or magnesium ions, these jellyfish disintegrated. But if she did that after adding amino acids, they held their shape. What’s more, they transformed into shapes that Cornell likens to glowing onions. Their once-hollow centers were filled with another layer of fatty acids—spheres within spheres. Not coincidentally, that’s what our actual cells are like, with membranes that comprise two fatty layers instead of one.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo, the presence of amino acids not only protects the fatty-acid spheres, but also turns them into something more obviously biological. Why? “We have no idea, and we wouldn’t have predicted it,” Keller says, laughing. “We’re in a lovely place that opens the field up to future theory.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/03/simulating-the-origins-of-life/474441/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: Simulating the origins of life\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“This is great work,” says \u003ca href=\"https://cbs.umn.edu/contacts/kate-adamala\"\u003eKate Adamala\u003c/a\u003e of the University of Minnesota. Other studies, she notes, have found interactions between any two of amino acids, fatty-acid membranes, and RNA, but Cornell and Keller’s study effectively ties all three together. Amino acids allow membranes to exist in the presence of magnesium, which RNA needs to function.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe study of life’s origins is always contentious. Scientists often disagree furiously about things that are happening right now, let alone events that occurred more than 3.5 \u003cem\u003ebillion years ago. \u003c/em\u003eSome researchers, for example, think that life began in\u003ca href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/02/08/1117774109\"\u003e shallow volcanic pools\u003c/a\u003e, while others argue that it must have arisen in\u003ca href=\"https://www.livescience.com/26173-hydrothermal-vent-life-origins.html\"\u003e underwater vents\u003c/a\u003e.

Trump has shown in the past that he has little patience for aides who tell him hard truths he doesn’t want to hear.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFollowing the August 3 shooting in El Paso, the president briefly acknowledged the alleged shooter’s motivation. “The shooter in El Paso posted a manifesto online consumed by racist hate,” \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/08/five-things-trump-blaming-el-paso/595492/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eTrump said at the White House\u003c/a\u003e. “In one voice, our nation must condemn racism, bigotry, and white supremacy. These sinister ideologies must be defeated.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYet within days, the president had moved on to fuming about coverage of his trip to El Paso, spreading conspiracy theories about the death of Jeffrey Epstein, and picking fights with the comedian Bill Maher. He has also gestured toward the possibility of expanding background checks for gun ownership, but dropped talk about white supremacy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/06/trump-racism-comments/588067/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eDespite a long record of racist remarks and actions\u003c/a\u003e, Trump is infuriated by any suggestion that he might be a racist. He seems to believe that acknowledging a serious problem of white racist violence during his presidency would reflect poorly on his leadership, just as acknowledging Russian interference in the 2016 election would call the legitimacy of his victory into question. In both cases, he is correct. But ignoring the problems will not make either go away, so the president’s thin skin is preventing him from dealing with a genuine threat to the nation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe federal government’s inadequate response to white racist violence predates Trump. Early in the Obama administration, a Department of Homeland Security report warned about a rise in the phenomenon. But Barack Obama’s team bowed to pressure from conservatives who accused the government of political correctness. Trump was among the right-wing figures who complained that the Obama administration wouldn’t name “radical Islamic terror” as a threat. DHS withdrew the report.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnder the Trump administration, the government has remained flat-footed, now because of Trump’s antipathy to the topic of domestic terrorism and white supremacy. In effect, he is guilty of a mirror image of the accusation he made against Obama. Trump said Obama wouldn’t name “radical Islamic terror” out of fears of political correctness, but his own sensitivities mean his administration has looked away from the threat of domestic terror out of its own sense of what is politically correct.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/06/trump-racism-comments/588067/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: An oral history of Trump’s bigotry\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhite racists were \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/08/who-does-trumps-white-identity-politics-reach/595189/?utm_source=feed\"\u003ean important part of Trump’s winning coalition\u003c/a\u003e in 2016, although by no means all of it, and Trump has signaled that \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/07/racism-campaign-strategy/593962/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eexacerbating racial tensions\u003c/a\u003e will be a central part of his 2020 reelection campaign, too. The president has downplayed the threat posed by white nationalists and white supremacists. After a violent white-supremacist march in Charlottesville, the president focused on what he insisted were “good people on both sides.” After a white-supremacist shooter killed 51 people in New Zealand, Trump said he was not worried about the threat posed by the ideology, saying, “I think it’s a small group of people that have very, very serious problems.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe FBI disagreed. \u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/wray-says-fbi-has-recorded-about-100-domestic-terrorism-arrests-in-fiscal-2019-and-most-investigations-involve-white-supremacy/2019/07/23/600d49a6-aca1-11e9-bc5c-e73b603e7f38_story.html\"\u003eIn testimony in July\u003c/a\u003e, Director Chris Wray, a Trump appointee, said that his agents had made nearly as many domestic-terrorism arrests as global-terrorism arrests over the previous nine months, with most of them related to white supremacy. That number may obscure more than it tells, too: Since the federal government has been more focused on global terrorism, it stands to reason it would have made more arrests in that area as well.

Could that prove a turning point for Trump on domestic terror? Sure—but it probably won’t be. That’s just not Trump’s style. The president has refused to even acknowledge the fact of Russian interference, let alone respond to it, despite unanimity among his aides—a refusal that would be slapstick were it not so dire.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhite racist violence is a real political liability for Trump.

The three 11-year-old heroes of Gene Stupnitsky’s new comedy are somewhat foul-mouthed, occasionally girl-crazy, and drawn into plenty of wild antics over the course of the movie—but every joke is about how bad these kids are at being bad. The film’s R rating is prominently displayed in promo materials, which also tout the movie’s association with raunchy comedies like \u003cem\u003eSuperbad\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eNeighbors\u003c/em\u003e, and \u003cem\u003eSausage Party\u003c/em\u003e. \u003cem\u003eGood Boys \u003c/em\u003eindeed has its share of dirty jokes, but the best gag of all is that its protagonists don’t understand any of them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe film follows three rising sixth graders who have to stay out of trouble for a day so they can attend a “kissing party” that will feature one of their crushes. There are several other subplots involving parents and older students that the trio bumble through, and while viewers will be able to appreciate the nuances of these story lines, the movie itself stays rooted in the kids’ innocent perspective. It’s a tough balance to strike, and the film largely manages it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eGood Boys \u003c/em\u003eis half-rooted in the frank, sometimes gross, sometimes biting comedy of the Judd Apatow era. But it’s also reminiscent of ’80s adventure fare like \u003cem\u003eThe Goonies \u003c/em\u003eor \u003cem\u003eStand by Me\u003c/em\u003e, tales filtered through the eyes of middle schoolers growing up and learning to deal with the real world. The biggest challenge for older viewers (who, thanks to the MPAA rating, will be the majority of the audience) is whether they want to put up with a movie centered on relatively clueless youngsters. Fortunately, there’s enough insight and silliness to make it worthwhile.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe lead troublemaker, Max, is played by Jacob Tremblay—another in a long line of preternaturally talented preteen actors (think Dakota Fanning and Haley Joel Osment) with astounding poise in front of the camera. Until now, Tremblay has mostly appeared in serious dramas like \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/10/room-a-whole-world-in-four-walls/412267/?utm_source=feed\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eRoom\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/06/the-book-of-henry-is-a-warped-nightmare-of-a-movie/530472/?utm_source=feed\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Book of Henry\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, and the treacly but effective \u003cem\u003eWonder\u003c/em\u003e, but his comic timing is on point as he plays Max as a wannabe know-it-all. Desperate to hang out with his crush, Brixlee (Millie Davis), at the cool kids’ party, Max enlists his best buds, Lucas (Keith L. Williams) and Thor (Brady Noon), to help him learn how to kiss, setting off a ridiculous chain of events that sees them ditching school and running around the suburbs for the day.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe stakes are extremely low in \u003cem\u003eGood Boys\u003c/em\u003e, as they should be, given that the protagonists (who call themselves “the Beanbag Boys”) can’t even ride public transportation alone yet. But for Max, Lucas, and Thor, every situation feels urgent and potentially catastrophic. Early on, they steal a bottle of illicit pills from the high-school seniors Hannah (Molly Gordon) and Lily (Midori Francis), who are bent on reclaiming it before they go to a concert. As the girls chase them around the city, the boys assume they must be in the throes of a serious drug addiction, not just trying to have a good time on a Friday night.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAgain and again, the trio\u003cem\u003e \u003c/em\u003econfront a menace they don’t entirely comprehend (one anarchic set piece unfolds in a frat house), navigate through it using childish logic, and emerge from the experience basically none the wiser. Stupnitsky, who co-wrote the film with his collaborator Lee Eisenberg (they worked together on \u003cem\u003eThe Office\u003c/em\u003e and other TV shows), never lets reality come crashing down on the kids; even the heavier things they’re worried about (like Lucas’s parents, who are getting a divorce) tend to stay on the periphery.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut \u003cem\u003eGood Boys \u003c/em\u003edoes allow for some moments of education, which helped the movie click for me. The first two acts are standard madcap fare, though Hannah and Lily eventually point out something that Max and his pals haven’t yet considered—that elementary-school friends rarely stay together forever, and the bond of the “Beanbag Boys” may not be eternal. The movie doesn’t turn fully melancholy, but its ending is sweetly self-aware, highlighting the differences among its winsome protagonists and noting that the loss of one’s innocence has less to do with rude jokes and more to do with the ways people evolve as they mature. Had the film not taken an introspective turn, I still would have appreciated its skill with generating easy laughs.

None of this would have happened were it not for Texas’s policy on easy transition between community college and state college/university educational institutions once you are in the system and meeting academic standards. And, I would add, automatic acceptance of the top 10% of high school graduating classes.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eI have no idea how commonplace this arrangement is across the country, but I have to applaud Texas for this educational feature.

I hope other states do the same.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eI agree with the reader that “portability” of credits through different levels of a public higher-ed system is an important opportunity-enhancing feature. Here’s a detailed example of how one state, California, has tried to ease the process: It has a site called \u003ca href=\"https://www.assist.org/\"\u003eassist.org\u003c/a\u003e, which lets students see which credits are transferable from one California public higher-ed institution to another, under which set of rules.

It would then list which credits for which specific courses could be transferred.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe reader in Texas adds:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eFailure at a 4 year university is indelible in GPA/class rank.

She endlessly mailed out short stories to magazines, and had some published. She wrote greeting-card verses on a piece-rate basis for all the major card makers.

The Communist Party and its local loyalists manage to routinely inflame opposition in the former British colony with what many Hong Kong residents see as persistent attempts to breach the “one country, two systems” formula that ensures their freedoms.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2019/07/china-bonds-between-hong-kong-and-taiwan-are-growing/593347/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: Hong Kong and Taiwan are bonding over China\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe latest move was a ham-handed attempt by Hong Kong authorities to push through an extradition law many feared Beijing could exploit to crush dissent.

Donald Trump bears the brunt of the blame for starting the trade war by imposing tariffs on Chinese imports. But a strong case can be made that the president is merely reacting to Beijing’s unwillingness to address long-standing American complaints about its unfair trade policies, from closing markets to U.S. companies to subsidizing favored Chinese champions. Yet throughout the negotiations between the two powers—which have dragged on for well over a year—China’s leaders have avoided taking responsibility for their role in the dispute, instead characterizing China as a victim of a Washington gone rogue. This month, \u003ca href=\"http://en.people.cn/n3/2019/0808/c90000-9604294.html\"\u003ea commentary\u003c/a\u003e in the \u003cem\u003ePeople’s Daily\u003c/em\u003e, the Communist Party’s mouthpiece, blasted that “some U.S. officials are maxing out their credibility in the international society and undermining the rule-based international order,” adding that “these Americans need to wake up.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2019/06/trumps-trade-war-with-china-is-changing-the-world/592411/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: Trump’s trade war with China is already changing the world\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eAll governments, of course, have a habit of insisting they are in the right. But China finds altering course especially difficult, mainly because of how its domestic political system functions. As an authoritarian regime—and one that is more and more centered on a personal cult surrounding Xi Jinping—admitting fault is perceived as a threat to credibility. Nor is it clear how much bad news filters up to top decision makers through a bureaucracy fearful that policy disagreements could be mistaken for disloyalty. Compounding matters is the historical narrative marketed domestically by Beijing, in which the party stars as the defender of the Chinese nation against foreign imperialists who have preyed upon the country for more than a century. “They haven’t been treated well; now they have a right to stand up and be a great power,” Glaser said of the thinking. “All of this leads the Chinese to believe that their interests are more important than others.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eSo instead of compromising, Beijing trots out a couple of standard tactics to try to get its way. First, it throws money at the problem. Since the beginning of trade negotiations with the United States, the Chinese have tried, in essence, to buy off the Trump administration with large purchases of American agricultural, energy, and other products. Then, Beijing mixes in coercion. In response to Trump, the Chinese have imposed its own punitive duties on U.S. goods, while threatening more action. None of this has worked. Earlier this month, Trump announced yet more tariffs on Chinese imports. When they come into effect on September 1, nearly everything China exports to the United States will have an extra tax slapped on it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eDitto in Hong Kong. The Communists have attempted to woo Hong Kongers through their wallets, with promises of even fatter riches created by closer ties to the mainland. Government planners in Beijing have included Hong Kong as a pillar of their \u003ca href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-18/china-unveils-plan-to-tie-hong-kong-macau-closer-to-mainland\"\u003egrandiose plan\u003c/a\u003e to integrate the region around the Pearl River Delta into a supercharged growth engine. A significant share of Hong Kong’s population isn’t willing to exchange its civil rights for new railway lines, though, so Beijing has cracked down harder on dissent. Protests have become more violent, with some locals accusing the police of unwarranted brutality. In late July, a mob \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/22/world/asia/hong-kong-protest-mob-attack-yuen-long.html\"\u003eviciously assaulted\u003c/a\u003e peaceful protesters. We don’t know for sure whether Beijing coordinated the efforts, but such methods of terrorizing dissenters are standard Communist weapons.

All great powers try to impose their will, of course, the United States included. However, Washington realized (at least until recently) that being a superpower entailed costs as well as benefits—whether upholding alliances, opening its markets, or supporting the dollar as a global reserve currency. The narrower, more self-centered outlook of China’s leaders is not winning hearts and minds among other nations as they might have hoped. Surveys conducted by the Pew Research Center show that global opinions of China have soured.

Pilots have one for landing airplanes that advises descending 1,000 feet every three miles to ensure that the plane doesn’t drop too quickly for passengers to adjust to changing cabin pressure. Outdoors-people use one as a guide for how long people can usually stay alive in extreme conditions: three minutes without oxygen, three hours without shelter, three days without water, and three weeks without food. More broadly, groupings of three pop up everywhere: the Holy Trinity, the three branches of the U.S. government, the number of data points required to determine an unknown location, the number of partners needed to corner people at a party to talk about polyamory.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eRelatively little is known about why people enjoy and invoke triads so frequently. But after more than a decade of personal research, I’d like to present a new rule of three for your consideration: If you work at a desk in an office, three desk beverages is the ideal number to keep by your side. The first is water. The second is a source of caffeine. The third is something fun—a juice, a soda, a glass of wine on Friday afternoon (if your office is like that), a kombucha (if you are like that).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe case for having any beverages at your desk in the first place is one of basic human biology. Your mom was right when she told you to drink some water: Mild dehydration isn’t a notable health risk, but the \u003ca href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3257694/\"\u003espotty research\u003c/a\u003e done on the topic suggests that being thirsty is distracting.

Water is the foundation of your beverage kingdom.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd then there’s caffeine. Research has shown that it \u003ca href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Timothy_Roehrs/publication/20858709_Effects_of_Caffeine_on_Alertness/links/5728ce9308aef7c7e2c0c78e/Effects-of-Caffeine-on-Alertness.pdf\"\u003eimproves alertness\u003c/a\u003e in moderately sleepy people—for instance, those who underestimated the size of their sandwich and are now slowly slipping into a food coma at their desk.

Add it to the lineup.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eCompleting the desk-bev triumvirate is where the magic happens. A third beverage is your wild card, a chance for a little bit of random pleasure in a period of the day that is otherwise not your own. One of the reasons people \u003ca href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2019/05/why-do-we-turn-into-snack-maniacs-at-work.html\"\u003ego so wild for random snacks\u003c/a\u003e in the workplace is that popcorn or cookies allow a moment of disengagement from work that feels autonomous. Since water and coffee are the only drinks many workplaces provide, tracking down a third can be an excuse to leave the office for a moment, even if it’s just to run to the nearby corner store. Small, regular pleasures have \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2019/07/coffee-financial-advice/594244/?utm_source=feed\"\u003ereal psychological value\u003c/a\u003e in any part of life. During the workday, acquiring a mango seltzer or green juice can return some humanity to the cubicle farm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIt probably isn’t a coincidence that three is my personal sweet spot, according to Kurt Carlson, a marketing researcher at the College of William \u0026amp; Mary’s Raymond A. Mason School of Business. As far as I can tell, he’s the only person who has done significant research into why and how human brains sort things into groupings of three. “People believe they’re observing something special when they see the third instance of it happen,” he explains. “After making three shots in a row, the person’s hot, and four doesn’t make them more hot. If you miss three traffic lights in a row, the world’s out to get you.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCarlson references shots because he began his research by looking at data from the Philadelphia 76ers basketball team. He found that when players make or miss three shots in a row, both they and their competitors believe that they are on a streak, which actually changes the probability of a player making or missing the next shot. If a guy is hot, he is “going to take shots that he shouldn’t take, the defense is going to double-team him, his teammates are going to force him the ball in places they shouldn’t have forced him the ball,” Carlson explains. Counterintuitively, that makes a player with “hot hands” less likely to make a fourth shot than under baseline circumstances. The inverse also happens for players who miss three: Everyone takes that as a sign that a player is no longer a threat, and the player’s chances of sinking a shot end up improving.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWhen it comes time to make decisions or process new information, people often default to problem-solving \u003ca href=\"https://www.latimes.com/health/la-xpm-2010-nov-02-la-he-wray-herbert-psychology-20101102-story.html\"\u003eshortcuts called heuristics\u003c/a\u003e, many of which are so ingrained in human thinking that it might feel like you were born with them. Carlson believes that groupings of three spring out of our brains’ efforts to be simultaneously organized and complete. “The least cognitively challenging way to categorize things is to put them into two buckets, and the hardest way is to treat everything as an individual,” he says. The middle-ground approach to distinguishing between concepts without driving ourselves mad with nuance is to put things into three categories. In that sense, at least, the theory of hydration, caffeine, and pleasure is time-tested and psychologically approved.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eUnfortunately, academia stands in the way of testing my desk-bev theory any further. “That is as far as I got,” Carlson says. “I moved on.

If I ever bring up a “serious” topic, he won’t just resist talking about it, but have something bordering on a panic attack before shutting down completely. He’ll then need to detox for hours by being alone before he’s good to talk about anything again, even minor things like what’s for dinner.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBy “serious” things I mean long-term financial planning, whether he wants kids, his plans related to school and career, what would happen if one of us dies. (We aren’t married.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eI’ve tried broaching these topics in a variety of ways. Casually. Sternly. Trying to approach it like a negotiation. I’ve never actually given him an ultimatum, but I have told him that if he doesn’t try to do something about his inability to talk about these bigger things, I’m going to be reduced to issuing an ultimatum eventually. No matter what I do, it always ends the same way.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eI am the primary breadwinner and we have enough money to pay the bills. I don’t really want kids, so for the most part, we can get along fine without these topics being broached on a day-to-day basis. I mostly just try to avoid them, but inevitably something comes up that forces the point, or I can’t stand it anymore and I need to talk to him.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eI feel like he has some issues with anxiety and needs to talk to a professional. How can I convince him that he (or we) needs to see somebody about this without that conversation itself producing a meltdown?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLesley\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eDallas, Texas\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDear Lesley,\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eI can see why you’re concerned about this pattern between you and your partner. Communication and negotiation are vital to any healthy relationship, so even more important than the specific “serious” topics you hope to talk about is the issue of why you’re both struggling to have these discussions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWhat your partner is doing is called stonewalling. It’s a way of checking out of the conversation. A person might avoid a topic by being silent, changing the subject, ignoring his partner by scrolling through his phone instead of listening, or simply leaving the room. Essentially, stonewalling shuts down a conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eBut even though the problem seems to lie with the person who stonewalls, the other partner plays a role, too. After all, a conversation ends only if you let it end. It’s not just how he responds to you bringing up these conversations. It’s also about how you respond to his refusal to have them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eHere’s an example commonly seen in couples therapy: A husband brings up a topic his wife doesn’t want to discuss, and she begins to cry. He, in turn, feels bad for making her cry, immediately backs off from the topic, and turns his attention instead to her tears. Now they’ve both backed away from the original topic—he, to avoid causing her more distress; she, to avoid something she doesn’t want to discuss. It’s a manipulation, but one that both partners participate in.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eYou’re doing something similar with your partner. He gets anxious and leaves the room, and to avoid causing him more distress, you let the conversation drop. You’re both afraid of something—he, of the topic; you, of upsetting him. So you collude in his avoidance by not bringing it up even after he’s recovered.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eHe may avoid these topics for a number of reasons. It may be that he’s afraid he’ll disappoint you by not being able to fulfill whatever expectations you have around money, kids, or jobs, and disappointing his partner feels intolerable to him. It could be that he’s had the experience of being steamrolled during these kinds of conversations—interrupted, argued with when he gives an answer his partner doesn’t like—and the thought of being unable to make his point leaves him feeling anxious and out of control. It might be that he finds himself overwhelmed by the number of topics presented to him at once, or that he thinks the discussion of one topic will inevitably lead to another. (It’s often easier to hear “Can we talk about money?” than “Can we talk about money, which also relates to kids, your school plans, and what happens if we die?”) It could be that these conversations have gone badly in the past—maybe with you, maybe with someone else—and he figures, I don’t want that to happen again. It might be that he believes having these conversations will require him to be accountable and make changes he’s not interested in making (getting a better job, finishing school). He may suspect that discussing these topics will lead to a discussion about marriage, and he doesn’t want to go there.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eYou both likely come from families in which resolving marital conflict wasn’t modeled well, and so your parents either “never fought” or fought in a way that felt frightening or destructive. In some families, too, when people say “We need to talk,” they really mean “You need to listen while I complain about you.” People who grow up in families like these tend to want to keep the peace in their relationships, but what they get instead is distance, loneliness, and resentment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eSo how can you approach your partner about going to see a therapist together to unravel this pattern between you? You’ll need to respond differently to his retreat in the face of difficult topics by setting a boundary. Note that there’s a difference between a boundary and an ultimatum. A boundary is about setting a limit for yourself. An ultimatum is about controlling someone else by insisting that they change.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eYou’ve already issued an ultimatum by telling him that if he doesn’t change, you’re going to give him an ultimatum. But that hasn’t helped because (a) ultimatums rarely work and (b) you’ve never followed through. Instead, a boundary is both kind and firm (meaning delivered with love and confidence rather than anger and wishy-washiness), and clearly states the limit you’re setting for yourself.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIn this case, it might go something like, “I love you so much, and it’s upsetting to see you get so anxious when I bring up certain topics. But I also want us to have an intimate and long-lasting relationship, and a relationship in which we can’t talk about basic life issues, or even more difficult things, won’t be fulfilling for either of us. It won’t allow us to be close to each other or feel truly safe with each other if so much is floating unsaid in the air between us. I can’t be responsible for your anxiety—I don’t create it, and I’m not here to fix it. That’s up to you. But no matter what you do about that, I need us to get help with our communication in order for me to feel confident that we can be a happy couple, which is what I very much want for us.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIf he shuts down this conversation before you’re able to finish, you can keep your boundary in one of two ways. First, you can set up an appointment with a couples therapist and email him the time and place, and write concisely in that same email what you attempted to explain when he panicked. (He may find absorbing something he can read at his own pace easier than something you say to him in real time in a room together.) In couples therapy, you both will experience a way of having these conversations that feels connecting rather than acrimonious, which in turn will make him less anxious about having them going forward.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eAnd if he says he won’t go to the appointment, or refuses to acknowledge your email, you can make an appointment for your own therapy, which will not only preserve your boundary of getting help with the communication problem (at least your role in it), but also help you learn how to set and maintain boundaries in your relationships, a lesson that sounds long overdue.\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eDear Therapist is for informational purposes only, does not constitute medical advice, and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

An occupation that has defined the African American experience has nearly ceased to exist, as 98 percent of black agricultural landowners have lost their land since the 1950s, often under circumstances that amount to theft. Through a variety of means—sometimes legal, often coercive, in many cases legal and coercive—farmland owned by black people came into the hands of white people, who eventually sold to agribusiness, who eventually sold to Wall Street. Economists estimate that this robbery has resulted in the loss of hundreds of billions of dollars, perhaps even trillions of dollars, of black wealth. For the September issue of The Atlantic, staff writer \u003cstrong\u003eVann R. Newkirk II\u003c/strong\u003e investigates the shameful, as-yet-untold story—and its devastating, lasting consequences.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe cover story, “\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/09/this-land-was-our-land/594742/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eThis Land Was Our Land\u003c/a\u003e,” is available now at The Atlantic, and will be available on newsstands next week.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eLike Ta-Nehisi Coates’s “The Case for Reparations” in The Atlantic five years ago, Newkirk itemizes the racist policies and illegal pressures that resulted in black people owning almost nothing of the bounty beneath their feet. His deeply reported piece traces how much of the rich and productive Mississippi Delta soil came to be owned by one of the largest pension firms in the United States, the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association (TIAA), and examines how black people living and working in the region have been completely uprooted. “For a people who were once considered chattel themselves, real property has carried an almost mystical importance. There’s a reason the fabled promise that spread among freedmen after the Civil War was not a check, a job, or a refundable tax credit, but 40 acres of farmland to call home,” Newkirk writes. “The history of the Delta suggests that any conversation about reparations might need to be more qualitative and intangible than it is. And it must consider the land.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIn more than a year of reporting, Newkirk found that much of the loss of black-owned farmland since the 1950s came through legal mechanisms—the tax sale, the partition sale, and the foreclosure. And yet, illegal pressures played a significant role, including discrimination in federal and state programs, swindles by lawyers and spectulators, unlawful denials of private loans, and even outright acts of violence or intimidation. “Mass dispossession did not require a central organizing force or a grand conspiracy,” Newkirk writes. “Thousands of individual decisions by white people, enabled or motivated by greed, racism, existing laws, and market forces, all pushed in one direction.”  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eAs a result, much of the land that was once made up of small black-owned farms came to be owned by white farmers, who aggregated it into larger farms, and eventually sold it to corporations and funds, including TIAA. In just a few years, a single company has managed to accumulate a portfolio in the Delta almost equal to the remaining holdings of all the African Americans who have lived on and shaped the land for centuries. In Washington County, Mississippi, where in February TIAA reportedly bought 50,000 acres for more than $200 million, black people make up 72 percent of the population but own just 11 percent of the farmland. In Tunica County, where TIAA has acquired former plantations, black people are 77 percent of the population but own just 6 percent of farmland. Newkirk writes that the company’s newfound dominance in the region is “merely the topsoil covering a history of loss and legally sanctioned theft in which TIAA played no part,” but notes that “TIAA’s position is instrumental in understanding both how the crimes of Jim Crow have been laundered by time and how the legacy of ill-gotten gains have become a structural part of American life.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eRead “\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/09/this-land-was-our-land/594742/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eThis Land Was Our Land\u003c/a\u003e” at The Atlantic.

A clear majority favor providing tax credits for low-income workers, requiring companies to provide their employees with paid parental leave, raising the minimum wage, and increasing taxes on the rich. A plurality favor breaking up big banks and making it easier for workers to unionize.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eAccording to recent polls, most Americans also believe that the government has a moral duty to provide all citizens with health care. A full 70 percent approve of a public option, which would allow all Americans to buy into Medicare. This would give universal or near-universal health coverage to Americans, and amount to a massive wealth transfer from rich to poor.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThese findings have emboldened progressives in the party to claim that they won’t have to pay an electoral price for embracing policies—or labels—that would have seemed unthinkable just 10 years ago.

Roosevelt.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMore mainstream figures within the party have, of late, adopted the same argument.

While Americans seem more open to progressive economic policy now than in the recent past, for example, they are not nearly as opposed to capitalism as some Democrats like to claim. The same Voter Study Group survey that found strong support for breaking up big banks also found that a plurality of Americans object to the idea of the government reducing differences in income and favor less regulation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eOther polls make clear that most Americans remain hostile to socialism. According to the most detailed study on the question, conducted by the \u003ca href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/06/25/stark-partisan-divisions-in-americans-views-of-socialism-capitalism/\"\u003ePew Research Center\u003c/a\u003e, 65 percent of Americans have a positive view of capitalism, while 42 percent have a positive view of socialism. Some 55 percent have either a very negative or somewhat negative view of socialism.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eSanders and Buttigieg are right in one respect: Like many of his Democratic predecessors, Barack Obama was able to win two presidential elections despite being tarred as a socialist at every turn. But it stands to reason that Obama was able to win in part because most voters dismissed Fox News’ attacks. It is unlikely that Sanders or Buttigieg could pull off the same feat if voters thought the attacks were accurate. (This is especially true in the case of Sanders, who actively embraces the socialist label.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eA similar caveat also applies to the fights about specific public policies that have taken up most of the Democratic debates. Political scientists such as Larry Bartels have long argued that most voters don’t pick their preferred candidates on the basis of their specific policy proposals; rather, they ask themselves which candidates seem to advocate for their interests, and then embrace whatever policies they favor. As a result, political elites play a large role in shaping the policy preferences of ordinary voters.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eBut public opinion is not infinitely malleable. Indeed, political scientists have also found that most voters are highly loss-averse and deeply sensitive to perceived threats to their material standing. So while they may have only vague opinions on issues that are abstract and feel distant from their daily lives, they are also likely to react strongly when they fear that they may lose a concrete benefit to which they have long been accustomed. This makes it all the more concerning that leading Democratic contenders, including Sanders, Senator Elizabeth Warren, and (at various instances) Senator Kamala Harris, have endorsed abolishing private health insurance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eAt the moment, about two thirds of Americans below the age of 65 have private health insurance. Out of these, \u003ca href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/245195/americans-rate-healthcare-quite-positively.aspx\"\u003e70\u003c/a\u003e percent say they are satisfied with what their insurance covers, and 85 percent are satisfied with the quality of care they receive. So it is hardly surprising that \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/Yascha_Mounk/status/1153374611951800320/photo/1\"\u003e54 percent of all Americans\u003c/a\u003e believe that Medicare for All is a bad idea if it would abolish private health insurance, with just 41 percent embracing this as a good idea. Given the raw emotions the subject of private insurance inspires—and the broad support for more moderate policies that would still provide Americans with universal coverage—it is astonishing how cavalierly some Democratic candidates have committed themselves to its abolition.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/07/does-tv-makes-you-dumber-and-more-populist/593287/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eYascha Mounk: The more you watch, the more you vote populist\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"dropcap\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003eMost Americans are strenuously opposed to socialism, and instinctively distrust candidates who make breathless promises of political revolution.

Immigrants fill many of these positions. According to Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, an estimated 20 percent of wealth work is done by people who are not citizens, compared with less than 10 percent of all U.S. labor. Foreign-born workers often move to large metros to find jobs before relocating to cheaper towns and suburbs to build a more permanent home.

First, full-time retail and service jobs at places like nail salons and spas. “You’re talking about people with $30,000 incomes that are often employed in high-wealth metro areas, or resort economies,” Muro said. Because they often cannot afford to live near their place of work, they endure long commutes from lower-cost neighborhoods. These arrangements aren’t merely time-consuming; they can also be exploitative. For example, New York City nail salons \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/01/nyregion/nail-salon-sweeps-in-new-york-reveal-abuses-and-regulatory-challenges.html\"\u003eare notorious\u003c/a\u003e for flouting minimum-wage laws and other labor regulations, and massage parlors across Florida have served as \u003ca href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/investigations/2019/07/29/sex-trafficking-illicit-massage-parlors-cases-fail/1206517001/\"\u003efronts for human trafficking\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eA second category is the “Uber for X” economy—that nebulous network of people contracted through online marketplaces for driving, delivery, and other on-demand services. Optimistically, these jobs offer autonomy for workers and convenience for consumers, many of whom aren’t wealthy. But the business models that keep these firms aloft rely on the strategic avoidance of laws like the Fair Labor Standards Act, which regulates minimum wage and overtime pay.

The nannies, house cleaners, and cooks of the past had little to no recourse, not even in name, to the protection of the law if their employers maltreated them. But their work was also less anonymous; the hired help tended to live with their employers, where they would cook, clean, and care for children. These workers were integrated into family life in a way that is unthinkable for the anonymous wealth workers of the modern world.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eRelationships between the classes, once mediated through the household, are now managed through an app that serves a large metro area. The workers of the new servant economy don’t live with their employers, but rather sleep many miles away where they can afford a bedroom. “You could argue there was a more benignly human quality to the old aristocratic relationships,” the economist Muro told me. “Today’s platforms strip down what was once a job into simple, seamless transactions.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eMany contractors surely relish the autonomy—and perhaps even the anonymity—of these apps, which give on-demand wealth workers flexibility to work whenever and wherever they wish, while protecting their privacy from clients (if not from the apps themselves), but the rush to make these transactions seamless can make both sides of this marketplace feel invisible.

A trio of steel silos here. A post there. A patch of scruffy wilderness in the distance. Each landmark was a reminder of the Scott legacy that she had fought to keep—or to regain—and she noted this with pride. Each one was also a reminder of an inheritance that had once been stolen.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDrive Route 61 through the Mississippi Delta and you’ll find much of the scenery exactly as it was 50 or 75 years ago. Imposing plantations and ramshackle shotgun houses still populate the countryside from Memphis to Vicksburg. Fields stretch to the horizon. The hands that dig into black Delta dirt belong to people like Willena Scott-White, African Americans who bear faces and names passed down from men and women who were owned here, who were kept here, and who chose to stay here, tending the same fields their forebears tended.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut some things have changed. Back in the day, snow-white bolls of King Cotton reigned. Now much of the land is green with soybeans. The farms and plantations are much larger—industrial operations with bioengineered plants, laser-guided tractors, and crop-dusting drones. Fewer and fewer farms are still owned by actual farmers. Investors in boardrooms throughout the country have bought hundreds of thousands of acres of premium Delta land. If you’re one of the millions of people who have a retirement account with the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association, for instance, you might even own a little bit yourself.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTIAA is one of the largest pension firms in the United States. Together with its subsidiaries and associated funds, it has a portfolio of more than 80,000 acres in Mississippi alone, most of them in the Delta. If the fertile crescent of Arkansas is included, TIAA holds more than 130,000 acres in a strip of counties along the Mississippi River. And TIAA is not the only big corporate landlord in the region. Hancock Agricultural Investment Group manages more than 65,000 acres in what it calls the “Delta states.” The real-estate trust Farmland Partners has 30,000 acres in and around the Delta. AgriVest, a subsidiary of the Swiss bank UBS, owned 22,000 acres as of 2011. (AgriVest did not respond to a request for more recent information.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnlike their counterparts even two or three generations ago, black people living and working in the Delta today have been almost completely uprooted from the soil—as property owners, if not as laborers. In Washington County, Mississippi, where last February TIAA reportedly bought 50,000 acres for more than $200 million, black people make up 72 percent of the population but own only 11 percent of the farmland, in part or in full. In Tunica County, where TIAA has acquired plantations from some of the oldest farm-owning white families in the state, black people make up 77 percent of the population but own only 6 percent of the farmland. In Holmes County, the third-blackest county in the nation, black people make up about 80 percent of the population but own only 19 percent of the farmland. TIAA owns plantations there, too. In just a few years, a single company has accumulated a portfolio in the Delta almost equal to the remaining holdings of the African Americans who have lived on and shaped this land for centuries.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is not a story about TIAA—at least not primarily. The company’s newfound dominance in the region is merely the topsoil covering a history of loss and legally sanctioned theft in which TIAA played no part. But TIAA’s position is instrumental in understanding both how the crimes of Jim Crow have been laundered by time and how the legacy of ill-gotten gains has become a structural part of American life. The land was wrested first from Native Americans, by force. It was then cleared, watered, and made productive for intensive agriculture by the labor of enslaved Africans, who after Emancipation would come to own a portion of it. Later, through a variety of means—sometimes legal, often coercive, in many cases legal \u003ci\u003eand\u003c/i\u003e coercive, occasionally violent—farmland owned by black people came into the hands of white people. It was aggregated into larger holdings, then aggregated again, eventually attracting the interest of Wall Street.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"full-width\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" height=\"767\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/07/WEL_NewKirk_Tractor/905180ac6.jpg\" width=\"960\"\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"caption\"\u003eWillena Scott-White’s son Joseph White cutting grass at the edge of a field on Scott-family land, Mound Bayou, Mississippi (Zora J.

But what happened to black landowners in the South, and particularly in the Delta, is distinct, and was propelled not only by economic change but also by white racism and local white power. A war waged by deed of title has dispossessed 98 percent of black agricultural landowners in America. They have lost 12 million acres over the past century. But even that statement falsely consigns the losses to long-ago history. In fact, the losses mostly occurred within living memory, from the 1950s onward. Today, except for a handful of farmers like the Scotts who have been able to keep or get back some land, black people in this most productive corner of the Deep South own almost nothing of the bounty under their feet.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eII. “Land Hunger”\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=\"smallcaps\"\u003eLand has always been \u003c/span\u003ethe main battleground of racial conflict in Mississippi. During Reconstruction, fierce resistance from the planters who had dominated antebellum society effectively killed any promise of land or protection from the Freedmen’s Bureau, forcing masses of black laborers back into de facto bondage. But the sheer size of the black population—black people were a majority in Mississippi until the 1930s—meant that thousands were able to secure tenuous footholds as landowners between Emancipation and the Great Depression.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDriven by what W. E. B. Du Bois called “land hunger” among freedmen during Reconstruction, two generations of black workers squirreled away money and went after every available and affordable plot they could, no matter how marginal or hopeless. Some found sympathetic white landowners who would sell to them. Some squatted on unused land or acquired the few homesteads available to black people. Some followed visionary leaders to all-black utopian agrarian experiments, such as Mound Bayou, in Bolivar County.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1901/03/the-freedmens-bureau/308772/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eFrom March 1901: W.

In 1900, according to the historian James C. Cobb, black landowners in Tunica County outnumbered white ones three to one. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, there were 25,000 black farm operators in 1910, an increase of almost 20 percent from 1900. Black farmland in Mississippi totaled 2.2 million acres in 1910—some 14 percent of all black-owned agricultural land in the country, and the most of any state.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe foothold was never secure. From the beginning, even the most enterprising black landowners found themselves fighting a war of attrition, often fraught with legal obstacles that made passing title to future generations difficult. Bohlen Lucas, one of the few black Democratic politicians in the Delta during Reconstruction (most black politicians at the time were Republicans), was born enslaved and managed to buy a 200-acre farm from his former overseer. But, like many farmers, who often have to borrow against expected harvests to pay for equipment, supplies, and the rent or mortgage on their land, Lucas depended on credit extended by powerful lenders. In his case, credit depended specifically on white patronage, given in exchange for his help voting out the Reconstruction government—after which his patrons abandoned him. He was left with 20 acres.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn Humphreys County, Lewis Spearman avoided the pitfalls of white patronage by buying less valuable wooded tracts and grazing cattle there as he moved into cotton. But when cotton crashed in the 1880s, Spearman, over his head in debt, crashed with it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAround the turn of the century, in Leflore County, a black farm organizer and proponent of self-sufficiency—referred to as a “notoriously bad Negro” in the local newspapers—led a black populist awakening, marching defiantly and by some accounts bringing boycotts against white merchants. White farmers responded with a posse that may have killed as many as 100 black farmers and sharecroppers along with women and children. The fate of the “bad Negro” in question, named Oliver Cromwell, is uncertain. Some sources say he escaped to Jackson, and into anonymity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLike so many of his forebears, Ed Scott Sr., Willena Scott-White’s grandfather, acquired his land through not much more than force of will. As recorded in the thick binders of family history that Willena had brought along in the truck, and that we flipped through between stretches of work in the fields, his life had attained the gloss of folklore. He was born in 1886 in western Alabama, a generation removed from bondage. Spurred by that same land hunger, Scott took his young family to the Delta, seeking opportunities to farm his own property. He sharecropped and rented, and managed large farms for white planters, who valued his ability to run their sprawling estates. One of these men was Palmer H. Brooks, who owned a 7,000-acre plantation in Mississippi’s Leflore and Sunflower Counties. Brooks was uncommonly progressive, encouraging entrepreneurship among the black laborers on his plantation, building schools and churches for them, and providing loans. Scott was ready when Brooks decided to sell plots to black laborers, and he bought his first 100 acres.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnlike Bohlen Lucas, Scott largely avoided politics. Unlike Lewis Spearman, he paid his debts and kept some close white allies—a necessity, since he usually rejected government assistance. And unlike Oliver Cromwell, he led his community under the rules already in place, appearing content with what he’d earned for his family in an environment of total segregation. He leveraged technical skills and a talent for management to impress sympathetic white people and disarm hostile ones. “Granddaddy always had nice vehicles,” Scott-White told me. They were a trapping of pride in a life of toil. As was true in most rural areas at the time, a new truck was not just a flashy sign of prosperity but also a sort of credit score. Wearing starched dress shirts served the same purpose, elevating Scott in certain respects—always within limits—even above some white farmers who drove into town in dirty overalls. The trucks got shinier as his holdings grew. By the time Scott died, in 1957, he had amassed more than 1,000 acres of farmland.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eScott-White guided me right up to the Quiver River, where the legend of her family began. It was a choked, green-brown gurgle of a thing, the kind of lazy waterway that one imagines to be brimming with fat, yawning catfish and snakes. “Mr. Brooks sold all of the land on the east side of this river to black folks,” Scott-White told me. She swept her arm to encompass the endless acres. “All of these were once owned by black families.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"full-width\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/07/WEL_Newkirk_Family/5dff9b3fb.jpg\" width=\"960\"\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"caption\"\u003eMembers of the extended Scott family. \u003cem\u003eFrom the right\u003c/em\u003e: Isaac Daniel Scott Sr. and his wife, Lucy Chatman-Scott; Willena Scott-White; and Willena’s son Joseph White, with his daughter, Jade Marie White.

As the historian Pete Daniel recounts, half a million black-owned farms across the country failed in the 25 years after 1950. Joe Brooks, the former president of the Emergency Land Fund, a group founded in 1972 to fight the problem of dispossession, has estimated that something on the order of 6 million acres was lost by black farmers from 1950 to 1969. That’s an average of 820 acres a day—an area the size of New York’s Central Park erased with each sunset. Black-owned cotton farms in the South almost completely disappeared, diminishing from 87,000 to just over 3,000 in the 1960s alone.

Roosevelt’s New Deal life raft for agriculture helped start the trend in 1937 with the establishment of the Farm Security Administration, an agency within the Department of Agriculture. Although the FSA ostensibly existed to help the country’s small farmers, as happened with much of the rest of the New Deal, white administrators often ignored or targeted poor black people—denying them loans and giving sharecropping work to white people. After Roosevelt’s death, in 1945, conservatives in Congress replaced the FSA with the Farmers Home Administration, or FmHA. The FmHA quickly transformed the FSA’s programs for small farmers, establishing the sinews of the loan-and-subsidy structure that undergirds American agriculture today. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy’s administration created the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, or ASCS, a complementary program to the FmHA that also provided loans to farmers. The ASCS was a federal effort—also within the Department of Agriculture—but, crucially, the members of committees doling out money and credit were elected locally, during a time when black people were prohibited from voting.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThrough these programs, and through massive crop and surplus purchasing, the USDA became the safety net, price-setter, chief investor, and sole regulator for most of the farm economy in places like the Delta. The department could offer better loan terms to risky farmers than banks and other lenders, and mostly outcompeted private credit. In his book \u003cem\u003eDispossession\u003c/em\u003e, Daniel calls the setup “agrigovernment.” Land-grant universities pumped out both farm operators and the USDA agents who connected those operators to federal money. Large plantations ballooned into even larger industrial crop factories as small farms collapsed. The mega-farms held sway over agricultural policy, resulting in more money, at better interest rates, for the plantations themselves. At every level of agrigovernment, the leaders were white.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMajor audits and investigations of the USDA have found that illegal pressures levied through its loan programs created massive transfers of wealth from black to white farmers, especially in the period just after the 1950s. In 1965, the United States Commission on Civil Rights uncovered blatant and dramatic racial differences in the level of federal investment in farmers. The commission found that in a sample of counties across the South, the FmHA provided much larger loans for small and medium-size white-owned farms, relative to net worth, than it did for similarly sized black-owned farms—evidence that racial discrimination “has served to accelerate the displacement and impoverishment of the Negro farmer.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn Sunflower County, a man named Ted Keenan told investigators that in 1956, local banks had denied him loans after a bad crop because of his position with the NAACP, where he openly advocated for voting rights. The FmHA had denied him loans as well. Keenan described how Eugene Fisackerly, the leader of the White Citizens’ Council in Sunflower County, together with representatives of Senator James Eastland, a notorious white supremacist who maintained a large plantation there, had intimidated him into renouncing his affiliation with the NAACP and agreeing not to vote. Only then did Eastland’s man call the local FmHA agent, prompting him to reconsider Keenan’s loan.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA landmark 2001 investigation by the Associated Press into extortion, exploitation, and theft directed against black farmers uncovered more than 100 cases like Keenan’s. In the 1950s and ’60s, Norman Weathersby, a Holmes County Chevrolet dealer who enjoyed a local monopoly on trucks and heavy farm equipment, required black farmers to put up land as collateral for loans on equipment. A close friend of his, William Strider, was the local FmHA agent. Black farmers in the area claimed that the two ran a racket: Strider would slow-walk them on FmHA loans, which meant they would then default on Weathersby’s loans and lose their land to him. Strider and Weathersby were reportedly free to run this racket because black farmers were shut out by local banks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnalyzing the history of federal programs, the Emergency Land Fund emphasizes a key distinction. While most of the black land loss appears on its face to have been through \u003ci\u003elegal \u003c/i\u003emechanisms—“the tax sale; the partition sale; and the foreclosure”—it mainly stemmed from \u003ci\u003eillegal \u003c/i\u003epressures, including discrimination in federal and state programs, swindles by lawyers and speculators, unlawful denials of private loans, and even outright acts of violence or intimidation. Discriminatory loan servicing and loan denial by white-controlled FmHA and ASCS committees forced black farmers into foreclosure, after which their property could be purchased by wealthy landowners, almost all of whom were white. Discrimination by private lenders had the same result. Many black farmers who escaped foreclosure were defrauded by white tax assessors who set assessments too high, leading to unaffordable tax obligations. The inevitable result: tax sales, where, again, the land was purchased by wealthy white people. Black people’s lack of access to legal services complicated inheritances and put family claims to title in jeopardy. Lynchings, police brutality, and other forms of intimidation were sometimes used to dispossess black farmers, and even when land wasn’t a motivation for such actions, much of the violence left land without an owner.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn interviews with researchers from the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History in 1985, Henry Woodard Sr., an African American who had bought land in the 1950s in Tunica County, said he had managed to keep up for years through a combination of his own industry, small loans from the FmHA and white banks, and the rental of additional land from other hard-pressed black landowners. Then, in 1966, the activist James Meredith—whose 1962 fight to integrate Ole Miss sparked deadly riots and a wave of white backlash—embarked on the famous \u003ca href=\"https://time.com/4356404/james-meredith-50th-anniversary-march-against-fear/\"\u003eMarch Against Fear\u003c/a\u003e. The next planting season, Woodard recalled, his white lenders ignored him. “I sensed that it was because of this march,” he said. “And it was a lady told me—I was at the post office and she told me, she said, ‘Henry, you Negroes, y’all want to live like white folks. Y’all don’t know how white folks live. But y’all are gonna have to be on your own now.’ ”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWoodard’s story would have been familiar to countless farmers in the Delta. In Holmes County, a crucible of the voting-rights movement, a black effort to integrate the local ASCS committees was so successful that it was subject to surveillance and sabotage by the Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission, an official agency created by Governor J. P. Coleman in 1956 to resist integration. Black landowners involved in running for the committees or organizing for votes faced fierce retaliation. In 1965, \u003cem\u003eThe New Republic\u003c/em\u003e reported that in Issaquena County, just north of Vicksburg, the “insurance of Negroes active in the ASCS elections had been canceled, loans were denied to Negroes on all crops but cotton, and ballots were not mailed to Negro wives who were co-owners of land.” Even in the decades after the passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, formal and informal complaints against the USDA poured out of the Delta.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese cases of dispossession can only be called theft. While the civil-rights era is remembered as a time of victories against disenfranchisement and segregation, many realities never changed. The engine of white wealth built on kleptocracy—which powered both Jim Crow and its slave-state precursor—continued to run. The black population in Mississippi declined by almost one-fifth from 1950 to 1970, as the white population increased by the exact same percentage. Farmers slipped away one by one into the night, appearing later as laborers in Chicago and Detroit. By the time black people truly gained the ballot in Mississippi, they were a clear minority, held in thrall to a white conservative supermajority.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/07/the-ghosts-of-freedom-summer-in-greenwood-mississippi/374106/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eNikole Hannah-Jones: Freedom Summer, 1964: Did it really change Mississippi?\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMass dispossession did not require a central organizing force or a grand conspiracy. Thousands of individual decisions by white people, enabled or motivated by greed, racism, existing laws, and market forces, all pushed in a single direction. But some white people undeniably would have organized it this way if they could have. The civil-rights leader Bayard Rustin reported in 1956 that documents taken from the office of Robert Patterson, one of the founding fathers of the White Citizens’ Councils, proposed a “master plan” to force hundreds of thousands of black people from Mississippi in order to reduce their potential voting power. Patterson envisioned, in Rustin’s words, “the decline of the small independent farmer” and ample doses of “economic pressure.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAn upheaval of this scale and speed—the destruction of black farming, an occupation that had defined the African American experience—might in any other context be described as a revolution, or seen as a historical fulcrum. But it came and went with little remark.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eIV. The Catfish Boom\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=\"smallcaps\"\u003eWorld War II\u003c/span\u003e\u003cb\u003e \u003c/b\u003etransformed America in many ways. It certainly transformed a generation of southern black men. That generation included Medgar Evers, a future civil-rights martyr, assassinated while leading the Mississippi NAACP; he served in a segregated transportation company in Europe during the war. It included Willena’s father, Ed Scott Jr., who also served in a segregated transportation company. These men were less patient, more defiant, and in many ways more reckless than their fathers and grandfathers had been. They chafed under a system that forced them to relearn how to bow and scrape, as if the war had never happened. In the younger Scott’s case, wartime service sharpened his inherited land hunger, pushing him to seek more land and greater financial independence, both for himself and for his community. One of his siblings told his biographer, Julian Rankin, that the family’s deepest conviction was that “a million years from now … this land will still be Scotts’ land.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUpon his return to the Delta, Scott continued down his father’s hard path, avoiding any interface with the FmHA and the public portions of the agrigovernment system, which by that time had spread its tendrils throughout Sunflower and Leflore Counties. He leaned on the friendships he and his father had made with local business owners and farmers, and secured credit for growing his holdings from friendly white bankers. Influenced by the civil-rights movement and its emphasis on community solidarity and activism, Scott borrowed from Oliver Cromwell’s self-sufficiency playbook too. He used his status to provide opportunities for other black farmers and laborers. “Daddy said that everyone who worked for us would always be able to eat,” Willena Scott-White told me. He made sure of more than that. Scott sent relatives’ and tenants’ children to school, paid for books, helped people open bank accounts and buy their own land. When civil-rights activists made their way down for Mississippi’s Freedom Summer, in 1964, he packed up meals and brought them to rallies.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen Scott-White thinks of her father, who died in 2015, she seems to become a young girl again. With allowances for nostalgia, she recalls a certain kind of country poorness-but-not-poverty, whereby children ran barefoot and worked from the moment they could walk, but ate well, lived in houses with solid floors and tight roofs, and went to high school and college if they showed skill. “We lived in something like a utopia,” Scott-White told me. But things changed at the tail end of the 1970s. Plummeting commodity prices forced highly leveraged farmers to seek loans wherever they could find them. Combined with the accelerating inflation of that decade, the beginnings of the farm-credit crisis made farming at scale without federal assistance impossible. Yet federal help—even then, two decades after the Civil Rights Act—was not available for most black farmers. According to a 2005 article in \u003cem\u003eThe Nation\u003c/em\u003e, “In 1984 and 1985, at the height of the farm crisis, the USDA lent a total of $1.3 billion to nearly 16,000 farmers to help them maintain their land. Only 209 of those farmers were black.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs Rankin tells it in his biography, \u003ci\u003eCatfish Dream\u003c/i\u003e, Scott made his first visit to an FmHA office in 1978. With the assistance of Vance Nimrod, a white man who worked with the black-owned Delta Foundation, a nonprofit promoting economic advancement for black Mississippians, Scott secured an operating loan for a season of soybeans and rice from the FmHA agent Delbert Edwards. The first time was easy—although, crucially, Nimrod accompanied him to the Leflore County office, in Greenwood. When Scott returned the next year without Nimrod, driving a shiny new truck the way his father used to, Edwards asked where Nimrod was. According to Rankin, Scott told the agent that Nimrod had only come to help secure that first loan; he wasn’t a business partner. When Edwards saw Scott’s vehicle, he seemed perplexed. “Who told you to buy a new truck?” he asked. Edwards ended up denying the requested loan amount.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, Edwards and the FmHA were moving to help local white farmers weather the storm, often by advising them to get into raising catfish. Commercial catfish farming was a relatively new industry, and it had found a home in the Delta as prices for row crops crashed and new legislation gave the USDA power and incentive to build up domestic fish farming. FmHA agents pushed white farmers to convert wide fields on the floodplain into giant catfish ponds, many of which would become contract-growing hubs for Delta Pride Catfish, a cooperative that quickly evolved into a local monopoly. The federal government poured millions of dollars into the catfish boom by way of FmHA loans, many of which were seized on by the largest white landowners, and kept those white landowners solvent. Mississippi became the catfish capital of the world in the 1970s. But the FmHA did not reach out to Scott, nor is there evidence that it supported the ambitions of any black farmers who might have wanted to get into catfish.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eScott decided to get into catfish anyway, digging eight ponds in fields where rice had grown the season before. He found his own catfish stocks and learned the ins and outs of the industry pretty much on his own. Scott finished digging his ponds in 1981, at which point, according to Rankin, Edwards of the FmHA visited the property and told him point-blank: “Don’t think I’m giving you any damn money for that dirt you’re moving.” The Mississippi FmHA would eventually compel Edwards to provide loans for Scott’s catfish operation for 1981 and 1982. But as court records show, the amount approved was far less than what white catfish farmers usually got—white farmers sometimes received double or triple the amount per acre that Scott did—and enough to stock only four of the eight ponds. (Edwards could not be reached for comment on any of the episodes recounted here.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"full-width\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" height=\"610\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/07/WEL_NewKirk_CatfishEDIT/f521aa922.jpg\" width=\"960\"\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"caption\"\u003eThe official opening of the processing plant for Scott’s Fresh Catfish, February 1983. \u003cem\u003eSeated, far left:\u003c/em\u003e Ed Scott Jr., founder and owner. \u003cem\u003eNext to Scott\u003c/em\u003e: Jim Buck Ross, Mississippi’s longtime commissioner of agriculture and commerce.

As a marker outside the old processing shed now indicates, it was the first catfish plant in the country owned by an African American. But discrimination doomed the enterprise before it really began. Without enough capital, Scott was never able to raise fish at the volume he needed. He claimed in court and later to Rankin that he had also been denied a chance to purchase stock in Delta Pride—a requirement to become a contract grower—because he was black. Without access to a cooperative, he had to do the processing and packaging himself, adding to the cost of his product. In 2006, Delta Pride and Country Select Catfish were combined into a new business entity, Consolidated Catfish Producers. When reached for comment, a spokesperson for Consolidated Catfish said that no employee at the new company could “definitively answer” questions about Scott or alleged discrimination against him.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eScott was in his 60s by the time his plant got off the ground. The effort took a toll. He slowly went blind. Arthritis claimed his joints. His heart began to fail. The plant limped quietly through the ’80s and then shut down. Lenders began the process of foreclosing on some of Scott’s cropland as early as 1983. In 1995, the FmHA approved a request from Scott to lease most of his remaining acres. The USDA itself had claimed most of his land by the late 1980s.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe downfall of the Scott catfish enterprise was proof of the strength and endurance of what the federal government would later state could be seen as a federally funded “conspiracy to force minority and disadvantaged farmers off their land through discriminatory loan practices.” The Scotts were not small-timers. They had the kind of work ethic and country savvy that are usually respected around the Delta. When the powers that be finally prevailed over Ed Scott Jr., they had completed something decisive, something that even today feels as if it cannot be undone.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eV. Farmers in Suits\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=\"smallcaps\"\u003eBut land is never really lost,\u003c/span\u003e not in America. Twelve million acres of farmland in a country that has become a global breadbasket carries immense value, and the dispossessed land in the Delta is some of the most productive in America. The soil on the alluvial plain is rich. The region is warm and wet. Much of the land is perfect for industrialized agriculture.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSome white landowners, like Norman Weathersby, themselves the beneficiaries of government-funded dispossession, left land to their children. Some sold off to their peers, and others saw their land gobbled up by even larger white-owned farms. Nowadays, as fewer and fewer of the children of aging white landowners want to continue farming, more land has wound up in the hands of trusts and investors. Over the past 20 years, the real power brokers in the Delta are less likely to be good ol’ boys and more likely to be suited venture capitalists, hedge-fund managers, and agribusiness consultants who run farms with the cold precision of giant circuit boards.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne new addition to the mix is pension funds. Previously, farmland had never been a choice asset class for large-scale investing. In 1981, what was then called the General Accounting Office (now the Government Accountability Office) released a report exploring a proposal by a firm seeking pension-investment opportunities in farmland. The report essentially laughed off the prospect. The authors found that only about one dollar of every $4,429 in retirement funds was invested in farmland.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"full-width\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/07/WEL_Newkirk_Bins/d88edd8cc.jpg\" width=\"960\"\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"caption\"\u003eGrain bins on Scott-family land, in Drew, once used for rice and now for soybeans.

In 2008, a weakened dollar forced major funds to broaden their search for hedges against inflation. “The market in agricultural land in the U.S. is currently experiencing a boom,” an industry analyst, Tom Vulcan, wrote that year. He took note of the recent entry of TIAA-CREF, which had “spent some $340 million on farmland across seven states.” TIAA, as the company is now called, would soon become the biggest pension-fund player in the agricultural real-estate game across the globe. In 2010, TIAA bought a controlling interest in Westchester Group, a major agricultural-asset manager. In 2014, it bought Nuveen, another large asset-management firm. In 2015, with Nuveen directing its overall investment strategy and Westchester and other smaller subsidiaries operating as purchasers and managers, TIAA raised $3 billion for a new global farmland-investment partnership. By the close of 2016, Nuveen’s management portfolio included nearly 2 million acres of farmland, worth close to $6 billion.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInvestment in farmland has proved troublesome for TIAA in Mississippi and elsewhere. TIAA is a pension company originally set up for teachers and professors and people in the nonprofit world. It has cultivated a reputation for social responsibility: promoting environmental sustainability and respecting land rights, labor rights, and resource rights. TIAA has endorsed the United Nations–affiliated Principles for Responsible Investment, which include special provisions for investment in farmland, including specific guidelines with regard to sustainability, leasing practices, and establishing the provenance of tracts of land.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe company has faced pushback for its move into agriculture. In 2015, the international nonprofit \u003ca href=\"https://www.grain.org/\"\u003eGrain\u003c/a\u003e, which advocates for local control of farmland by small farmers, \u003ca href=\"https://www.grain.org/article/entries/5336-foreign-pension-funds-and-land-grabbing-in-brazil\"\u003ereleased the results of an investigation accusing TIAA’s farmland-investment arm of skirting laws\u003c/a\u003e limiting foreign land acquisition in its purchase of more than half a million acres in Brazil. The report found that TIAA had violated multiple UN guidelines in creating a joint venture with a Brazilian firm to invest in farmland without transparency. The Grain report alleges that when Brazil tightened laws designed to restrict foreign investment, TIAA purchased 49 percent of a Brazilian company that then acted as its proxy. \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/17/world/americas/tiaa-cref-us-investment-giant-accused-of-land-grabs-in-brazil.html\"\u003eAccording to \u003ci\u003eThe New York Times\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, TIAA and its subsidiaries also appear to have acquired land titles from Euclides de Carli, a businessman often described in Brazil as a big-time \u003ci\u003egrileiro\u003c/i\u003e—a member of a class of landlords and land grabbers who use a mix of legitimate means, fraud, and violence to force small farmers off their land. In response to criticism of TIAA’s Brazil portfolio, \u003ca href=\"https://www.wnycstudios.org/story/tiaa-cref-accused-illegaly-investments-brazil\"\u003eJose Minaya, then the head of private-markets asset management at TIAA, told WNYC’s \u003ci\u003eThe Takeaway\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e: “We believe and know that we are in compliance with the law, and we are transparent about what we do in Brazil.

We do due diligence on the sellers, whether it’s an individual or whether it’s an entity.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTIAA’s land dealings have faced scrutiny in the United States as well. In 2012, \u003ca href=\"https://www.nffc.net/Issues/Corporate%20Control/TIAA-CREF%20Backgrounder_2.3.13.pdf\"\u003ethe National Family Farm Coalition found\u003c/a\u003e that the entry into agriculture of deep-pocketed institutional investors—TIAA being an example—had made it pretty much impossible for smaller farmers to compete. Institutional investment has removed millions of acres from farmers’ hands, more or less permanently. “Pension funds not only have the power to outbid smaller, local farmers, they also have the long-term goal of retaining farmland for generations,” the report noted.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAsked about TIAA’s record, a spokesperson for Nuveen maintained that the company has built its Delta portfolio following \u003ca href=\"https://www.tiaa.org/public/pdf/how_we_invest_in_farmland.pdf\"\u003eethical-investment guidelines\u003c/a\u003e: “We have a long history of investing responsibly in farmland, in keeping with our corporate values and the UN-backed Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI). As a long-term owner, we bring capital, professional expertise, and sustainable farming practices to each farm we own, and we are always looking to partner with expansion-minded tenants who will embrace that approach and act as good stewards of the land.” The company did not comment on the history of any individual tract in its Delta portfolio.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut even assuming that every acre under management by big corporate interests in the Delta has been acquired by way of ethical-investment principles, the nature of the mid-century dispossession and its multiple layers of legitimation raise the question of whether responsible investment in farmland there is even possible. As a people and a class, black farmers were plainly targets, but the deed histories of tax sales and foreclosures don’t reveal whether individual debtors were moved off the land because of discrimination and its legal tools.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn addition, land records are spotty in rural areas, especially records from the 1950s and ’60s, and in some cases it’s unclear exactly which records the investors used to meet internal requirements. According to Tristan Quinn-Thibodeau, a campaigner and organizer at ActionAid, an anti-poverty and food-justice nonprofit, “It’s been a struggle to get this information.” The organization has tried to follow the trails of deeds and has asked TIAA—which manages ActionAid’s own pension plan—for an analysis of the provenance of its Delta portfolio. Such an analysis has not been provided.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat we do know is that, whatever the specific lineage of each acre, Wall Street investors have found a lucrative new asset class whose origins lie in part in mass dispossession. We know that the vast majority of black farmland in the country is no longer in black hands, and that black farmers have suffered far more hardships than white farmers have. The historian Debra A. Reid points out that “between 1920 and 1997, the number of African Americans who farmed decreased by 98 percent, while white Americans who farmed declined by 66 percent.” Referring to the cases studied in their 2001 investigation, Dolores Barclay and Todd Lewan of the Associated Press observed that virtually all of the property lost by black farmers “is owned by whites or corporations.” The foundation of these portfolios was a system of plantations whose owners created the agrigovernment system and absorbed thousands of small black-owned farms into ever larger white-owned farms.

A Deeper Excavation\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=\"smallcaps\"\u003eAs we drove through\u003c/span\u003e the patchwork remnants of the Scotts’ land, Willena Scott-White took me to the site of Scott’s Fresh Catfish. Gleaming steel silos had turned into rusting hulks. The ponds were thick with weeds and debris. The exterior walls of the plant itself had collapsed. Rusted beams lay atop ruined machinery. Fire ants and kudzu had begun nature’s reclamation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLate in Ed Scott Jr.’s life, as he slipped into Alzheimer’s, Willena and his lawyer, Phil Fraas, fought to keep his original hopes alive. In the \u003cem\u003ePigford v. Glickman\u003c/em\u003e lawsuit of 1997, thousands of black farmers and their families won settlements against the USDA for discrimination that had occurred between 1981 and the end of 1996; the outlays ultimately reached a total of $2 billion. The Scotts were one of those families, and after a long battle to prove their case—with the assistance of Scott-White’s meticulous notes and family history—in 2012 the family was awarded more than $6 million in economic damages, plus almost $400,000 in other damages and debt forgiveness. The court also helped the Scotts reclaim land possessed by the department. In a 1999 ruling, Judge Paul L. Friedman of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia acknowledged that forcing the federal government to compensate black farmers would “not undo all that has been done” in centuries of government-sponsored racism. But for the Scotts, it was a start.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“The telling factor, looking at it from the long view, is that at the time of World War I there were 1 million black farmers, and in 1992 there were 18,000,” Fraas told me. The settlements stemming from \u003cem\u003ePigford\u003c/em\u003e cover only specific recent claims of discrimination, and none stretching back to the period of the civil-rights era, when the great bulk of black-owned farms disappeared. Most people have not pushed for any kind of deeper excavation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAny such excavation would quickly make plain the consequences of what occurred. During my drive with Scott-White, we traveled through parts of Leflore, Sunflower, and Washington Counties, three of the counties singled out by Opportunity Insights, a Harvard University research group, as among the worst in the country in terms of a child’s prospects for upward mobility. Ten counties in the Delta are among the poorest 50 in America. According to new data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on all 74,000 U.S. census tracts, four tracts in the Delta are among the lowest 100 when it comes to average life expectancy. More than 30 tracts in the Delta have an average life expectancy below 70. (The national average is 79.) In some Delta counties, the infant mortality rate is more than double the nationwide rate. As if to add gratuitous insult to injury, a new analysis from ProPublica finds that, as a result of the Internal Revenue Service’s intense scrutiny of low-income taxpayers, \u003ca href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/graphics/eitc-audit\"\u003ethe Delta is audited by the IRS more heavily than any other place in the country\u003c/a\u003e. In sum, the areas of deepest poverty and under the darkest shadow of death are the ones where dispossession was the most far-reaching.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"full-width\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" height=\"767\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/07/WEL_NewKirk_GraveSiteEDIT/1e4888ffa.jpg\" width=\"960\"\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"caption\"\u003eThe Scott-family cemetery. (Zora J. Murff)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe consequences of dispossession had long been predicted. Fannie Lou Hamer, a Sunflower County activist whose \u003ca href=\"http://americanradioworks.publicradio.org/features/sayitplain/flhamer.html\"\u003e1964 speech to a Democratic National Convention committee\u003c/a\u003e galvanized support for the Voting Rights Act, spoke often of the need for land reform as a precondition for true freedom. Hamer’s utopian Freedom Farm experiment stressed cooperative landownership, and she said the concentration of land in the hands of a few landowners was “at the base of our struggle for survival.” In her analysis, mass dispossession should be seen as mass extraction. Even as the U.S. government invested billions in white farmers, it continued to extract wealth from black farmers in the Delta. Each black farmer who left the region, from Reconstruction onward, represented a tiny withdrawal from one side of a cosmic balance sheet and a deposit on the other side. This dynamic would only continue, in other ways and other places, as the Great Migration brought black families to northern cities.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis cosmic balance sheet underpins the national conversation—ever more robust—about reparations for black Americans. In that conversation, given momentum in part by the publication of \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/06/the-case-for-reparations/361631/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eTa-Nehisi Coates’s “The Case for Reparations”\u003c/a\u003e in this magazine in 2014, I hear echoes of Mississippi. I hear echoes of Hamer, the Scotts, Henry Woodard Sr., and others who petitioned the federal government to hold itself accountable for a history of extraction that has extended well beyond enslavement. But that conversation too easily becomes technical. How do we quantify discrimination? How do we define who was discriminated against? How do we repay those people according to what has been defined and quantified? The idea of reparations sometimes seems like a problem of economic rightsizing—something for the quants and wonks to work out.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEconomics is, of course, a major consideration. According to the researchers Francis and Hamilton, “The dispossession of black agricultural land resulted in the loss of hundreds of billions of dollars of black wealth. We must emphasize this estimate is conservative … Depending on multiplier effects, rates of returns, and other factors, it could reach into the trillions.” The large wealth gap between white and black families today exists in part because of this historic loss.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut money does not define every dimension of land theft. Were it not for dispossession, Mississippi today might well be a majority-black state, with a radically different political destiny. Imagine the difference in our national politics if the center of gravity of black electoral strength had remained in the South after the Voting Rights Act was passed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003caside class=\"callout-placeholder\" data-source=\"curated\"\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003cp\u003ePolitics aside, how can reparations truly address the lives ruined, the family histories lost, the connection to the land severed? In America, land has always had a significance that exceeds its economic value. For a people who were once chattel themselves, real property has carried an almost mystical import. There’s a reason the fabled promise that spread among freedmen after the Civil War was not a check, a job, or a refundable tax credit, but 40 acres of farmland to call home. The history of the Delta suggests that any conversation about reparations might need to be \u003ci\u003emore \u003c/i\u003equalitative and intangible than it is. And it must consider the land.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLand hunger is ineffable, an indescribable yearning, and yet it is something that Americans, perhaps uniquely, feel and understand. That yearning tugged at me hardest as Willena Scott-White rounded out her tour of the fields, the afternoon slipping away. Out among the Scotts’ fields is a clearing with a lone, tall tree. In the clearing is a small cemetery. A handful of crooked, weathered tombstones stand sentinel. This is where Ed Scott Jr. is buried, and where some of Willena’s older siblings now rest. Willena posed for a picture beside her parents’ grave. She told me that this is where her own bones will rest after her work on Earth is done.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“This is\u003ci\u003e our\u003c/i\u003e land,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003csmall\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis article appears in the September 2019 print edition with the headline “This Land Was Our Land.”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/small\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/RwXFzvsbkNs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/RwXFzvsbkNs/","published":"2019-08-12T10:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:39-594742"},{"title":"The Contradictory Americana on Display at the Iowa State Fair","content":"\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eDES MOINES—Children are being shot, another apocalyptic climate report just hit, but the 2020 Democratic candidates still made time for fried Oreos at the Iowa State Fair.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eAnd fried cheese curds, fried PB\u0026amp;J, and giant turkey legs.

On Friday night, they all hauled 100 miles up the highway to Clear Lake for an event called the Wing Ding. The dinner, which featured five-minute presidential speeches, took place inside the Surf Ballroom, the last venue that Buddy Holly, the Big Bopper, and Ritchie Valens played in 1959 before their plane crashed in a field a few miles away. On Friday, a couple of hundred Democratic activists picked through sloppy joes and baked beans, waiting to be wowed. (The candidates did come together to hold hands in a brief moment of silence for the latest shooting victims, and performed for the cameras in the plaza next to the large record-themed memorial to the dead musicians.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e“It’s harder to smile these days,” former Housing Secretary Julián Castro told me. “It’s harder to smile because of everything that has happened.

A little later, Henry, who had a special \u003cspan class=\"smallcaps\"\u003eDirector of Fun\u003c/span\u003e T-shirt printed for him by the campaign, made another cameo during an appearance she recorded for CBS. Gillibrand’s husband, Jonathan, drove the family around the state in an RV. Former Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper is using one too. Harris pulled into Iowa on a bus wrapped in a three-color logo of her last name. It basically functioned as a rolling interview studio, shuttling her over four days from the Missouri River to the Mississippi, mostly for the sake of claiming the gimmick.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eGillibrand handed her dripping ice-cream cone to an aide as she and I spoke. “There’s an ever-present anxiety, because [Trump has] put us at such risk in so many ways that people really do fear the future,” she told me. It can be hard to focus on fair games a few hours after speaking at a quickly organized presidential forum on gun violence. “You do have to separate it,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThen she was off to see the butter cow, which was accompanied this year by a butter Big Bird, a butter Oscar the Grouch, and a butter Cookie Monster, watching a butter TV.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe only major candidate who didn’t come to Iowa this weekend was former Texas Representative Beto O’Rourke, who scrapped his trip to continue visiting the families of shooting victims in the El Paso area, where he lives. A piece of black tape covered his name on the official posted schedule for the speeches at the fair. He sent a video message that played on-screen at the Wing Ding dinner: “I’m sad that I can’t be with you in person,” but “I hope to see you in the very near future.” Meanwhile, O’Rourke shaped the weekend from a distance: After he cursed and called Trump a white supremacist earlier in the week, many reporters spent their time at the fair asking other candidates whether they agreed with his use of the term, the latest instance of the yes-or-no question that has become a Twitter-friendly staple of the campaign trail.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eSenator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts drew more people to her speech on the soapbox than most of the other candidates combined. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg received a hugely enthusiastic reception at the Wing Ding from the moment he walked out, and it continued through a speech that called for a fresh start with serious answers. Biden, meanwhile, sounded tired and ran long, not realizing that “We Take Care of Our Own,” the Bruce Springsteen song his campaign has cribbed from the old Obama playlist, was playing to nudge him offstage.

While the governor waited to be told the patties had crisped enough to flip, he talked about his family roots in Iowa, then asked the chef, Spanky, how much of a hit his farm had taken from Trump’s tariff wars. (He also wanted to know where the name Spanky came from.) While waiting in line to see the butter cow, Bullock told me that the fair was “a nice break,” but that he is concerned that the race so far isn’t caught up enough with what’s happening in the country. “We can’t have these debates that are disconnected from people’s lives,” he told me.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWashington Governor Jay Inslee, whose campaign is based on his belief that Americans aren’t adequately focused on climate change as an immediate, existential threat, was in an upbeat mood with the reprieve of the weekend. We caught up as he worked the crowd after the Wing Ding. “I know these people have a lot of passion for the things that count,” Inslee told me. “It’s not just fried chicken and pork on a stick. These people care a whole bunch, maybe more than ever.” He compared this moment to the political awakening for many Americans during the Vietnam War. His fellow candidates are acting alarmed enough, Inslee said, but “it’s more important that the voters be alarmed than the politicians, and the voters are very, very alarmed, appropriately so.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eRepresentative Tim Ryan of Ohio walked around the fair with his wife and son, introducing the boy to other candidates and feeding him fair food.

For influencers to grow online, collaboration is key. Being a twinfluencer means having someone around you to act as a sounding board, brainstorm with, or simply hold the camera. It also means splitting editing and promotion time between two people: While one twin responds to fans via Instagram DM, the other can cut together the day’s YouTube video. This allows each twin to play to their strengths, together acting as one super-influencer. “My sister, Olivia, is more organized than me,” says Ashley Mescia, a 19-year-old influencer. “I’m better when it comes to socializing.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eMeet and greets and brand events, too, are easier with a partner. “Whenever we meet new people, we’re not too shy because we feed off each other. We can fill in the spaces where the other one lacks,” says 18-year-old Myka Montoya, who is one half of the \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCk6Jvjrs7XbCtWwFBbWt6lw\"\u003eMontoya Twins\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eSplitting everything isn’t always painless, however. Some twins said they were more likely to fight with a sibling than a friend. Others mentioned that when you’re a twinfluencer, you can’t have autonomy over your own channel or Instagram account. Maintaining a twin brand, especially as both parties develop their own unique personalities and interests, can be hard. While the Stokes twins maintain \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbp9MyKCTEww4CxEzc_Tp0Q\"\u003ea shared YouTube channel\u003c/a\u003e, each has an individual Instagram account. “I didn’t want people to only see us as one person,” Alex says. On Instagram, they often match their outfits, though in real life they maintain different looks. But one twin won’t make a change in appearance without the other doing it too.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned=\"\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BelaCmCFvRD/\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

David Cameron believed he could win the referendum and thereby head off the electoral threat to his party from the right. He did not. Theresa May believed she could turn a narrow 52–48 vote in favor of leaving into a mandate for a “hard Brexit” in which Britain got everything it wanted and gave up nothing. She did not. Now Boris Johnson is voluntarily manufacturing a crisis over no deal—in which Britain would leave the EU without any agreement on the rules and regulations governing how it would trade and work with the bloc—that could send damaging shock waves through Britain, Ireland, and the rest of the EU.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2019/03/brexit-international-audience-uk/585670/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: Even now, Brexit remains impossible to understand\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThere has been much discussion of the roles of history and memory in relation to Brexit.

Yet it is hard to avoid the sense that embedded in Brexit is a form of “Make Britain great again.” Sharper parallels are perhaps drawn between Britain’s \u003ca href=\"http://theconversation.com/brexit-is-not-world-war-ii-politicians-should-stop-comparing-them-111286\"\u003ecollective recollection\u003c/a\u003e of its part in World War II, heavily mythologized as the moment it \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.historyextra.com/period/second-world-war/britain-stood-alone-ww2-myths-brexit-debate/\"\u003estood alone\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e against Adolf Hitler, and the attitude of Brexit supporters to the isolation and hardship Brexit may bring.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWhile the myths constructed around the history of empire and World War II reinforce British exceptionalism, they are contradictory. The first casts Britain as a superpower; the second as a lone, plucky underdog. This dissonance is not new, nor is it unique to the Brexit process. It has helped produce disasters on an international scale before. The Suez crisis—during which Britain was neither able to take control of the Suez Canal, nor able to oust Egypt’s anti-imperialist leader, Gamal Abdel Nasser—is often cited as a precursor.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eBrexit is a public withdrawal from a voluntary union; Suez was a covert invasion of a sovereign state. They are wholly different. Yet there is a familiarity to the grand aspirations undercut by slapdash and delusional strategic planning; to the frantic rush to act, even as it becomes clear that most or all of the options are damaging; to leaders fixated on a path that many can see will probably end badly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIn general, Britain remembers Suez as a blip in what is \u003ca href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2014/07/26/britain-proud-its-empire\"\u003ewidely viewed\u003c/a\u003e as a mostly well-intentioned and competent imperial policy. Far from ending British exceptionalism, the disaster has been used to reinforce it. Suez can be framed as a unique aberration if it is blamed on what is erroneously held to have been a betrayal by the United States, and on the folly of one man, the physically and mentally exhausted Prime Minister Anthony Eden. That heads off more troubling questions about whether there were deeper problems with cabinet decision making, military advice, foreign policy, the political culture as a whole, and even the nation’s understanding of itself.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe historian Kim A.

Winston Churchill \u003ca href=\"http://lachlan.bluehaze.com.au/churchill/am-text.htm\"\u003edenounced\u003c/a\u003e that event—in which imperial forces fired on Indian civilians in an enclosed space, killing hundreds—as “without precedent or parallel in the modern history of the British Empire” and “absolutely foreign to the British way of doing things.” Churchill, who was a strong believer in empire, had not suddenly become a critic. As Wagner points out in his book \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Amritsar-1919-Empire-Making-Massacre/dp/0300250711/\"\u003eAmritsar 1919: An Empire of Fear and the Making of a Massacre\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e, Churchill’s speech “was, on the contrary, an elaborate act of deflection and a staunch attempt to reassert the moral legitimacy of the British Empire.” Just months later, Churchill was part of the cabinet that deployed the Black and Tans, temporary constables who gained a reputation for violence against civilians in Ireland.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2019/08/londons-falling-and-us-trade-deal-wont-save-it/595753/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: London’s falling, and a U.S. trade deal won’t save it\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eExceptionalism is again visible in what was by most metrics a far bigger disaster than Suez or Amritsar: the partition of India and Pakistan, which left between 1 and 2 million people dead, created 10 million to 20 million refugees, and established a hostile relationship between successor states that \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2019/08/indias-kashmir-democracy/595711/?utm_source=feed\"\u003ethreatens global security\u003c/a\u003e to this day.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe last British viceroy of India, Lord Mountbatten, has been blamed ever since for speeding Britain’s exit deadline up. What he achieved by that was to ensure that most of the fallout did not happen on Britain’s watch. Internationally, many newspapers reported Indian and Pakistani independence alongside photographs of Mountbatten and British officials applauding the raising of new flags. (Mountbatten had all British flags removed in advance, thus avoiding embarrassing images of newly independent peoples cheering them being pulled down.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eOnly in the days and weeks after partition did the shocking reports of death and destruction ramp up, and so British exceptionalism was able to remain unscathed. The British could sigh sadly at the appalling outcome, and murmur “après nous, le déluge.” The writer Pankaj Mishra has \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/opinion/sunday/brexit-ireland-empire.html\"\u003edescribed\u003c/a\u003e a “malign incompetence” common to Mountbatten and the Brexiteers. His point rings true, but the critique cannot be limited to a few individuals, or it risks again letting the system itself off the hook. Why do British politics, society, and culture produce such individuals, promote them, and reward them?

The conflict of emotions from what was pure joy turned to guilt and terror overnight. How could I love this baby the way I loved Emmy? Was it okay to love this baby the way I loved Emmy? It felt like by loving my son, I was trying to replace her. The fear of birthing my son and what that meant \u0026#8230;..a monumental step forward\u0026#8230;.proof that time continued without her when all I wanted was for time to stop.  But let me say this\u0026#8230;.I couldn\u0026rsquo;t have been more wrong.  Easton provided us an even closer bond to his sister. The moment I heard his cry, something sparked back alive in my soul. Hope. Love. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure. But in that moment, I knew I was Mom and my kids deserved the world from me. Everything was going to be okay. My joy and grief could coexist.  Now, I can actually say with joy and excitement that we are expecting identical twin boys. From the day I met my husband, he has always said he wanted identical twin boys born on his birthday. We are due on the lucky day/angel number of 11/11 which is not far off from @millerbode Birthday of 10/12. From the beginning of this pregnancy, we knew Emmy had her hands in this miracle somehow.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\"\u003eA post shared by \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/morganebeck/\"  style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e Morgan Miller\u003c/a\u003e (@morganebeck) on \u003ctime style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2019-08-12T12:28:35+00:00\"\u003eAug 12, 2019 at 5:28am PDT\u003c/time\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cscript async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe couple are also parents to a 10-month-old son, Easton and a 4-year-old son, Nash, while Bode is also a father to a 6-year-old, Samuel, and an 11-year-old daughter, Neesyn.

It\u0026rsquo;s quite possible \u0026mdash; probable even \u0026mdash; that by the time lawmakers returns to Washington on Sept. 9, their attention will have shifted elsewhere.

When more people are quitting than getting fired, that’s a sign of a healthy labor market. It means people are finding better-paying jobs, or feel confident that they will. And, sure enough, a record number of workers are quitting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"wJwZBa\"\u003eIn April, 3.5 million workers quit their jobs — the highest number ever recorded in a single month (check out the red line in the graph below).

But they do change how the federal government will enforce it. Here are two of the biggest changes. (Read the full new finalized rules \u003ca href=\"https://www.fws.gov/endangered/improving_ESA/regulation-revisions.html\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"iOTBtl\"\u003eThe new rules allow for greater leeway in protecting threatened species and open the door to industry to skirt protections \u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"a0v7YB\"\u003eCurrently, species that are listed as “threatened” are defined as “any species which is likely to become endangered within the foreseeable future.” (Threatened is a designation that’s less severe than “endangered.”) The new rules constrain what is meant by “foreseeable future” and give significant discretion in interpreting what that means.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"BkHr16\"\u003e“The Services will describe the foreseeable future on a case-by-case basis,” the new rule \u003ca href=\"https://www.fws.gov/endangered/esa-library/pdf/listing-and-designating-critical-habitat.pdf\"\u003estates\u003c/a\u003e. Discretion is not a problem per se, but as the Washington Post \u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/animalia/wp/2018/07/19/endangered-species-act-stripped-of-key-provisions-in-trump-administration-proposal/?utm_term=.a176bde096b0\"\u003eexplained\u003c/a\u003e last year, this could mean that in determining protections for plants and animals, regulators could ignore the far-flung effects of climate change that may occur several decades from now. Polar bears are threatened now, but they’ll be in even more peril in the future, when there’s less and less sea ice. There’s now more leeway for the government to determine if disappearing ice 40 years from now contributes to the threat Arctic animals face today. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"sPcLUQ\"\u003eThe second big change is more of a giveaway to industry. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"hORy3I\"\u003eUntil now, the agencies that enforce the ESA have had to base their decisions of whether to protect a species solely on scientific data, “without reference to possible economic or other impacts of such determination.”  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"3C6SeB\"\u003eThe new rule removes that phrase. “The Act does not prohibit the [government] from compiling economic information or presenting that information to the public,” the rule argues. It does clarify that it’s allowed to do so “as long as such information does not influence the listing determination.” (But that’s confusing: Why strike the phrase from the guidelines in that case?)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"lLCiz9\"\u003eThat change, conservation groups fear, opens the door to business interests coming into discussions of whether a species should be protected.

(Get ready for some bone-cracking dismemberment.) And after spending years as a writer, Berloff was ready to try her hand in the director’s chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"VptCEN\"\u003eI talked to Berloff by phone, two weeks ahead of the film’s release.

For a variety of reasons, I wanted a bigger challenge. I felt like I love screenwriting — I will always write, it’s how I approach story — but I was ready to tackle a bigger project. I was ready to try something on a bigger scale. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"9eWOhE\"\u003eBut really, the question was, how do you do that? We’re very good in our society about putting people in a lane and telling them to stay there. And I had a really lovely career as a screenwriter. Who was ever going to give me an opportunity to direct a giant studio movie? \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Er2t8X\"\u003eSo trying to figure out how to do it took a bunch of years, and it all just happened really organically. I wrote \u003cem\u003eThe Kitchen\u003c/em\u003e and felt really strongly that this was the one I wanted to “raise my hand” on, for a variety of reasons. I felt like I knew these characters inside and out, and I still had a lot more I wanted to say with the story that wasn’t necessarily on the page. I felt like, \u003cem\u003eGive me a shot to direct this, and I’ve got more to tell\u003c/em\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"n20Fe2\"\u003eI had a very longstanding relationship with the guys at New Line and Warner Brothers — I say guys because they’re all guys — and they trusted me and gave me this incredible opportunity.

New Line had sent me the comic book in February 2016, and I loved the story when I read it. I thought it provided an incredible opportunity to really explore what would it be like if women could take over a world. I was starting to feel really frustrated with my career, not sure that there’d be any opportunities to grow beyond where I was. So \u003cem\u003eThe Kitchen\u003c/em\u003e is a fantasy: What if I could play in that pond? What if I could take over the world? I thought that would be really appealing to many women. How would women run a world? How do they operate differently than men? Nobody’s going to give us the opportunity — we’re going to have to take it.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"uWvyKJ\"\u003eAll of that stuff started to feel exciting to me when I read the book, and I got really invested in these characters and just went to town with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"IAKO2f\"\u003eAlissa Wilkinson\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"mjSrln\"\u003eIt’s a morally complex story — it’s not obvious what we’re supposed to be thinking about these characters right off the bat, and they change a lot as the story unfolds. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"6b6DKR\"\u003eAndrea Berloff\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"nPQSiK\"\u003eI think we are not going to have arrived at the next \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/3/20/16955588/feminism-waves-explained-first-second-third-fourth\"\u003ewave of feminism\u003c/a\u003e until we can accept that women don’t have to be angels. Right? So I anticipate that it will be shocking to people that particularly these [actresses] who are so beloved by America are not playing angels in the movie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"U2Sb03\"\u003eI felt strongly that nobody’s an angel, men or women. Just because women take over an industry doesn’t mean they’re going to be perfect little people. They’re going to be complex and messy, just like men are. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"AZz5dl\"\u003eNow, that’s not to say they’re not complex and messy in a different way. But women have to be allowed to make mistakes. We have to be allowed to make a mistake and fail and get back up again. So I thought that showing imperfections, and maybe some bad decision-making along the way, felt a lot more real and a lot more interesting to me than showing a bunch of really good girls getting what they want, because I don’t think that’s realistic in any way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"rTQkYg\"\u003eAlissa Wilkinson\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"SVX9Hi\"\u003eTalking about feminism is interesting because this book and movie is set in the past — how did you approach that? \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"KcpBbU\"\u003eAndrea Berloff\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ROL3uV\"\u003eBeing able to look at the past allows you to examine contemporary issues that we’re dealing with in a more blunt way. We think we’re so much more evolved now, but really we’re still wrestling with the same racism, and classism, and poverty, and lack of opportunity for marginalized people that they were wrestling with in the 1970s. It was just much more blunt then. Looking at those issues allows us to look at today’s society through a different lens that maybe we can reflect upon ourselves. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"GrTpbh\"\u003eIn creating the look of the ’70s, I had an incredible team around me. It was really difficult. So [costume designer] Sarah Edwards and I sat down and looked at all of these clothes from the ’70s. Our guideposts became, “It has to be authentic ’70s clothes, but they have to be clothes that look cool to our eye today.” Some 1970s clothes don’t look cool anymore. And I didn’t want the women not looking cool. I wanted them to look great. So we sorted out what survived the ’70s and still looked great. \u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\"The Kitchen\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KJa64jPJ8doUEkNK0ZLothUc5DQ=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18956751/thekitchen2.jpg\"\u003e\n      \u003ccite\u003eAlison Cohen Rosa/Warner Bros.\u003c/cite\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003eThey definitely look cool.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"5amb9Z\"\u003eShane Valentino, production designer, found incredible locations and dressed them to make them look authentically ’70s. As you know, New York is largely not the same as it was back then, so we had to do a lot of work to make it look like the ’70s. There’s a lot of visual effects work in the movie. We had to take out buildings, then create new buildings and backdrops. So it was quite a bit of work. We were really determined to try to remind people what New York felt like [during that time period], how dirty the city was. We had all of this trash that we would cart all over the city.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"15Lgdw\"\u003eAlissa Wilkinson\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"9XYwoC\"\u003eEven now, Hell’s Kitchen still kind of has that vibe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"yu7n5R\"\u003eAndrea Berloff\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"iBTPSD\"\u003eYeah. Gritty and a little dirty. But it was really — obviously we pulled photos from the time — it was really dirty. It was shocking what was going on in the city, because the city was broke. They didn’t have the money to pick up the garbage, particularly in the poor areas. So in the wealthy areas, they would pick up the garbage, and in the poor areas, they just wouldn’t. We really felt like you can see that reflected in the movie, for example, when the ladies go to Brooklyn; it’s suddenly this nice, beautiful, clean neighborhood, which is a stark contrast to the world they live in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"v5qoSO\"\u003eAlissa Wilkinson\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"5RpVPD\"\u003eThis is a drama through and through, but two of the three stars, Melissa McCarthy and Tiffany Haddish, are known predominantly as comedians. That’s a bold choice to make — what led you to decide on that casting?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"9zrr3e\"\u003eAndrea Berloff\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"K72TO9\"\u003eOne of the only ways for a female-drive movie of this size to get attention is to be provocative, to give people a reason to talk about it. I’m not sure we’ve ever had a true mob movie centered on women, and putting people you would not expect in these roles was also provocative and interesting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"6bmRfg\"\u003eAs a first-time director, I decided I was going to take a big swing. If I did a little $5 million indie, that was very sweet and very well written, everybody would’ve said, “Good job,” and patted me on the back. And then what? How would I have gotten my opportunity to go direct a big studio movie? If you’re going to go for it in life, you’ve gotta \u003cem\u003ego\u003c/em\u003e for it. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Nz1qUX\"\u003eThese women wanted this opportunity, and they knocked it out of the park. I think Melissa and Tiffany absolutely killed it in their performances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"RQcb3z\"\u003eEverybody knew Elisabeth would be amazing, because she’s an amazing dramatic actress, but Melissa and Tiffany wanted the opportunity. We were excited to give it to them, and we also had faith that they are incredibly talented. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"F8d8hx\"\u003eAnd that’s what gives people a reason to go to the theater. If you’ve never seen your favorite actresses do this kind of thing before, that’s a reason to go out that night. Get some girlfriends, go to the theater, and have a good time. It’s really hard to get people to go to the movies anymore. You’ve got to give them a reason. You’ve got to make an event out of it. And we felt like casting them would give the movie some reason for being.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"PnwygJ\"\u003eAlissa Wilkinson\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"6g4hSW\"\u003eStudio movies tend to play it really safe, trying to hit as wide an audience as possible.

That was something that made the production run really smoothly. It allowed all of us from top to bottom to do our best work. I would take [this experience] with me to future movies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"gpm0j2\"\u003eAlissa Wilkinson\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Zi3qMK\"\u003eThere’s so much talk about diversity in the film industry, and about what it will take to get studios to let women take those big risks and helm big movies and keep trying, even if they sometimes fail.

I don’t think this is an easy industry to break into, male or female. You have to really put yourself out there, and say, “This is my voice and this is who I am,” in a really bold way. I think people respond to boldness and people respond to originality. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Gff5VG\"\u003eEvery time somebody asks me, “How do I start screenwriting, what should I do?” I say the most important thing to do is to not read any of the screenwriting books.

To an extent in the modern world, that means access to global markets — grain can be shipped to Europe and timber to Japan. But for most people, it means direct access to other people, who serve as customers and co-workers and suppliers. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"fblDjA\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://voxeu.org/article/why-denser-areas-are-more-productive\"\u003eLionel Fontagné and Gianluca Santoni\u003c/a\u003e find that heavily populated areas offer higher labor productivity and higher pay because “denser commuting zones seem to offer a better match between employers and employees.” The more people there are around, the more different kinds of businesses you can have and the more finely specialized they can be, meaning it’s more likely that any given person will be well-suited to work at someplace or other that’s in town. This is in some ways most obvious at the routine retail level — big cities have specialty shops and very focused restaurants rather than general stores and generic diners — but research by Jason Abel, Ishita Dey, and Todd Gabe finds that the positive impact on density on productivity is \u003ca href=\"http://www.citylab.com/work/2012/12/why-denser-cities-are-smarter-and-more-productive/4049/\"\u003eespecially true in knowledge-intensive industries\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"bKdRpd\"\u003eThose findings are not immigration-specific, but the beginning of wisdom on immigration policy is that immigrants are people. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"X4fTOT\"\u003eAnd, indeed, when you take the \u003cem\u003eforeigner\u003c/em\u003e element out of it, most people correctly grasp that depopulation is not an economic growth strategy.

Unauthorized workers receive few if any public services (they ride the bus, but they’re ineligible for social assistance programs) but contribute to the tax base. Indeed, since people living and working in the United States illegally are often paying Social Security taxes without collecting benefits, they are in some ways the great heroes of the US Treasury. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"SiHUtE\"\u003eFor the immigrant population at large, the best research on the fiscal impact of immigration comes from the \u003ca href=\"http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=23550\"\u003eNational Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine\u003c/a\u003e, which concluded that over the course of a 75-year time horizon, “the fiscal impacts of immigrants are generally positive at the federal level and generally negative at the state and local level.” Immigrants, in other words, pay more to the federal government in taxes than they receive in benefits, while the reverse is true for state and local governments. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"eBUmHZ\"\u003eThis adverse impact on state and local governments is important, and derives largely from the fact that immigrants have kids who end up needing to go to school.

Immigrants contribute to both goals, directly through their presence in the country and indirectly by raising children. Indeed, it’s striking that even an immigration skeptic like George Borjas concedes that \u003ca href=\"http://www.vox.com/2015/8/17/9164725/immigration-and-wages-impact\"\u003eimmigrants grow the economy\u003c/a\u003e and do not personally obtain 100 percent of the benefits of that growth — meaning their presence increases the overall level of resources available to the native population. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"2s3wjr\"\u003eImmigrants commit crimes at a lower rate\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"EZ9jIk\"\u003eImmigrants may build American prosperity, but there’s more to life than economics. For Trump, the central mode of anti-immigrant rhetoric has always been a more visceral fear of violence, from his initial warning of an incoming flood of Mexican rapists to the various efforts to limit Muslims’ ability to travel to the United States.

Something much milder, like making employers of foreign-born workers pay an extra payroll tax, with the money used to plug the Social Security funding gap or subsidize low-paid workers’ wages, would leave absolutely everyone better off. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"rSE1RC\"\u003eThe benefits to immigrants are also relevant because the economy is not a fixed pie.

Growing exports of American manufactured goods has become an obsession, but increasing domestic sales has the exact same benefits.

It’s true, of course, that an America that continues to be open to immigrants will be a progressively less white and less Christian country over time.

For instance, one business journal urges women to \u003ca href=\"https://www.bizjournals.com/birmingham/news/2014/09/18/how-women-can-use-golf-to-succeed-in-corporate.html\"\u003e“get in the game”\u003c/a\u003e by golfing with male coworkers, while a careers website proclaims that \u003ca href=\"https://www.themuse.com/advice/7-ways-to-excel-in-a-maledominated-workplace\"\u003e“beer is for bonding,”\u003c/a\u003e advising women to socialize with male peers over drinks. Engaging in the same networking activities as men, the logic seems to go, will increase women’s exposure to work opportunities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut a new study suggests this advice isn’t quite right. While it’s true that highly connected women tend to land better jobs, the most successful women also have something they cannot get through “beers with the boys”: close ties with female peers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe researchers came to this conclusion by analyzing social-network and job-placement data for graduates of an MBA program. They found an important gender difference: for men, the most significant factor affecting job status after graduation was how “central” they were in their networks—that is, how many highly connected people they have relationships with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuccessful women also tended to be more central, but that alone was not enough to land them a top job. The most successful women often had a tight-knit circle of female colleagues as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe reason for this difference may come down to the types of information that men versus women need to succeed. Presumably, having numerous connections provides ready access to what the researchers call “public information,” such as which companies are hiring and which types of candidates they’re seeking. For men, that alone may be enough to land a good job. “Men really need a network that’s going to maximize their access and exposure to market information,” says study coauthor Brian Uzzi, a professor of management and organizations at Kellogg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWomen, however, “need the same thing men need and one thing more,” Uzzi says. Specifically, women need “private information,” which may include insider tips about a company’s leadership culture and politics, or hints about how to make an impression in a male-dominated industry, for example.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cspan class=\"pull-quote\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"quote-line\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“Men really need a network that’s going to maximize their access and exposure to market information,” says Uzzi.

Furthermore, only fellow women can provide the sensitive, gender-specific information that will be useful in a career context—hence the benefit of having connections who are both close and are women.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there is a caveat, the researchers warn: if the contacts in a woman’s network do not have sufficiently diverse networks of their own, she may find herself in an echo chamber, hurting her chances of success.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eIdentical resumes, but very different networks\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUzzi and his coauthors, Kellogg research assistant professor Yang Yang and Nitesh Chawla of the University of Notre Dame, wanted to know how, exactly, social networks influence career trajectories, especially for individuals pursuing leadership roles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter all, most graduates of MBA programs are highly qualified, with similar test scores, GPAs, and work experience, Uzzi says. “The men and women should look fairly indistinguishable on paper.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the researchers suspected that the connections students form in school would not be so identical.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey knew that many connections between students were weak, “arm’s-length” links: these students wouldn’t exchange deeply personal information, but they might chat about job opportunities and typical salaries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther connections, however, were stronger, “embedded” relationships. These exist between close friends who share sensitive, subjective information, such as details about what it’s like to work at a particular firm, or (for women) tips for getting ahead in a male-dominated industry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUzzi and colleagues wanted to know how different kinds of relationships influenced career success, and whether the answer varied for men and women.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo investigate, the team obtained anonymized data on alumni who graduated from a top MBA program in 2006 and 2007. The data included the students’ entrance test scores, undergraduate major, GPA, work experience, nationality, and gender, as well as each person’s starting salary upon graduation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe researchers normalized salaries by region and industry, then used the salaries to assign each job a ranking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUzzi’s team also obtained anonymized information on more than 4.5 million emails sent between the students during their time in the program. The researchers could not read the messages, but they could see which students were communicating with one another and when.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe researchers used an algorithm to determine who was in a student’s social network based on their emails. They then classified each student-to-student relationship as strong or weak based on a number of characteristics gleaned from the emails. For instance, if two people communicated more than would be expected by chance, regularly exchanged emails on weekends, and replied to each other quickly, they probably had a strong tie. Meanwhile, a pair that emailed less frequently likely had a weak connection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cspan class=\"pull-quote\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"quote-line\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“Women who have networks that resemble those of high-placing men are low-placing.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"quote-line\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe team also measured how central each person was in their network. Uzzi notes that in this study, centrality does not mean the number of contacts a person has, but rather the number of highly connected individuals they communicate with. The distinction is important, he says, because a person with relatively few contacts can still be highly central if their contacts have lots of connections. “Even a small network can provide a wide reach,” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, the researchers counted how many strong and weak bonds each graduate had, and the gender breakdown of their network. Using statistical techniques, the researchers then analyzed which factors most affected the graduates’ job rankings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eBusiness networking for women versus men\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe students’ on-paper qualifications, such as test scores and work experience, did not seem to influence job placement, probably because the candidates were already very close on these measures. “It’s like if you had a basketball team where everybody was 6’5” or 6’7” or 6’6”,” Uzzi explains. “Height is probably not going to be the thing that determines which one of them is the best player.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut sizeable differences emerged when the researchers examined social networks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmong men, the most successful graduates were more central: men in the top quartile of centrality achieved a job rank 1.5 times higher than men in the bottom quartile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat is significant, Uzzi says, especially considering that the pay level for someone’s first job after graduation will likely carry forward to future positions. Throughout their career, the higher salary “just compounds over and over and over again,” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNotably, the men’s connections did not have to be strong to be effective. If they had many weak ties to people with many weak connections, they still performed well. Furthermore, the gender composition of men’s networks did not affect their placement levels. “What men need to do well in job placement is just get ‘public’ information,” which anyone can provide, Uzzi says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eHow to network successfully\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCentrality also mattered for women. Yet having a robust network still wasn’t enough to bring women’s job rankings up to the level of men. “Women who have networks that resemble those of high-placing men are low-placing,” even when their qualifications are stellar, the authors write.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, a different social characteristic did go hand in hand with success.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbout three-quarters of the highest-ranking women emailed constantly with a few other women. And, when combined with a well-developed network, these close friends offered a large career boost: women with both high centrality and close ties with female peers had an average job ranking 2.5 times higher than women whose networks lacked those two features.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cspan class=\"pull-quote\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"quote-line\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“You need that private information to understand how to negotiate within a world where you’re being held to different standards.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"quote-line\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUzzi speculates that a male-heavy network may not be especially helpful because only women are likely to share the kinds of private information that female candidates need. For instance, since recruiters sometimes assume women aren’t as committed as men, a female friend might suggest questions to ask during an interview to demonstrate serious interest in a position. A male friend—even a well-connected one—may not think to offer that kind of advice, since he has never faced that obstacle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You need that private information to understand how to negotiate within a world where you’re being held to different standards,” Uzzi says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThe value of a diverse network\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUzzi was a bit surprised by the results. After all, having a close circle of friends could have meant that women were living in an echo chamber, cut off from important insights. Closer analysis revealed why that was not the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe most successful women had close friends who tended to be connected to many different groups of people, and who could therefore provide new information. If a woman’s inner circle had mainly redundant connections, she did not perform as well—perhaps because she was more likely to get the same perspective repeatedly, “which could create a lot of blind spots,” Uzzi says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe researchers point out several caveats to their findings. Since they did not read actual emails for privacy reasons, they had to make assumptions about the types of information peers provided. Thus, they can’t say for sure that strong and weak connections provided private and public information, respectively. And more research is needed to see if the results hold true in a range of other contexts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, the results are more than correlations, which strongly suggest that “social networks matter in job placement,” he says. “And they matter differently for men and women.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnderstanding the effects of social networks is particularly important in the age of LinkedIn and Facebook, when people are paying more attention than ever to their connections. “You may find that more and more women are trying to emulate men’s networks, which, according to our findings, doesn’t really help women,” Uzzi says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis article was previously published in \u003ca href=\"https://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/successful-networking-men-women\"\u003eKellogg Insight\u003c/a\u003e.

This is in addition to having systems that while in theory are meant to be supportive to female leadership, in reality make the playing field extremely uneven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKenyan politics is a rough game and \u003ca href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/08/07/kenyas-female-politicians-just-fought-the-one-of-the-most-violent-campaign-in-history-election/\"\u003eespecially so for women\u003c/a\u003e.

For most species, only about 2% of hatchlings reach adulthood, according to Elise Bennet, an attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, a San Francisco-based nonprofit that seeks to protect endangered species through legal action.

It offers parents three subscription tiers meant for kids ages two through 10. They can sign up to get four pairs of sneakers a year for $20 a month, six pairs for $30 a month, or 12 pairs for $50 a month. Parents are able to change their level at any time, and the kids will get about 100 different sneaker styles to choose from in sizes 4c-7Y.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat may seem like \u003cem\u003ea lot\u003c/em\u003e of sneakers to be buying a child.

After age two, kids\u0026#8217; feet generally aren\u0026#8217;t growing fast enough to warrant four or more new pairs of shoes a year, and as for wear and tear, Bass tells patients who are avid runners and athletes they need two to three pairs of new shoes a year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCobban says they developed the tiers through testing. Originally they thought one plan for up to four pairs a year would be sufficient, but while running their \u0026#8220;burner brand,\u0026#8221; as he calls it, they found parents wanted options with more shoes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;Generally what we see in the acquisition behavior is people come in on the $20-a-month plan, but over the course of a few months after they join, they upgrade,\u0026#8221; he says.

Adventure Club lets it do just that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo how was Nike able to run the program for so long without parents realizing it was a Nike business? For one thing, it offered shoes by Nike and Converse, and many people still don\u0026#8217;t associate the two as being the same company, Cobban says, even though Nike has owned Converse since 2003. Easy Kicks also advertised that it was working \u0026#8220;in partnership\u0026#8221; with Nike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNike had recently \u003ca href=\"https://footwearnews.com/2018/shop/sneakers-deals/easykicks-subscription-service-nike-kids-sneakers-515915/\"\u003estarted to acknowledge\u003c/a\u003e that it was backing the business, but Cobban explains that it waited to reveal its full engagement because it wanted to know if there was a need and market for the service regardless of Nike\u0026#8217;s involvement. It also wasn\u0026#8217;t sure what the final version would look like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe 10,000 members it signed up as Easy Kicks answered the first question.

These are artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, big data analytics, cloud computing, cybersecurity, internet of things (IoT), mobile tech, robotic process automation (RPA), virtual reality (VR), and 3D Printing. There will be different roles in each of these jobs, and each role will require different technology and professional skillset.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow essential is upskilling and reskilling?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#8217;s a success imperative. Emerging technologies are going to displace around 70 million jobs, according to the World Economic Forum. But they are also going to create 133 new ones. Today, the world does not have the skill required for this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, whenever I talk to any government—and I was in the US just last week—the biggest discussion on the table is talent shortage. The good thing is India\u0026#8217;s being extremely proactive in identifying the problem and the way forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe 10 technologies we have identified are creating around 55 new job roles, and for each of those, there are different skill pathways. Today it\u0026#8217;s not just about skill sets because if you want to become a data analyst, it\u0026#8217;s not just about learning data sciences or AI, it\u0026#8217;s also about learning a bit of communication, project management, and design thinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe have to move from STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) to STEAM, wherein A stands for arts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat does this shift mean for mid-career employees?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose working in IT are beginning to understand that technology is not going to take all the chores.

So why can\u0026#8217;t you do away with all the doctors and just have AI do the analysis? The answer is that you need a human touch for the conversation with patients. You cannot have a machine saying, \u0026#8220;We have crunched your data, you have a tumour and you are going to die in 30 days.\u0026#8221; This is where you need someone to hold your hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, we have to learn how to co-exist with technology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIs the regulatory environment, such as protectionism around H-1B visas in the US, pushing the Indian IT industry towards reskilling?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIndian companies make for just 12% of the H-1B. The major recipients are American ones. Today, Indian IT firms are hiring in the US at a faster rate than the industry average. We create over 500,000 jobs there. The biggest problem—and the reason I go to the US often—is the shortage of talent. The US has a major skill deficit and the government accepts it. So most of my discussions with the US government are about how do we start a skilling initiative in the country to build up a talent pipeline there. And it\u0026#8217;s not just the US, we are having the same discussions in the UK, and in all other large countries where our companies are present.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDo you feel educational institutions in India have caught up with emerging technology trends?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, and they will never because technology is changing very fast. What we need colleges and universities to do is to build foundational skills. For instance, can the kid collaborate, do they understand problem-solving, are they quick learners, are they willing to work, do they have a strong foundation in math, science, and the liberal arts? These are the kids that will have a premium.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, even then, once we hire, we will have to train these candidates and that\u0026#8217;s the new norm of doing business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIndians have always longed for US jobs. Does the current regulatory environment require them to realign their ambitions?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday\u0026#8217;s youth is very clever. They are looking at the technologies or skills that matter. They then decide what they want to become. There is such a severe talent shortage across the world that if you develop the right talent, you\u0026#8217;ll have a job. That\u0026#8217;s the mindset change we need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe media is much more worried about H-1B than we are. If the US cuts H-1B visas, it impacts their own companies more.\u003cspan class=\"pull-quote\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"quote-line\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eToday, Bhavish Aggarwal is a role model for young Indians, not Satya Nadella.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"quote-line\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI honestly feel youngsters are way wiser than we give them credit for. When we go to colleges today—and I am not talking only about the IITs—most students there want to become entrepreneurs. The job aspiration level is changing and now it\u0026#8217;s not about joining a company. Role models are changing. They are Ritesh (OYO founder Ritesh Agarwal) and Bhavish (Ola founder Bhavish Aggarwal) and all, unlike our times when it used to be Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, etc. Today, it\u0026#8217;s not even Satya Nadella. In fact, there was a time when people wanted one job-one company, now they don\u0026#8217;t even want a job.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo you mean the protectionist environment in the US has not affected the Indian IT industry at all?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026#8217;s a lot of rhetoric, none of it has become law as yet. The increased scrutiny is cumbersome. But a majority of our workforce is moving towards the US. The bigger worry is not H-1B but local talent availability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut do we like the rhetoric and the constant change in rhetoric? No, we don\u0026#8217;t.

That\u0026#8217;s how the world is seeing them and it\u0026#8217;s time we started giving them that respect. IDC recently came out with a ranking of the top companies in the world on AI capabilities and portfolios, and two of the top three were Indian firms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday, we are pretty much digitising our customers\u0026#8217; businesses. Indian IT companies have seen a huge spike in digital revenue. And there is no finishing goal in digital transformation. There is no endpoint. So they have to revamp every single day, just as everybody else does. The right question is can they revamp faster than the need?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAre they revamping faster than clients\u0026#8217; needs?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe race is on.

There is no certainty right now on whether there is going to be a central one-point leader or there will be a distributed leadership.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe one quality that would be essential will be being humane. Words like empathy and authenticity were just fashionable earlier, but today, these are proving to be the differentiators because leadership is going to constantly be about change and change management. Future leaders will never be able to sit back and say, \u0026#8220;Okay, I have achieved my goal,\u0026#8221; because there is no goal post. It\u0026#8217;s about constantly managing change. It\u0026#8217;s about motivating people to keep up with change.

We made plans to have lunch the next day. A sketchy old man came riding down the alley across the street on a bicycle. My dad said he had to talk to the old guy about supplies for the job.

It would be the first of many stories we exchanged that afternoon. I told him about a friend of mine getting busted for having two pounds of weed and it inspired him.

He described driving around without a license because when he was a kid the fine was only $25; accidentally taking weed over the border and getting tossed in jail; hanging out with car thieves and mobster sons; getting into huge brawls on the beach; skinny-dipping and flirting with housewives on job sites.

It was the most fun I could remember having with him. The conversation flowed. We talked politics, and as he complained bitterly about how rough it is for the working poor and about Donald Trump being a Nazi, I was reminded of where many of my beliefs came from (and was super relieved that he had no access to Facebook).\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIt was fun and easy because he was finally honest with me, not only about his past but about his addiction. It's not like there would be any way to hide it. My dad is truly a solid denizen of my hometown's underbelly.

He currently resides in a motel that's \u003ci\u003e The Florida Project \u003c/i\u003ebut with less cute kids and more electric wheelchairs. He did bizarre cokehead moves. He had to cash a check so we stopped at the bank. He grabbed a free mint and then immediately smashed it on the ground. \"I don't like to eat the whole mint at once,\" he nonchalantly explained to me. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eNone of this shocked or embarrassed me because he seemed comfortable in this life. He talked openly about this \"coke thing\" that he had, not to brag or excuse his actions, but to simply state reality. After spending a lifetime in the shadows of his mysteries and disappointments, constantly wondering why he did the things he did, I got to see the person I had spent a childhood chasing. It was the first time I wasn't held a silent hostage by the hopes for the man I wanted him to be or the lies of the man he pretended to be. It was him—strange and heartbreaking, but him. It was freeing for me. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eNot that it was painless. He complained constantly about not being able to feel his toes and having a constant pain in his swollen stomach. When I implored him to see a doctor, he dismissed the suggestion, telling me, \"I've had a good run.\" \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI realized his honesty came from his sense of fatality. He's committed to his drugs, and letting them kill him. He doesn't want to get better because what kind of life is waiting for him on the other side? He's old as fuck and torn every relationship in his life asunder. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWe have these big myths of addiction and sobriety, that getting clean is always a brand new start, that it's all it takes. Sometimes all it does it let you have clear-eyed view of how badly you fucked everything up and how there's nowhere else to go. If he doesn't want to see that, I can't really blame him. I'm sure I wouldn't, either.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"article__media\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1565627705479-meanddad2.jpeg\" alt=\"My dad and me.

He wished my mom wasn't still mad at him. Most of all, he said he hated how the people closest to him could only see his addiction, that it outweighed everything else that he's done in his life. Now, admittedly, getting pity is every addict's superpower. But I couldn't help but think how I had avoided the hard work of reaching out and looking at him and justified it by cordoning him off as an addict, a failure.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI thought about the people I do that to constantly, those who I walk by in my day to day and brush off as I go from fancy patio to fancier patio. There was sadness in my dad's life but there was also community, a warmth that occurs when you're down at the bottom and forgotten about by everyone except those down there with you.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMaybe this is what forgiveness looks like. It's not an explosion of sobbing catharsis or a deathbed confession; It's an appraisal, an honest reckoning about what you've lost but also what you have. My dad's life is tragic but I also saw some beauty in it. He's lived outside the boundaries of respectable society his entire life, making the moneyed and mannered uncomfortable whether as a teenage miscreant or a senior citizen dirtbag. He did it by living according to his own code. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhile we were hanging out, I watched him open numerous doors for people; we helped women unload boxes of diapers in a daycare center; he complained about young addicts he knew who never wanted to work for their cash. He was funny, opinionated, hypocritical, charming, strange, and loving. He was my father and I'm so glad that, thanks to a simple twist of fate, I got a chance to finally meet him.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWe made plans to have lunch again two days later.

That’s the overworld, anyway (so far! I’m about two thirds in as of this writing), since your main character, Nova, frequently shrinks down and enters 2D Zelda-style dungeons whenever she encounters a person that needs, well, cleaning. It’s a little bit like \u003ci\u003e Psychonauts\u003c/i\u003e in terms of its structure: Each dungeon represents a person who has been overcome by nano dust, a pretty easy metaphor for decay and disease, and you were born to clean it, to solve problems, to care about the world around you.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e So, we have three easily identifiable elements here, the 2D Zelda-style gameplay, which has you exploring, solving puzzles, and combating creatures in tightly designed \u003ci\u003e Link’s Awakening\u003c/i\u003e style stages. That’s very much the original \u003ci\u003e Anodyne\u003c/i\u003e. Then we have the more experimental, 32-bit 3D environments, very much in the style of Han Tani’s \u003ca href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/pampqg/all-our-asias-ps1-sean-han-tani\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e All Our Asias\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e last year, which used that early 3D aesthetic to tell a deeply personal story about the Asian-American experience, framed as an exploration of a dying man’s memories. We also have this interplay between retro gameplay and a whimsical, fiercely humanist story: Nova is here to help other people. She is frequently chatted up by her handlers/mommies (C-Psalmist and Palisade), who tell her to take breaks and even physically cradle her when the world gets to be too much. In this way, the game is reminiscent of my 2016 game of the year, \u003ci\u003e Even the Ocean\u003c/i\u003e, where Aliph, a rad nonbinary character, was tasked with helping to clean up pollution elements in communities around a whimsical world, balancing 2D platforming with a more freeform overworld.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"article__media\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1565633679118-anodyne_2_pastel_horizon.jpeg\" alt=\"Anodyne 2 Pastel Horizon\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"article__image-caption\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e \u003cp\u003e I’m enjoying my time with \u003ci\u003e Anodyne 2\u003c/i\u003e, particularly it’s dreamy tone and big, surreal world dotted with pint-sized dungeons, a little like a super-indie (two people made it) \u003ci\u003e Breath of the Wild\u003c/i\u003e. It’s an impressively-sized overworld, with varied terrain types: a gorgeous seashore, an other-wordly desert, a weird blue forest, etc, with secret items and characters and little quests. I adore the Saturn aesthetic and the talent this team has for building games that feel good to play and connect emotionally. This game—like Analgesic’s previous work—cares about the human condition and the strange ways we relate to one another, to the point of radical earnestness. Best of all, it does this through through inventive tweaks to \u003ci\u003e Link to the Past\u003c/i\u003e’s 2D dungeon formula.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e In one sequence, I found a creature named Geof—a sort of Rock-dude—digging at the bottom of a massive tower. Once I entered his mind/body construct and started playing in the 2D plane, his dungeon offered dual presentations of a once prosperous farming town that started to get choked on the nano dust. Geof was the mayor, and he took it upon himself to dig the rot away, but he ignored the pleas of his family and friends to just abandon the place and start somewhere new. I played in the tower as it stands now, a sort of dusty graveyard, and how it looked in the past, with lush vines and flowers and happier music, with increasingly dire messages from the people within. This takes place largely in the 2D world, with some short jumping puzzles in 3D that showcase the sheer height of the structure in the world.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e In another, I explored the mind of a scientist robot, where most of the puzzles involved split-screen affairs with my character on one side and a doppleganger on the other, and I had to guide both through various obstacles and puzzles to get to the core and clean up the dust. In still another, I encountered a gorgeous sunset-hued 2D city tower, where I was tasked with making fashion choices for residents, running up and down stairs to collect “orders” and put together cute outfits, using my dust-cleaner to subvert the usual combat mechanics I used in other dungeons.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"article__media\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1565633903906-anodyne_2_early_2d.jpeg\" alt=\"Anodyne 2 Yolk of Yummy\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"article__image-caption\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e \u003cp\u003e Every stage has that sort of twist on tone or mechanics to suit the interior life of its host character. At its heart, \u003ci\u003e Anodyne 2\u003c/i\u003e is about understanding and helping others, even though there’s some ambiguity about the nature of the mysterious “center” that you come from. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e I personally enjoy the mixture of 3D exploration and 2D spelunking, but there’s also a danger of incongruity that none of the team’s previous games have had to contend with. I think that some folks will have a favorite mode, and that’s likely to be the dungeons. I love the 3D world and lo-fi aesthetic, and it gets much bigger and more impressive as the game goes on, but the opening city environment wasn’t my favorite. It looks simplistic in a way that was less appealing than the later environments, and given the impressive 2D tower/city stage I encountered later, I know this team can do cities well. The chunky, blocky aesthetic simply works better when it’s used to evoke massive spaces that are a pleasure to get lost in and lose time to.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e But there’s a certain joy in enjoying both modes side by side, the tightness of the puzzle boxes next to the floatiness and abstraction of the 3D spaces, which evoke both the 3D platformers of the 32-and-64-bit era as well as much less cheery work, such as the haunting landscapes of Conor Sherlock and \u003ca href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/yw7g4v/kitty-horrorshow-castle-wormclot\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eKitty Horrorshow\u003c/a\u003e’s works. There’s a push and pull here that is aesthetically interesting and fairly bold, especially as the game goes on, as the world opens up and limits and boundaries start to crack and fade a bit more. Like the first \u003ci\u003e Anodyne\u003c/i\u003e, this game’s imagination and range is impressive, as is its creative use of space and place.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"article__media\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1565633707359-RingGolem.png\" alt=\"Anodyne 2 Blue Skies\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"article__image-caption\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e \u003cp\u003eI’m not done with \u003ci\u003e Anodyne 2\u003c/i\u003e.

In the past, when a new species was designated as “threatened,” they were automatically given the same protections as endangered species, including penalties for killing or harming individuals or destroying their critical habitat.

I also put on a 'cosmopolitan' or 'international school' accent.” At Jyoti’s “straight” job in tech they’re read as “cute, young and enthusiastic”, whereas in queer spaces, especially white, queer spaces where Jyoti calls out racism, they’re read as “intimidating to the point of being dangerous. In straight spaces, nobody's scared of me the way they are in queer spaces, but in both, I generally get read as a bit sexless,” they continued. “Queers read me as prudish or uninterested by way of my blunted, autistic affect; straight scenes tend to read me as innocent. I swear like a sailor, and that bursts both bubbles a little, but people are often very surprised to learn that I'm a sex worker.”\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e Many of my sources told me that they feel they can’t present as openly queer or trans at work or around certain family members, so they code switch in these environments. Teo, a 28-year-old PhD student in North Carolina, said that they code switch in male-dominated spaces like the auto shop or hardware store for safety. “I'm \u003ca href=\"https://www.glbtrt.ala.org/news/archives/2845\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAMAB\u003c/a\u003e non-binary/genderqueer, and I do a lot of femme presentation things like having painted nails, short shorts, and ‘women's’ tank tops,” they explained, telling me that when they run errands in male-dominated spaces they “usually present significantly more masculine” by hiding their painted nails and tucking their long hair under a baseball hat. “The way I carry myself changes, too,” they continued. “I have a more naturally effeminate body comportment that I straighten out in those spaces.” \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e For the sources I spoke to, the point of making these adjustments is avoiding hate-fueled violence, \u003ca href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/qv7jvx/snapchats-gender-swapping-photo-filters-can-result-in-real-transphobia\" target=\"_blank\"\u003edysphoria-inducing\u003c/a\u003e misgendering, rudeness, hostility, and even just awkwardness. “I don't trust the kind of people I may run into here: I'm a \u003ca href=\"https://lgbtq.arizona.edu/sites/lgbtq.arizona.edu/files/Resource_Guide-QTPOC.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eQTPOC\u003c/a\u003e and I’m worried that someone might attack me,” Teo explained. “Even getting yelled at would not be great—I wouldn't really know how to handle it.” \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e Matt, a 33-year-old non-binary artist based in New York City, feels similarly, telling me they hide everything they do to present as queer in certain intolerant environments: “I do whatever I can to avoid confrontation, weird looks, or basically anything uncomfortable happening.” Since coming out two years ago, Matt’s been surprised by how hard it can be to know when code switching is necessary. “Family members I thought were going to be weird have been very cool, and some I figured would be great have been \u003ci\u003e weird\u003c/i\u003e,” they explained. “It forces me to be making calculations constantly, which stinks.” They said the hyper-awareness one needs to move through the world as a non-binary person can be exhausting. “I do \u003ci\u003e not\u003c/i\u003e have the fortitude to explain non-binary gender to my goddamned widowed grandma,” they continued. “It really screws me up and erodes my confidence and sense of worth, often for days afterwards, because what am I, some kind of coward? Am I betraying \u003ci\u003e the cause\u003c/i\u003e somehow?” \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e Aubrey made a similar comment about how draining code switching can be. “Switching to more masculine speech and mannerisms wears me out,” she said. “There's a threshold of how much I can do it per day before my job performance and cheeriness starts to plummet.”\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e Despite this toll, code switching can include moments of tenderness and solidarity. “Maybe it's because I was a theater kid in school, but chatting 'full femme' with my few queer coworkers only to snap immediately to employee mode for a customer is almost nice,” Aubrey mused. “It's a performance that I have at least some control over, so I guess there's a sense of agency about it.”\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e Mitch, a 25-year-old retail manager based in Canada, concurred. “When people I don't know give signals of queerness, like using the word 'partner' or wearing certain clothing styles, I give signals back, like explicitly mentioning my girlfriend,” they said. “I do this to let them know they’re in a safe space, and that I’m a safe person.”\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e While these moments of tenderness and solidarity are heartwarming, they illustrate an uncomfortable reality for LGBTQ people, which is that most spaces entail a risk of violence, hostility and misunderstanding for them—and again, for Black trans women in particular, the risk of death. For LGBTQ people, especially QTPOC, code switching is constant, background labor that is often invisible to heterosexual, cis folk, and the pockets of safety carved out by people like Mitch are all-too-rare refuges from the struggle to blend in. \u003c/p\u003e","url":"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/evj47w/the-exhausting-work-of-lgbtq-code-switching","published":"2019-08-12T17:00:00Z","guid":"evj47w"},{"title":"Foster the People Is Peddling a Conspiracy Theory About Jeffrey Epstein's Death","content":"\u003cp\u003eAs you have surely heard by now, Jeffrey Epstein was \u003ca href=\"https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/wjwq7y/jeffrey-epstein-died-by-suicide-at-his-manhattan-jail-reports-say\" target=\"_blank\"\u003efound dead\u003c/a\u003e in his jail cell early Saturday morning, while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.

Part of this concern stems from how \u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/ubers-bare-knuckle-battle-against-the-taxi-industry/2015/07/27/e0e7be98-3483-11e5-8e66-07b4603ec92a_story.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eUber steamrolled Mayor Bill de Blasio\u003c/a\u003e in a 2015 battle over similar problems. The mayor’s attempt to curtail Uber's expansion was met by fierce opposition as the company organized drivers and lobbyists to fight the mayor. The city’s subsequent hesitation to challenge Uber was overcome only after \u003ca href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/why-are-new-york-taxi-drivers-committing-suicide/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003edriver protests and a string of driver suicides\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe vehicle cap was the first of its kind passed by a major American city, and also came with the first pay floor introduced to \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/02/nyregion/uber-drivers-pay-nyc.html?module=inline\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eguarantee a livable wage for drivers\u003c/a\u003e. At the time, full-time drivers were paid so little that 40 percent qualified for Medicaid and 18 percent for food stamps. The new pay standard aimed to increase pay by $9,600 annually, while the vehicle cap sought to increase driver utilization rates (total time spent driving with a passenger). \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhen the vehicle cap and pay floor were first passed in 2018, de Blasio took to Twitter and made clear that the rules were fighting \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/nycmayor/status/1027289516145557505?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\"a crisis that is driving working New Yorkers into poverty and our streets into gridlock.\"\u003c/a\u003e In the same tweet thread, he added, \"more than 100,000 workers and their families will see an immediate benefit from this legislation. And this action will stop the influx of cars contributing to congestion grinding our streets to a halt.\" The argument went that each rule would be ineffective without the other: pay increases would disappear if for-hire-vehicle registration grew unchecked, while a vehicle license freeze would give City Council one year to investigate how best to protect those gains and further reduce congestion. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOn the question of the 2018 pay floor, driver groups were in agreement. The Independent Drivers Guild (IDG), an app-driver labor group, raised concerns that the proposals “underestimated driver costs, namely in vehicle renting costs and benefits.” In December, the TLC introduced \u003ca href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90275936/inside-new-yorks-plan-to-guarantee-lyft-and-uber-drivers-a-minimum-wage\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ea new pay structure\u003c/a\u003e built on the August pay rules standard that incorporated those concerns by tying driver pay to utilization rates (how much time was spent riding with a passenger). Pay would now account for \"deadhead\" trips (empty and lengthy trips between pickups), time spent driving around for passengers, and app drivers were now protected from pay cuts. In a \u003ca href=\"https://gizmodo.com/new-yorks-rideshare-organizers-clash-amid-unprecedented-1834623838\" target=\"_blank\"\u003erare moment of unity\u003c/a\u003e, the IDG and the New York Taxi Workers Alliance (NYTWA), a union for taxi drivers, called the December pay rules “the first real attempt anywhere to stop app driver pay cuts.”\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhen it comes to extending the 2018 vehicle cap, however, the groups agree and disagree on different points. The IDG originally sought a driver cap \u003ci\u003e and\u003c/i\u003e cap on leasing fees as part of a long-term solution, arguing that a vehicle moratorium would empower \u003ca href=\"https://qz.com/1013882/ubers-rental-and-lease-programs-with-new-york-car-dealers-push-drivers-toward-shady-subprime-contracts/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003epredatory leasing companies\u003c/a\u003e already exploiting drivers (so far \u003ca href=\"https://www.amny.com/transit/nyc-uber-lyft-cap-1.34206065\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eit has\u003c/a\u003e). The NYTWA, on the other hand, \u003ca href=\"http://www.nytwa.org/home/2018/7/27/nytwa-statement-on-proposed-for-hire-vehicle-cap-in-nyc-cap-on-fhv-leasing-expenses-health-fund-for-drivers\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ecalled for\u003c/a\u003e extending the vehicle cap \u003ci\u003e and\u003c/i\u003e a cap on leasing fees. Tina Raveneau, an Independent Drivers Guild member who uses both Lyft and Uber, said in a statement that extending the moratorium was tantamount to “gambling with the livelihoods of eighty thousand low-income New York families.\" After the vote, the NYTWA Executive Director Bhairavi Desai said: “even though Uber, Lyft drivers and yellow cab owner-drivers are at different stages of their struggle for life out of poverty, stopping the oversaturation of cars is the starting point for all drivers to recover in this race to the bottom.” \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eNow we move to the second proposal, the cruising cap. Again, the driver groups are at odds again. The proposal is part of a larger plan to fight congestion. This part comes from \u003ca href=\"https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/tlc/downloads/pdf/annual_report_2018.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ea report released by the TLC\u003c/a\u003e revealing 29 percent of all Manhattan traffic comes from for-hire vehicles spending 41 percent of their time empty (a 59 percent utilization rate). The goal here is to increase the utilization rate to 69 percent by 2020 with the help of a \u003ca href=\"https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2019/02/03/congestion-pricing-surcharge-in-nyc-goes-into-effect\" target=\"_blank\"\u003econgestion surcharge\u003c/a\u003e that went into effect earlier this year. NYTWA supports the cruising cap, while IDG opposes it. On the congestion surcharge, however, the IDG and NYTWA are united in their opposition. The NYTWA argues the congestion plan will \u003ca href=\"http://www.nytwa.org/home/2019/1/31/nytwa-statement-on-congestion-pricing-surcharge-lawsuit\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\"force drivers to choose between food and medicine\"\u003c/a\u003e while the IDG claims it doesn’t target the worst offenders: \u003ca href=\"https://drivingguild.org/2018/11/28/uber-and-lyft-drivers-slam-unfair-regressive-congestion-tax/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ecommercial, construction, and delivery vehicles.\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThis complicated debate about how best to check the exploitation of drivers and the city by ride-hail companies is happening at the same time as a debate over how to handle \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/19/nyregion/nyc-taxis-medallions-suicides.html?module=inline\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ea taxi industry crisis\u003c/a\u003e that threatens to bankrupt thousands—\u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/23/nyregion/bill-de-blasio-taxi-commissioner.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewithout anyone leading the TLC\u003c/a\u003e. For those reasons alone, the delay members of City Council called for would’ve made sense. The real problem, however, is that NYC has no clear vision for what to do with these ride-hail companies. The ride-hail companies have a clear strategy: a \u003ca href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/zmpaq4/this-bill-could-destroy-ubers-unsustainable-business-model\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ebusiness model\u003c/a\u003e built on exploiting workers and takes advantage of political dysfunction long enough to build a monopoly. It’s not clear what New York's strategy is beyond addressing problems as they emerge. To take one example, even as ride-hail companies \u003ca href=\"https://www.autoblog.com/2019/01/23/uber-lyft-public-transit-study/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003estrangle public transit\u003c/a\u003e, there will likely be no response to Uber’s new plan to \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/07/technology/uber-train-bus-public-transit.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eprofit off of public transit\u003c/a\u003e until it is too late. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn the short-term, all these measures are good first steps. The measures will improve utilization rates, driver compensation, and reduce traffic congestion. They’ll help raise funds for the city’s ailing transit system (by taxing low-income drivers instead of wealthy elites). They do nothing to address the fundamental problem here. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe ride-hail companies are exploitative firms, backed by tens of billions of dollars and have already \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/1/18525715/lyft-loses-lawsuit-overturn-nyc-driver-wage-law\" target=\"_blank\"\u003etried to fight\u003c/a\u003e these rules. Any solution has to begin with critically examining the role ride-hail companies play in our political economy. New York City has to ask itself whether it wants a fully public urban transit system or a private system that starves and cannibalizes the public option. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe city has spent years envisioning a dynamic system of carrots and sticks to ensure the firms are on their best behavior. There is no carrot the city can offer that can compete with a company willing to lose \u003ca href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/zmjew8/were-all-killing-uber-just-by-using-it\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e$5.2 billion this quarter\u003c/a\u003e, or the \u003ca href=\"https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2019/05/ubers-path-of-destruction/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e$20 billion it lost in the decade before\u003c/a\u003e, just so it can corner the market.

The conflict of emotions from what was pure joy turned to guilt and terror overnight. How could I love this baby the way I loved Emmy? Was it okay to love this baby the way I loved Emmy? It felt like by loving my son, I was trying to replace her. The fear of birthing my son and what that meant \u0026#8230;..a monumental step forward\u0026#8230;.proof that time continued without her when all I wanted was for time to stop.  But let me say this\u0026#8230;.I couldn\u0026rsquo;t have been more wrong.  Easton provided us an even closer bond to his sister. The moment I heard his cry, something sparked back alive in my soul. Hope. Love. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure. But in that moment, I knew I was Mom and my kids deserved the world from me. Everything was going to be okay. My joy and grief could coexist.  Now, I can actually say with joy and excitement that we are expecting identical twin boys. From the day I met my husband, he has always said he wanted identical twin boys born on his birthday. We are due on the lucky day/angel number of 11/11 which is not far off from @millerbode Birthday of 10/12. From the beginning of this pregnancy, we knew Emmy had her hands in this miracle somehow.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\"\u003eA post shared by \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/morganebeck/\"  style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e Morgan Miller\u003c/a\u003e (@morganebeck) on \u003ctime style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2019-08-12T12:28:35+00:00\"\u003eAug 12, 2019 at 5:28am PDT\u003c/time\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cscript async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe couple are also parents to a 10-month-old son, Easton and a 4-year-old son, Nash, while Bode is also a father to a 6-year-old, Samuel, and an 11-year-old daughter, Neesyn.

But they also know that the time isn\u0026rsquo;t on their side \u0026mdash; especially in 2019, when a news cycle is even shorter. It\u0026rsquo;s quite possible \u0026mdash; probable even \u0026mdash; that by the time lawmakers returns to Washington on Sept. 9, their attention will have shifted elsewhere.

It\u0026#8217;s a statistical process called cluster analysis. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhat we did was we looked for those patterns. Where are there very similar people whose orientation toward society on things like how they raise kids, things like how worried they are about whether the world\u0026#8217;s becoming less safe, and looking at their values, things like how much they care about preserving authority figures in society, how much they care about sense of fairness. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe grouped people according to those attributes, their psychology, and also their degree of political engagement.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eThat gave us a very interesting distribution of seven groups from the far left to the far right. And using that methodology, we were able to better explain some of the deepest divisions in our country on questions related to race and immigration and health care and other issues. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt allowed us to see a little bit deeper into people\u0026#8217;s psychology and belief system and show how that\u0026#8217;s connected to people\u0026#8217;s political beliefs. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe also discovered in that group something we call the exhausted majority. This is our interpretation of what about two-thirds of Americans belong to. It\u0026#8217;s a group of Americans that feels deeply frustrated by the conflict in our political system, wants to see some level of compromise, and doesn\u0026#8217;t feel particularly well-represented in the political debate.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBluey:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eWell, looking at the different tribes, it was interesting to note that we hear, obviously, a lot about the progressive left or the conservative right, but the highest percentage was politically disengaged people. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what can you tell us when it comes to some of those policy issues? Obviously, that is the core focus of our work here at The Daily Signal in terms of covering those big debates. What can you tell us from your research that you\u0026#8217;ve discovered about these various seven tribes and how they respond to an issue like immigration?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHawkins:\u003c/strong\u003e The politically disengaged, I\u0026#8217;ll just start with that and then answer the broader question about immigration. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePolitically disengaged are the most heterogeneous group. This is a group that doesn\u0026#8217;t have a lot in common with each other except for the fact that they aren\u0026#8217;t particularly oriented toward watching the news or reading the news closely about politics. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0026#8217;re not particularly likely to vote, their answers to political questions don\u0026#8217;t line up in a consistent way that shows an underlying ideology or worldview that connects them to politics. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0026#8217;re more likely to have a position that aligns with Democrats on immigration, but then a position that aligns more with conservatives on abortion, for instance.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eSo there\u0026#8217;s a lot going on in that group. They do tend to be lower educated, lower income. They often express finding politics kind of overwhelming. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis is a group that in our research we found was most inclined toward believing conspiratorial theories about society, for instance. So they\u0026#8217;re a complex group, as we say, they\u0026#8217;re 26% of the population. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd if they were to all vote, I think we would see different outcomes in our country. But \u0026#8230; at the moment, they feel the political system doesn\u0026#8217;t have much to offer them and they tend to think along the lines of things like, \u0026#8220;All politicians are the same and they\u0026#8217;re all corrupt. The system is rigged for the rich,\u0026#8221; and so on. That means it leads them to focus more on just making it through their daily lives. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis is a group that has a lot of young parents in it and who are just trying to make ends meet. Politics is kind of a luxury activity for them that they don\u0026#8217;t get too indulgent.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eThen, on the question of how these groups differ on issues like immigration, we find that there is a complex story here. There are some elements of immigration where there\u0026#8217;s a lot of alignment. For instance, most Americans support a policy that would bring a process into being for people who are living here with undocumented status toward becoming a citizen. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026#8217;s especially true of people who were brought here as children. So what\u0026#8217;s called the the \u0026#8220;Dreamers\u0026#8221; and the DACA program. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThen there is much more division and a lack of agreement on what immigration is actually doing for our country today. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIs immigration leading to more prosperity and better economic outcomes or is it really a net drain where it\u0026#8217;s costing the country a lot in terms of public resources?\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eWe found in other research we\u0026#8217;ve done that really if you express that your policy objective for immigration is to preserve our border, at the same time that we show humanity and respect toward those who are fleeing from violence and poverty and coming to the United States in a way that is respectful of our laws in our culture, you can get most Americans on board with that kind of policy. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe trick really with immigration is to commit to both things at the same time. Keep our country safe, keep our country orderly, and then show humane, dignity, and respect toward people who are coming from outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/190812_Flag-1024x755.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-552961\" srcset=\"https://www.dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/190812_Flag-1024x755.jpg 1024w, https://www.dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/190812_Flag-300x221.jpg 300w, https://www.dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/190812_Flag-768x566.jpg 768w, https://www.dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/190812_Flag.jpg 1250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eLogan Deetz, center, holds American flag at the Washington Monument on July 4, 2014.

We found that, on average, media consumption tends to distort people\u0026#8217;s perceptions of their political opponents. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn some ways it\u0026#8217;s counterintuitive because the people who are consuming the most news ought to be the most informed and in many respects they are the most informed about what\u0026#8217;s happening in the country. But when it comes to assessing what their political opponents believe, they tend to have really distorted and kind of caricatured understandings of their political opponents.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eWe found that this was true kind of independently of what media source people were reading, but the degree to which it was true varied, particularly some of the more hard right-leaning news sources, such as Breitbart, were correlated with the strongest overstatement of how extreme \u0026#8230; Democrats\u0026#8217; policy views are. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe also found that people who identified, for instance, as Democrats, but occasionally watch Fox News had a better, more accurate read on Republicans.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eSimilarly, Republicans, who occasionally read left-leaning sources or watch left-leaning sources, had a better understanding of what their political opponents thought. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo the takeaway from us is it\u0026#8217;s really helpful to have what we refer to as a balanced media diet. Just like with your food, you might have some things that are easy and fun for you to consume and some things which you kind of need to hold your nose a little bit. But you know that they\u0026#8217;re good for you because on aggregate they give you the kind of healthiest picture of what the country really thinks. So that\u0026#8217;s what we\u0026#8217;re concluding from that section of our report.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBluey: As the executive editor of The Daily Signal, I wholeheartedly agree with you on that. I think that\u0026#8217;s one of the reasons that we were inspired to create a news organization here at The Heritage Foundation. We felt that we were hopefully adding a healthy dose to the diets of Americans in terms of the news that we produce and the focus particularly on policy issues and the debates that are playing out here in Washington and across the country. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo I encourage our listeners always to have that healthy diet of news consumption. As much as we love you listening and reading to The Daily Signal, make sure you\u0026#8217;re checking out other sources as well. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStephen, I want to ask you also about the perception gap and, specifically, the finding on higher education, which really surprised me. The people who have a higher education and a college degree actually are contributing to this gap. What did you discover?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHawkins\u003c/strong\u003e: That\u0026#8217;s right. This was particularly interesting on the left side of the spectrum, meaning among Democrats. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhat we found is that more highly educated Democrats were the ones who were more likely to have the more distorted picture of your average Republican. And that correlated to education but likely not the curriculum that they\u0026#8217;re consuming as a more highly educated person, but rather that higher-educated Democrats tend to filter out the conservatives and Republican friends in their social networks as they become more educated.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eWe found that as Democrats went from high school to college to Masters degrees and further degrees, with each increasing step up that ladder of educational attainment, they reported lower and lower levels of Republicans and conservatives in their friend circles. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo what\u0026#8217;s happening here is an interesting social effect where Democrats tend to self-select out of politically diverse communities and into a more politically homogenous environment where their day-to-day contact with people who differ from them politically starts to go really southward and then they end up having less of a direct connection to the reality of everyday Republicans.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAllen:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eYou all concluded in the report that we\u0026#8217;re actually less divided in America than we think we are. So do you have any advice or thoughts on how we go about shifting our focus from those differences to the areas that we do agree on?\u003cbr\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHawkins:\u003c/strong\u003e At the level of just your listeners and us in this conversation, I think that the two key takeaways are: Do keep that balanced media diet that we already talked about. Do try and engage with people who you normally don\u0026#8217;t talk to because they don\u0026#8217;t agree with you about politics. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eKeep those conversations going. It\u0026#8217;ll be a healthy way to stay in touch with what more regular people think, who aren\u0026#8217;t just part of these ideological fringes. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut, unfortunately, the main takeaway from our study is that the sources of this sense of a deep division in our country are actually institutional. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe incentive structures in our political system from the way that the parties select their nominees in the primary process through to the way that they gain support with campaign donations and all the way through to the way that our voting system works. Where voting is not obligatory.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eAll of these serve to amplify conflict and sense of polarization, as do a lot of the incentive structures in our new media landscape—where tailoring your content to confirm the perspective of your audience is proving to be a very lucrative approach as opposed to creating a balanced, neutral, and objective picture of what\u0026#8217;s happening in our country. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo what I really hope will happen from at least this report and from other similar efforts is that as a country we\u0026#8217;ll start having this conversation about: How do we reduce the level of polarization in our country? How do we return to a place where we can focus on things that we have in common and build constructively from there rather than focusing on the sources of division and exploiting them for revenue as a media organization or for votes as a political party?\u003cbr\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBluey:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eStephen, thanks for sharing that advice. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd finally, I want to ask you, what\u0026#8217;s coming up next for More in Common? Do you have future studies in the works or other projects that that you\u0026#8217;re working on now?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHawkins:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah. We\u0026#8217;re going to continue to conduct research and we\u0026#8217;re looking to build partnerships. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMore in Common is still a small organization, only a few dozen people between four countries. And we\u0026#8217;re looking to build partnerships with organizations that have reach in the numbers of millions and help them to better communicate with a cross-cutting section of the public to help to address some of these issues of polarization we\u0026#8217;re seeing. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn France, we partnered with the Catholic Church. It was really struggling to talk about some sensitive issues around immigration and Islam and we\u0026#8217;re looking to build partnerships like that in the United States as well.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBluey: That\u0026#8217;s wonderful.

Aqueous film forming foams (AFFF) used in fighting fires of flammable liquids or flammable gases, oils, solvents and alcohols can containsodiumalkyl sulfate, fluorotelomers, perfluorooctanoicacid(PFOA) or perfluorooctanesulfonicacid(PFOS).\\nThe United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is expected to release updates on tests of per- and polyfuoroalkyl substances or PFAs pollution in public water supplies for 16 million Americans in 33 states, including Pennsylvania.

And, in a first, economic factors will be allowed to be taken into account when deciding whether new animals should be added to the list of protected species.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe proposal comes after two years of work to narrow the law. Last year, Interior Secretary David Bernhardt wrote in a \u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/at-interior-were-ready-to-bring-the-endangered-species-act-up-to-date/2018/08/09/2775cd8e-9a96-11e8-b55e-5002300ef004_story.html?noredirect=on\"\u003eWashington Post op-ed\u003c/a\u003e that the Endangered Species Act places an “unnecessary regulatory burden” on companies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBernhardt, however, has a history of lobbying against the law. Prior to joining Interior, he ran the natural resources department at lobbying and law firm Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck. During his time there, he worked on behalf of oil and gas companies as well as large agribusinesses to weaken environmental protections.

One possible manifestation of that is bitter cold snaps in winter, as Arctic air slides south along with the jet stream boundary. There is a correlation between cold mid-latitude winters and low sea ice cover in the Arctic. But does the one really cause the other?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe possible relationship between a warming Arctic and changing behavior of the jet stream is still a matter of real scientific debate. For a number of reasons, it’s a difficult question to resolve. In this case, a team led by the University of Exeter’s Russell Blackport tried to disentangle the chain of events with a clever analysis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eChecking causality\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUltimately, the question is whether shrinking sea ice allows the ocean to warm the atmosphere, or whether the warm air forms separately and then melts the sea ice. The researchers used a pair of climate models and global maps of observed weather; the measurement gaps were filled in by simulated physics. First, the team categorized each winter in North America and Asia based on two measures: cooler or warmer mid-latitude temperatures and lower or higher Arctic sea ice. As in other studies, they found a correlation between the two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1549985#p3\"\u003eRead 6 remaining paragraphs\u003c/a\u003e | \u003ca href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1549985\u0026comments=1\"\u003eComments\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"feedflare\"\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=F4YkQanaGI4:ZarisPvNTmM:V_sGLiPBpWU\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=F4YkQanaGI4:ZarisPvNTmM:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=F4YkQanaGI4:ZarisPvNTmM:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=F4YkQanaGI4:ZarisPvNTmM:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=F4YkQanaGI4:ZarisPvNTmM:qj6IDK7rITs\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=F4YkQanaGI4:ZarisPvNTmM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","url":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1549985","published":"2019-08-12T18:06:21Z","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1549985"},{"title":"Now you can use Android phones, rather than passwords, to log in to Google*","content":"\u003cdiv id=\"rss-wrap\"\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"intro-image intro-left\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/google-password-800x380.png\" alt=\"Now you can use Android phones, rather than passwords, to log in to Google*\"\u003e\u003cp class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/google-password.png\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"1213\" data-width=\"2552\"\u003eEnlarge\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/p\u003e  \u003c/figure\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ca name=\"page-1\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt could soon become easier for Android users to securely log in to Web accounts.

Moore adapted the persona into his act and released three albums of his frequently raunchy material accompanied by jazz and R\u0026amp;B musicians. Because of his delivery style (which typically involved rhyming lyrics), Moore is often called the \"Godfather of Rap.\" (Snoop Dogg, who has a cameo in the biopic, \u003ca href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/zap-rudyraymooreobit-story.html\"\u003ehas said\u003c/a\u003e, \"Without Rudy Ray Moore, there would be no Snoop Dogg, and that's for real.\")\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoore slowly built up a cult following, despite the fact that his albums (including the cover art) were much too vulgar to be publicly displayed in record stores. With the rise of \"blaxploitation\" films in the early 1970s, Moore saw an opportunity to bring the character Dolemite to the moviegoing masses. He financed his first film himself with royalties from his record sales.

Michael Rothenberg (Exhibit A)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the firm’s debut fund, Rothenberg entirely eliminated the slow and orderly parceling out of fees in lieu of a one-time 17.75% fee upon the closing of the $2.6 million fund. That meant an immediate infusion of about $470,000 into the firm, but no continual fees thereafter. This sort of heavy upfront payment is not uncommon in the industry, although it is less common to have literally the sum total of management fees for a 10-year fund paid out entirely on its first day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom an LP perspective, this sort of fee structure indicates that the firm almost certainly would have had to raise additional funds almost as soon as the first one closed, since the fees of future venture funds would be needed to cover the management costs of the first fund in its later years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn short: this is what a bootstrap looks like in venture capital.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, continuing to the second fund (2014), we see a bit more of a traditional parceling out of fees over the course of the fund, although still with a heavy upfront skew. The fund pays out the typical 20% of invested capital in total, but 80% of that amount was paid out in the first two years. Again, the implicit assumption with this sort of bootstrap is that the firm will succeed and raise additional capital (and therefore management fees) to keep the operation going.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe then see the same pattern in the 2015 fund, with fees having a normal structure, but then with more aggressive upfront payouts required. So while the fund had a flat payout every year for its management fee, two years of that fee was to be paid out immediately upon close. Similarly, the administrative fee was flat — but paid out entirely in the first year of the firm’s operation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, the fourth fund (2016) returns to a more typical, flat fee structure at 2.5% per year with no provisions for upfront payment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy does this all matter?

Over the first three years, the firm had access to roughly $5.1 million in fees, whereas with a traditional 2% annual structure, the firm would have had access to just $1.2 million. Of course, that bootstrap comes at a cost in the later years, when the firm would have more resources to manage the fund.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNonetheless, those upfront payments helped the firm tremendously punch above its own weight. With its $1.2 million of fees in year one, it essentially had the resources of a $60 million fund — yet it had only raised $6.7 million. It similarly punched above its weight the next few years as it raised new funds with aggressive upfront fee schedules as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, there’s a heavy burden with this approach — it’s a bet-it-all strategy that leaves little room for error (such as a series of failed investments) that might make future fundraising hard. It’s a rocket with no ejection seat, but when it works, it can compress the time to venture fund leader dramatically — maybe even by as much as a decade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"embed breakout\"\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"azkUioqSWj\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/25/the-death-of-once-high-flying-vc-funds/\"\u003eThe death of once high-flying VC funds\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ciframe title=\"\u0026#8220;The death of once high-flying VC funds\u0026#8221; \u0026#8212; TechCrunch\" class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/25/the-death-of-once-high-flying-vc-funds/embed/#?secret=azkUioqSWj\" data-secret=\"azkUioqSWj\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUltimately, VCs like to bet, and they certainly like to bet on themselves, which is why these sorts of cash-flow optimizations are prevalent for new firms.

PitchBook notes that its last round in 2018 was at a modest $135 million, and my guess is that is up by quite some way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe idea of building a business on search, of course, is not at all new, and Lucidworks works is in a very crowded field. The likes of Amazon, Google and Microsoft have built entire empires on search \u0026#8212; in Google\u0026#8217;s and Microsoft\u0026#8217;s case, by selling ads against those search results; in Amazon\u0026#8217;s case, by generating sales of items in the search results \u0026#8212; and they have subsequently productised that technology, selling it as a service to others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlongside that are companies that have been building search-as-a-service from the ground up \u0026#8212; like Elastic, Sumo Logic and Splunk (whose founding team, coincidentally, went on to found Lucidworks\u0026#8230;) \u0026#8212; both for back-office processes as well as for services that are customer-facing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn an interview, Hayes said that what sets Lucidworks apart is how it uses machine learning and other AI processes to personalise those results after \u0026#8220;sorting through mountains of data,\u0026#8221; to provide enterprise information to knowledge workers, shopping results on an e-commerce site to consumers, data to wealth managers or whatever it is that is being sought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTake the case of a shopping experience, he said by way of explanation. \u0026#8220;If I\u0026#8217;m on REI to buy hiking shoes, I don\u0026#8217;t just want to see the highest-rated hiking shoes, or the most expensive,\u0026#8221; he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe idea is that Lucidworks builds algorithms that bring in other data sources \u0026#8212; your past shopping patterns, your location, what kind of walking you might be doing, what other people like you have purchased \u0026#8212; to produce a more focused list of products that you are more likely to buy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;Amazon has no taste,\u0026#8221; he concluded, a little playfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday, around half of Lucidworks\u0026#8217; business comes from digital commerce and digital content \u0026#8212; searches of the kind described above for products, or monitoring customer search queries sites like Red Hat or Reddit \u0026#8212; and half comes from knowledge worker applications inside organizations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe plan will be to continue that proportion, while also adding other kinds of features \u0026#8212; more natural language processing and more semantic search features \u0026#8212; to expand the kinds of queries that can be made, and also cues that Fusion can use to produce results.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInterestingly, Hayes said that while it\u0026#8217;s come up a number of times, Lucidworks doesn\u0026#8217;t see itself ever going head-to-head with a company like Google or Amazon in providing a first-party search platform of its own. Indeed, that may be an area that has, for the time being at least, already been played out. Or it may be that we have turned to a time when walled gardens \u0026#8212; or at least more targeted and curated experiences \u0026#8212; are coming into their own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;We still see a lot of runway in this market,\u0026#8221; said Jonathan Murphy of Francisco Partners. \u0026#8220;We were very attracted to the idea of next-generation search, on one hand serving internet\u003cspan class=\"Apple-converted-space\"\u003e users facing the pain of the broader internet, and on the other enterprises as an enterprise software product.\u0026#8221; \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucidworks, it seems, has also entertained acquisition approaches, although Hayes declined to get specific about that. \u003cspan style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\"\u003eThe longer-term goal, he said, \u0026#8220;is to build something special that will stay here for a long time.

An investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board determined that the truck driver mistakenly turned onto the railroad’s right-of-way “due to acute fatigue and unfamiliarity with the area.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"3KPNyH\"\u003eAs a result, the NTSB issued \u003ca href=\"https://ntsb.gov/safety/safety-recs/_layouts/ntsb.recsearch/Recommendation.aspx?Rec=H-16-015\"\u003ea safety recommendation\u003c/a\u003e to the big tech companies, as well as other map and GPS providers like TomTom, Inrix, Garmin, MapQuest, Omnitracs, and UPS.

Passwords have all kinds of vulnerabilities, even before you consider the fact that a lot of people reuse them across multiple sites. However, with this method, credentials are stored locally on your device so they can’t be intercepted or hacked off a company’s servers, and they’re also impossible to “phish” by tricking you into visiting a fake website. Using a password manager along with two-factor authentication helps mitigate a lot of these vulnerabilities, but the new method Google is using removes them entirely. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"iaw-6\"\u003eIf you have a compatible Android handset, then you can try the functionality out now by heading over to \u003ca href=\"https://passwords.google.com\"\u003epasswords.google.com\u003c/a\u003e using the Chrome app on your phone. This service lets you manage all of the passwords that Chrome has saved for you. If you tap on any one of these saved passwords, then Google will prompt you to “Verify that it’s you,” at which point, you can authenticate using your fingerprint or any other method you’d usually use to unlock your phone.

This contact could wear down those cables over time, and, in a few cases, it resulted in short-circuits that started the fires.

Instead, Tumblr will act as as a “complementary” site to WordPress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-float-right\"\u003e\u003caside id=\"BmTfjN\"\u003e\u003cq\u003e“We’re not going to change any of that.”\u003c/q\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"QWO7a3\"\u003e“It’s just fun,” Mullenweg told the \u003cem\u003eJournal\u003c/em\u003e. “We’re not going to change any of that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"pYMbDt\"\u003eOne part of being a complement to WordPress is possibly sharing services and functionality, according to the report.

Unfortunately, stargazers may have a tough time seeing these shooting stars this year, thanks to the light of our pesky Moon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"1SSOlW\"\u003eThe Perseid meteor shower occurs every August whenever Earth passes through the tail of a comet called Swift-Tuttle, a big rock about 16 miles (26 kilometers) across that orbits around the Sun. As Swift-Tuttle zooms through space, the Sun heats up the icy comet, causing a bunch of loose material like pebbles and dust to fly off. This debris forms a cloud all along Swift-Tuttle’s orbital path around the Sun. The Earth barrels through this cloud at the same time every year, resulting in a bombardment of debris that reaches speeds of between 25,000 and 100,000 miles an hour. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-float-right\"\u003e\u003caside id=\"3ZRvY1\"\u003e\u003cq\u003e“We’re not expecting a sort of once-in-a-lifetime, ‘Oh my gosh, the sky will be full of shooting stars,’ [event].”\u003c/q\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"9eJrrH\"\u003eThese tiny meteors pose no threat to us on Earth. They’re so small — about the size of sand or rice — and they come in so fast that they burn up completely when passing through the thick atmosphere around our planet. “They hit the upper atmosphere, and all of a sudden, they’re going through some gases, they heat up with friction, and then they glow,” Michelle Thaller, an astronomer and research scientist at NASA’s Goddard Spaceflight Center, tells \u003cem\u003eThe Verge\u003c/em\u003e. “And so you get these wonderful streaks of light.” The streaks get their name from the fact that they look like they’re coming from the constellation Perseus when they whizz through the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"QpYvAO\"\u003eThe night of August 12th is when Earth passes through the densest part of the Swift-Tuttle debris cloud, leading to the most frequent streaks of light. But this year, the full Moon is just a few days away, so our lunar neighbor is almost fully illuminated. That means the sky is very bright with light reflected off the Moon, which will make any Perseid meteors more difficult to see. “We’re not expecting a sort of once-in-a-lifetime, ‘Oh my gosh, the sky will be full of shooting stars,’ [event],” says Thaller. “It won’t be like that.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"YaIbFR\"\u003eThat doesn’t mean you should completely stay indoors, says Thaller, as a few meteors will be bright enough to get past the Moon’s glow. And if this year’s event turns out to be a true bust, there’s always next year. The Perseids occur at the same time every year, and in 2020, the Moon will be way less bright. So if the lunar light blows out tonight’s show, come back next year to try again.\u003c/p\u003e","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/12/20802470/perseid-meteor-shower-comet-swift-tuttle-full-moon","published":"2019-08-12T20:02:41Z","guid":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/12/20802470/perseid-meteor-shower-comet-swift-tuttle-full-moon"}]},{"url":"https://www.wired.com/feed","items":[{"title":"Ebola Is Now Curable.

Anybody can fall victim to a data breach at any time. The damage is usually extensive and expensive if not utterly debilitating. Breaches are a cancer that never knows remission and a significant cause of concern in the connected world of today. What is a data breach to begin with? Well, you need to know your enemy, and there are about five different types of data breach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eHere is a quick and straightforward analogy. If a burglar picks your lock or breaks your window and enters your house, that is a \u003cstrong\u003esecurity breach.\u003c/strong\u003e If the burglar steals your documents and personal information and then leaves, that is a \u003cstrong\u003edata breach.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to an article on \u003ca href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_breach\"\u003eWikipedia\u003c/a\u003e, “A data breach is a security incident in which sensitive, protected or confidential data is copied, transmitted, viewed, stolen or used by an individual unauthorized to do so.” A friend might steal a couple of your randy pictures to expose or prank you on Facebook; data breaches usually happen on a colossal scale involving \u003ca href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/pictures-story/872-worst-data-breaches.html\"\u003emillions if not billions of records.\u003c/a\u003e Big companies (you know, the kind you’d never imagine would fall victim) such as Yahoo, and Equifax among others aren’t safe either. When you think of it, attackers seem to love big and blue-chip companies because of the more significant the impact, the fatter the paycheck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stolen information is then used to commit credit card fraud, identity theft, and a host of other heinous crimes. Some attackers will even sell the information in bulk on the \u003ca href=\"https://www.csoonline.com/article/3249765/what-is-the-dark-web-how-to-access-it-and-what-youll-find.html\"\u003edark web\u003c/a\u003e, giving even more bad guys the chance to commit abhorrent atrocities ranging from espionage to blackmail and the list goes on. Data breaches are a severe problem that mandates organizations to prepare beforehand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eThe first step in preparing is awareness about the 5 different types of data breach. If you know how the enemy operates, you can put countermeasures in place.\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor each of the five \u003ca href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/07/24/how-to-better-defend-against-cyber-threats/\"\u003etypes of \u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/07/24/how-to-better-defend-against-cyber-threats/\"\u003edata breach\u003c/a\u003e, you\u0026#8217;ll learn a couple of preventative measures so that you can bolster the security of your systems. Keep in mind that attackers hardly rest, so don’t you sleep either. Keep learning and implementing the best security practices and stay ahead of the bad guys. Always remember to share your concerns about security and give each other the best security tips you hear about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e5 Different Types of Data Breach 2019\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis list of data breaches is in no particular order, but they are all serious areas of concern for any organization or person looking to stay safe from data breach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003ePhysical Theft\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho has ever watched the Mission: Impossible film that was released in 1996? If you haven’t seen it \u0026#8212; find it and watch it. For those who watched the film, I think you’ll agree when I say: We should laud the director, Brian De Palma, for that one famous scene where Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) rappels from the vent of an incredibly secure CIA vault to steal the NOC list that contained the real names of agents in the field.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHAT PEOPLE is a classic example of data breach by physical theft, but we celebrated Tom Cruise for the act. In the real world, things might not be as dramatic, but data breach by physical theft is very much a reality for many organizations. It could be as simple as someone plugging a USB drive into a server containing sensitive and business-critical information, or as brazen as someone carrying a hard disk out of your business premises. If anybody can walk out of your premises with sensitive business data, you’re in deeper trouble than you would like to admit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeaving confidential documents in plain sight or disposing of sensitive information improperly (yes, a determined data thief won’t have qualms about going through your trash) can also expose you to a data breach. It’s the main reason vaults (but clearly not that CIA vault in Ethan’s case), shredders and furnaces were invented \u0026#8211; to protect and get rid of sensitive information that mustn’t fall into the wrong hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo protect your organization from physical theft of data, implement stringent security protocols that ensure only authorized people have access to privileged and sensitive data. Have you ever heard of chit-key vaults and safe deposit boxes? Well, you might need to school yourself up on such secure storage options if you’d like to keep physical data breaches at bay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat about your prized server room? We recommend you invest in military-grade security, laser sensors, motion detectors, sentry guns, the Death Star, the Infinity Gauntlet; whatever works for you \u0026#8211; just ensure you leave nothing to chance. Pardon all the movie references, but we all know what happens when hackers release nude pictures of female celebrities and media files that were meant to stay private. The fallout if often nasty and people lose face and jobs, but I digress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eCyber Attack\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCyberattack is one of the most prevalent forms of data breach since the attacker needn’t be physically present on your business premises to steal your data. All a cyber attacker needs is a computer with internet access and a couple of hacking tools to grab your data without your knowledge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eData breach by cyber-attacks can go on for months or even years without anyone noticing, especially if the hacker did his/her job well. Often, the intrusion is discovered when the damage has already been done, i.e., after the data breach has taken place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut how does a criminal hacker on the other side of the globe gain access to your system? The attackers rarely reinvent the wheel unless they have to. They use \u003ca href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/03/29/evaluating-popular-web-browsers-in-terms-of-security-and-privacy/\"\u003eold hacking methods\u003c/a\u003e that are known to work. If they devise a new tactic, it’s mostly a combination of old tactics meant to exploit vulnerabilities in your system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCommon mechanisms hackers use to break into your systems include malware, keyloggers, fictitious websites, trojans, backdoors, and viruses, among others. Usually, they trick users into clicking and as a result, install malicious programs on the system, which is how they mainly gain access to your data. Others will intercept the information you send and receive over an unsecured network in what is commonly known as the man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn attacker may dupe an unsuspecting staff member to steal login credentials. The attacker then uses the login credentials to login to the staffer’s computer, from where they launch a lateral attack on the rest of your system. Before long, the attacker has access to restricted areas of your network, and BAM \u0026#8211; your data is gone, lost or rendered useless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith criminal cyberattacks making up over 48% of data breaches according to the \u003ca href=\"https://www.ibm.com/security/data-breach\"\u003eCost of Data Breach Study\u003c/a\u003e by IBM, how do you protect yourself from cybercriminals looking to harvest your data? Preventative measures to keep cyber attackers at bay include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEncourage staffers to use strong and unique passwords. Never use the same password for different accounts. If you can’t remember many different passwords, considering investing in a password manager such as \u003ca href=\"https://www.lastpass.com/\"\u003eLastPass\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://www.cyclonis.com/products/password-manager/\"\u003eCyclonis\u003c/a\u003e, among others. And please, never ever use “123456,” “password,” “admin” and such easy-to-guess passwords\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eInvest in a state of the art \u003ca href=\"https://thebestvpn.com/what-is-vpn-beginners-guide/\"\u003eVPN\u003c/a\u003e to secure your network.

Or what happens when you send the wrong attachment to the right recipient? That photo you mean to send to your significant other?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth scenarios constitute data breach, and when it happens in an organization, it can cause unprecedented chaos and unrest. But perhaps the above examples don’t cut it for you, so here is a fun fact. Did you know networked backup incidents and misconfigured cloud servers caused by employee negligence exposed over 2 billion records in 2017? According to the 2018, IBM X-Force Threat Intelligence Index published on itweb.co.za.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe point is to err is human; we all make mistakes, and it’s inevitable. But mistakes that could take your company off the pivot can’t be taken lightly or for granted. To mitigate this type of data breach, you must educate your employees on the essential elements of information security, and what will happen if they aren’t vigilant when performing their duties. It might sound like a weak point, but a little training could go a long way in combating data breach due to employee negligence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn top of that, educate non-technical staff members on data security awareness procedures and policies. At the end of the day, you should embrace a zero-tolerance policy to data breaches that result from employee negligence. Inform your employees on the importance of keeping data safe and the repercussions should the unthinkable happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eInsider Threat\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile most organizations focus on mitigating external threat factors, insiders pose a more significant threat than you’d typically imagine.

Network protectors can quickly combat malicious outsiders, but the job becomes harder when threats come from trusted and authorized users within the organization.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eThe job becomes 10 times more challenging since there are different types of insider threats, namely:\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDisgruntled employees \u003c/strong\u003e\u0026#8211; This category of criminal insiders commit deliberate sabotage or steal intellectual property for monetary gain.

They scout the dark web looking to recruit your employees. If one of your employees collaborates with a malicious attacker, you will have a severe security and data breach, and you don’t need a rocket scientist to tell you that. In some cases, an employee may even cooperate with another employee in the same organization, exposing you to all types of cybersecurity problems. If you need a little prodding in the right direction, just think how insider collusion can expose your enterprise to fraud, intellectual property theft, and plain old sabotage.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eInadvertent insiders\u003c/strong\u003e \u0026#8211; Ignorance is not bliss as far as cybersecurity goes. Negligence on your employees part invites all manner of trouble since attackers are savvy to vulnerabilities that inadvertent insiders cause. Negligent staff members expose your organization to malware, phishing, and man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks, among other forms of attack. Attackers may take advantage of negligence in your organization to exploit misconfigured servers, unsecured/unmonitored microsites, and so on.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePersistent malicious insiders\u003c/strong\u003e \u0026#8211; Criminal “second streamers,” i.e., employees seeking supplemental income maliciously, won’t protect your data. Instead, they will commit a slew of malicious acts such as exfiltrating data for financial gains. And this category of people will remain undetected for long periods to maximize the benefits of data theft. And since they are aware of network monitoring tools, they will steal data slowly instead of committing data theft in bulk. As such, they can operate under the radar for months or years.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow do you prevent data breach caused by insiders? How do you protect your data when the threat comes from the same people you trust. To protect your data from insider threat, you need to implement measures such as endpoint and mobile security, Data Loss Prevention (DLP), data encryption at rest, in motion and use as well as Identity and Access Management (IAM). You can even adopt behavioral analysis and reduce vulnerabilities. These measures will combat, among other things, unauthorized access, negligence, and data loss in case of a breach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eRansomware\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat comes to mind when you see the word RANSOMWARE? WannaCry? $700,000 of losses? Laws? The HIPAA perhaps? CryptoWall? CryptoLocker? Ransomware can constitute a data breach depending on the malware that attacks your systems. Other factors such as the type of data stolen, the current status of said data and \u0026#8211; again \u0026#8211; laws. Anybody who puts your data at risk of loss has committed data breach to some extent. If some hacker somewhere holds your data hostage, your organization will surely experience losses in all fronts. And you determinedly would instead carry on as usual \u0026#8211; plus money doesn’t just grow on trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eThe attacker who hijacks your data has demonstrated that they can steal or destroy your data at will.\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClearly, they are talented, and ransomware comes in a million shades of nasty.

It’s one of the reasons the US government has a $15 billion budget for cybersecurity. The majority of attackers use ransomware to cover their tracks. Just think about it for a minute. Some guy breaks into your system steals your data, and if that isn’t enough, holds your data hostage for profit as they cover a data breach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eRansomware ruins your reputation. It takes blood, sweat, and tears to build a name, so say \u0026#8220;no\u0026#8221; to ransomware.\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can avoid ransomware of you’re cautious enough.

And please install a powerful antivirus program (my favorite is \u003ca href=\"https://www.eset.com/int/\"\u003eEset Nod32\u003c/a\u003e), and ensure you activate web file protection and firewalls to combat malware-laden emails and messages that pass spam filters. Additionally, invest in a clever backup plan so that you can simply wipe the drives to eliminate ransomware, and then restore backups. That way, you can beat ransomware attackers at their own game, instead of paying a ransom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eFinal Words\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecurity goes beyond mere awareness, so don’t take data breach sitting down. You can effectively protect yourself, and if the worst happens, rise from the ashes stronger than before.  Keep learning and implementing the best security policies and procedures to protect your business against the various forms of data and security breaches.

The presentation of the news came in Apple’s typical hype-building fashion. But with news of original programming comes celebrities and with that a new degree of hysteria – even for Apple. The video presentation featured some of the biggest names in entertainment, from Oprah to Steven Spielberg, Steve Carell to Reese Witherspoon, Jason Momoa to Big Bird.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis push into streaming is not just focused on the exclusive, Apple-created content of Apple TV+, however. Instead, Apple is hoping to make its TV app the centerpiece of any streaming experience. Apple aims to integrate other services, including HBO, Showtime, Starz, and CBS All Access, directly into its interface, handle all streams and allow users to pay for these services through the app. Notably absent is preeminent streamer Netflix.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLess than a month after this industry-shaking news, another giant entered the fold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDisney Perks Up Its Ears\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a mid-April event, Bob Iger announced \u003ca href=\"https://preview.disneyplus.com\"\u003eDisney+\u003c/a\u003e; the company’s also long-awaited OTT video service, would also launch this fall. Disney, of course, is not a new entrant to content creation. It has its library of classics, Pixar films and all of its recently acquired Fox properties. It also holds perhaps the two most valuable content engines that have ever existed in Star Wars and the Marvel Cinematic Universe. These franchises have produced six of the seven most significant domestic box office openings of all-time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition to this library of beloved content and the expertise to continue creating more of it, Disney set the initial price of its new service at $7 per month. This price is significantly less than Netflix, which offers its most basic plan for $12.99 per month.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the entries of Apple and Disney, it’s clear that we’re coming to an inflection point for OTT video. But lost in the fog of the streaming wars is the strain that more and \u003ca href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/10/22/7-dos-and-donts-for-app-preview-videos-if-you-want-a-shot-at-going-viral/\"\u003ebetter video\u003c/a\u003e will put on networks – the very mechanism that allows watchers to consume OTT content. Now more than ever, network operators must prepare for ever-increasing bandwidth demands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNetwork Challenges of the Streaming War\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVideo is now the overwhelming function being supported by networks. According to \u003ca href=\"https://www.sandvine.com/hubfs/downloads/phenomena/2018-phenomena-report.pdf\"\u003eSandvine’s Global Internet Phenomena Report\u003c/a\u003e, almost 58 percent of the total downstream internet traffic is video. By itself, that would be enough to worry network operators with legacy networks. Compounding concerns, however, the push towards streaming video today is no longer coming just from consumer preferences. It’s also coming from content creators.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTake, for example, Oscar-winner Jordan Peele’s reboot of The Twilight Zone. Although CBS Television Studios produced the project and CBS backed it with a Super Bowl ad, CBS did not give it a traditional network distribution. Instead, the CBS All Access streaming service aired it. Even those funding and making video content are choosing to put it on non-traditional platforms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith these two forces driving online video, it’s no wonder that US consumers are increasingly considering canceling pay-TV services. OTT video services are projected to have a U.S. market penetration of more than 58 percent in the next three years, according to \u003ca href=\"https://www.emarketer.com/content/more-than-half-of-us-consumers-watch-subscription-ott-video-2018\"\u003eeMarketer analysis\u003c/a\u003e. Meanwhile, video quality standards in the streaming era continue to change. We’ve gone from standard definition to high definition, and now, 4K is gaining steam as more 4K-capable devices become available. Some have even already begun to discuss the 4K successor, 8K UHD-2, although that is years down the line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis combination of higher streaming volume and higher quality video equates to stress for the networks that must carry it. To do so and to thrive, networks need greater capacity infrastructure, but even more importantly, optimization to scale from both a capacity and operational perspective.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRising to Support an OTT World\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor network providers, the trick of streaming video isn’t just about having enough network capacity. It’s about providing an excellent quality of experience (QoE) for the viewer. Traditionally, streaming video providers sent video over the top of the internet data connection. This simple approach, however, can be impacted by network congestion and result in viewers watching that dreaded “spinning disk.” That means that, in addition to supporting massive data transfer with minimal delay, network providers need to think about the network as an integral part of the total video distribution solution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCloser \u0026amp; Newer\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first part of the equation and perhaps the most intuitive way to provide a great \u003ca href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/07/05/why-customer-centric-companies-are-leveraging-performance-video-for-unprecedented-growth/\"\u003eQoE is updating infrastructure\u003c/a\u003e and bringing content caches closer to the viewer. While often overlooked, data does not just appear out of nowhere. It is physically traveling over any number of connections. Therefore, it’s logical that having the best physical connection as close as possible to the end-user improves speed and service quality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday, however, coaxial infrastructures are aging and limited in their ability to meet demand. Fiber is the future – and increasingly the present – of wireline network infrastructure. Network providers have been making significant efforts to push fiber, and therefore, network activity, closer to end-users to increase bandwidth, supply a better experience and drive performance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fiber push means that streaming content no longer has to travel from a server located hundreds or thousands of miles away to reach consumers. Less travel from server locations mitigates the risk of delays along the way that can lead to poor performance and creates increased capacity demand across the entire network core. Rather, as head-ends turn into mini data centers, content is caching much closer to the end-user. This level of proximity improves responsiveness, overall quality of experience, and enables support of higher capacity streaming like 4K video.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHigh speed and responsiveness are crucial in the growing streaming era. Even more valuable, though, is incorporating the ability to automate and optimize network activity to support growing bandwidth needs. That step means moving from rapid network response to network demand anticipation and, in turn, adaptability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Adaptive Network\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdaptive networks provide the operational scalability required to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eadjust to the increasing pressure that streaming video puts on network infrastructure\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003erespond to unpredictability in traffic patterns\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGetting there takes more than a snap of the fingers, however. It requires the ability to scale from both a capacity and an operational perspective. Adaptive networks must combine programmable equipment, data analytics, and intelligent algorithms with software control and automation. Together, these create a feedback loop that tells the video service provider how well its application is performing and tells the internet service provider how well its network is performing. This loop informs the network how to adapt to match the demand of the streaming video services it is carrying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSmart Infrastructure\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe infrastructure elements, both physical and virtual, must be highly intelligent and interpret data so the network can make decisions itself. Being enabled to make high-end decisions requires the supporting IP/optical infrastructure be highly instrumented to deliver routing and performance telemetry to algorithms that determine the health of the network. The massive amount of information that this layer produces creates the need for big network analytics and intelligence functions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eData – Big and Small \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe often hear the term “big data.” In this context, this is the information that informs the network on how to adjust in the long term, what to look out for, and potential vulnerabilities. Small data, however, also happens at a rapid pace. Something as small as an immediate request from a customer, for example, requires a quick network response. Those moves are possible through network analytics that interprets network performance and its impact upon service quality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMaking Software Work For You\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs it stands today, human intervention is a fundamental component to making network changes. However, as the future adaptive network takes hold, operator influence will begin to wane. Network automation will have a more significant function in taking care of network maintenance. With this, network operators will significantly reduce the possibility of human error bringing network issues or outages, instead of keeping it running at peak performance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the context of streaming video, an adaptive network means:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe ability to measure Quality of Experience (QoE) at the user device level,\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe ability to measure Quality of Service (QoS) of the network, and\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCorrelating these inputs to determine cause and effect.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaking these assessments allows the network to determine the appropriate solution, reconfigure the network, and cache resources to optimize the consumer’s viewing experience. This is adaptivity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Future: 5G Networks, OTT and Beyond\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs streaming continues to grow, so do networks, and the one that people can’t hear enough about is 5G. That’s with good reason. The higher speed capabilities and \u003ca href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/12/11/will-uncertainty-in-us-5g-deployments-affect-iot-development/\"\u003ereduced latency of 5G\u003c/a\u003e are perfect attributes to support OTT video. As OTT providers increase their presence in the live video space, this becomes even more valuable. Beyond speed and responsiveness, 5G’s network slicing functionality will allow operators to dedicate parts of their network to specific applications. Streaming entertainment could have a part of 5G networks all to itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegardless of the type of network, we used to watch a video, embracing network solutions that support the growing appetite for the never-ending buffet of streaming services is critical. Embracing efforts to cache video content closer to the edge and to enable adaptive networks supports OTT streaming today but also prepares the network for the future – a future that moves far beyond today’s capabilities. In five years, immersive Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality tie-ins could make Black Mirror’s interactive Bandersnatch episode look quaint. Networks that can adapt will be prepared, and their users and operators will see the benefit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe post \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/08/12/apple-and-disneys-entries-into-the-streaming-wars-stress-telecom-networks/\"\u003eApple and Disney’s Entries into the Streaming Wars Stress Telecom Networks\u003c/a\u003e appeared first on \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\"\u003eReadWrite\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://readwrite.com/2019/08/12/apple-and-disneys-entries-into-the-streaming-wars-stress-telecom-networks/","published":"2019-08-12T15:00:12Z","guid":"https://readwrite.com/?p=154594\u0026preview=true\u0026preview_id=154594"},{"title":"Roborock S6: Vacuuming and Mopping in One Smart Device","content":"\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cimg width=\"300\" height=\"118\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-03-at-9.30.53-AM-300x118.png\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-03-at-9.30.53-AM-300x118.png 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-03-at-9.30.53-AM-260x102.png 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-03-at-9.30.53-AM-900x354.png 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are numerous robot vacuums available as well as mopping devices.

The vac knows where it should and shouldn\u0026#8217;t go in relation to height and risky areas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe company promises 98 percent accuracy for its floor mapping technology. For my testing, it was highly accurate. I couldn\u0026#8217;t find any mistakes in its pathways no matter what barriers I (had fun) putting in front of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eFeatures and Functionality\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis smart cleaning device includes features that let you name each area of the map it creates and then schedules cleaning for rooms listed on that map or an entire floor within your home. The Roborock S6 also uses SLAM algorithms to calculate the fastest, most efficient way to cover an entire room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can use the Mi Home app (iOS and Android versions available) to do this along with listing areas that you don\u0026#8217;t want the vacuum to go. It is compatible with other smart devices like Amazon Alexa, Google Home, and devices from IFTTT.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter wp-image-157588 size-large\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-03-at-8.55.08-AM-900x441.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"441\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-03-at-8.55.08-AM-900x441.png 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-03-at-8.55.08-AM-260x127.png 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-03-at-8.55.08-AM-300x147.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe robot vacuum has a detachable main brush that works on cleaning the ground while a variable speed side brush covers corners and along walls where dust bunnies like to live.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, the Robo can also provide a mopping feature. The mop has an adjustable water flow feature so mopping can be tailored to your home\u0026#8217;s needs. The water is spread evenly across the floor to provide consistent mopping functionality. (This is so fast and easy.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat I Like\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBesides the incredible multi-action cleaning power where I know it\u0026#8217;s not only vacuuming but also mopping, I like that it is extremely quiet. However, it\u0026#8217;s so quiet that I forget it\u0026#8217;s there, so it\u0026#8217;s possible to take it out of quiet mode. I prefer quiet mode, and our household solved the issue of tripping over it by running it overnight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother positive about this smart cleaning device is its modular design. It\u0026#8217;s straight forward in terms of how it works. Being straight forward means I haven\u0026#8217;t spent much time figuring out how the parts work. None of us have time for lengthy setup for a product, and Roborock S6 is easy. Also, there doesn\u0026#8217;t seem to be any real maintenance involved. For example, it has small charging dock cables that can be tucked away rather than unwieldy cables that tangle. The dustbin simply pops out for emptying and then pops right back into place. The water tank for the mopping is just as easy to open, fill, and replace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIts cleaning power is the best yet of all the robotic vacuums I\u0026#8217;ve tested. The Robo picks up so much dust, lint and \u0026#8220;stuff,\u0026#8221; even when its dustbin container is full. There is a large battery that keeps the vacuum going for up to three hours in quiet mode. The power also takes-on high thresholds and thick carpets easy for this robot vacuum cleaner to navigate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eAreas of Improvement\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt $650, this smart cleaning device comes with a hefty price tag. Other than that, this is an extraordinary smart cleaning device.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter wp-image-157589 size-large\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-03-at-8.55.22-AM-900x412.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"412\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-03-at-8.55.22-AM-900x412.png 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-03-at-8.55.22-AM-260x119.png 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-03-at-8.55.22-AM-300x137.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eIn the Box\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe robot vacuum is available in three colors (white, black, and rose gold), and arrives with accessories that include a power dock and adapter as well as disposable mop cloths. The box also contained a user manual.

Army develops ‘stealthy’ rifles","content":"\u003cp\u003eThe U.S. Army is planning to use cutting-edge technologies to significantly reduce the noise and visual signature of the next-generation rifles, according to new data from the Joint Service Small Arms Program.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next generation rifles will combine modern firepower with reduced visual and acoustic signatures. The U.S. arms makers working with military researchers on new solutions that help to field a system that will allow troops to gain the advantage of stealth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the major challenges is the development of critical component-level technologies that provide lightweight, reduced signature, lower-recoil rifle development to enable increased system performance. To be really \u0026#8216;stealthy\u0026#8217;, it is not enough to remove the noise of firing. Engineers are making efforts to reduce first-shot weapon signature in low light to conduct operations without detection. Currently, first shots produce a brighter flash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blast and flash are caused by the combustion products of the gunpowder, and any remaining unburned powder, mixing with the ambient air. The size and shape of the muzzle flash are dependent on the type of ammunition being used and the individual characteristics of the firearm and any devices attached to the muzzle (such as a muzzle brake or flash suppressor).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to new data, continues development of a convenient gas purge system to remove oxygen from the barrel to reduce the weapon flash from the first shot, but doing so without losing accuracy and range.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe new system designed to reduce or close the gap for gunner position detection. No escaping gas means no loud noise, making a pop rather than a bang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe new weapons system developing especially for use in irregular warfare like the insurgencies in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-44413\" src=\"https://defence-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ZLQQ4RXGPFEKRJ5VFXV6PQ2KUM-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1283\" height=\"779\" srcset=\"https://defence-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ZLQQ4RXGPFEKRJ5VFXV6PQ2KUM-1.jpg 1283w, https://defence-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ZLQQ4RXGPFEKRJ5VFXV6PQ2KUM-1-300x182.jpg 300w, https://defence-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ZLQQ4RXGPFEKRJ5VFXV6PQ2KUM-1-768x466.jpg 768w, https://defence-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ZLQQ4RXGPFEKRJ5VFXV6PQ2KUM-1-1024x622.jpg 1024w, https://defence-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ZLQQ4RXGPFEKRJ5VFXV6PQ2KUM-1-750x455.jpg 750w, https://defence-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ZLQQ4RXGPFEKRJ5VFXV6PQ2KUM-1-1140x692.jpg 1140w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1283px) 100vw, 1283px\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_44414\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-44414\" style=\"width: 1297px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\u003e\u003cimg class=\"size-full wp-image-44414\" src=\"https://defence-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/5201971.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1297\" height=\"865\" srcset=\"https://defence-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/5201971.jpg 1297w, https://defence-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/5201971-300x200.jpg 300w, https://defence-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/5201971-768x512.jpg 768w, https://defence-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/5201971-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://defence-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/5201971-750x500.jpg 750w, https://defence-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/5201971-1140x760.jpg 1140w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1297px) 100vw, 1297px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-44414\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"\u003eCompetitors in the United States Army Special Operations Command International Sniper Competition engage targets on a night live-fire range on Fort Bragg, North Carolina, March 20, 2019.

But none of those maybes came true.

Now there is also some hope, not just for Murad but for the relatives of all the 21,000 people who have died or gone missing trying to cross the Mediterranean since 2011.

In this sterile, highly-regulated environment, test tubes and refrigeration units store bone fragments, blood samples, and other DNA samples from some of the most harrowing events of the last few decades. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eSince its founding in 1996, the International Commission on Missing Persons (ICMP) has quietly pioneered some of the most advanced DNA identification technology in the world. It began work at the request of President Bill Clinton to try and identify the 40,000 people missing in the wars in the former Yugoslavia. In the last two decades, it has put a name to 70% of those victims, and its work on that conflict continues. In 2015, the ICMP moved its main office from Sarajevo to The Hague \u0026mdash; a city already home to other peace and justice-based institutions such as the International Criminal Court \u0026mdash; reflecting the expansion of its work. Today, it employs more than 140 people and is called on for any event where large numbers have gone missing \u0026ndash; Hurricane Katrina, the 2004 Asian tsunami, the MH17 crash over Ukraine, the California wildfires, and the recent wars in Syria and Iraq. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eBut its newest endeavor may be one of the hardest yet. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003e\u0026ldquo;It is unprecedented,\u0026rdquo; says Kathryne Bomberger, Director-General of the ICMP. \u0026ldquo;Europe hasn\u0026rsquo;t experienced such a large number of missing persons in a long time, and they are missing migrants.\u0026rdquo; In these politically-volatile times, when nationalist parties have made inroads across Europe, the ICMP\u0026rsquo;s task is even more difficult. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003e\u0026ldquo;You can use the best technologies in the world,\u0026rdquo; Bomberger says, \u0026ldquo;but the political will in the end is what matters the most.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eThe mechanics of the process are simple in theory: the countries that have found migrant bodies on their soil \u0026#8212; mostly southern European nations like Italy, Greece, Malta and Spain \u0026#8212; would take DNA samples and any other identifying characteristics and upload this information to a centralized database maintained by the ICMP. Meanwhile, anyone searching for a missing relative would fill in a form and give a DNA sample using a simple saliva or pin-prick blood test that can be done at home. The results of that are uploaded to a second database, and the two data sets are then compared for matches. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eBut none of this will happen without the full support of the governments involved, and the hundreds of thousands of refugees who survived the journey to Europe now face a surge in support for far-right leaders. For such politicians, \u0026ldquo;these people [are] without value, and particularly in death they deserve nothing from us,\u0026rdquo; says Simon Robins, a researcher on missing migrants with the University of York\u0026rsquo;s Centre for Applied Human Rights.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003e\u0026ldquo;If you find a body in London on the street, the authorities would make every effort to identify it,\u0026rdquo; says Robins. But when a body washes up on a beach in Greece or Italy, \u0026ldquo;the fact that that person\u0026rsquo;s racial origins suggest they may not be a citizen means that no investigation is conducted.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eAnd relatives of those who died in the Mediterranean have very little lobbying power. Many of the shipwreck survivors who make it to Europe are not able to vote. Family members in countries of origin are usually very poor or living in war zones. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eBomberger says the ICMP started pressuring governments to work on identifying missing migrants in 2011, when the Arab Spring led to the first large groups of refugees crossing the Mediterranean in overcrowded boats, and death tolls started to rise. The ICMP received $400,000 from the Swiss government in late 2017 \u0026mdash; just about enough money to start the first phase of the project: bringing Italy, Greece, Malta and Cyprus together to sign an agreement and start work on the technicalities of the search.

Bodies washed up on beaches, and no one knew what to do with them. Giorgia Mirto, a field researcher on border deaths attached to the University of Bologna, describes haphazard record-keeping in Italy and no systematic procedure to take DNA samples from bodies or bury victims from the same shipwreck together. After 2013, when two high-profile shipwrecks prompted more scrutiny, a protocol for dealing with the recovered bodies was developed. But Mirto says it\u0026rsquo;s not clear if every municipality is following the correct procedures. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eRobins, who traveled to the Greek island of Lesbos for research during the crisis, describes a similar situation there. In the summer of 2015, at least 3,000 people were arriving on Lesbos per day, and hundreds were dying each day. Bodies were stacked in freezer containers. Graveyards ran out of space.

Even that estimate of 21,000 may not be accurate; it comes from deaths and missing persons reported by family members and shipwreck survivors, and from bodies actually retrieved and buried. People working in the field say the number is likely much higher. Mirto says that previous research done between 1990 and 2013 showed that around 27% of people believed to have been killed in migration were found and identified, but she thinks that figure would be lower now. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eThousands of people likely remain at the bottom of the sea, trapped in the rotting wood of the vessels they thought would save them, their underwater coffins preventing them from floating to the surface. It is highly unlikely any country will cover the huge expense of trawling the seabed. And some people may still be alive. EUROPOL, the European Union\u0026rsquo;s law enforcement agency, estimates that around 10,000 children have gone missing during migration, some left waiting in refugee centers for parents who may never come, others trafficked and exploited. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eWorking out where all the records \u0026#8212; and the bodies \u0026#8212; are is the ICMP\u0026rsquo;s first task.

country is better equipped to win a US-China trade war?","content":"\u003cp\u003eBy Eswar Prasad\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe United States and China are clearly on a collision course. Chinese companies abscond with intellectual property, and President Trump introduces tariffs on Chinese goods; President Xi Jinping responds with his own levies, so Trump adds more. China allows the value of its currency to fall, and the United States \u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/china-lets-currency-plunge-below-7-a-decade-low-after-trump-adds-new-tariffs/2019/08/05/c7415db6-b754-11e9-8e83-4e6687e99814_story.html\"\u003ebrands\u003c/a\u003e it a currency manipulator. We are now on the verge of all-out economic warfare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese are the world’s two largest economies, and the collapse of trade between them would hardly bring either one to a grinding halt. But the combatants are not evenly matched. China might seem in a better position to cope with a trade war, since it is a heavily managed economy and the government squashes political resistance. Yet its every maneuver carries enormous risks. Meanwhile, Trump, who manages a durable and flexible economy, is not exactly seeking victory for the American way of doing business. His approach, in some ways right out of Beijing’s playbook, would make our economy quite a bit more like China’s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe breakdown in trade between the two countries is already causing pain in both economies, as \u003ca href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-05/farm-groups-sound-alarm-over-trump-s-china-trade-war-escalation\"\u003esoybean farmers\u003c/a\u003e in the Midwest and Chinese \u003ca href=\"https://www.scmp.com/economy/global-economy/article/3016490/chinas-textile-capital-suzhou-was-struggling-trade-war\"\u003etextile exporters\u003c/a\u003e in Guangzhou can attest. The battle will intensify if rising tensions close off investment flows and dampen the movement of tourists and students between two countries. But the U.S. economy is about 50 percent larger than China’s, and is less dependent on trade, so its prospects look better. And China exports more to the United States than it imports from the United States (a fact that clearly riles up Trump and was a key instigator for the trade war). So the near-term pain will be greater for China.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Beijing does have some advantages. One is the structure of its (mostly) command economy, which is dominated by state enterprises. The majority of banks in China are also state-owned, making it easy for the government to generate a surge of cheap credit—and the subsequent investment that boosts growth. The second advantage is the structure of China’s political system, in which dissent is easier to shut down and bad news about the trade war can be filtered out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, even a state-dominated economy with many economic weapons has to be cautious about which ones it uses; some of them could backfire badly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of China’s greatest weapons in a trade war is its ability to disrupt the work of American companies that want to sell into China’s enormous and fast-growing markets or that use China as part of their global supply chains. But other foreign companies and investors could also begin to see China as an unpredictable and volatile business environment, unconstrained by the rule of law. This would hurt China’s plans for modernizing its economy with the help of foreign investments and foreign technological and managerial expertise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChina could also further cheapen the value of its currency, the renminbi, to offset U.S. tariffs. Here, too, the government faces constraints. Fear of a major devaluation could cause foreign investors to pull their money out of China, and domestic investors might follow. This happened in 2014-15, when a modest government-orchestrated devaluation \u003ca href=\"http://www.paulsoninstitute.org/paulson-blog/2016/12/07/eswar-prasad-on-chinas-growing-currency-challenges/\"\u003eset off\u003c/a\u003e panic-driven capital outflows in anticipation of further depreciation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoreover, even an autocratic government cannot count on getting carte blanche from its people. Xi is not immune to domestic political pressures and must carefully manage the tricky balance between using nationalist sentiments as a rallying cry and actually delivering good economic performance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheoretically, China can stimulate a flagging economy by ordering a burst of investment that boosts gross domestic product growth in the short term. But this would probably generate more bad loans in an already \u003ca href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-banks-results/chinas-top-banks-warn-of-fragile-bad-loans-scenario-as-economy-slows-idUSKCN1RA077\"\u003efragile\u003c/a\u003e banking system. A protracted trade war would also halt even modest momentum toward market-oriented reforms, a putative \u003ca href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-congress-economy-reforms/xi-says-china-will-continue-to-open-its-economy-deepen-financial-reforms-idUSKBN1CN09K\"\u003eobjective\u003c/a\u003e of the Chinese government. This would hurt the economy’s long-term growth prospects. And China’s plan to shift the focus of its economy from staid and inefficient state enterprises to high-productivity and high-value industries will fall short if it loses access to technology from the United States and other Western nations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn some ways, Trump seems more constrained than Xi because of America’s democratic political system, its more laissez-faire economy and the limits on his executive power. But he, too, has some elements in his favor as he does battle with China. Trump has the advantage of managing an economy that is enormously flexible and resilient. And getting tough on China \u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/08/07/democrats-struggle-present-united-front-trumps-trade-war/\"\u003eresonates\u003c/a\u003e not just with his political base but even with Democrats, many of whom have long called for aggressive U.S. action against Chinese trade and currency practices, even if they disagree with Trump on tactics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet in exercising his power, he could end up making America’s economy a bit more like the state-dominated one operated by Beijing—and, in so doing, permanently damage the U.S. free market. To rescue the agricultural sector from the consequences of the trade war, Trump has already \u003ca href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fcf5f5c8-aee6-11e9-8030-530adfa879c2\"\u003edispatched\u003c/a\u003e $28 billion in government subsidies. He has also jawboned American companies to move their production bases back to U.S. shores, rather than letting them make their own commercial decisions. Trump has even \u003ca href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/trump-tweets-fed-attack-says-it-should-cut-rates-faster-2019-8-1028427560\"\u003epressured\u003c/a\u003e the Federal Reserve, whose independence is seen as sacrosanct, to lower interest rates and \u003ca href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-28/trump-wants-fed-to-weaken-dollar-powell-says-that-s-not-his-job\"\u003esuggested\u003c/a\u003e that the Fed should help drive down the value of the dollar. With such moves, he risks undermining the true strengths of the United States: the institutions that make the U.S. dollar and the American financial system so dominant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat’s worse, Trump suggests that the rule of law is up for negotiation. After imposing sanctions on Chinese technology companies such as ZTE and Huawei for running afoul of U.S. rules, he \u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/05/13/trump-pledges-to-help-chinese-phone-maker-zte-get-back-into-business/\"\u003ehinted\u003c/a\u003e that those sanctions could be negotiated away as part of a trade deal.

In that model, Trump sees something Washington should copy—and seems ready to abandon what makes the United States special.

A desire to offset China brought the two countries closer together in the past, and could do so again. A look to history, however, also shows that shared perceptions of an external threat from China are necessary, but insufficient, to bring India and the United States into a close and sustained alignment: that requires agreement on the nature and urgency of the threat, as well as how to approach the threat strategically, economically, and ideologically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith its long view, \u003ci\u003eFateful Triangle\u003c/i\u003e offers insights for both present and future policymakers as they tackle a fateful, and evolving, triangle that has regional and global implications.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://www.brookings.edu/book/fateful-triangle/","published":"2019-08-12T20:29:20Z","guid":"https://www.brookings.edu/?post_type=book\u0026p=569509"}]},{"url":"https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/world/rss","items":[]},{"url":"https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/world/feed","items":[{"title":"US Suspects 7 Russians Killed in New 'Skyfall' Nuclear Missile Test - What Is Putin Plotting?","content":"","url":"http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/world/2019/august/us-suspects-7-russians-killed-in-new-skyfall-nuclear-missile-test-what-is-putin-plotting","published":"2019-08-12T18:52:03Z","guid":"http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/world/2019/august/us-suspects-7-russians-killed-in-new-skyfall-nuclear-missile-test-what-is-putin-plotting"}]},{"url":"https://www.pri.org/stories/feed/everything","items":[{"title":"South Korea’s ‘No Japan’ boycott is new.
