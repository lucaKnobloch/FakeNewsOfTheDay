Shiraz’s popularity became widespread and the variety was planted across the country, but it was often used as a blending grape. However, intrepid winemakers in the Barossa Valley—such as Dr. Christopher Rawson Penfold, founder of Penfold’s Grange—had a different experience with the grape in the region’s hot climate, and deemed Shiraz worthy of its own label. In the 1950s and 1960s, inspired by the winemaking in Bordeaux, new techniques were introduced at Penfold’s, which set the benchmark for decades to come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFast forward to the 1980’s and 1990’s, and Robert Parker, the arbiter of wine styles for several decades, gave perfect scores to the lush and ripe versions of Shiraz from estates like Penfold’s and Torbreck, setting off a barrage of copycats. “Australia had a reputation both internationally and domestically, of producing big, sweet, jammy styles of Shiraz with the Barossa leading the charge,” says Caroline Mooney, owner and winemaker of \u003ca href=\"https://birdonawirewines.com.au/\"\u003eBird on a Wire\u003c/a\u003e in the Yarra Valley. While some were very good, bottles of mediocre-quality wine with higher-than-average alcohol content were also being churned out; the flood of one-note wines meant Shiraz soon fell out of favor with the drinking public.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eDefining Terroir \u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor many winemakers, Shiraz’s downfall became a moment of reckoning; they saw it as an opportunity to talk about terroir and educate drinkers on the climactic diversity of the country. “When Bird on a Wire started [in 2008], there was a need to differentiate cool climate Shiraz, chasing a more elegant, savory, and fine tannin profile,” Mooney says, “And to offer an explanation as to why not all Australian Shiraz needed to be 16% alcohol and jammy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Sexton-Vineyard-sunrise-copy-2.jpg?w=683\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2679743\" srcset=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Sexton-Vineyard-sunrise-copy-2.jpg 4680w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Sexton-Vineyard-sunrise-copy-2.jpg?resize=100,150 100w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Sexton-Vineyard-sunrise-copy-2.jpg?resize=200,300 200w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Sexton-Vineyard-sunrise-copy-2.jpg?resize=768,1152 768w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Sexton-Vineyard-sunrise-copy-2.jpg?resize=683,1024 683w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Sexton-Vineyard-sunrise-copy-2.jpg?resize=141,212 141w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Sexton-Vineyard-sunrise-copy-2.jpg?resize=335,503 335w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Sexton-Vineyard-sunrise-copy-2.jpg?resize=67,100 67w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Sexton-Vineyard-sunrise-copy-2.jpg?resize=40,60 40w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Sexton-Vineyard-sunrise-copy-2.jpg?resize=103,154 103w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Sexton-Vineyard-sunrise-copy-2.jpg?resize=720,1080 720w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Sexton-Vineyard-sunrise-copy-2.jpg?resize=263,394 263w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Sexton-Vineyard-sunrise-copy-2.jpg?resize=392,588 392w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Sexton-Vineyard-sunrise-copy-2.jpg?resize=112,168 112w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Sexton-Vineyard-sunrise-copy-2.jpg?resize=310,465 310w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Sexton-Vineyard-sunrise-copy-2.jpg?resize=104,156 104w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Sexton-Vineyard-sunrise-copy-2.jpg?resize=222,333 222w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Sexton-Vineyard-sunrise-copy-2.jpg?resize=257,385 257w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Sexton-Vineyard-sunrise-copy-2.jpg?resize=533,800 533w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Sexton-Vineyard-sunrise-copy-2.jpg?resize=80,120 80w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Sexton-Vineyard-sunrise-copy-2.jpg?resize=82,123 82w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Sexton-Vineyard-sunrise-copy-2.jpg?resize=115,173 115w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Sexton-Vineyard-sunrise-copy-2.jpg?resize=328,492 328w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Sexton-Vineyard-sunrise-copy-2.jpg?resize=345,518 345w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 4680px) 100vw, 4680px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eSunrise on the Sexton Vineyard at Giant Steps Winery in the Yarra Valley.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"image-credit\"\u003eGiant Steps\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eProducers in places like the Yarra Valley and Adelaide Hills, with their cool-climate profiles, adapted the French name, Syrah, to signify the soul of the style they sought. “We wanted to differentiate cool climate Syrah—a highly perfumed, spicy, savory red wine—from the warmer climate, larger wines that people have historically associated with the varietal name Shiraz,” explains Steve Flamsteed, winemaker at \u003ca href=\"https://www.giantstepswine.com.au/\"\u003eGiant Steps\u003c/a\u003e in the Yarra Valley.

Although he says he makes his Shiraz “in somewhat of a Syrah style, I think [Syrah] is more a cold climate nomenclature.

As in the lobster soup the balance of acid and fat is a thrilling high-wire walk. It’s a hallmark of the cooking at Slippurinn, and of Icelandic food in general.

Slippurinn is a family affair: “We all focus on different things in but in a small business like this you need to be able to do a lot of things. My mom, Kata, is the headwaiter and gardener. My dad, Auðunn, is a fisherman and does everything necessary to keep the place alive with his carpenter skills. And my sister Indíana designed the place.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIndíana kept the building’s industrial bones, warming them up with wood tables, secondhand sofas, groovy lamps, and potted plants. A shelving unit constructed from old ladders anchors one wall of the dining room, displaying dog-eared cookbooks, matte ceramics, and vintage tools. Huge windows line another, overlooking the concrete docks where be-wooled passengers disembark from boutique cruise ships and fishermen shuttle their catches between blue-and-white warehouses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eCod powers the local trade, and doesn’t have to travel far up to the Slippurinn kitchen, where Matt dehydrates and fries its skin into chicharron. A pharaonic gold dusting of nutritional yeast and seaweed exponentially ups the chips’ marine umami. The accompanying tangy, herbal dip of strained buttermilk, lovage, lemon zest, and lumpfish roe calls to mind Greek taramasalata on a Nordic holiday. The cod’s flesh, meanwhile, becomes fish cakes as fluffy as French quenelles. The golden, racquetball-sized cakes are plated in ring with lacy caramelized onions, buttery mashed potatoes, and magenta dabs of rhubarb jam that electrify the whole dish like lights on a Christmas wreath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Slippurinn-Iceland-Family-Business.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Slippurinn-Iceland Family Business\" class=\"wp-image-2679686\" srcset=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Slippurinn-Iceland-Family-Business.jpg 2880w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Slippurinn-Iceland-Family-Business.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Slippurinn-Iceland-Family-Business.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Slippurinn-Iceland-Family-Business.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Slippurinn-Iceland-Family-Business.jpg?resize=1024,683 1024w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Slippurinn-Iceland-Family-Business.jpg?resize=281,187 281w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Slippurinn-Iceland-Family-Business.jpg?resize=755,503 755w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Slippurinn-Iceland-Family-Business.jpg?resize=100,67 100w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Slippurinn-Iceland-Family-Business.jpg?resize=60,40 60w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Slippurinn-Iceland-Family-Business.jpg?resize=154,103 154w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Slippurinn-Iceland-Family-Business.jpg?resize=591,394 591w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Slippurinn-Iceland-Family-Business.jpg?resize=392,261 392w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Slippurinn-Iceland-Family-Business.jpg?resize=252,168 252w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Slippurinn-Iceland-Family-Business.jpg?resize=697,465 697w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Slippurinn-Iceland-Family-Business.jpg?resize=234,156 234w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Slippurinn-Iceland-Family-Business.jpg?resize=500,333 500w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Slippurinn-Iceland-Family-Business.jpg?resize=578,385 578w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Slippurinn-Iceland-Family-Business.jpg?resize=600,400 600w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Slippurinn-Iceland-Family-Business.jpg?resize=90,60 90w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Slippurinn-Iceland-Family-Business.jpg?resize=185,123 185w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Slippurinn-Iceland-Family-Business.jpg?resize=115,77 115w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Slippurinn-Iceland-Family-Business.jpg?resize=738,492 738w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Slippurinn-Iceland-Family-Business.jpg?resize=777,518 777w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2880px) 100vw, 2880px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eChef Gísli with his mom, the headwaiter and gardener, and sister, who designed the restaurant.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"image-credit\"\u003eCourtesy of Mali Lazel\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eRhubarb loves the endless sunlight of Icelandic summers, and given the season, its magenta fingerprints are all over Matt’s menu. Besides the fish cakes, the vegetable adds fruity acidity to a wild-tasting mountain lamb entrée consisting of a flat steak, cut from the leg, sliced and fanned around celery root crushed with hazelnuts. Rhubarb flavors the rum fizz from the cocktail menu styled like a botanical field guide, and at dinner, is baked with spent grains into a cake topped with angelica ice cream. There’s a gorgeous rhubarb cider on the wine list, too, made by Sveinn Steinsson, one of Matt’s former sous chefs from \u003ca href=\"http://maturogdrykkur.is/en/\"\u003eMatur og Drykkur\u003c/a\u003e, the acclaimed Reykjavik restaurant he opened in 2015 and sold to his partners the following year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition to Slippurinn, Matt also owns \u003ca href=\"http://skalrvk.com/\"\u003eSkál!\u003c/a\u003e, a \u003ca href=\"https://www.michelin.com/en/news/all-you-need-to-know-about-michelins-bib-gourmand-guide/\"\u003eMichelin Bib Gourmand\u003c/a\u003e award-winning bar in the capital’s first food hall, but his heart remains in the islands: “Slippurinn has, and always will be, my main focus.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eA Finishing Touch\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe single imperfect dish at Slippurinn is probably the prettiest: thick, flaky steaks of tusk, an Atlantic white fish that looks like a squatty eel, served in skillet of whiskey-whey sauce and festooned like a ceremonial offering with flowering blue beach herbs. It just needs salt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI find plenty of the salinity in a component of one of two desserts, shards of meringue that taste like black licorice aged in the sea air. The brittle meringue forms a teepee around layers of smooth, milk chocolate mousse, grassy chervil granita, and tart buttermilk foam. The combination of flavors has an alien, otherworldly quality, not unlike the Icelandic landscape, and I love it. The second dessert stars another plant slushy, made from lemony sorrel and strikingly emerald. It sits on a cloud of whipped skyr, and lest the whole set-up get too sour, toasted oats suspended in caramel ground it with deep stroke of cooked sugar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMatt says these ingredients reference “the nostalgic palate of Icelanders,” and there is no better way to indulge your inner kid, Icelandic or otherwise, than Slippurinn’s secret third dessert, the off-menu hot chocolate. Icelanders take cocoa seriously, and Slippurinn’s is no dump-and-stir situation. The barista crafts it like the most elaborate coffee beverage, layering shaved bittersweet chocolate, scalded milk, frothed milk, a pool of cool cream, grated chocolate, and a few flakes of sea salt into a speckled ceramic mug. The mug has no handle, so I cradle it in my hands and inhale the warm chocolate elixir, a moment of such hygge-ness it could have been contrived by an Instagram influencer. The rain’s not letting up outside, and that’s fine by me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eMore must-read stories from \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—The new Four Seasons brings a \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/04/philadelphia-four-seasons-restaurants/\"\u003epair of star-chef restaurants\u003c/a\u003e to Philadelphia\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—\u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/03/what-is-vietnamese-egg-coffee/\"\u003eVietnamese egg coffee\u003c/a\u003e is taking North America by storm–but what is it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—Why \u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/longform/charleston-restaurants-food-scene/\"\u003eCharleston’s food scene\u003c/a\u003e is stronger than ever right now\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—\u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/04/honolulu-best-restaurants/\"\u003eHonolulu\u0026#8217;s hottest restaurants\u003c/a\u003e take Hawaiian paradise beyond the beach\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—Listen to our new audio briefing, \u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/radio/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e 500 Daily\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://flipboard.com/@fortune\"\u003eFollow \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e on Flipboard\u003c/a\u003e to stay up-to-date on the latest news and analysis\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://fortune.com/longform/restaurant-review-slippurinn-iceland/","published":"2019-08-11T11:30:46Z","guid":"https://fortune.com/?post_type=longform\u0026p=2678009"},{"title":"H\u0026M and Zara Are Closing Stores To Get Ahead","content":"\n\u003cp\u003eEurope’s fast fashion giants may have been slow to wake up to the threat posed by e-commerce, but it looks more and more like they have raised their game enough to survive—and maybe even prosper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHennes \u0026amp; Mauritz, the Swedish company behind H\u0026amp;M, Monki and Weekday, and Spain-based Inditex (owner of Zara and Massimo Dutti) are both seeing the benefits of decisions taken last year to trim their networks of physical stores and throw more resources into online sales.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eEighteen months ago, H\u0026amp;M was still struggling with another makeover of its online store and seemingly hell bent on opening more stores that would never pay for themselves.

The results were notable for two reasons: one, its summer collections arrived with a bang, with sales rising 12% from a year earlier; second, it said it expected to whittle away its unsold inventory for the fourth quarter in a row, and forecast it would continue falling through the fiscal year-end.

After closing about 140 stores last year, H\u0026amp;M has revised down its plans for store openings this year from a net 175 worldwide to 130, and guidance for continued “optimization” of its store portfolio hints at further pruning. (A company spokeswoman declined to say whether the targets would see more revisions given the ongoing global slowdown.) Chief Executive Karl-Johan Persson told investors that some openings may be delayed while the company waits for more acceptable rent levels. More immediately, it’s cutting overcapacity in Europe, with a net reduction in H\u0026amp;M brand stores across the continent this year. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eZara parent Inditex, meanwhile, saw its global store count triple to nearly 7,500 under former CEO Pablo Isla. While some of that reflected a valuable diversification of the group’s portfolio to include upscale Massimo Dutti and youth-focus Bershka, the expansion left it with many stores that couldn’t pay their way in the age of e-commerce.

The Flushing location has been open since 2015 and offers its own “Barbie beef.” Along with a Seattle-area location that opened last year, the company also plans to expand to Boston. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/HDL_6.jpg?w=960\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2679719\" srcset=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/HDL_6.jpg 960w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/HDL_6.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/HDL_6.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/HDL_6.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/HDL_6.jpg?resize=212,212 212w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/HDL_6.jpg?resize=503,503 503w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/HDL_6.jpg?resize=100,100 100w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/HDL_6.jpg?resize=60,60 60w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/HDL_6.jpg?resize=154,154 154w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/HDL_6.jpg?resize=394,394 394w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/HDL_6.jpg?resize=392,392 392w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/HDL_6.jpg?resize=168,168 168w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/HDL_6.jpg?resize=465,465 465w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/HDL_6.jpg?resize=156,156 156w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/HDL_6.jpg?resize=333,333 333w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/HDL_6.jpg?resize=385,385 385w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/HDL_6.jpg?resize=600,600 600w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/HDL_6.jpg?resize=90,90 90w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/HDL_6.jpg?resize=123,123 123w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/HDL_6.jpg?resize=115,115 115w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/HDL_6.jpg?resize=492,492 492w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/HDL_6.jpg?resize=518,518 518w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/HDL_6.jpg?resize=912,912 912w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/HDL_6.jpg?resize=550,550 550w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/HDL_6.jpg?resize=470,470 470w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eHot pot with shrimp at Hai Di Lao.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"image-credit\"\u003eHaiDiLao\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIndividual pots of soup tear the meal away from the casualness of sharing, and presentation takes the front seat here: Seafood platters arrive with pomp, afloat in plumes of dry ice. Noodles arrive tucked into custom wooden beds; handmade meatballs look like works of art on pastel plates. Live spot prawns come arranged in a circle, facing upward, as if kneeling to say thank-you for the opportunity, a small bouquet of flowers nestled in the center. To keep the table from getting crowded, tiered racks turn plates of Wagyu beef cubes from clutter into a meat tower. To spare the kind of elegant clothing that one might wear to such a feast from the splatters of dipping, disposable bibs are provided. At the end of the meal, each diner gets a free soft-serve ice cream cone. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile this type of luxury spread is a decade or older in China, until recently it had made only small inroads into heavily Chinese-American enclaves in the U.S. But the current opening spree shows the widespread appeal: Hai Di Lao’s Seattle store will be in the heart of downtown Seattle, with a nearly 8,500-square-foot spot that will seat 300 people. At the time of the company’s IPO last year in Hong Kong, Hai Di Lao was opening a restaurant at a rate of one every three days and was valued at $12 billion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis means that we are just at the very beginning of the wave of Chinese hot pot chains coming into the U.S. Da Long Yi opened its first U.S. shop in Manhattan’s Chinatown earlier this year—specializing in tallow-frying ingredients before they are dipped.

But there's another influence at work in the wardrobe department, that of techwear luminary Errolson Hugh.

I know this because when I asked her a question at the Iowa State Fair on Friday afternoon, she leaned in close—very close.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Actually reaching people requires a more expanded conversation than just a conversation about externalities,” Williamson told me in a voice that was somehow both breathy and stern, her face inches from my own. I had just asked the 2020 candidate about her apparent \u003ca href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/2020-democratic-debate-marianne-williamson-says-we-wont-win-by-having-all-these-plans\"\u003eaversion to detailed policy plans\u003c/a\u003e, and in response, she’d explained that inspirational and unifying messages, more than concrete proposals, are what appeal to voters. “The part of the brain that rationally analyzes an issue is not the part of the brain that decides who to vote for,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWilliamson is the 67-year-old author of several popular self-help and advice books, is a confidant of Oprah Winfrey, and was the officiant at Elizabeth Taylor’s 1991 wedding at Michael Jackson’s Neverland Ranch. Her current occupation, though, is as a kind of motivational speaker for America, running for president on a platform based broadly on the motif that love always triumphs over hate. But while Williamson’s campaign has attracted the public’s curiosity—and encouraged its \u003ca href=\"https://www.wmagazine.com/story/marianne-williamson-first-debate-memes\"\u003ecreativity\u003c/a\u003e—she’s still not a top-tier candidate: She’s currently polling at less than 1 percent among likely Iowa Democratic caucus-goers, according to the \u003ca href=\"https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_ia_080819/\"\u003emost recent data\u003c/a\u003e from Monmouth University.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut you wouldn’t have known it at the state fair on Friday. Williamson floated through the fairgrounds like some sort of celestial being, unbothered by the harsh sun and perpetually surrounded by a throng of sweaty supporters demanding selfies and hoping to soak up some of her good vibes. Speaking at \u003cem\u003eThe Des Moines Register\u003c/em\u003e’s Political Soapbox, a mini stage where candidates take turns offering truncated stump speeches and fielding questions from curious Iowans, Williamson commanded a much larger crowd than either the entrepreneur Andrew Yang or former Representative John Delaney of Maryland, who had both spoken before her. The Iowans in attendance may well have known about her low polling numbers—and about recent criticism she’s generated with her comments on science and medicine—but they seemed drawn to her nonetheless.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“We have an amoral economic mind-set that has corrupted our government and hijacked our value systems,” she told the audience, standing onstage in wedge heels and a marbled, blue-and-mauve blazer as a quiet drumbeat played ominously from the speakers. The “conventional political establishment” is the problem, she said, to loud applause, and it’s time for the American people to wake up. “While it is true that sometimes Americans are slow to wake up,” she added, “once we do wake up, we slam it like nobody’s business!”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWilliamson’s eccentric performances in the first two presidential-primary debates are what put her on the map for many Americans: Hers was the most Googled name in the hours after the first debate, when, speaking in a quasi-Mid-Atlantic accent not unlike Katharine Hepburn’s, Williamson threatened to “harness love” to conquer President Donald Trump. In the second debate, she promised to combat the “dark, psychic force” of hatred in America, and offered a \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/08/democratic-debates-race-busing-trump-racist-tweets/595204/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eforceful argument\u003c/a\u003e for the payment of reparations to descendants of enslaved people in America.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/06/the-case-for-reparations/361631/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: The case for reparations\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlthough Williamson describes herself as a “pretty straight-line progressive Democrat,” she’s taken pains to set herself apart from the other liberal presidential hopefuls. She criticized Elizabeth Warren’s \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/10/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-2020-policies-platform.html\"\u003eoft-discussed plans\u003c/a\u003e in the first primary debate by labeling them “superficial fixes” to the much deeper problems facing the country. “If you think we’re going to beat Donald Trump by just having all these plans, you’ve got another thing coming,” Williamson said, citing America’s so-called sick-care system and the need for improved preventative care. “I’ve had a career not making political plans but harnessing the inspiration and the motivation and the excitement of people, masses of people,” she told the audience.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHer message seems to resonate with voters who view issues such as gun violence, the rising cost of health care, and climate change as symptoms of more profound societal problems. “Rather than just putting Band-Aids on things, she’s looking” deeper, Ken Golden, a 59-year-old from West Des Moines, told me. I met Golden at a booth for the Iowa Democratic Party, where Williamson was signing autographs for eager fairgoers. “Dude, it’s Marianne!” yelled one teenage boy to his friend, before the two made a beeline toward her to get a selfie. A team of mostly middle-aged women staffers followed her around, carrying clipboards and wearing purple T-shirts and pink baseball caps, in keeping with the campaign’s color scheme. They passed out metal buttons bearing a watercolor portrait of Williamson looking pensive, with a single lock of hair covering her left eye. At first glance, I thought it may have been a reimagining of the cover for “Space Oddity.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“I like what she talks about—the collective patriotism, the type of politics we’re getting nowadays and how toxic it is for our country,” Golden told me, not taking his eyes off Williamson, who was moving slowly toward us. “She just has a unique approach to politics.” When Williamson finally reached Golden, she greeted him and signed her name in swirly cursive on a campaign brochure. “For Ken,” she wrote, adding a small star as a flourish. (A Williamson fan on Twitter \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/rannie2dogs/status/1159888206046871552\"\u003eexplained to me\u003c/a\u003e that the star “stands for the light in each of us.”) Later, I watched as a mob cornered Williamson in the back of a souvenir shop; so many people were trying to speak with her that the store owner walked back to demand their immediate exit. “People are trying to shop!” she yelled at Williamson, before apologizing for being rude.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSome Democrats have observed this kind of frantic support for Williamson and raised alarm that she might be a left-wing Trump: a side-show candidate, dismissed by party officials and the media, who unexpectedly takes off. They’ve warned that her presently small following could quickly transform into something bigger. And many on the left argue that she’s a threat to public health, pointing to comments she’s made about modern medicine. Speaking at a campaign event in New Hampshire in June, Williamson \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/julesjester/status/1141517947518820359?s=21\"\u003ecalled\u003c/a\u003e mandatory vaccinations “Orwellian.” (She \u003ca href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/20/politics/marianne-williamson-2020-vaccines/index.html\"\u003elater said\u003c/a\u003e she “misspoke.”) The author \u003ca href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/454926-marianne-williamson-says-antidepressants-overprescribed-for-normal-human\"\u003ehas also criticized\u003c/a\u003e what she deems the overprescription of antidepressants. “You had a professional failure, you lost your job, you went bankrupt,” she \u003ca href=\"https://www.pscp.tv/BuzzFeedNews/1OdKrvVymmYKX?t=1m36s\"\u003etold \u003cem\u003eBuzzFeed News\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e \u003c/em\u003elast month. “Those things are very difficult, but they’re not a mental illness.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Marianne Williamson is genuinely dangerous and bad,” the \u003cem\u003eVox\u003c/em\u003e reporter German Lopez \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/germanrlopez/status/1156392579551956994\"\u003ewrote on Twitter\u003c/a\u003e last month. “At one point, Donald Trump was a funny joke to a lot of people.

The task will require convincing thousands more voters not only that she is a serious candidate, but that the country needs what she is selling: a “\u003ca href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-revolution-of-conscio_b_5574514\"\u003erevolution of consciousness\u003c/a\u003e” that she argues will set humanity on a path toward peace.

Her two most recent novels, \u003ci\u003eThe Little Red Chairs\u003c/i\u003e (2015) and \u003ci\u003eGirl\u003c/i\u003e, find her taking on subjects that a writer of her years and stature might sensibly avoid as too grim: \u003ca href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/04/25/edna-obriens-the-little-red-chairs\"\u003eSerbian war crimes in \u003ci\u003eThe Little Red Chairs\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, and now the barbarities of Boko Haram. In \u003ci\u003eGirl\u003c/i\u003e she even makes the daring choice to tell this terrible tale in the protagonist’s own words—an 88-year-old Irish woman speaking in the voice of a barely pubescent Nigerian girl. (Maryam isn’t quite sure how old she is.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat choice feels natural because, despite the obvious contrasts in circumstances, this girl isn’t so different from O’Brien’s young Irish heroines. She lives in a world that’s testing her, daring her to survive. And she survives, in part, by the act of writing about her ordeals. In a scrupulously hidden diary, she enters the stark details of what she endures, records the nightmares she has while sleeping and awake. “From dream to waking and back again,” she writes. “I cannot tell the difference.” Her matter-of-factness is heartbreaking, as she describes a brutal kidnapping, genital mutilation, repeated rapes, a forced marriage, a painful childbirth, a terrified flight through the forest, the puzzling remoteness of family and friends and officials, the anguish of believing that her baby is dead—and, ever present, chaos, hunger, fear, and self-doubt. The story her furtive diary entries tell has a stunned, muted tone, the flat affect of someone in shock.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is Maryam’s voice, in \u003ci\u003eGirl\u003c/i\u003e’s first sentences: “I was a girl once, but not any more. I smell. Blood dried and crusted all over me, and my wrapper in shreds. My insides, a morass. Hurtled through this forest that I saw, that first awful night, when I and my friends were snatched from the school.” It’s the deadened, illusionless voice of innocence abruptly lost, quickened here and there by little verbal sparks like \u003ci\u003emorass\u003c/i\u003e and \u003ci\u003ehurtled\u003c/i\u003e, signal flares of the soul. O’Brien has often written about women who are victims, but her women, even the very young ones like Maryam, are never only victims. They’re always fighting, often with no weapon but language, to keep hold of themselves and find a way home.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eGirl\u003c/i\u003e isn’t the book to read for the history of Boko Haram and its long assault on the peaceful citizens of Nigeria, or for a nuanced analysis of the country’s volatile politics. Scott MacEachern’s \u003ci\u003eSearching for Boko Haram: A History of Violence in Central Africa\u003c/i\u003e (2018) does those jobs admirably, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/01/cover-to-cover-the-chibok-girls/508784/?utm_source=feed\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe Chibok Girls: The Boko Haram Kidnappings and Islamist Militancy in Nigeria\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e (2016), by the Nigerian novelist Helon Habila, supplies more detail about the 2014 schoolgirl abductions on which O’Brien’s novel is loosely based. \u003ci\u003eGirl \u003c/i\u003eis the book to read for the sights and sounds and, yes, smells of some Nigerians’ harrowing experiences, and for a general sense of what it’s like to live in a world of radical, deadly unpredictability. Everything in \u003ci\u003eGirl \u003c/i\u003eseems to happen suddenly, out of the blue or in the darkness of deep night. The novel hurtles, as its heroine is hurtled, from one thing to another and another and another, with deranging, near-hallucinatory speed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe random-seeming quality of the storytelling is something new for O’Brien, whose usual pace is more measured and contemplative. The effect is disorienting, and it’s meant to be. I can’t think of another writer who so late in her career has so thoroughly reimagined herself and the practice of her art. She appears to have decided that the only way to do justice to her subject is this helter-skelter narrative style, in which events have no apparent logic, dreams and reality interpenetrate, and other voices, telling different stories or reciting learned myths and legends, keep bobbing up in the choppy course of Maryam’s tale.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe hear, in his own words, how a little boy named John-John was captured by the Jihadis; in her own words, how a schoolmate of Maryam’s made her escape; how an “oldish” man named Daran found his way to a crowded refugee camp; how the grandfather of a pilgrim called Esau slew a bull; and many other snatches of story, song, and even scripture, all recorded by the wandering girl Maryam as they were told to her. The rhythm of \u003ci\u003eGirl\u003c/i\u003e is intermittent and fearsomely strong; reading this novel is like riding the rapids.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd that, it seems to me, is what living in one of the world’s too-numerous war-ravaged places must be like. The violence is awful, but just as awful, in a way, is the day-to-day accommodation to relentless illogic and unreason—the creeping sense, at every moment, of certain disruption and displacement, sudden exile and loss. \u003ci\u003eGirl\u003c/i\u003e captures that sort of existential dread as well as any war novel I know. Early on, Maryam describes the day of her kidnapping: “We enter dense jungle, trees of all kinds, meshed together, taking us into their vile embrace. Nature had gone amok here.” That feeling of wrongness in nature is entirely new to her. Later, we learn that she had won a prize at school for an essay about trees, which did not seem then to embrace her vilely. Quite the contrary: “In our country we depend on trees for our lives,” she wrote.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eFor shelter in rain and for shade in sun. For food of many kinds. They are our second home … But the most important aspect of the tree is the Tree Spirit. Ancestors who have died live there and govern lives. They ward off evil. If these sacred trees are harmed or lopped or burnt, ancestors get very angry and sometimes take revenge. Crops fail and people go hungry. “Don’t step on the spirits,” my brother Yusuf would say when we did spells in there, tiptoeing over the bony roots that wound and knitted together. It was always at evening time. Birds did not roost there, but at certain times sang some song that was both inexplicably sweet and melancholy.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eShe dreams of this essay, at a moment when the very trees—her second home—have turned alien to her, malign. And when she wakes, in the Jihadis’ camp, she tells her diary: “I will never get out. I am here forever. I am asking God to please give me no more dreams. Make me blank. Empty me of all that was.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003caside class=\"callout-placeholder\" data-source=\"curated\"\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is a vision of hell: a girl, hardly begun in her life, wishing to be emptied of all that was. O’Brien has always been singularly alert to that sort of bleak emotion, especially when the despair is visited upon the young. It’s no more of a stretch for her to imagine the feelings of a Nigerian teenager than it was for her 16 years ago to find her way into the mind of another girl undone by war, \u003ca href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/features/edna-obrien-the-anger-of-heaven-is-nothing-to-the-anger-of-men-118602.html\"\u003ein her play \u003ci\u003eIphigenia\u003c/i\u003e, adapted from Euripides\u003c/a\u003e. Is the experience of a contemporary African girl really less accessible to a European writer of the 21st century than the Trojan War and the worldview of the ancient Greeks? Iphigenia discovers in the course of the play that her father, King Agamemnon, means to sacrifice her in order to appease the gods and, he hopes, reverse the flagging fortunes of the restive military he commands. That’s a girl whose world has turned on her. Iphigenia naturally pleads with her father at first: “Do not destroy me before my time … I love the light … do not despatch me down to the netherworld … hell is dark and creepy and I have no friends there … I am your child … I basked in your love.” But by the inevitable end, she’s telling her mother, “One must not love life too much.” She’s been emptied.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/unbound/interviews/ba2000-04-20.htm?utm_source=feed\"\u003eFrom April 2000: An interview with Edna O’Brien\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWar does that to people, and war, O’Brien knows, is a constant in history.

It’s like watching cats trying to play snooker, or Donald Trump trying to read a speech off a TelePrompter without breaking into an extemporaneous brag—it can’t be done. Shiv (Sarah Snook) can’t restrain herself from mocking someone’s PhD in Africana Studies. Connor (Alan Ruck) spirals into antagonism when someone utters the words “Brookings Institute.” Roman (Kieran Culkin) can’t even muster, upon request, the title of a single published book. “Watching you people melt down is the most deeply satisfying activity on the planet,” Naomi Pierce (Annabelle Dexter-Jones) tells Kendall (Jeremy Strong).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis satisfaction defined what it was like to watch Season 1 of \u003cem\u003eSuccession\u003c/em\u003e, a bitter, schadenfreude-flavored tonic to help digest the oily excesses of the 0.001 percent. The offspring of the diabolical media mogul Logan Roy (Brian Cox) are nasty, grossly overprivileged rats in a gilded barrel, sniping and biting each other as they try to ascend the swarm. Winning is the only concept that can permeate their psychological crusts; winning, for the Roy children, is also almost impossible given their avaricious, impulsive ogre of a father. To watch the first 10 episodes of the HBO show was to find bleak pleasure in awful people trying—and failing—to out-awful each other.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSomething changed \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/08/succession-finale-review-hbo/566855/?utm_source=feed\"\u003ein the Season 1 finale\u003c/a\u003e, though, when \u003cem\u003eSuccession\u003c/em\u003e’s occasionally dissonant modes of verbal absurdity and caustic family drama converged into tragedy. Strong’s Kendall, the ineffectual Hamlet to his father’s more dastardly Lear, went on a drug bender that led to the drowning death of a waiter at Shiv’s wedding. Before that moment, \u003cem\u003eSuccession\u003c/em\u003e had ostensibly been a show about an ailing Logan portioning out the pieces of his kingdom—trying to decide, like a Murdoch or a Redstone (or a Trump), which of his children most deserved to inherit the empire he’d spent his life accumulating. During Season 1, Kendall helped plan a hostile takeover of his father’s company, the announcement of which infuriated Logan as much as it seemed to earn his grudging respect. But Kendall’s Chappaquiddick catastrophe gave Logan one last card to play. “A rich kid kills a boy,” he told his sobbing son. “You’d never be anything else. Or, you know, it could be what it should be: Nothing at all. A sad little detail at a lovely wedding where father and son are reconciled.” The scene ended with Logan embracing Kendall, before passing him off to an associate to be taken away.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn Season 1, the Roys made for a delicious hate-watch. In Season 2, which takes the show to a level of insight and theatricality that rivals anything else on television this year, something has changed in the dynamic between characters and audience. You hate to feel it for these grasping brats, but there it is, anyway: pity. Roman is as snarkily useless as ever, Shiv as untrustworthy, Matthew Macfadyen’s Tom as majestically pompous and charisma-free. Kendall spends the first five episodes being more low-energy than a post-divorce Ross Geller, as hangdog as Droopy. Once, these ghastly people made for some mordant satire. Now, their damage is so suffocating that all you can do is cringe from the sidelines.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn case it’s unclear: Season 2 is extraordinary. Jesse Armstrong, the show’s creator, finds new levels of horror to mine in \u003cem\u003eSuccession\u003c/em\u003e’s autopsy of the ultra-rich, but he also finds pathos, which elevates the show even further. In the first scene, Kendall is “recharging” in a plunge pool at a Scandinavian rehab resort when he’s dragged, still dripping, to a TV appearance where he has to defend abandoning his takeover bid and returning to the Roy fold. Kendall goes through the motions, but his spirit seems to have evaporated. Strong is superb portraying a man so depressed that cocaine barely animates him (instead, it renders him only slightly less catatonic). Logan has given Kendall his lines, and Kendall repeats them over and over. All those skyscrapers littering the backdrop of the Roy corporate boardroom suddenly seem like so many shiny platforms for Kendall to eventually hurl himself from.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eSuccession\u003c/em\u003e is still replete with symbolism. In the first episode, Logan summons all his progeny to a meeting at his Hamptons house, where topiary is duly uncovered, Egyptian-cotton sheets laundered, and lobsters boiled for the family’s return. But the state of Roy is so rotten that a disgusting smell emanates throughout the manse. (“Open the doors!” Logan barks. “It smells like the cheesemonger died and left his dick in the brie.”) When the source of the odor is discovered, it somehow encapsulates both the deterioration of the Roy family unit and the way Logan’s venal practices are leaching out into the wider world.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFrom there, things only get grimmer. It feels like a cliché at this point to call a television show timely, but \u003cem\u003eSuccession\u003c/em\u003e’s ability to weave together plot points involving fascist newscasters, Facebook algorithms, media conglomerates, and even feral hogs is uncanny. The third episode, in which yet another catastrophic Roy conference leads to the breakdown of social mores, makes for one of the tensest, most excruciating hours of television in modern memory. Logan, his youngest son says in one moment, “can do whatever the fuck he likes. He’s like human Saudi Arabia.” To watch \u003cem\u003eSuccession\u003c/em\u003e is to see what happens when absolute power and unfettered id curdle into oppression in real time. When Cousin Greg (Nicholas Braun) weakly bleats that Logan isn’t obeying the rules, Logan bellows, “There are no rules.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile it’s still fair to say that there are no heroes in \u003cem\u003eSuccession\u003c/em\u003e—although Braun’s earnest, maladroit, and comically tall Greg comes close—the show’s investment in making you occasionally feel for its characters takes it into new terrain. The most boring characters, after all, are the ones who never surprise you. Armstrong’s family, unhappy in its own unique, Tolstoyan way, is also the stuff of classical tragedy, riddled with monsters and fated for hell. “Money wins,” Logan says in one episode, raising his glass for a toast. But his face is empty of discernible emotion, a void so gaping that no amount of money or winning can fill it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/-tQtP_Askvo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/-tQtP_Askvo/","published":"2019-08-11T12:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-595822"},{"title":"There’s More Than One Way to Fight Monopoly","content":"\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eFinally, the need for tougher antitrust enforcement is dawning on politicians across the American political spectrum. One company dominates online retail. Two ride-hailing companies dictate wages for hundreds of thousands of drivers. In agriculture, two chemical companies control the market for the most important seeds and have the leverage to gouge farmers. This is why a number of Democratic presidential contenders, including Bernie Sanders on the left and Amy Klobuchar in the center, have vowed to act against concentrated corporate power. Meanwhile, Donald Trump’s Department of Justice has initiated investigations of big tech companies.

The other, equally vital way to keep monopolies and near-monopolies in check is to build up the power of everyone else in the economy—the workers and small-business owners who, in making their livelihoods, must interact with ever-larger corporate giants. Especially when regulators stand down, ordinary people have to be able to join forces and create unions and cooperatives that could hold the largest corporations in check.

Jeffrey Epstein, 66, a wealthy white financier with many powerful friends and clients, was a previously convicted sex offender who was facing a new indictment on sex-trafficking charges when he died by suicide early yesterday in the federal Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in New York City.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSandra Bland, a 28-year-old African American woman, was driving to a new job in Texas in July 2015 when a state trooper pulled her over for failing to signal a lane change. Incredibly, the trooper transported Bland to the Waller County jail. Three days later, a jail officer found her hanging from a plastic garbage-can liner tied to a post in her cell. She had not been seen by any jail staff for more than 90 minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBoth cases led to a nationwide furor, as incredulous commentators searched for explanations. On social media yesterday, many people speculated, without evidence, about who besides Epstein might be responsible for his death. Tellingly, many criminal-justice experts pointed instead to a broader issue: Suicide has been a lingering problem in detention facilities, and systemic factors—such as inattention, understaffing, or inadequate training—generally offer a simpler explanation for a prisoner’s death than nefarious intent.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe New York Times\u003c/i\u003e and other outlets have reported that Epstein had attempted suicide a few weeks earlier, on July 23, but had been taken off suicide watch at the time of his death. The MCC is administered by the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Attorney General William Barr has ordered an investigation, declaring in a press release that he “was appalled to learn that Jeffrey Epstein was found dead early this morning from an apparent suicide while in federal custody. Mr. Epstein’s death raises serious questions that must be answered.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn Bland’s case, subsequent investigations found numerous deficiencies at the jail that included not only lapses in observation, but inadequate intake screening. Her death did not go unnoticed. In 2017, Texas enacted the Sandra Bland Act, which mandated that county jails develop better intake screening processes, as well as divert individuals with mental-health and substance-abuse issues toward treatment options. The legislation eased bail conditions for defendants with mental illnesses or intellectual disabilities and required that independent law-enforcement agencies better investigate jail deaths.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHundreds of individuals are thought to commit suicide each year in jails throughout the country, and suicide is still thought to be the leading cause of death in such facilities. Why such uncertainty? The U.S. Justice Department’s reporting program for deaths in correctional institutions has not released any data since 2016. The program was first established in 1990 to require the Justice Department to collect data on all deaths in custody from state and local authorities. As last reported in 2016, 2014 saw 372 suicides in local jails throughout the United States, resulting in a suicide rate of 50 deaths per 100,000 inmates. In state and federal prisons, 249 inmates died by suicide during 2014, resulting in a suicide rate of 20 deaths per 100,000 inmates.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat do these numbers mean? Several things. First, until 2014, there had been a significant decrease in the rate of suicide in jails throughout the United States. My studies of jail suicides for the Justice Department found that suicides had decreased by two-thirds over 20 years, from 107 per 100,000 inmates in 1986 to approximately 36 suicides per 100,000 inmates in 2006. Many believe that the suicide rate has continued to rise since the Justice Department’s last data dump in 2016, but we cannot be sure—because there are no data. In other words, the United States does not currently know how many inmates commit suicide in custody each year.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf course, many might ask: \u003cem\u003eWho cares?\u003c/em\u003e My answer has always been and continues to be the same. Preserving life is our moral and legal responsibility. Sandra Bland could have been our daughter, our sister, our loved one, our friend. Jeffrey Epstein was certainly not a sympathetic character, but his death, while perhaps leaving some victims relieved, deprives others of a sense of justice. We also need to remember the other victims in his case, including the first responders to the medical emergency yesterday, as well as those responsible for his care and custody.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe decline in inmate suicide rates from 1986 to 2006 suggests that many such deaths are preventable—and that the rate can go lower still. Over the years, greater general awareness of the problem, better training of all correctional and health-care personnel, more in-depth inquiry of suicide risk factors during the intake process, better design of physical facilities, and the continued threat of litigation reduced the numbers. We now know that Bland’s suicide certainly was preventable, and we await federal investigators to tell us whether Epstein’s death was.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSandra Bland’s death resulted in significant reform of local jail suicide-prevention practices in Texas. At a minimum, perhaps Jeffrey Epstein’s death will result in renewed efforts to require an accounting of the number of people that die in jails nationwide.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/6OSmSTJ0ufE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/6OSmSTJ0ufE/","published":"2019-08-11T10:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-595918"},{"title":"Democrats of All Ages Agree on Nothing","content":"\u003cp class=\"dropcap\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIf time travelers from a distant era—say, the 1992 presidential campaign—had dropped in on this summer’s Democratic debates, they’d be entitled to wonder just whose political party they’d stumbled upon.

But it’s also changed what’s ideologically acceptable.” (In fact, it seems beyond doubt that Hillary Clinton’s dominance of party processes and elders gave her a leg up in 2016.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eBen Rhodes, the former Obama speechwriter and deputy national security adviser, told me that the extent to which Trump has scrambled the country’s political culture has had a powerful impact on the Democrats. “One is the idea that politicians were mandated to play within an established set of lines, that were set by some perceived conventional wisdom, kind of goes out the window—Trump has tossed out a sense of ideological constraint,” Rhodes said. “And the other is the extent to which Trump has mobilized opposition. So Democrats are appalled by what he is doing to immigrants, and therefore may go beyond calling for the legalization of people who have been here a long time and move all the way to decriminalizing border crossings, because they see people in cages.” The party’s leftward drift, Rhodes said, “is both an emotional and intellectual response to Trump.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThat phenomenon was on full display during the first two debates, in which the most liberal candidates—such as Cory Booker, Bill de Blasio, Bernie Sanders, and to a lesser degree, Kamala Harris—portrayed both Clinton and Obama policies in a shockingly negative light. Obama, in this view, was not the president who finally delivered on the Democrats’ decades-long dream of expanding access to health care, but the man who left tens of millions of Americans without adequate insurance coverage. The next-wave Democrats characterized Obama not as the president who used bold and disputed executive action to protect undocumented immigrants brought to this country as children, but as the cold-eyed calculator who presided over a record number of deportations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eAnd Bill Clinton? His 1994 crime bill was mocked at the time of its passage as too soft because it included money for programs like “midnight basketball” and community policing, and its unpopular ban on assault weapons helped lead to the Democrats’ catastrophic loss of the House of Representatives that year. (Clinton accepted Republican proposals to stiffen prison sentences as the price for passing the bill, because conservative House Democrats who were vital to the overall bill’s passage declined to support the assault-weapons ban.) Now the crime bill—and its Senate quarterback, Joe Biden—are scorned as the progenitors of mass incarceration.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eRahm Emanuel, the former Clinton adviser and Obama chief of staff, told me he likens the current environment to the period following 1968, when Lyndon B. Johnson was succeeded by Richard Nixon, in a right-wing victory that exploited and exacerbated deep internal divisions in the Democratic Party, just as Trump’s ascendance has. Emanuel acknowledged that Johnson’s war in Vietnam makes the analogy imperfect—“unless you think the surge in Afghanistan counts as that, and I don’t”—but added, “We have seen this movie before.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e“Here’s the thing,” Emanuel told me. “Today’s progressives are more angry at Clinton and Obama than they are at Bush 43. Whether it’s Clinton’s ‘small ideas’ and welfare reform, or Obama’s Affordable Care Act without a public option—those are the things where they feel like there were missed moments for big, bold ideas. Really? And that’s what drives the energy. Yes, they’re angry at Trump. Yes, they’re angry at Bush. But a lot of the energy is directed at the fact that they don’t love those two presidents—which I’d remind everybody are the only two Democrats to get reelected since Franklin Roosevelt.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/07/democrats-want-have-it-both-ways-barack-obama/595270/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eDavid A.

But for anyone with a memory that extends beyond the advent of the internet, the distance that the 50-yard line has moved left can still seem stunning. It’s become a truism that Ronald Reagan could not win the nomination of today’s Republican Party, because his policies would be seen as far too liberal; the reverse may now be just as true for Obama and Clinton (leaving aside Clinton’s own obvious reevaluated reputation and vulnerabilities in the #MeToo-movement era).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003ePerhaps that’s only fitting. After all, Clintonism itself was born of a long-simmering fight for the soul of the party following Walter Mondale’s 1984 shellacking by Reagan. Together with such other moderate governors or former governors as Jerry Brown of California, Dick Lamm of Colorado, Bruce Babbitt of Arizona, Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, and Richard Riley of South Carolina, and congressional figures like Senators Sam Nunn of Georgia and Chuck Robb of Virginia, Clinton envisioned a “New Democratic Party.” Their efforts were bitterly contested by the party’s liberal wing, but Clinton’s 1992 victory vindicated his approach.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e“The point is that this contest between the progressive-liberal factions in the party and the centrist-moderate ones has a very long history,” Clinton’s White House press secretary Mike McCurry told me. “It has been there ever since the strong FDR, New Deal, World War II coalition began to dissolve in the late 1960s, race being the wedge issue that drove many southern Democrats to Nixon and the GOP. So we’ve been there, done that, and won when we accommodated the diversity in our party and expanded our political spectrum. That will be our challenge in 2020.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eMarcia Hale, a longtime Democratic operative who headed relations with state and local governments for the Clinton White House, told me she can hardly believe how far the dynamics have shifted since 1992, when Clinton campaigned on an overhaul of the welfare system, a modest tax cut for the middle class, and a pledge to extend health-insurance coverage. “What I can’t figure out is why they’re all trying to out-Bernie Bernie” on health care, she told me. “That may be where some people in Iowa are, but it’s not where the country is. It’s one thing to say you want to fix health care, and it’s another thing to say you want Medicare for All. These are a strong group of individuals with really different backgrounds, so it’s disheartening to see it go this way, so many falling in line. Let Bernie and Elizabeth Warren fight it out for that. I don’t know if the damage is permanent, but once you say these things, you’ve got to live with it.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIt’s a historiographic axiom that revolutions happen in times of rising expectations, and the Democrats’ leftward drift is no exception. “Obama accomplished a lot of progressive goals, but the nature of the progressive movement is that if Obama advanced the ball this far down the field, we want to advance it further,” Rhodes told me. “You wouldn’t be having a Medicare for All conversation if we didn’t have the Affordable Care Act. Legalization of gay marriage opened up the conversation about trans rights. I do think the strength of Bernie’s 2016 campaign mainstreamed ideas that previously had been on the far left.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eAdam Frankel, a longtime Obama campaign and White House speechwriter, notes another reality: Focus groups of the voters who went from Obama to Trump have found that such voters wanted change—change above all.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e“It’s all of these things that people are tired of—modulation, moderation,” Frankel told me. “Where Obama sought to weigh his firmly held principles against the reality of what seemed achievable, now we’re in an environment that regards that as quaint or even misguided. I think there’s a degree to which people’s freedom to say some of this stuff now is the result of his walking the line, and getting elected as the first black president. It’s not like you could have gotten away with saying a bunch of this stuff then.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eStill, Frankel said, the shift can be unsettling. “It totally does seem like an entirely different party,” he told me, recalling how the longtime John F.

There are ways to address that, though. Governments could use the extra money from the tax increase to compensate farmers for income losses or otherwise help them adjust to the new reality. In fact, that’s what Albert Stegemann, an agriculture spokesperson from Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats party, has \u003ca href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/germany-meat-tax-on-the-table-to-protect-the-climate/a-49924795\"\u003eproposed\u003c/a\u003e: “The additional tax revenue should be used to support livestock farmers to help them restructure.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"T4uHBw\"\u003eAn arguably more serious ethical worry is that a meat tax could have a negative health impact on low-income communities by depriving them of a source of much-needed calories. They often don’t have fully stocked grocery stores or farmers’ markets where they can buy nutritious plant-based foods or high-quality produce, and even when those items are available, they can be more expensive.

So Jules goes off to the city without Rue, and Rue walks back home in tears, and then relapses upon her arrival.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"MaxOLK\"\u003eWe see Rue do a line of coke and collapse onto her bed. And then after a moment, she arches up, is apparently pulled out of bed by an unseen force, and begins stumbling through a … metaphorical music video?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"uOVRWr\"\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"\u003e\u003ciframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/k-9DOwrLdkg?rel=0\" style=\"border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"encrypted-media; accelerometer; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Dj50fL\"\u003eIf you can, I’d recommend just watching the video, because what happens next is difficult to describe. But here’s more or less how it goes: Walking jerkily, Rue lurches her way out of her bedroom and into her living room, where she embraces her unmoving and unaware family. Rue’s actress Zendaya is singing an original song in voiceover (\u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/7/15/20692091/zendaya-celebrity-explained-oscars-2015-dreadlocks-euphoria-spiderman-far-from-home\"\u003eZendaya, who came up on the Disney Channel\u003c/a\u003e, had a music career in addition to her acting career for awhile), and onscreen, Rue is mouthing along to the words, but slightly off-beat. Her dead father appears and twirls her around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Nt9vpA\"\u003eThen Rue finds herself in the street, surrounded by masses of dancing people wearing robes the exact color of the hoodie Rue took from her dad’s room after he died. The people form a pyramid, and Rue climbs to the top and then dives into the center of the pyramid, disappearing from the camera’s gaze. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"y5onuc\"\u003eIt’s a weird three minutes of television. It’s super weird! Watching it, I’m not at all sure I even like the scene. But I do think the scene marks an exciting turn for \u003cem\u003eEuphoria\u003c/em\u003e. If the show can figure itself out from here, this might be remembered as the moment where it found its inner \u003cem\u003eBuffy\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"W2Mnjy\"\u003eHeightened fantasy sequences have been part of \u003cem\u003eEuphoria\u003c/em\u003e’s vocabulary since Day 1. But generally, it saves them for moments of levity. It doesn’t use them to amplify its sincerity. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"tP8pcX\"\u003eIn this final sequence, \u003cem\u003eEuphoria\u003c/em\u003e finally peels away all its layers of smug, prepare-to-be-shocked pretension and exposes its deeply sincere, teenaged heart. This is Rue, who just sacrificed the person she fully believes to be the love of her life for her family’s sake, betraying her family in an act of self-destruction. And then — because \u003cem\u003eEuphoria\u003c/em\u003e wants us to feel everything just so deeply, the way you do when you’re a teenager — the show discovers that literal storytelling won’t capture the emotional truth of the moment. It has to layer a metaphor on top instead. We have to see Rue get pulled away from her family and let her addiction swallow her up whole. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"gPMMjq\"\u003eA teen show that can tap into that kind of storytelling again and again, that can capture exactly how it feels to be 16,\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eexperiencing everything with operatic intensity, has a shot at being a really great show. It’s exciting to think that, in its second season, \u003cem\u003eEuphoria\u003c/em\u003e might get there.\u003c/p\u003e","url":"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/8/11/20798641/euphoria-season-finale-recap-season-one-episode-eight-and-salt-the-earth-behind-you","published":"2019-08-11T17:30:00Z","guid":"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/8/11/20798641/euphoria-season-finale-recap-season-one-episode-eight-and-salt-the-earth-behind-you"}]},{"url":"https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml","items":[{"title":"Norway

The phrase reflects a sincere effort to take personal lives seriously by using the language and mechanisms of the corporate sphere. In a capitalist system, the word “labor” denotes worth. Running personal errands and buying birthday cake and spending hours talking through other people’s worries is valuable, it suggests, because they’re comparable to paid work. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eTo understand exactly \u003cem\u003ehow\u003c/em\u003e those activities are valued, though, we should work to recognize when a capitalist perspective is applied, and why. “I would love to see discussions of emotional labor include that further point,” says Dembroff. “Not only does emotional labor occur outside the workplace, but the reason it occurs outside the workplace is because our workplace is not constrained.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ePhrases such as \u0026#8220;emotional labor\u0026#8221; do not turn our home lives into a capitalist tool, but reflect that reality. The personal sphere has long catered to profit-making goals. Traditionally, men worked all day to earn a family wage, and women worked at home to produce future workers. The latest manifestation of capitalist feminism, the \u003c/span\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eLean In \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eapproach, was widely criticized for encouraging middle-class women to mimic men’s behavior: work all day and leave the household chores to a paid domestic worker, thus solving gender inequality by exacerbating class inequality. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eThe popular discussion around “emotional labor” attempts to challenge that value system. But it still relies on the capitalist framework. Dembroff says within academia, feminist care ethics (a field of philosophy focused on the ethics of caring) often combines terms such as “emotional labor” and “second shift” with “a critique of the reduction of value of personal relationships to capitalist values such as productivity and efficiency.” That critique is often left out in lay conversations. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eThere are non-capitalist ways to value activities outside the home. The capitalist reverence for making money is so widespread and deeply held that it’s difficult to see labelling activities “work” as anything other than a token of respect. But if we valued care over profit, surely we’d see more business people celebrated for their selflessness, rather than women applauded for taking managerial strategies to the home.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eIt can be difficult to notice capitalism’s influence; as the parable goes, fish are blind to water. Similarly, profit-focused values are hardly remarkable when they’re everywhere. Using corporate words to praise personal behavior is a small sign of just how deeply entrenched we are in a capitalist framework. Given this reality, perhaps there’s no better way to suggest that acts have value than to describe them as labor. But loving someone—whether a friend, parent, or partner—takes so much more thought and investment and insight than mere work. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://qz.com/1684675/feminist-capitalism-brought-emotional-labor-to-the-home/","published":"2019-08-11T10:00:01Z","guid":"https://qz.com/1684675/auto-draft/"},{"title":"North Korea is citing Donald Trump to justify its latest missile tests","content":"\u003cimg width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/north-korea-missile-test-e1565541116431.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;w=1024\" class=\"attachment-medium_10 size-medium_10 wp-post-image\" alt=\"North Korea test fires a new weapon in a photo released by KCNA on Aug. 11, 2019.\" /\u003e\u003cp\u003eNorth Korea \u003ca href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/10/north-korea-fires-two-projectiles-shortly-after-trump-dismissed-earlier-launches\"\u003efired off\u003c/a\u003e a new type of short-range missile yesterday (Aug. 10), the latest in a series of weapons tests rattling neighbors in recent weeks.

At points in the past, compass needles would point south instead of north. But look into the details of these transitions and things will get considerably more complicated.

And what is it about the \"geodynamo\" of Earth's liquid iron outer core that causes this behavior?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRecords of these transitions exist in several forms. Small bits of the mineral magnetite in sediment will tend to orient themselves with the Earth's magnetic field as they settle into place.

Doctors like Chang often rely on eye imaging to track the development of conditions like glaucoma. With enough scans, he reasoned, he \u003ca href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/alphabets-ai-predict-kidney-disease/\"\u003emight find patterns\u003c/a\u003e that could help him better interpret test results.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat is, if he could get his hands on enough data. Chang embarked on a journey that’s familiar to many medical researchers looking to dabble in machine learning. He started with his own patients, but that wasn’t nearly enough, since training AI algorithms can require thousands or even millions of data points. He filled out grants and appealed to collaborators at other universities. He went to donor registries, where people voluntarily bring their data for researchers to use. But pretty soon he hit a wall. The data he needed was tied up in complicated rules for sharing data. “I was basically begging for data,” Chang says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChang thinks he might soon have a workaround to the data problem: patients.

One, thankfully, is already in place; the decentralization of systems such that every state and county maintains its own, providing a bewildering panoply of varying targets, rather than a single tantalizing point of failure. A second, as security guru Bruce Schneier \u003ca href=\"https://www.theregister.co.uk/AMP/2019/08/09/schneier_voting_security/\"\u003epoints out\u003c/a\u003e, is to eschew electronic voting machines altogether and stick with good old-fashioned paper ballots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut paper ballots don\u0026#8217;t help much if you use machines to tabulate them, and those machines are compromised \u0026#8212; so it\u0026#8217;s especially worrying if those are, in engineering parlance, black boxes, i.e. machines which provide visibility only of their inputs and their outputs, not their inner workings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA solution to this black-box problem is to either tabulate by hand, or instantiate a separate audit process after each election. That means independently sampling and hand-counting a small fraction of the votes, ensuring that the audit result is statistically in line with the overall tally \u0026#8212; and if it isn\u0026#8217;t, increasing the sample size, up to and including a full recount.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe election threat model is broader than you might think. Researchers can, for instance, \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/ericgeller/status/1159992712013029377\"\u003etransform ballot images\u003c/a\u003e so that votes move imperceptibly. Which is one of many reasons why paper ballots are so critical. I have some good news there: as Politico\u0026#8217;s excellent \u003ca href=\"https://www.politico.com/interactives/2019/election-security-americas-voting-machines/\"\u003evoting machine interactive\u003c/a\u003e shows, most US states have and/or are moving to paper ballots (and most of the remainder were/are going to mostly vote for the party apparently \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/5/21/18629428/election-security-mitch-mcconnell-donald-trump-russia\"\u003eopposed\u003c/a\u003e to \u003ca href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/31/politics/election-day-holiday-republicans/index.html\"\u003edemocracy\u003c/a\u003e anyway.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe audit situation, though, is \u0026#8230; more complicated. Only 25 states require any audits of federal elections, for instance, and only some of those audits have teeth. Witness Verified Voting\u0026#8217;s superb interactive explainers of \u003ca href=\"https://www.verifiedvoting.org/resources/post-election-audits/\"\u003epost election audits\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://www.verifiedvoting.org/state-audit-laws/\"\u003estate audit laws\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0026#8217;t want to minimize the significance of secure voting machines and the Voting Village hackers\u0026#8217; work.

Like its 1994 predecessor \u003cem\u003eSystem Shock\u003c/em\u003e, it’s a cyberpunk game overstuffed with powers and weapons — you play as an unnamed soldier on a faster-than-light spaceship seemingly overrun by parasitic aliens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-float-right\"\u003e\u003caside id=\"5foz2y\"\u003e\u003cq\u003eSystem Shock 2 overwhelms you when you’re at your weakest\u003c/q\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"K3JYZg\"\u003eBut unlike its predecessor, which let you use any equipment you picked up, accessing these weapons and powers is hard. \u003cem\u003eSystem Shock 2\u003c/em\u003e uses a complicated upgrade system with draconian cutoffs for equipping important items. Your protagonist can be augmented into a super-hacker, a master of energy weapons and old-fashioned firearms, or a psychic warrior with pyrokinetic power and invisibility cloaking. He’s also highly vulnerable until you build up the right set of complementary upgrades, which requires progressing the plot long enough to earn dozens of rare “cyber modules.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ZbJi9x\"\u003eMeanwhile, the game overwhelms players with constantly deteriorating weapons and wandering enemies, wearing them down while they’re at their weakest, even as it dangles the promise of inhuman power in front of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"slWnys\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eSystem Shock 2’s\u003c/em\u003e first few hours can be brutally difficult as a result, reaching their lowest point on the aforementioned engineering level. It’s a series of corridors and shadowy cargo bays all designed to hammer every possible vulnerability.  Your dependable melee weapon becomes useless against a stream of kamikaze service droids. The hallways are full of laser turrets, deadly radiation leaks, and possessed former crewmates. The cargo bays are lined with dormant droids that could wake up at any minute. The rich sound design lets you hear enemies long before you see them, opening automatic doors in the distance or calling to you in tortured voices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"pZfYFo\"\u003eSurvival means figuring out which scarce resources you can waste, including your own health. Instead of trying to make your character feel realistic or human, the game pushes you to coldly embrace being a machine, hyper-optimizing every interaction with the world. If you encounter a bear-sized security robot, your most efficient option is often to run headlong into its body while flailing a wrench, hugging the safe space between its cattle-prod-like harm. Exploiting the occasional genuine bug — like a single pistol that never degrades, found in the game’s later sections — doesn’t even feel like cheating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"FhTosT\"\u003eAnd this kind of calculated play makes perfect sense in the \u003cem\u003eSystem Shock\u003c/em\u003e universe, where traditional cyberpunk corporate wars have given way to a ruthless monopoly that approaches totalitarian socialism. Both games effectively take place in hermetically sealed, spacebound company towns. The original is set in a space station called Citadel, the sequel on a ship called the \u003cem\u003eVon Braun\u003c/em\u003e, run by the sinister TriOptimum Corporation and a toothless futuristic United Nations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-float-right\"\u003e\u003caside id=\"9oYKcP\"\u003e\u003cq\u003eTraditional cyberpunk corporate wars have given way to ruthless monopoly\u003c/q\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"0VTvKb\"\u003eThe \u003cem\u003eVon Braun’s\u003c/em\u003e living areas are bland and sterile, strewn with potted plants and art screens that cycle between a handful of fuzzy paintings. Money has technically been abolished, but you still have to “buy” egregiously expensive products from \u003cem\u003eStar Trek-\u003c/em\u003estyle replicators using nanite construction material. Human enemies are horrifically transformed monsters, but TriOptimum-constructed mechanical ones are unsettlingly emotionless or even chipper — the service droids hunt you down to cheerfully ask if you need help with anything, then explode in your face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"rEWEQb\"\u003eUnlike scads of other cyberpunk games, including the upcoming \u003cem\u003eCyberpunk 2077\u003c/em\u003e, there’s no room for hip countercultural rebellion in \u003cem\u003eSystem Shock\u003c/em\u003e. Its big conflicts turn out to be an accidental byproduct of corporate infighting. \u003cem\u003eSystem Shock 2’s\u003c/em\u003e “aliens” first appear to come from Tau Ceti. They’re actually the creations of a rogue TriOptimum AI named SHODAN, who is the villain of \u003cem\u003eSystem Shock\u003c/em\u003e, but secretly guides the player through much of \u003cem\u003eSystem Shock 2 \u003c/em\u003ebefore revealing her existence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"G7PW9v\"\u003eAs you form an uneasy alliance with SHODAN, she pushes you to leave your weak flesh behind by continuously upgrading your body.

McCain collided with the Alnic MC, a Liberian oil tanker, off the coast of Singapore. The report provides a detailed overview of the actions that led to the collision: when crew members tried to split throttle and steering control between consoles, they lost control of the ship, putting it into the path of the tanker. The crash killed 10 sailors and injured 48 aboard the McCain. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"jSCHbc\"\u003eThe report says that while fatigue and lack of training played a role in the accident, the design of the ship’s control console were also contributing factors. Located in the middle of the McCain’s bridge, the Ship’s Control Console (SCC) features a pair of touch-screens on both the Helm and Lee Helm stations, through which the crew could steer and propel the ship. Investigators found that the crew had placed it in “backup manual mode,” which removed computer-assisted help, because it allowed for “more direct form of communication between steering and the SSC.” That setting meant that any crew member at another station could take over steering operations, and when the crew tried to regain control of the ship from multiple stations, control “shifted from the lee helm, to aft steering, to the helm, and back to aft steering.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-float-right\"\u003e\u003caside id=\"pNNLs7\"\u003e\u003cq\u003eThe ship’s touchscreen controls and procedures were overly complicated\u003c/q\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"x6oAhS\"\u003eThe NTSB report calls out the configuration of the bridge’s systems, pointing out that the decision to transfer controls while in the strait helped lead to the accident, and that the procedures for transferring the controls from one station to another were complicated, further contributing to the confusion. Specifically, the board points to the touchscreens on the bridge, noting that mechanical throttles are generally preferred because “they provide both immediate and tactile feedback to the operator.” The report notes that had mechanical controls been present, the helmsmen would have likely been alerted that there was an issue early on, and recommends that the Navy better adhere to better design standards. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"mYiKd8\"\u003eFollowing the incident, the Navy conducted fleet-wide surveys, and according to Rear Admiral Bill Galinis, the Program Executive Officer for Ships, personnel indicated that they would prefer mechanical controls. Speaking before a recent Navy symposium, he described the controls as falling under the “‘just because you can doesn’t mean you should’ category,” and that ship systems were simply too complicated. He also noted that they’re looking into the design of other ships to see if they can  bring some system commonalities between different ship classes. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-float-left\"\u003e\u003caside id=\"mWXxtt\"\u003e\u003cq\u003eThe Navy will begin to replace the controls in the summer of 2020 \u003c/q\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"uKCXno\"\u003eAdmiral Galinis tells \u003cem\u003eUSNI News\u003c/em\u003e that plans are currently underway to switch out the systems. “We’re already in the contracting process, and it’s going to come on almost as a kit that’s relatively easy to install.” According to the Naval Sea Systems Command, all \u003cem\u003eArleigh Burke\u003c/em\u003e class destroyers with the Integrated Bridge and Navigation System will get physical throttles, beginning in the summer of 2020 with the USS \u003cem\u003eRamage. \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"g9Vcwm\"\u003eTouchscreens weren’t the only issue in the collision: the report calls out that several crew members on the bridge at the time weren’t familiar with the systems that they were overseeing and were inexperienced in their roles, and that many were fatigued, with an average of 4.9 hours of sleep between the 14 crew members present. The report recommended that the Navy conduct better training for the bridge systems, update the controls and associated documentation, and ensure that Navy personnel aren’t tired when they’re on the job. \u003c/p\u003e","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/11/20800111/us-navy-uss-john-s-mccain-crash-ntsb-report-touchscreen-mechanical-controls","published":"2019-08-11T15:19:48Z","guid":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/11/20800111/us-navy-uss-john-s-mccain-crash-ntsb-report-touchscreen-mechanical-controls"},{"title":"How to sync all your fitness activities with Google Fit","content":"\u003cimg alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OnDKsPpHlQ15zenMsNYQf-J7Hqc=/47x0:790x495/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/64991637/google_fit_dark_mode.0.png\" /\u003e\n\n\n  \u003cp id=\"Gcj5o0\"\u003eThere are many excellent fitness tracking apps, but the best ones tend to focus on a particular type of exercise, such as running, cycling, or yoga.

hospital and rode his motorcycle to his home in Matagalpa, Nicaragua, to pick up a change of clothes for his wife. On his way back, he was stopped at a police checkpoint and taken into custody. Police officers questioned him for hours about his father, a former mayor and member of the opposition party to Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega. At one point, a police detective pushed Augusto into a windowless room and beat him with a plastic Pepsi bottle loaded with sand. The next morning, caked with blood and bruised to a pulp, Augusto was released without charges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe beating, along with more threats against his father, inspired Augusto to join in the \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/11/11/nicaragua-protests-terrorism-daniel-ortega/\"\u003emass protests\u003c/a\u003e against the Ortega government that erupted in April 2018. A month later, a little after midnight on May 29, police broke down Augusto’s door, pulled him barely dressed out of his house, and took him back to the police station to question him again about his father. He was told that his father was accused of plotting a coup against Ortega, a charge Augusto strongly denies. (Augusto, like other asylum-seekers named in this story, is referred to by a pseudonym for his protection.) Scared to return home after his release — “They told me the next time they came, they were going to kill me” — he moved in with his grandfather. A couple months later, someone spray-painted “plomo, plomo, FSLN,” on his front door; \u0026#8220;plomo\u0026#8221; means \u0026#8220;lead\u0026#8221; in Spanish, in reference to a bullet, and FSLN is Ortega’s political party, the Sandinista National Liberation Front. To Augusto, it was a clear death threat. In the following days, Augusto, his father, and his sister-in-law decided to flee the country.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c!-- BLOCK(promote-promo)[0](%7B%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22crop%22%3A%22promo%22%2C%22promo%22%3A%22immigrants%22%7D) --\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"promote-embed\" data-promo=\"immigrants\" data-crop=\"promo\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c!-- END-BLOCK(promote-promo)[0] --\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter an arduous three-week trip, they made it to the U.S.-Mexico border in Juárez, Mexico. As they approached the port of entry, a man came up to them and told them that they needed to pay $300 each to access the bridge and cross into the United States. Not having the money, they walked a mile along the border until they saw a Border Patrol truck. They climbed the fence, dropped to their knees on American soil, put their hands behind their heads, and told the agent who approached them that they had come to the U.S. to ask for asylum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen in custody, Augusto had a brief interview with a Border Patrol agent, Daniel Chavira. Augusto explained again why he had come to the U.S., and said that he was seeking asylum and had a USB drive in his backpack full of evidence. Yet Chavira confiscated the USB drive (Augusto would never see it again) and recorded on the arrest report, using capital letters, that Augusto “stated that he DOES NOT fear harm and/or persecution should he be returned to his native country.” Chavira also wrote that Augusto intended to go to Los Angeles, “where he planned to reside and seek unauthorized employment.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither of those statements were true. But Augusto didn’t know at the time what the document claimed he had said, nor that contradictory information on a government document can severely complicate, or even completely derail, an asylum claim. And it would be months before Augusto, with the help of an immigration attorney, was able to stand before a judge to confront the concocted statements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eA Million Lies\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen an immigrant seeking to make an asylum claim has a run-in with federal authorities — either at the border or once inside the U.S. — the information recorded by those officials on various government forms can have a tremendous impact on their cases. One such form is the I-213, which Border Patrol or Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents fill out when they take a migrant into custody. Another is the I-867, a record of sworn statement and a standard part of the intake process. The statements written on these forms — whether or not they bear any resemblance to the truth — are incredibly difficult to disprove or override.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe I-213 specifically is akin to a police arrest report, summarizing an individual’s personal history, the circumstances of their arrest, and a narrative portion based on an interview with the migrant; in government parlance, it is a record of alleged “alienage” and “removability.” Border Patrol and ICE agents, who often have only perfunctory knowledge of asylum law, have total control as to what goes onto someone’s I-213. If an immigration officer writes that a migrant stated something that contradicts later testimony in front of a judge or on another government document, the contradiction can lead to an “adverse credibility determination.” That, in turn, can result in prolonged detention, denial of bond, or denial of asylum — then deportation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[1](%7B%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22right%22%7D) --\u003e\u003cblockquote class=\"stylized pull-right\" data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"right\"\u003e\u003c!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[1] --\u003eImmigration judges treat the I-213 as “sacrosanct.”\u003c!-- END-CONTENT(pullquote)[1] --\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c!-- END-BLOCK(pullquote)[1] --\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA private attorney in New Jersey, who did not want his name used for fear of retaliation from a judge, told The Intercept that one of his client’s I-213s stated that he had a criminal conviction, while in reality, criminal charges against his client had been dismissed. “Despite being given the actual certified disposition from the criminal court, the judge still was not convinced that the information in the I-213 was inaccurate,” the attorney said. Based on that fictional conviction, the client was deemed ineligible for bond and has remained in detention for two years. “I’ve never seen anything so brazenly absurd,” he said, explaining that judges treat the I-213 as “sacrosanct.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Intercept spoke with over a dozen attorneys and immigration experts, all of whom said they regularly encountered incorrect, or sometimes plainly ridiculous, information on their clients’ I-213s. The problem is “super prevalent,” in the words of Andrew Free, an immigration attorney based in Nashville, Tennessee. Kirsten Zittlau, an immigration attorney in San Diego, said she has seen “a million lies” on I-213s. In reviewing dozens of I-213s and cross-checking them with migrants’ own accounts, written testimonies, or attorneys’ explanations, The Intercept confirmed regular instances of erroneous, fabricated, and downright bogus information recorded on these forms. Many of the forms were even internally discrepant — botching or switching names, as well as mangling dates, mistaking gender, and flubbing countries of origin, among other errors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBorder Patrol officers in particular are supposed to ask migrants if they fear returning to their home country, and the answer to that initial question can be key to establishing the basis for an asylum claim.

More than one attorney told The Intercept they’ve seen I-213s for infants as young as a few months old who, according to Border Patrol, claim that they came to the United States to work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGovernment documents provided to Human Rights Watch via a Freedom of Information Act request and shared with The Intercept reveal further instances of Border Patrol agents and Customs and Border Protection officers including erroneous information on intake forms, and they also shed light on abuse of asylum-seekers. The documents, internal complaints filed by asylum officers with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, show that front-line border officials often go to extraordinary lengths to deny the people in their custody the ability to make an asylum claim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHuman Rights Watch’s ongoing investigation has turned up numerous cases of Border Patrol pressuring asylum-seekers not to claim fear, or officers simply lying and saying that people did not fear being returned, when in fact they had stated otherwise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The evidence we have gathered raises serious concerns that Border Patrol officers consistently deny asylum-seekers the opportunity to make a claim for protection or falsify records in a way that undercut those claims,” said Clara Long, senior researcher in the U.S. program at Human Rights Watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c!-- BLOCK(photo-grid)[3](%7B%7D)(%7B%22columns%22%3A2%2C%22photos%22%3A%5B%7B%22alt%22%3A%22%22%2C%22src%22%3A%22https%3A%5C%2F%5C%2Ftheintercept.com%5C%2Fwp-uploads%5C%2Fsites%5C%2F1%5C%2F2019%5C%2F08%5C%2Fjohn-I1213-edit-1565385421-822x1024.jpg%22%7D%2C%7B%22alt%22%3A%22%22%2C%22src%22%3A%22https%3A%5C%2F%5C%2Ftheintercept.com%5C%2Fwp-uploads%5C%2Fsites%5C%2F1%5C%2F2019%5C%2F08%5C%2Faugusto-I1213-edit-1565385426-822x1024.jpg%22%7D%5D%2C%22caption%22%3A%22The%20I-213%20forms%20for%20John%2C%20left%2C%20and%20Augusto.%20Some%20information%20has%20been%20redacted%20for%20privacy%2C%20and%20highlights%20were%20made%20by%20their%20attorneys.%22%2C%22credit%22%3A%22Obtained%20from%20Molly%20Molloy%20and%20released%20with%20permission%20from%20the%20respondent%22%2C%22size%22%3A%22xtra-large%22%7D) --\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"photo-grid\" data-caption=\"The I-213 forms for John, left, and Augusto.

Cursory interviews and a reliance on stock answers to fill out forms would certainly be a draw to an overworked and overwhelmed agency. “Anything to make the job easier,” said a former Border Patrol agent I asked about falsifying I-213s. (He came forward last year as a \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/09/20/border-patrol-agent-immigrant-abuse/\"\u003ewhistleblower\u003c/a\u003e about the agency’s anti-immigrant culture.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of these cases do seem like hurried clerical errors made by officers triaging sometimes hundreds of cases a day, said Jodi Ziesemer, director of immigrant protection at New York Legal Assistance Group; it’s as if an immigration officer “clearly put someone’s name and [alien registration number] on the top of someone else’s form.” Genevra Alberti, a private attorney in Kansas City, Missouri, described a client who was picked up by ICE on her way to work while wearing her work uniform. Her I-213, however, said she claimed she was unemployed. “I’m not sure if they were not paying attention, wrote the document a day later, or just winged it,” Alberti hazarded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[6](%7B%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22right%22%7D) --\u003e\u003cblockquote class=\"stylized pull-right\" data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"right\"\u003e\u003c!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[6] --\u003e“I’m not sure if they were not paying attention, wrote the document a day later, or just winged it.\u0026#8221;\u003c!-- END-CONTENT(pullquote)[6] --\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c!-- END-BLOCK(pullquote)[6] --\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe more nefarious reason for erroneous information appearing on these forms would be deliberate falsification to save time or scuttle asylum claims — something that’s harder to prove. But lawyers say it’s difficult to otherwise explain how completely off-base the information often is. Shunting apprehended migrants into expedited removal — which is only possible if a migrant doesn’t claim that they are afraid to return to their country of origin — saves the agents both time and paperwork. It may also serve an ideological goal of denying more people entry. Indeed, the White House may see Border Patrol’s flippancy with asylum-seekers\u0026#8217; stories as an asset; Trump adviser Stephen Miller \u003ca href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/stephen-miller-wants-use-border-agents-screen-migrants-cut-number-n1035831\"\u003ereportedly\u003c/a\u003e wants Border Patrol to do more asylum screenings because he thinks they will be less credulous of claims.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgents may also lie on forms to give themselves cover for detaining someone on the basis of racial profiling. Zittlau, the attorney in San Diego, describes this as “reverse-engineering.” ICE or Border Patrol agents stop and search brown-skinned Latinos, Zittlau explains, and when they come across someone who doesn’t have authorization to be in the U.S., they then fabricate a story for why they stopped them. The Intercept cross-referenced some of Zittlau’s client affidavits with their I-213s and found a host of inconsistencies or boilerplate language.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor instance, Zittlau showed me two I-213s prepared by the same Border Patrol agent after two separate traffic stops in Southern California where he questioned Latino drivers on their legal status. The stops, both on Interstate 15, were three months apart, but he wrote down an identical justification: “the driver’s posture appeared to be stiff, rigid, and appeared to be white knuckling the steering wheel from being overly nervous.” In both instances, the agent claimed that the vehicle slowed down “dramatically” from 70 to 60 mph; except for the make and model of the vehicle, the descriptions were verbatim. The false information in cases like these may or may not influence a person’s claim to remain in the U.S., but either way, it underscores the impunity with which officers present a manhandled version of the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither the Border Patrol nor ICE responded to questions for this story.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c!-- BLOCK(photo)[7](%7B%7D)(%7B%22scroll%22%3Afalse%2C%22align%22%3A%22bleed%22%2C%22bleed%22%3A%22full%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22auto%22%7D) --\u003e\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-bleed full-bleed width-auto' style='width: auto;'\u003e\u003c!-- CONTENT(photo)[7] --\u003e\n\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-262416\" src=\"https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/08/Dorina_final-1565103234.jpg\" alt=\"Dorina_final-1565103234\" /\u003e\n\u003cp class='caption source pullright' style=''\u003eIllustration: Clay Rodery for The Intercept\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- END-CONTENT(photo)[7] --\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c!-- END-BLOCK(photo)[7] --\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eBenefit of the Doubt\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe government has the overwhelming balance of credibility in immigration matters, thanks to longstanding legal precedent. A 1988 Board of Immigration Appeals case, Matter of Barcenas, made it such that an immigrant had to “come forward with proof” before immigration officers would need to defend their recorded version of events. How an immigrant might obtain proof of a conversation that took place months or sometimes years previously while they were in custody is unclear. But the court basically ruled that if it’s one person’s word against another, the Border Patrol wins. A 1995 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals case specifically \u003ca href=\"https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F3/45/308/633949/\"\u003eweighed in favor\u003c/a\u003e of the I-213, stating “such forms are presumed inherently reliable if authenticated, and are presumed to contain information from the respondent unless the respondent presents evidence to the contrary.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn practice, attorneys told The Intercept, suppressing evidence presented by Border Patrol or ICE is nearly impossible. Ziesemer said that attorneys have been “trying to chip away at that assumption that [these documents] are reliable.” The idea that the Border Patrol was subjected to oversight was “a farce,” she said. “The court is not properly scrutinizing these documents.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[8](%7B%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22left%22%7D) --\u003e\u003cblockquote class=\"stylized pull-left\" data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"left\"\u003e\u003c!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[8] --\u003e The judge responded, \u0026#8220;Well, I don\u0026#8217;t see why a Border Patrol agent would make something up.\u0026#8221;\u003c!-- END-CONTENT(pullquote)[8] --\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c!-- END-BLOCK(pullquote)[8] --\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that chipping away isn’t easy. In criminal court, a police arrest report is considered hearsay and is not admissible as evidence; in immigration court, such reports are often the \u003cem\u003eonly\u003c/em\u003e evidence. According to the Department of Justice’s immigration judge “\u003ca href=\"https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/eoir/legacy/2014/08/15/hearsay.pdf\"\u003eBenchbook\u003c/a\u003e,” the rules of evidence applicable to criminal courts do not apply, and “any type of evidence is admissible so long as it is material and relevant to the issues before the hearing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis setup, as well as the overall prosecutorial culture of the immigration courts, lends itself to a judge’s giving credence to Border Patrol and ICE. They are all — judges, along with frontline Border Patrol agents and ICE officers — employees of the Justice Department. Immigration judges’ ultimate boss is the attorney general; they are not part of the independent judicial branch. Molly Molloy, a researcher who has spent years writing about and analyzing the border and immigration, described one case in which an asylum-seeker claimed that information on an I-213 was wrong. The judge responded, \u0026#8220;Well, I don\u0026#8217;t see why a Border Patrol agent would make something up.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnlike in criminal court, where an attorney could cross-examine a witness or question the evidence, in immigration court they’re not given that opportunity. “It’s legally, absolutely wrongheaded,” said the New Jersey attorney. “I have no way to challenge” dubious evidence or false accusations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSubpoenaing the agents who filled out the forms — a means by which an attorney could potentially contest a fabricated statement — is nearly an impossible task. Not only do judges frequently deny attorneys’ requests to issue a subpoena, as multiple attorneys attested, but it is unrealistic to think that a Border Patrol agent would remember one interview, among potentially hundreds, which took place months or even years earlier. Nancy Oretskin, Augusto’s attorney, explained that she tried to subpoena the officer in his case, but that the judge denied her request because she had not exhausted all other modes of trying to locate the officer and ask him to come into court. Despite multiple calls to the Border Patrol station, she never reached the officer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e“They Were So Rude. They Were Racist.”\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the Border Patrol policy manual details, during an intake interview, the examining immigration officer “must be absolutely certain” that “the alien has understood the proceedings against him or her.” The manual explicitly exhorts the agent to “have the alien read the [sworn] statement, or have it read to him or her in a language the alien understands” before signing and initialing. But in reality, migrants frequently report that they feel pressured and confused during the intake, and the conditions under which immigration officers interview migrants also factor into the veracity of the documents they produce.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe records released to Human Rights Watch include the account of an asylum-seeker who, just before his intake interview, saw Border Patrol officers use a Taser to electrocute two of the men in line before him. When asked if he feared being returned to his country, the man said, “I said no, because I was afraid.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMackenzie Levy, staff member on the Dilley Pro Bono Project, which provides legal services to women and children locked up in the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, Texas, described an I-213 in which it was recorded that one client, Eliza, said she was not afraid to return to her country.

They were racist. … They want you to sign deportation papers. They push and push and push and push you into signing. They try to confuse you. They try to trick you into signing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDorina emphasized how disoriented she was during the interview: “I was six days in the hielera and two days in the perrera,” she said, using terms that describe the Border Patrol’s short-term custody centers — “hielera,” or icebox — and the processing centers where people are held in cages of metal fencing — “perrera,” or dog kennel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They took my son away for two days,” she continued. “It was the worst experience of my life. I couldn’t sleep. I didn’t bathe. I couldn’t eat the food. The AC was so, so, so, so cold. There were 35 people in there. It’s so, so bad. They move you from one hielera to another to another, and you don’t even know where you are.” Amid that confusion, the separation from her child, as well as the cold and the hunger and the filth, an armed Border Patrol officer interrogated her and asked her if she was scared to return to her own country. She said that she was, but when her asylum officer interviewed her later, she was told that her I-213 was blank. Her case is ongoing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c!-- BLOCK(photo)[9](%7B%7D)(%7B%22scroll%22%3Afalse%2C%22align%22%3A%22bleed%22%2C%22bleed%22%3A%22full%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22auto%22%7D) --\u003e\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-bleed full-bleed width-auto' style='width: auto;'\u003e\u003c!-- CONTENT(photo)[9] --\u003e\n\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-262415\" src=\"https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/08/John_final-1565103158.jpg\" alt=\"John_final-1565103158\" /\u003e\n\u003cp class='caption source pullright' style=''\u003eIllustration: Clay Rodery for The Intercept\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- END-CONTENT(photo)[9] --\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c!-- END-BLOCK(photo)[9] --\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eDeported and Then Tortured\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn, who is 30, and, like Augusto, from Nicaragua, also took part in the popular mass protests against the Ortega regime. His involvement, as he explained it to The Intercept, mostly entailed using his car to transport injured students and protesters to the hospital, but he also participated in a few marches and rallies. He shared photos of himself marching with a surgeon’s mask to protect against tear gas. At one march the police arrested him, took him to a station, and tortured him. After he was released, John continued with his activism, and the government kept stalking him. They “had a kill order on me,” he said. After seeing his friends killed or jailed, scared for his life and for the safety of his wife and two young children, he went into hiding and started sleeping under a bridge, trying to figure out his next move. Soon, he said, “I reached my limit.” And so he fled — north.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFollowing thousands of his compatriots and tens of thousands of other Central Americans, he passed through Mexico and made his way to the U.S. border, where he told a Border Patrol agent that he wanted to ask for asylum. After they handcuffed him and threw him into a hielera, he asked to speak to a lawyer, but his request was denied. Finally, after a few days, a Border Patrol agent interviewed him. He told the agent, again, that he wanted to ask for asylum. He laid out his whole story, explaining why his life was in danger in his home country. The officer “seemed to be typing notes,” he said. On the I-213, the agent recorded that John “did not indicate any claim fear of persecution if returned to their native country of Nicaragua.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I read that statement to him via WhatsApp, John let out a plosive guffaw. “No, that’s false,” he said. I asked him if he made it clear to the agent that he feared returning to his country. He told me that he had. After he was transferred to an ICE detention center, he represented himself in court to make his asylum claim, but it was denied. The judge told him that he wasn’t being granted asylum because he wasn’t believable, because Nicaragua wasn’t as dangerous as he contended, and because he had told a Border Patrol agent, as recorded on his I-213, that he wasn’t afraid of being returned to his country.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[10](%7B%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22right%22%7D) --\u003e\u003cblockquote class=\"stylized pull-right\" data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"right\"\u003e\u003c!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[10] --\u003eBack in Nicaragua, before he even left the airport, he was arrested.

Back in Nicaragua, before he even left the airport, he was arrested. Police officers took him to a back room and kept him there for 26 hours. “It felt like an eternity,” he told me. He suffered “hours of torture — psychological, physical, and verbal.” Ever since, he’s been anxious, has trouble sleeping, and has been repeatedly targeted. Police officers recently confiscated his driver’s license. In May, they took him back into custody and tortured him again. “They fractured my hand, hurt my leg, my eye was so swollen I couldn’t get out of bed,” John said. He struggled to explain the treatment he had endured. “If you go through the fire,” he said, “only then can you understand.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnlike John, Augusto was able to secure an attorney, Oretskin, who fought against the false statement on his I-213 and presented evidence of his persecution. Though she wasn’t able to convince the judge to subpoena the agent who wrote the error-ridden I-213 to come to court, Oretskin preempted the government attorney using the fabricated statement as a means to question his credibility and asked Augusto to explain what he actually said on the stand. It worked: The judge granted him asylum. “Let me be clear,” Oretskin told The Intercept, “he won because he had a good asylum claim, because he was persecuted because of his political opinion.” Augusto’s father, meanwhile, who had been falsely accused of plotting a coup against Ortega, and who fled along with his son, also has an I-213 that says he “DOES NOT fear harm and/or persecution would he be returned to his native country.” His case has not yet been decided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003e\u003c!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[11](%7B%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"shortcode\" data-shortcode=\"newsletter\" data-campaign=\"\" data-cta=\"\" data-headline=\"\" data-layout=\"\" data-subhead=\"\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[11] --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsylum-seekers aren’t only fleeing danger, traveling sometimes thousands of miles, and struggling against an administration determined to restrict their \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/07/16/trump-new-rule-asylum-eligibility/\"\u003eaccess to protection\u003c/a\u003e.

These modifications allow these planes to fly in Class B and above airspace, allowing them to safely share congested airspace with commercial aircraft. The aircraft also arrived equipped with Electronic Propeller Control Systems, which is a huge advance for the 179th AW maintenance team. The EPCS upgrades will replace the hydro mechanical propeller control system, which most of the planes currently assigned to the unit still use.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCol.

Kmetz. “These aircraft will be much more capable and enduring while giving our operators much better combat situational awareness.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe EPCS upgrades are just some of the modifications that will be made to the C-130s in the upcoming years. Other enhancements include new modular blade propeller technology, collision avoidance technology, and reinforcing the aircrafts’ wing boxes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIncorporating modular blade technology (NP2000) and the T-56 Series 3.5 engine upgrades will provide increased performance and reliability. The NP 2000 eight-bladed propeller decreases propeller maintenance time, increases performance and fuel efficiency while being transported by taking up less pallet space. The NP 2000 provides improved thrust and readiness, while reducing operations and support costs.

Brett Walker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Massachusetts Army National Guard performed a Patriot Crucible 2019 military exercise on Cape Cod, July 27 \u0026#8211; August 8 marks the first time in decades the military has used combat simulations at the Cape Cod military training grounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCamp Edwards, the site at which Patriot Crucible 2019 is taking place, is the Army portion of Joint Base Cape Cod. Other instillations on Joint Base Cape Cod include Otis Air Force Base and Coast Guard Station Cape Cod. Camp Edwards consists of 33,000 acres of land, including maneuver space as well as weapon ranges and simulation centers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u0026#8220;There are enough facilities here to support an exercise of this size,\u0026#8221; said Army Maj. Alexander McDonough, the Plans and Training Officer for Camp Edwards. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatriot Crucible 2019 is an intense, two-week field exercise focused on preparing Army logistics and support units from across the northeast to participate in major combat operations against a near-peer enemy equipped with artillery, helicopters and trained troops. More than 800 soldiers from the Massachusetts and New Jersey Army National Guard are participating in the event. They include truck drivers, firefighters, chemical experts and military police.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCapt. Kyunghun Woo, an officer in 1st Army (East), is the Officer in Charge of observer controllers for Patriot Crucible 2019. Woo said this exercise involves a greater variety of units and soldiers than he is accustomed to seeing in battalion-level training exercises. Woo\u0026#8217;s fulltime assignment for 1st Army is to observe and evaluate National Guard units during field exercises. In a typical year, he will evaluate five exercises.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u0026#8220;Overall, this exercise, from what I see, is well planned,\u0026#8221; said Woo. \u0026#8220;This is set up to allow us to evaluate their Mission Essential Task List.\u0026#8221;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Massachusetts National Guard planned and resourced this exercise, but coordinated with evaluation experts from 1st Army throughout the process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u0026#8220;I was closely working with Major DiCrescenzo and Major Mulhern on this planning, including overall planning review,\u0026#8221; said Woo.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMajors David DiCrescenzo and Robert Mulhern are the planning officers for the Massachusetts National Guard assigned to Patriot Crucible. They report spending only $309,503.84 to plan, resource and execute the entire event. They prepared this exercise to prioritize training soldiers in logistic and service support to the combat arms, which distinguishes Patriot Crucible from traditional large-scale field exercises.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u0026#8220;For units to replicate the hybrid threat, it is very difficult with the resources they have internally,\u0026#8221; said Mulhern. \u0026#8220;So what we\u0026#8217;ve done is try to combine those resources as a state and as a region and put them into an exercise.\u0026#8221; \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe exercise does require participating soldiers to defend themselves from enemy attacks, but most of the training tasks relate to other critical aspects of military campaigns. For instance, soldiers are establishing field fueling points, enemy detention centers and mobile mess halls, all under austere conditions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of the training tasks in Patriot Crucible involve partnerships between the Massachusetts National Guard and other organizations at the local and international levels. Military Police are working with Barnstable County sheriff deputies to refine their systems of guarding and caring for prisoners. Army engineers are repairing a fish and game clubhouse on Camp Edwards. Military officers from Kenya are assisting in battle staff functions through the State Partnership Program.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;When most units go to annual training, they are limited to what they can do on their own,\u0026#8221; said McDonough. \u0026#8220;Patriot Crucible allows units to work across MOSs [Military Occupational Specialties] and achieve Mission Essential Tasks they could not do alone.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u0026#8220;The benefit [of Patriot Crucible] is it helps build partnerships between our states in the northeast as well as with our 1st Army partners providing feedback and evaluations for the units going through the training,\u0026#8221; said Mulhern. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo increase realism in the training, observer controllers are using illumination flares, artillery simulators and smoke grenades. McDonough said it has been more than two decades since those materials were used in military training on Camp Edwards. Some instruments, such as tracer rounds, are being used on Camp Edwards for the first time ever during Patriot Crucible. Environmental and safety staff are present and monitoring the effects of those devises.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u0026#8220;Improving on this exercise would involve using more technology,\u0026#8221; said DiCrescenzo. \u0026#8220;We strive to incorporate aspects of the current and future operational environment to get soldiers to think what it would be like to be in combat with a near-peer competitor.\u0026#8221;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis year\u0026#8217;s Patriot Crucible exercise involves Army National Guard units from two states \u0026#8211; Massachusetts and New Jersey \u0026#8211; as well as evaluators from the 174th Infantry Brigade of the full-time component of the Army. The National Guard units are evaluated on the same standards and missions as their regular Army equivalents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u0026#8220;The proficiency of units I see in this is better than what I normally see,\u0026#8221; said Woo.

Witnesses said at least two people were arrested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClouds of tear gas swirled and stun grenades thundered across the stone-paved esplanade as masses of worshippers skirmished with police in the worst bout of fighting at the contested holy site in months.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe clashes came amid heightened tensions between Israel and the Palestinians, just days after an Israeli soldier was killed south of Jerusalem. On Saturday, Israeli troops killed four Palestinian militants who attempted to cross the Gaza border fence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTens of thousands of Muslims had flocked to the site in Jerusalem\u0026#8217;s Old City early Sunday for holiday prayers, police said. Jews are also observing on Sunday the Ninth of Av, a day of fasting and mourning for the destruction of the two Biblical temples which stood at the site in antiquity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe site is the holiest for Jews and the third holiest for Muslims, after Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia, and has long been a flashpoint at the epicenter of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJordan, which serves as the custodian of the holy site, said in a statement that it had sent a formal complaint to Israel and condemned what it called Israel\u0026#8217;s \u0026#8220;irresponsible provocations.\u0026#8221; Sufian al-Qudah, a spokesman for the Jordanian Foreign Ministry, said Amman holds Israel completely responsible for the violence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLarge numbers of Palestinians had gathered at the gates of the compound early Sunday after rumors circulated that police would allow Jewish visitors to enter the site. The protesters chanted \u0026#8220;Allahu Akbar\u0026#8221; (God is greatest) and threw stones at police, who then charged into the compound while firing stun grenades and rubber-coated bullets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIsraeli police had initially barred entry to Jewish visitors, but reversed their decision after the clashes broke out and allowed them to enter. Several dozen entered the site under close police escort and Muslim worshippers began throwing chairs and other objects at the group. The Jewish visitors left the compound shortly thereafter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJerusalem District police commander Doron Yedid told Israeli media that the decision to allow Jewish visitors to enter the site was made \u0026#8220;with the backing of the top political officials.\u0026#8221; Police spokesmen could not be reached for comment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe reversal came after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u0026#8217;s religious nationalist allies called for the site to be opened to Jewish visitors. Israelis are headed to unprecedented repeat elections next month after Netanyahu failed to form a government following April\u0026#8217;s elections.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJews are barred from praying at the compound under a longstanding arrangement between Israel and Muslim authorities. Jewish tradition also maintains that Jews should avoid entering the holy site.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut in recent years Israeli religious nationalists have stepped up visits to the site to challenge the arrangement.

Israel views all of Jerusalem as its unified capital, while the Palestinians want east Jerusalem as the capital of their future state.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIsraeli-Palestinian tensions have spiked following President Donald Trump\u0026#8217;s decision in 2017 to recognize Jerusalem as Israel\u0026#8217;s capital and move the U.S. Embassy there. The Israeli-Palestinian peace process has been moribund for at least a decade, and the Palestinians have cut ties with the Trump administration over what they see as its unfair bias toward Israel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a separate incident on Sunday, Israeli troops killed a Palestinian gunman after he opened fire on them from across the perimeter fence around the Gaza Strip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Israeli military said an \u0026#8220;armed terrorist\u0026#8221; approached the frontier early Sunday and opened fire toward troops on the other side, who responded by shooting at the attacker.

Hamas, which has ruled Gaza since 2007, said the attack was an \u0026#8220;individual act\u0026#8221; carried out by youths frustrated at the Israeli-Egyptian blockade on Gaza and was not planned by the group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/time/world/~4/NNmLoKYcOuU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/world/~3/NNmLoKYcOuU/","published":"2019-08-11T15:22:03Z","guid":"http://time.com/?p=5649494"},{"title":"Kim Jong Un Supervised Test-Firings of an Unspecified New Weapons System, North Korea Says","content":"\u003caside class=\"right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad\" id=\"right-rail__ad-5649451\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module\" data-src=\"https://time.com/5649451/kim-jong-un-weapons-test-north-korea/\" data-widget-id=\"SB_2\" data-ob-template=\"timemag\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(SEOUL, South Korea) \u0026mdash; North Korea said Sunday that leader Kim Jong Un supervised test-firings of an unspecified new weapons system, which extended a streak of launches that are seen as an attempt to build leverage ahead of negotiations with the United States while driving a wedge between the U.S. and South Korea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe report by North Korean state media came hours after President Donald Trump said that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un expressed a desire to meet again to start nuclear negotiations after the end of ongoing joint U.S.-South Korea military exercises, and that he apologized for the flurry of recent short-range ballistic launches that rattled U.S. allies in the region.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a separate statement on Sunday, North Korea\u0026#8217;s Foreign Ministry blasted South Korea for continuing to host military drills with the United States, and said that future dialogue will be held strictly between Pyongyang and Washington and not between the Koreas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSouth Korea\u0026#8217;s military said the North on Saturday fired what appeared to be two short-range ballistic missiles.

Arabia Seriously after Negotiating with Iran: Report","content":"\u003cp\u003eThe newspaper, in an op-ed by senior expert Kamal Khalaf, says this is not the only gateway to look at other cases that are no less important than water safety and maritime security. The Yemen case is at the forefront of issues that will be raised during the Iran-Saudi negotiations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It is clear that Saudi Arabia is preparing proper grounds for stopping the war on Yemen and seems to have been able to convey a message to Tehran via a secret channel that the end of the war should be in a way that Riyadh would not be shown as a failed party. This is the main request of Riyadh, and considers it a crucial issue for negotiating with Tehran. Apparently, the changes the UAE has made to its role in Yemen are also affecting the Saudi position, and it is reported that the discrepancy these days between Saudi Arabia and the UAE is due to the UAE\u0026#8217;s new stance on Iran and the war in Yemen,” he is quoted as saying by \u003cem\u003eRai al-Youm\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKhalaf goes on to say what reinforces this view is the devastating battles in Aden between the UAE-backed transitional council and the Saudi-backed Mansur Hadi forces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“While the Emirati officials are questioning the legitimacy and competence of Mansour Hadi, the Dubai police chief, Dhahi Khalfan, in his Twitter account, has directed harsh criticism at Hadi, stating that a real commander cannot, from inside the hotel room, won the victory. But in the meantime, we need to consider the depth of the relationship between Riyadh and Abu Dhabi, as well as the close personal relationship between Bin Zayed and Bin Salman, to say with certainty that Abu Dhabi is, above all, an indirect communication channel between Riyadh and Tehran and its entire move are coordinated with Riyadh.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, one can play a better role in this regard, and there is no one better than Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has a close relationship with Bin Salman and Iranian politicians. For this reason, if the right channel is chosen to convey the message between Riyadh and Tehran, Russia is the best option, underlines Khalaf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRiyadh has always been one step behind Abu Dhabi in changing policies and dealing with crises and different cases, and this was clearly seen in the UAE\u0026#8217;s move to resume diplomatic relations with Damascus, while Saudi Arabia initially hesitated. According to our assessments, Riyadh\u0026#8217;s hesitation will end soon, and the Saudis will take a major step toward establishing ties with Damascus and negotiating with Iran, concludes
