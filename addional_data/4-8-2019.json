The 60th-floor sky lobby cocktail bar, JG Skyhigh, and the 59th-floor main dining room both occupy one sweeping space surrounded by 40-foot-high, floor-to-ceiling windows that, from this perch atop Philly’s tallest building, showcase One Liberty Place, historic City Hall, and the rest of the City of Brotherly Love. Designed by London-based architect Norman Foster (who also designed the rest of the \u003ca href=\"http://content.fortune.com/fortune500/comcast-37/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eComcast\u003c/a\u003e Technology Center), the restaurant also features two walls of waterfalls and an angular, mirrored ceiling that catches the light and reflects the street 60 stories below. “Wherever you sit, you can see people walking. You’re part of the city a little bit,” says Vongerichten. “At night when the city is all lit up, it’s magic.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eVongerichten’s first foray into Philadelphia came to be after his friend and Comcast CEO Brian Roberts approached him about the project. While the New York City–based chef was drawn by Philadelphia’s vibrant food scene, he’s also a self-described architecture buff and couldn\u0026#8217;t pass up the opportunity to work with a legend. Norman Foster has designed structures around the world, including Apple’s corporate headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., but this is the architect’s first restaurant project. With an over-the-top space, the decor is minimalist, with soft curves and a neutral color palette. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe kitchen will be helmed by chef de cuisine Nicholas Ugliarolo, who has worked with Vongerichten for six years, including at New York City’s vegetable-forward abcV. The menu will feature classic Jean-Georges bites like Egg Caviar, as well as dishes tailored for the Philly market, according to the chefs, with à la carte options like corn nut–crusted salmon, hamachi sashimi with spiced strawberry water, and summery heirloom tomatoes in a bright, acidic tomato broth. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/JG-Skyhigh.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2676520\" srcset=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/JG-Skyhigh.jpg 1920w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/JG-Skyhigh.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/JG-Skyhigh.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/JG-Skyhigh.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/JG-Skyhigh.jpg?resize=1024,683 1024w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/JG-Skyhigh.jpg?resize=281,187 281w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/JG-Skyhigh.jpg?resize=755,503 755w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/JG-Skyhigh.jpg?resize=100,67 100w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/JG-Skyhigh.jpg?resize=60,40 60w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/JG-Skyhigh.jpg?resize=154,103 154w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/JG-Skyhigh.jpg?resize=591,394 591w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/JG-Skyhigh.jpg?resize=392,261 392w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/JG-Skyhigh.jpg?resize=252,168 252w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/JG-Skyhigh.jpg?resize=697,465 697w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/JG-Skyhigh.jpg?resize=234,156 234w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/JG-Skyhigh.jpg?resize=500,333 500w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/JG-Skyhigh.jpg?resize=578,385 578w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/JG-Skyhigh.jpg?resize=600,400 600w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/JG-Skyhigh.jpg?resize=90,60 90w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/JG-Skyhigh.jpg?resize=185,123 185w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/JG-Skyhigh.jpg?resize=115,77 115w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/JG-Skyhigh.jpg?resize=738,492 738w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/JG-Skyhigh.jpg?resize=777,518 777w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eWhile on the top of 60 floors, Chef Vongerichten says the design should still catch the light and vibrancy from the street level.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"image-credit\"\u003eCourtesy of Jean-Georges\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eGetting In on the Ground Floor\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFifty-nine floors below, another Vongerichten alum heads his own kitchen. Greg Vernick was the sous chef at Nougatine and Spice Market and a corporate chef trainer for the global brand before moving to Philadelphia to open his namesake restaurant in 2012. Seven years later, the chef is unveiling his follow-up, Vernick Fish. And while the city has waited patiently for more from Vernick, the timing makes sense for a disciplined chef known for meticulous ingredient sourcing and thoughtful preparations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn another first for Philadelphia, restaurant designer Adam Tihany—who has worked with acclaimed chefs including Daniel Boulud, Thomas Keller, and Vongerichten—conceived the space. The sprawling, 3,400-square-foot restaurant features a zinc bar, warmed with caramel-hued leather bar stools and dark wood high-top tables. Large-scale light fixtures hang from the ceiling, adding a touch of visual drama. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs its name suggests, the modern brasserie will spotlight seafood, with Vernick drawing inspiration from coastal regions around the world, and, more specifically, from a lifetime of summers spent at the Jersey Shore. “We have a blackened fluke dish on the menu, and every time the fluke hits the griddle, the salty, marshy smell instantly reminds me of Somers Point,” says Vernick. The menu will include wild, lake, and preserved fish, plus some oyster bar classics. But for all of Vernick’s restraint and focus, a fun and looser vibe hits with the dessert offerings of pie and cake by the slice—another nod to Jersey Shore summers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile these openings are a significant moment for Philadelphia’s food scene at large, it is also a serendipitous reunion for the chefs. “Having Jean-Georges in the building makes me want to do a better job,” Vernick says. “I want to make him proud.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor his part, it seems like Vongerichten is already there. “It’s amazing what he’s achieved here in Philadelphia,” Vongerichten says of Vernick. “I\u0026#8217;m honored to be his friend and mentor.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eMore must-read stories from \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—What you should know about \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/07/28/modena-italy-food/\"\u003eItaly’s new food capital\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—\u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/03/what-is-vietnamese-egg-coffee/\"\u003eVietnamese egg coffee\u003c/a\u003e is taking North America by storm–but what is it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—Why \u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/longform/charleston-restaurants-food-scene/\"\u003eCharleston’s food scene\u003c/a\u003e is stronger than ever right now\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—\u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/04/honolulu-best-restaurants/\"\u003eHonolulu\u0026#8217;s hottest restaurants\u003c/a\u003e take Hawaiian paradise beyond the beach\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—Listen to our new audio briefing, \u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/radio/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e 500 Daily\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://flipboard.com/@fortune\"\u003e \u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://flipboard.com/@fortune\"\u003eFollow \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e on Flipboard\u003c/a\u003e to stay up-to-date on the latest news and analysis\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://fortune.com/2019/08/04/philadelphia-four-seasons-restaurants/","published":"2019-08-04T12:00:17Z","guid":"https://fortune.com/?p=2676507"},{"title":"Has Mezcal Become Too Big for Its Own Good?","content":"\n\u003cp\u003eYou don’t find mezcal—mezcal finds you. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt may just be a popular expression in the liquor world, but it rings true as Americans are increasingly discovering the agave-based, Mexican-made smoky cousin of tequila.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBeloved by bartenders, mezcal is enjoying a prime spot on trendy cocktail-bar menus, featured as an easy swap in popular drinks like the margarita, the negroni, or the old-fashioned.

Pricey vodka brands Grey Goose and Belvedere, for example, propelled superpremium vodkas for many years as early winners. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen asked why so many large liquor companies are investing in mezcal, especially considering the category’s small size, Agdern has a simple response: “The answer is growth. We are all looking for growth.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eDiageo, owner of Smirnoff vodka and Don Julio tequila, sees a similar opportunity. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Christina Choi joined Diageo about six months ago, she would explain to friends her role overseeing the rum, tequila, and mezcal categories, and nine times out of 10, people would exclaim, “Oh, my God, I love mezcal!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen asked, “Well, what’s your favorite brand?”—they couldn’t name one. “Therein lies the opportunity,” says Choi, a senior vice president at Diageo. Mezcal is a liquor with nascent brand awareness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eChoi explains there are two distinct consumer segments for mezcal. The first seeks a balance between mezcal’s famed smokiness and agave, and this crowd is typically focused on enjoying cocktails at the bar. The second represents a more discerning drinker who is willing to pay more and sip it neat, like a drinker of Scotch.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Casamigosfamilyshot.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2675791\" srcset=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Casamigosfamilyshot.jpg 6720w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Casamigosfamilyshot.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Casamigosfamilyshot.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Casamigosfamilyshot.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Casamigosfamilyshot.jpg?resize=1024,683 1024w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Casamigosfamilyshot.jpg?resize=281,187 281w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Casamigosfamilyshot.jpg?resize=755,503 755w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Casamigosfamilyshot.jpg?resize=100,67 100w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Casamigosfamilyshot.jpg?resize=60,40 60w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Casamigosfamilyshot.jpg?resize=154,103 154w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Casamigosfamilyshot.jpg?resize=591,394 591w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Casamigosfamilyshot.jpg?resize=392,261 392w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Casamigosfamilyshot.jpg?resize=252,168 252w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Casamigosfamilyshot.jpg?resize=697,465 697w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Casamigosfamilyshot.jpg?resize=234,156 234w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Casamigosfamilyshot.jpg?resize=500,333 500w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Casamigosfamilyshot.jpg?resize=578,385 578w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Casamigosfamilyshot.jpg?resize=600,400 600w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Casamigosfamilyshot.jpg?resize=90,60 90w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Casamigosfamilyshot.jpg?resize=185,123 185w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Casamigosfamilyshot.jpg?resize=115,77 115w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Casamigosfamilyshot.jpg?resize=738,492 738w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Casamigosfamilyshot.jpg?resize=777,518 777w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 6720px) 100vw, 6720px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eThe lineup from Casamigos, a tequila company cofounded in 2013 by George Clooney, Rande Gerber, and Mike Meldman.

we became much less about shooting the Fortizar and much more about getting in position to fight their fleet.  This led to a series of warps back and forth around the Fortizar where Snuff seems disinclined to break tether.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a while of this Cainun decided a fight was not going to happen.  By his estimation, Snuff Was not going to have a go at us unless

their own once we left.  It looked like they were going to drop on us on our way home.  And when we spotted the cyno Cainun decided to give that a shot to see what they would bring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Machariel fleet dropped on us in \u003ca href=\"http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Black_Rise/Nennamaila\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eNennamaila\u003c/a\u003e and we were in close enough range to engage.  And while they did not bring HAW dreads along with them, they did jump fax support in to keep their Machs alive.  After a few attempts we were only able to break the tank on \u003ca href=\"https://zkillboard.com/kill/78210689/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eone Machariel\u003c/a\u003e while

battle titled against us, the likelihood of us getting another Mach kill fell away, and Cainun decided to warp us out.  My alt, in an Abaddon, was tackled by one of the Machs however, so while my Guardian warped off to the station to dock up, the Abaddon sat there in the middle of hostiles waiting to die.  This was a double whammy because my alt had gotten the kill mail for the one Mach we killed, so that Abaddon was going to have a very short lived kill mark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then I was no longer pointed.  I don\u0026#8217;t know if the person who had me tackled found a better target or if I just wandered out of range before it was my turn, but I wasn\u0026#8217;t going to stick around and ask.  Already aligned and at speed, I warped right out and docked up with the rest of the survivors who made it out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat Mahcariel we killed was expensive, but not expensive enough to offset out own losses.  We lost the ISK war by about a 6 to 1

Rather than waxing snarky about backward oafs who don't get why harassment is bad, she says she understands the impulse, and launches into a story about seeing a service dog in an airport terminal. One that was wearing a vest that says \"Dog Working. Do Not Pet.\" The kind of dog you're never supposed to touch. \"Now I'm in a pickle, because I'm going to pet that fucking dog. I mean, it's a dog. It obviously wants it,\" she says, as the audience bursts out laughing. \"I get your logic.\" Maybe women need vests, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe punchline gets more, but different laughter. Sarcasm about \"wanting it\" is standard fare for women comics, but trading working woman for working dog is sneakily, bleakly brilliant.

disinclined to break tether.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a while of this Cainun decided a fight was not going to happen.  By his estimation, Snuff Was not going to have a go at us unless

rel=\"noopener\"\u003eNennamaila\u003c/a\u003e and we were in close enough range to engage.  And while they did not bring HAW dreads along with them, they did jump fax support in to keep their Machs alive.  After a few attempts we were only able to break the tank on \u003ca href=\"https://zkillboard.com/kill/78210689/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eone Machariel\u003c/a\u003e while

battle titled against us, the likelihood of us getting another Mach kill fell away, and Cainun decided to warp us out.  My alt, in an Abaddon, was tackled by one of the Machs however, so while my Guardian warped off to the station to dock up, the Abaddon sat there in the middle of hostiles waiting to die.  This was a double whammy because my alt had gotten the kill mail for the one Mach we killed, so that Abaddon was going to have a very short lived kill mark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then I was no longer pointed.  I don\u0026#8217;t know if the person who had me tackled found a better target or if I just wandered out of range before it was my turn, but I wasn\u0026#8217;t going to stick around and ask.  Already aligned and at speed, I warped right out and docked up with the rest of the survivors who made it out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat Mahcariel we killed was expensive, but not expensive enough to offset out own losses.  We lost the ISK war by about a 6 to 1

The author of the manifesto claimed that he was inspired to target Hispanics after reading the manifesto of the Christchurch, New Zealand, terrorist who attacked two mosques and killed 51 people in March. He wanted to kill Hispanic immigrants as an “act of preservation” to reclaim his country from “destruction,” he explained. He referred to Hispanics as “invaders with high birth rates” and expressed his fear of “shameless race mixers,” “the threat of the Hispanic voting bloc,” and the “cultural and ethnic replacement brought on by invasion.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe manifesto expresses extreme versions of a fear that has also been expressed by prominent political figures.

In the past few weeks, President Trump told four congresswomen of color, all U.S. citizens, to go back to where they came from. He stood onstage at a campaign rally while the crowd chanted “Send her back!” for 13 seconds. He \u003ca href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/22/opinions/trump-retweets-katie-hopkins-racism-obeidallah/index.html\"\u003eretweeted Katie Hopkins\u003c/a\u003e, a British extremist who has called migrants “cockroaches” and called for a “final solution” for Muslims.

FBI Director Christopher Wray recently said the \u003ca href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/454338-fbis-wray-says-majority-of-domestic-terrorism-arrests-this-year\"\u003eFBI has recorded about 100 domestic-terrorism arrests in 2019,\u003c/a\u003e most of them involving ties to white supremacy. The FBI, for the first time, has also identified fringe conspiracy theories as a risk factor for domestic terrorism, citing QAnon, which says an active deep-state conspiracy is trying to take down Trump. QAnon signs and shirts now appear frequently at Trump rallies. An FBI document predicted that conspiracy-theory-driven extremists are likely to increase during the 2020 presidential-election cycle.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs a Muslim American, I have been asked for 18 years to denounce violent Muslim extremism done by terrorists I’ve never met.

Soon after the gun massacre at Columbine High School in the spring of 1999, Clinton flew to Littleton, Colorado, to talk with students, teachers, and parents mourning the deaths of the 13 victims. So much of his job, he told the audience, centered on a task that had nothing to do with his constitutional duties: comforting survivors of mass shootings. “More than we ever could have imagined,” he said, his role was “to be with grieving people.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThat’s not something that comes naturally to President Donald Trump. Consoling a nation calls for empathy and eloquence; Trump hasn’t shown much capacity for either. Presidents often use scripture as a balm when people are hurting; Trump seems little moved by religious faith or feeling. Part of a president’s job is to be a unifying figure in times of national crisis. After 30 divisive months in office, Trump could be past the point where he can take on that role. The question now is whether his countrymen even expect him to.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eSo far, Trump’s response to this weekend’s mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, has been uneven. He’s sent out the obligatory condolences and offers of federal assistance via Twitter. But he has also taken time to tweet favorably about two of his political supporters. A full day has passed since the El Paso shooting without Trump making a live statement on camera, though he made \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/Kevinliptakcnn/status/1158026195772026881\"\u003ea cameo at a private wedding\u003c/a\u003e at his golf club in New Jersey, where he spent the weekend.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eAs mass shootings have become commonplace in this country, Americans have grown used to seeing their presidents try to play a healing role. It’s a norm that Trump’s predecessors helped cultivate. Former President Barack Obama built his legacy partly on his memorable response to gun violence. The day of the Newtown, Connecticut, shooting in December 2012, he teared up while addressing the press about the massacre of schoolchildren. Three years later, he led mourners in singing “Amazing Grace” while giving a eulogy for the pastor killed at an African American church in Charleston, South Carolina.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIn Littleton that day in 1999, Clinton delivered a speech designed to soothe the community, closing with a story about Nelson Mandela, the anti-apartheid leader who became South Africa’s first black president after serving nearly three decades in prison. Mandela was filled with anger over his confinement, but resolved never to surrender to his jailers his “mind and his heart.” Looking out at students who had heard the gunshots at Columbine and seen their classmates fall, Clinton said: “I see here today that you have decided not to give your mind and your heart away. I ask you now to share it with all your fellow Americans.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eRepublican President George W. Bush gave a short and powerful speech at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, Virginia, after the 2007 mass shooting on campus that left 32 people dead. One day after the violence, Bush traveled to the school to speak at a memorial service held in the basketball arena. “People who have never met you are praying for you. They’re praying for your friends who have fallen and who are injured,” Bush said. “There’s a power in these prayers—real power. In times like this, we can find comfort in the grace and guidance of a loving God.

But in their senseless lethality, there was something especially harrowing about this weekend’s shootings. One mass shooting piled atop another in the space of half a day, reinforcing the creeping sense that no public space is safe. Twenty people died at a Walmart in El Paso, and another nine were murdered outside a bar in a popular neighborhood in Dayton. More than four dozen were injured between the two episodes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIn any other administration, it would fall to the president to reassure a jittery nation. But does the country, at this moment, think Trump has that in him? Does enough of the nation see in him a truly national leader who can bind up fresh wounds? Polling has repeatedly shown that he is the most polarizing president in the modern era. A Gallup survey evaluating Trump’s second year in office found that the gap between Democrats’ and Republicans’ approval of him was a whopping 79 points—the largest ever recorded. His approval rating in 2018, at about 40 percent, was the \u003ca href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/245996/trump-job-approval-sets-new-record-polarization.aspx\"\u003elowest for any second-year president\u003c/a\u003e since World War II, Gallup reported. In a sign of how people view Trump as a moral figure, a \u003ca href=\"https://poll.qu.edu/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=2609\"\u003eQuinnipiac University poll\u003c/a\u003e from March showed that by a margin of 72 percent to 21 percent, voters said Trump was not a good role model for children.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003ePublic opinion of the president seems to track with his own conception of his job: He doesn’t carry himself as someone who necessarily wants to preside over all Americans; invariably, his focus is his core voters. And his compassion is conditional. When parts of California, a deep-blue state, were scorched by wildfires last year, Trump threatened to cut off federal aid, saying without evidence that the state had mismanaged funds. Just days ago, he \u003ca href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/08/02/747615349/rep-cummings-says-someone-tried-to-break-into-his-home-too-bad-trump-says\"\u003eseemed to gloat\u003c/a\u003e upon hearing the news about an attempted break-in at the home of Democratic Congressman Elijah Cummings.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eAnything Trump says about the shooting in El Paso in particular risks reigniting a debate about whether his own rhetoric fuels such acts of violence.

More than 20 Democrats are running to lead the country, and nearly all of them are trying to offer something more than “thoughts and prayers”—the banality scorned on the left in recent years that traditionally accompanies mass shootings. But for the next year and a half, the most concrete action that the majority of these contenders can contribute themselves in response is a single vote in Congress.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHarris did not detail exactly what she wants Trump to do, but in her platform on combatting gun violence, she pledges that if Congress fails to enact a comprehensive gun-safety package—including universal background checks, an assault-weapons ban, and more—she would take executive action where she could. Those moves would include stronger regulations to tighten background-check requirements, more aggressive action to revoke the licenses of gun manufacturers that break the law, and the reversal of a Trump-administration decision that made it easier for people with outstanding arrest warrants to obtain guns.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSeveral of Harris’s Democratic rivals have made similar proposals, and some would go even further. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, for example, has called for requiring prospective gun owners to have a license. So has Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana. In the immediate aftermath of this weekend’s shootings, most of the 2020 Democratic candidates issued vague calls for “action” and denunciations of both Trump’s rhetoric and a growing threat of domestic terrorism from white nationalists. Booker, appearing on CNN’s \u003cem\u003eState of the Union\u003c/em\u003e, accused Trump of “savagely fraying the bonds of our nation by speaking consistently words of hatred.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“The president is contributing to what is going on right now,” Booker said in a separate interview on NBC’s \u003cem\u003eMeet the Press\u003c/em\u003e.

The new Democratic majority in the House passed a pair of bills earlier in the year to close loopholes in the federal background-check system—the most substantive advancement of gun-control legislation in years. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, an ardent backer of gun rights, has no intention of taking them up, and both chambers of Congress have left for their summer recess. The Democratic presidential primary features seven senators—nearly one-sixth of the minority caucus—but none of them, individually or collectively, can force McConnell’s hand.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs on many other issues, the Democratic Party has moved left in recent years, spurred on by the seemingly endless spate of mass shootings that has struck communities across the country. The party’s presidential candidates are proposing policies, such as a ban on assault weapons and a national registry and licensing system, that would have been considered politically treacherous even in a primary a decade ago. Yet after two more atrocities, with dozens more dead, their power to do anything is barely greater than the average citizen’s.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese hopefuls can plead with the president and the Senate, and demand, as Harris did, that they “do something.” But running for the White House brings nothing more than a microphone.

Police are investigating whether the gunman wrote it. It is, \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/03/new-zealand-shooters-manifesto-will-continue-spread/585085/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eunlike the Christchurch, New Zealand, manifesto\u003c/a\u003e, straightforward and written in language comprehensible to normal people, rather than in allusive, wink-laden online jargon. One benefit of that straightforwardness is that, if police confirm the strongly suspected link between the gunman and the manifesto, no debate will be necessary about what motivated the killer, or what fountains of ideas he drank from.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe author of the manifesto pronounced himself in “general” agreement with the Christchurch murderer. He opposed racial mixing; he thought America was committing suicide by letting Hispanics “invade.” He intended to kill to counter these trends, and he claimed to be ready to die in the act. He even endorsed, tactically, the targeting of innocent and unarmed people, using the phrase \u003cem\u003elow-security targets\u003c/em\u003e (imagine the type of subhuman consciousness that would refer to cowering children this way).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLet’s get back to those fountains of ideas. The very few noteworthy sections of the manifesto are the ones that reveal a broader range of influences than one might suspect. The author reserves his greatest rage not for Hispanics, but for “the takeover of the United States by unchecked corporations.” The corporations, he says, are pro-immigration and befoul our natural environment. Once automation spreads and causes mass unemployment, Hispanic invaders will demand government freebies—specifically a universal basic income (UBI)—and will cause civil unrest if not placated. Oddly enough, the author shares some of these goals, for white people anyway: “Achieving ambitious social projects like universal healthcare and UBI would become far more likely to succeed if tens of millions of dependents are removed.” The ideal, he suggests, would be automation without immigration, so that the low-paying jobs would go to robots and nonimmigrant Americans would get the good jobs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMany of these ideas, including some of the most stupid and craven ones, come not from the right, as traditionally conceived, but from the left as well. The left has peddled conspiracies of corporations as diabolical puppeteers (while the right has credulously promoted corporations as angelic job creators). Lack of confidence in job markets’ ability to digest and repurpose displaced workers is typically a concern of the left, and, of course, the Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang has been the most vocal figure on the subject of job loss due to \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/us/politics/andrew-yang-automation.html\"\u003eautomation\u003c/a\u003e. UBI and health care have been proposed by Swedish-model Democrats and ridiculed by Republicans. The belief that poor immigrants would, if given the chance, fill our welfare rolls and capsize the ship of state—that’s the position not only of the Trump adviser Stephen Miller but also of \u003ca href=\"https://psmag.com/news/bernie-says-immigration-threatens-the-social-safety-net-research-shows-otherwise\"\u003eBernie Sanders\u003c/a\u003e and a long tradition of labor leftists eager to keep “American jobs” safe from immigrants. Combine these ideas, which have traction now in both major parties, with straightforward racism and xenophobia, which have traction in one major party, and you get what we saw yesterday in El Paso.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you think that this cross-pollination of ideas means Sanders is just as culpable as Trump, then congratulations: You just cannonballed right into the inferno. It is one thing to favor one’s countrymen over one’s potential countrymen, as Sanders does (narrow-mindedly, in my view).

Portions of the manifesto read like an eco-terrorist rant from the 1980s. Others read like Timothy McVeigh. “Actually the Hispanic community was not my target,” the manifesto says, “until I read ‘The Great Replacement’ [the Christchurch manifesto].” These conspiracies have been snatched from the buffet line of bad ideas, then served up as a form of fascism.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRecently, FBI Director Christopher Wray \u003ca href=\"https://wjla.com/news/nation-world/fbi-director-tallies-threats-domestic-terrorism-china-russia-violence-against-police\"\u003esaid\u003c/a\u003e that he has focused on stopping violence rather than ideology: You can think anything you want, but being violent is what will trigger the feds’ attention.

Jihadists believe many things that many ordinary, peaceful Muslims believe; they take those beliefs and pursue them with extreme intellectualized violence. How do you police an ideology shared in part by millions of law-abiding citizens? Given that Americans are supposed to enjoy freedom of conscience, how do you police an ideology at all?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs we learn more about the perpetrator, we will doubtless discover that he said vile and alarming things, online and off, long before he started killing. In retrospect, all these statements will feel like tragic missed opportunities to straitjacket a young man and save both his life (he will soon face Texas justice, after all) and the lives of at least 20 others. But keep in mind how commonplace, on a sentence-by-sentence level, portions of that manifesto are.

Only near the end, after murdering someone who wouldn’t stop pleading for his life, does he finally offer the flimsiest of explanations. “I just can’t stand all the fucking noise,” he whines.

Not so for \u003cem\u003eThe Nightingale\u003c/em\u003e, which is set in 1825 amid the escalation of British presence on the island of Tasmania. The movie is a period piece, but it’s the furthest thing from a sumptuous costume drama, instead summoning the brutal truths of the time for a story that provides no easy resolution.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Nightingale \u003c/em\u003efollows an Irish woman, Clare (Aisling Franciosi), who sets out to exact justice after being assaulted by Hawkins and his men and witnessing them murder her husband and child. It’s not a simple narrative of an avenging angel, however; Kent sets this story apart from the tropes that define the “\u003ca href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2019/01/the-babadooks-jennifer-kent-on-the-nightingale.html\"\u003erape revenge\u003c/a\u003e” genre, one of the \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/05/revenge-is-a-gory-shocking-and-subversive-piece-of-horror/559961/?utm_source=feed\"\u003egrisliest\u003c/a\u003e subcategories of 1970s exploitation film. The scenes of assault in \u003cem\u003eThe Nightingale \u003c/em\u003eare incredibly hard to watch, not because of gratuitous voyeurism, but because they are unvarnished. Kent takes pains to depict the experience from Clare’s perspective, without any hint of Hollywood glamorization. The same goes for all the other violence in the film, of which there is plenty. There are no arcing splatters of blood, no clean pieces of action choreography; every death feels like a senseless loss.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe story is anchored in the history of the penal colonies established by Britain in Australia from 1788 to 1868. Clare is an Irish convict, whose husband is being detained in Tasmania with her, and that status is why Hawkins views her as his property to dominate and control. Kent also makes sure to depict the experiences of Aboriginal people, who were debased and eradicated on a massive scale by a colonial power that didn’t treat them as human beings. As Clare embarks on her journey to find Hawkins, she connects with a local Aboriginal guide, Billy (Baykali Ganambarr), and the two eventually bond over their shared experiences of military oppression.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat relationship and the actors’ two performances are about the only shreds of humanity that Kent allows the viewer to cling to during the characters’ trek through the forest. Even so, the two are so suspicious of each other that much of their journey sees them fighting and splitting up, each of them at times unsure if there’s even any point in seeking vengeance. The camera work heightens the tension: \u003cem\u003eThe Nightingale\u003c/em\u003e is shot in a boxy aspect ratio that feels claustrophobic despite the rural setting. Kent doesn’t exult in the wide majesty of the forest, but rather conveys the ominous trees surrounding Clare and Billy on all sides. Frequently, she cuts to extreme close-ups of her characters’ faces, registering every twitch of pain they’re suffering.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlthough \u003cem\u003eThe Nightingale \u003c/em\u003eis a tough watch, all the brutality is in service of a worthy effort: viscerally reckoning with the history of the director’s home country. Clare’s quest for retaliation leads her down a dark path, but in Kent’s eyes, it’s the only path available to her after surviving horrors that essentially robbed her of the spark of life. \u003cem\u003eThe Nightingale \u003c/em\u003eisn’t an easy cinematic experience, but if you can handle it, it’s an unforgettable one.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/3waoT59-QnU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/3waoT59-QnU/","published":"2019-08-04T12:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-595153"},{"title":"The Truth About Painkiller Addiction","content":"\u003cp class=\"dropcap\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIn the early days of the opioid crisis, public officials had reasons to blame it on all the pills. News stories featured people who, to the shock of their neighbors and loved ones, had died unexpectedly of a drug overdose. In an emergency, authorities do what they can with the tools at hand. In tightening controls on doctors who prescribed pain relievers, state and federal agencies were focusing on the aspect of the problem most subject to regulatory intervention.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eTo some degree, that strategy worked. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, overdose deaths declined by about 5 percent in 2018—a dip attributable almost exclusively to fewer deaths from oxycodone, hydrocodone, and other prescription opioids. (Fentanyl deaths are still climbing.) Now that the fever of the opioid crisis \u003ca href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/drug-overdose-data.htm\"\u003emay be breaking\u003c/a\u003e, Americans can revisit some of the stories we have told ourselves about the role of prescription medication in the crisis.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eDid policy makers and public-health experts correctly assess who was at risk of becoming addicted to opioid medications? Were their views on the addictive potential of such drugs realistic? Did they anticipate the consequences of policies devised to constrain doctors from overprescribing? In retrospect, policy makers seriously misjudged the answers to these questions, overestimating the risk that these drugs posed to the average patient while simultaneously doing too little to urge clinicians to identify those most vulnerable to addiction. The best time to correct course is now—while the opioid problem still commands public attention, and before the restrictions imposed at the height of the crisis harden into permanent practice.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"dropcap\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003eBy now, the outlines of the story are familiar: Opioid prescribing began to rise in the early 1990s, powered by two forces. One was a campaign by oncologists and pain specialists to correct the undertreatment of pain. The other was the introduction in 1996 of the potent time-release oxycodone medication Oxycontin, which the drug company Purdue Pharma vigorously marketed to doctors.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003ePacked with up to 80 milligrams of oxycodone a pill, Oxycontin became a magnet for opioid abusers. And with a street value of $1 a milligram, Oxycontin became valuable as local currency. By 1999, the diversion of pills into the black market was well under way in Maine and rural Appalachia.

Law enforcement cracked down on pill mills, the maker of Oxycontin made the pill harder to crush, physicians tightened their prescribing practices, and more states created prescription registries to help identify people who were obtaining prescriptions by “doctor shopping”—that is, by seeking prescriptions from multiple physicians at the same time. Many people who abused pills turned to heroin, which was cheaper and easier to get. Several years later, illicitly sourced fentanyl, 50 times as potent as heroin, intensified the death toll.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2017/04/joblessness-and-opioids/523281/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: The link between opioids and unemployment\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eFrom 1999 to 2011, the CDC documented a fourfold rise in prescription-related overdose fatalities.

In Feldman’s case, the nature of the risk was constant anguish. When she was 4 years old, her heroin-addicted mother left the family and died of an overdose before she was 12. “For so much of my childhood, I felt abandoned, worthless, unlovable, and confused,” she told me. Her first Percocet came from a girlfriend. “Being numb helped,” she said. Before Percocet, though, she had achieved “escape” with marijuana, alcohol, PCP, benzodiazepines, and cocaine.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eAs for “Johnny,” the hypothetical shiny all-American kid who seemed to have it all—well, I met a real-life version of him this year. I am a psychiatrist who, for the past 11 months, has taken a break from urban life to do some clinical work at a behavioral-health clinic in a small community in southeastern Ohio. I have gotten into the habit, as I go around town, of chatting with anyone who seems friendly. While stopping at a fast-food place one day, I met a 23-year-old man who was on a vape break from his job there, and he was game to talk. He told me that he had been a star football player at his public high school. At 18, he had been thrilled to receive a full football scholarship to Ohio State University. He planned to major in engineering but truly aspired to the National Football League.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eUnlike many of his friends, who felt stymied in the small Appalachian town where pills and heroin were short-term cures for boredom, this young man could imagine a future for himself. But a month before graduation, he was in a car accident. The injury to his right shoulder ruined his ability to throw overhead—and the damage went far beyond his anatomy. He developed post-traumatic stress disorder from the crash. Even worse, he told me, his universe was shattered. Football had given him both social status and a sense of purpose. What made this devastation bearable was the hydrocodone that his orthopedic surgeon gave him. Within six months, he was drinking and still using the pills that the sympathetic surgeon continued to prescribe. Eventually, he moved to heroin. By the time we met, he was enrolled in a buprenorphine clinic and was otherwise drug-free, but was still trying to regain his footing. Every day, he went to work at a fast-food restaurant and felt bitter about the direction of his life.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2018/08/elderly-americans-opioids/568981/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: A simple reason so many older Americans are overdosing on opioids\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eAll of us have stressors in our lives, but when the turmoil seems insurmountable, some people find drugs unexpectedly seductive. One day last summer, after I gave a talk on addiction in New York, a 25-year-old graduate student approached me. He told me what had happened to him as a teen and the only child of working-class parents in Queens. (Both he and the young man in Ohio gave me permission to describe their stories but asked me not to identify them by name.) During his junior year of high school, the graduate student had been laboring under what he called “a boulder of stress.” He was ashamed of being overweight, anxious about excelling at the private school his strict and intimidating parents could barely afford, and quietly panicking about what they would say when one day he would have to them tell he was gay. At the end of his junior year, he broke his front teeth in a bike accident. The dental surgeon gave him two weeks of Percocet—a drug the then-teenager had never even heard of. “But I loved it,” he told me. The drug gave him freedom from dread. He managed to get two more refills from the dentist, and then bought Percocets or Vicodins from kids who loitered outside the high school near his house. One day, his father could not rouse him and called an ambulance. His parents were shocked by this crisis, and so was he. He weaned himself off the pills and they all entered family therapy. Within a year, he felt less overwhelmed and was ready to apply to college. He could talk to his parents more freely about himself and was working up to coming out to them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eReducing both of these cases to one-dimensional, good-kids-get-hooked-on-opioids narratives may be tempting. But these two men’s stories are more nuanced than that, and reveal much about the complex nature of addiction. Opioids acquire their dark power when they keep souls—not just broken shoulders and teeth—from throbbing. If those two young men in Ohio and New York had never been given pain relievers by their doctors, would they have gotten past their turmoil without turning to drugs?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eI’m less sanguine about the former Ohio football phenom, not least because he lived in a community where so many people were trying to medicate their troubles away, whether with opioids or alcohol. In the eyes of some people, certain problems are worse than a drug habit. Addiction often conceals depression, and, if not for drugs, the Ohio man might have slid even deeper into it—at least until the toll of addiction became too great. As for the young man from Queens, seeking out Percocet would never have occurred to him if he had not been prescribed it. So yes, in a sense, his dentist precipitated his addiction. His parents initially understood his addiction to be entirely the result of a dentist and a prescription. Yet when they learned the depth of their son’s unhappiness, they realized that the prescription was not the full problem.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"dropcap\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe focus on prescriptions as the dominant problem, however, was embraced by policy makers of all kinds, from legislators to pharmacy-benefits managers. It drove their vigorous efforts to rein in prescribing, and it resulted in a one-third reduction in the number of opioid prescriptions nationwide from 2012 to 2017. Some form of pill control was warranted, to be sure. Too many doctors and dentists were routinely overprescribing, sometimes dispensing a month’s supply of pills when only several days’ worth, if any, was needed. But the bluntly designed pill-control policies enacted by insurers, pharmacies, and regulators did great damage to patients with chronic pain who had been functioning well on prescription opioids.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eDoctors felt Drug Enforcement Administration agents, their state medical boards, attorneys general, and other health-care agencies breathing down their neck. They reduced patients’ dosages or cut them off altogether, leaving them in misery, unable to find another physician who would treat them, and sometimes contemplating suicide. Policy makers \u003ca href=\"https://www.cigna.com/newsroom/news-releases/2018/cignas-partnership-with-physicians-successfully-reduces-opioid-use-by-25-percent-one-year-ahead-of-goal\"\u003ehave frequently used\u003c/a\u003e a reduction in total opioid prescriptions as a metric for success, but that metric does not account for how demand for those medications is distributed among patients. The potency of opioids is often measured in “morphine milligram equivalents,” or MMEs; 90 milligrams of morphine equals 60 MMEs of oxycodone. It turns out that only a \u003ca href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6097519/\"\u003esmall minority\u003c/a\u003e of chronically ill people, about 10 percent (many of whom take high doses), account for 70 percent of the total MMEs prescribed. When an insurer boasts of a 25 percent reduction in total MMEs prescribed, that could mean that some chronically ill patients have successfully been shifted to a nonaddictive form of analgesia—or that patients who badly need opiates aren’t getting them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2017/05/is-depression-contributing-to-the-opioid-epidemic/526560/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: How untreated depression contributes to the opioid epidemic\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eNow that the CDC’s preliminary data on prescription-related overdoses show an encouraging trend, I hope some of the pressure on doctors to curtail prescribing as a general practice will give way to making more careful distinctions based on what is appropriate for each patient and what is not. But breaking free of the simple narrative that opioids are indiscriminately dangerous to patients is difficult. Recent headlines about \u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/investigations/dea-pain-pill-database/?utm_term=.ba2353f7e9c2\"\u003emassive quantities of pills hauled into small towns\u003c/a\u003e reinforce that perception.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThere is little question that the more drugs coursing through a neighborhood or town, the more they will be used.

This is where Feldman and those two troubled young men come in. Most people take prescribed opioids uneventfully, but in these three cases the individuals did not. Clearly, the addictive potential of drugs is not random. And while exposure is necessary for addiction to develop, exposure is almost never sufficient. Addiction is a dynamic process, and depending on whether someone is suffering in a certain way under certain circumstances, a drug will either be profoundly seductive or it won’t.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/UiQ1hVjuucY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/UiQ1hVjuucY/","published":"2019-08-04T10:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-595090"},{"title":"Planned Parenthood’s Never-Ending Identity Crisis","content":"\u003cp class=\"dropcap\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003eAll abortion debates are eternal.

The attacks on Planned Parenthood are not new, and neither are the debates over its identity. “I get a little amused at people who say, ‘Well, you know, what’s going on right now, isn’t this just awful?’” said Feldt, who led the organization from 1996 to 2005 and now coaches women on executive-leadership skills.

For several years afterward, abortion opponents fought to pass a constitutional amendment that would have superseded the Supreme Court’s 1973 opinion in \u003cem\u003eRoe v. Wade\u003c/em\u003e. One of Wattleton’s first goals, she declared at a press conference, was to restore Medicaid coverage for abortions for poor women—something that is still a priority of the abortion-rights movement today. At the time, “it was hugely controversial within the organization, the concern being that this would imperil our federal funding,” Wattleton told me. “It’s really unbelievable, the conversation today versus the conversation then, which is almost exactly the same.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eDuring her tenure, Wattleton built a reputation as an eloquent and ubiquitous defender of abortion. She successfully pushed the organization to take an aggressive stance in favor of abortion rights—sometimes to the chagrin of local affiliates, who feared public condemnation and retribution from lawmakers. In 1989, Wattleton oversaw the creation of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, the organization’s advocacy arm, which promotes pro-abortion-rights candidates and mobilizes voters. But she rejects the idea that Planned Parenthood has politicized abortion.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e“The mischaracterization of somehow, Planned Parenthood making this a political issue is astonishing to me,” she told me. “There is nothing that the organization would prefer, that they would like to do more, than to be left alone to provide services to people who want them and ask for them.” Asking Planned Parenthood to step out of politics is like asking the organization to simply avoid its attackers, she said, and downplaying abortion is a way of perpetuating shame. It sends a message to women that “you’re doing something that’s naughty, that’s bad,” she said. “I am aghast that anyone at the top of Planned Parenthood would even counter such a message, let alone speak it.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/07/lila-rose-anti-abortion/593404/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: When your pregnancy is political\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eAnd yet, Maraldo, Wattleton’s successor, did exactly that: She tried to steer the organization away from its association with abortion and cultivate its reputation as a mainstream health-care provider. At the time, in the early 1990s, Planned Parenthood had just won a major victory at the Supreme Court, which reaffirmed the fundamental principles of \u003cem\u003eRoe\u003c/em\u003e in its decision in \u003cem\u003ePlanned Parenthood v. Casey\u003c/em\u003e. Bill Clinton had just won the White House, and the Democratic Party held both chambers of Congress. The possibility of sweeping health-care reforms seemed real, and Maraldo, a former nurse, wanted to make sure Planned Parenthood would have a voice in those debates. She also\u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/17/us/seeking-to-lead-group-beyond-abortion-battle.html?searchResultPosition=3\"\u003e gave a number\u003c/a\u003e of\u003ca href=\"https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-11-09-vw-54964-story.html\"\u003e interviews arguing\u003c/a\u003e that abortion should not be the center of Planned Parenthood’s identity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e“Abortion, abortion, abortion—it’s like waving red flags in front of a bull. We do so much else,” Maraldo told me recently. At its core, she said, the fight over abortion is “really about reproductive control and privacy.” While she believes abortion should be safe and available to women who need it, she saw—and sees—prevention as the main mission of Planned Parenthood. According to the organization’s\u003ca href=\"https://www.plannedparenthood.org/uploads/filer_public/4a/0f/4a0f3969-cf71-4ec3-8a90-733c01ee8148/190124-annualreport18-p03.pdf\"\u003e own data\u003c/a\u003e, that’s true: Abortion accounts for only 3.4 percent of the services offered at the national network of Planned Parenthood affiliates, while consultations on contraception and sexually transmitted diseases make up 75 percent. In 2017, Planned Parenthood affiliates performed 332,757 abortions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIn recent years, the abortion-rights movement has turned away from Clinton’s argument that abortion should be “safe, legal, and rare,” instead\u003ca href=\"https://slate.com/human-interest/2018/07/the-abortions-we-dont-talk-about-six-slate-women-tell-their-stories.html\"\u003e promoting\u003c/a\u003e campaigns\u003ca href=\"https://shoutyourabortion.com/\"\u003e to “shout your abortion”\u003c/a\u003e and\u003ca href=\"https://prochoiceoregon.org/event/ice-cream-naral-pro-choice-oregon/\"\u003e creating ice-cream flavors\u003c/a\u003e with names such as “Rocky Roe v. Wade.” This kind of rhetoric “would not be my choice,” Maraldo, who now leads Girls Inc. of New York, told me. “I don’t think labeling having an abortion with pride is necessarily going to resonate with most Americans. I think the American people, at the end of the day, are mainstream centrists. I think the polarities have taken over. And I think that for a lot of Americans around the dinner table, it’s a problem.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe strategy Maraldo articulated in the ’90s, outlining a vision of Planned Parenthood as a general health-care provider, eventually led to her\u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/09/us/reasserting-its-identity-group-picks-new-leader.html?searchResultPosition=2\"\u003e ouster from the organization\u003c/a\u003e. Her successor, Feldt, represented a return to Planned Parenthood’s earlier era. Before taking her national role in 1996, Feldt led affiliates in Arizona and Texas. During her decade at the head of the national organization, Feldt learned an important lesson, she told me: “Controversy is your friend. When something is controversial, it means it’s important enough that people are paying attention. You can take that energy, and you can use it to propel yourself forward.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eFeldt does not believe Planned Parenthood needs to choose between being a health-care provider and a political advocate. “I think it is possible to walk and chew gum at the same time,” she said. But in the years since she left the organization, she believes it has “kept narrowing what reproductive rights are all about … to call it health care.” Feldt, who entered adulthood during the civil-rights movement, thinks Planned Parenthood’s mission is about “whether women will be able to function as full and equal citizens. It’s not about birth control. It’s not about abortion. It’s about who we are as women.” The organization has been debating between its role as a health-care provider and an advocacy organization “since Margaret Sanger’s day, 100-and-some-odd years ago,” she told me, referring to the woman who founded the organization’s precursor. These same debates were still raging when Feldt arrived. “But the truth is, it’s all inseparable,” she said. “And when you try to make yourself smaller, you will always get pushed into a defensive corner.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eOver the past 40 years of personnel drama at the top of Planned Parenthood, one theme has remained constant: The hard-charging political warriors have tended to last longer than the women who tried to neutralize Planned Parenthood’s image. Cecile Richards, who succeeded Feldt, was a savvy political strategist who was nursed on red-state politics: Her mother, Ann, stands as the last Democrat and last woman to serve as governor of Texas.

In that show, one family deals with the tumultuous decade of the title, in a fashion that brings them into close contact with nearly all of the major news events of the period. Critics \u003ca href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1999-02-05-9902050133-story.html\"\u003emocked the show’s tendency\u003c/a\u003e to turn the actual events of history into fodder for an overwrought family drama.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"mDwuzL\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eYears and Years\u003c/em\u003e does exactly the same thing, but the decade it traces is ... the 2020s. It starts on New Year’s Eve 2019, then vaults forward through the next 10 years over six episodes (with a brief epilogue set in 2034 for good measure). It has all the sweep of historical fiction, but its history is invented, an attempt to extrapolate current trends into a world that feels scarily plausible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"1WI1Q4\"\u003eThe show’s speculative fiction doesn’t feel so fictional. On it, refugees hoping to flee to Britain are rounded up in concentration camps, and fascist populism gains traction by having an entertaining figurehead who’s not afraid to be ridiculous on TV. (Here, that figurehead is named Vivian Rook, and she’s played by \u003ca href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000668/?ref_=nv_sr_1?ref_=nv_sr_1\"\u003eEmma Thompson\u003c/a\u003e with ruthless hilarity.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"n0xQ6C\"\u003eBut the events are all filtered through the prism of the fictional Lyons family: four siblings, their partners, their children, and their grandmother. (Their parents are no longer in the picture.) History, then, is only relevant if it’s relevant to the Lyonses. When the US launches a nuclear bomb at a Chinese military base in the first episode, eldest Lyons daughter Edith (\u003ca href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0828961/?ref_=nv_sr_1?ref_=nv_sr_1\"\u003eJessica Hynes\u003c/a\u003e) is there. The growing refugee crisis is seen via the prism of a young man the youngest Lyons son, Daniel (\u003ca href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0869871/?ref_=nv_sr_1?ref_=nv_sr_1\"\u003eRussell Tovey\u003c/a\u003e), starts sleeping with. Even Vivian’s political rise is filtered through the family members’ perspectives, despite Thompson being the biggest name in the cast. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"DEsGbU\"\u003eSome of these stories work better than others. The relationship between Daniel and Viktor (\u003ca href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2360755/?ref_=nv_sr_1?ref_=nv_sr_1\"\u003eMaxim Baldry\u003c/a\u003e) drives much of the show’s run and grounds some of its more ridiculous moments. (Daniel shatters his marriage to another man by running away to have sex with Viktor when the US nukes China, and he becomes convinced the world might really be ending.) \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"egD3UH\"\u003eBut then you have something like when Lyons grandchild Bethany (\u003ca href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm9519090/?ref_=nv_sr_1?ref_=nv_sr_1\"\u003eLydia West\u003c/a\u003e) declares that she is a transhumanist and wishes to transcend her physical form to become a being of pure information, living in the cloud somewhere. It ends up tying into the series’ end game, but for much of the series’ run, it feels wildly extraneous at best and slightly as if it’s mocking trans people at worst. (By the end of the finale, the show reveals its hand, and I feel safe in saying it is fully on board with us trans folks. Phew.) \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"562ATC\"\u003eBoth the show’s strengths and weaknesses are par for the course for its writer, \u003ca href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0203961/?ref_=nv_sr_1?ref_=nv_sr_1\"\u003eRussell T. Davies\u003c/a\u003e, who might be best known in the US for the four seasons he spent rebooting and then running \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2014/8/22/6055755/doctor-who-explained-who-is-doctor-who?__c=1\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eDoctor Who\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e from 2005 to 2010. But Davies is also one of the most influential TV writers of his generation, particularly when it comes to depictions of gay men. He also created \u003ca href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0185102/?ref_=nm_flmg_wr_25\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eQueer as Folk\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, which ran in the UK from 1999 to 2000, and was the rare series to depict gay men forthrightly and honestly. It gained a cult fanbase in the US, before it was adapted for a local audience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Xfw3uQ\"\u003eDavies is fantastic at conceiving of TV series that look at corners of the world that aren’t always well-covered. And \u003cem\u003eYears and Years\u003c/em\u003e — with its blend of family drama and sci-fi — is certainly an amazing \u003cem\u003eidea\u003c/em\u003e for a show. But the show’s over-reliance on sentimentality and the thinness of some of the characters are distinct weaknesses of Davies’s approach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Yq7Uhh\"\u003eAnd so is too much of the finale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"Fc2Uy7\"\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eYears and Years\u003c/em\u003e tries to give audiences hope in the end.

It was produced by public network BBC One in the UK, but its American co-producer is HBO, a network primarily subscribed to by those with enough disposable income to do so. I doubt anybody will change their habits because of seeing Muriel talk about how we should be fighting against a slow slide into dystopia, instead of bemoaning it and doing nothing, but it’s nice to hear all the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"fgANpx\"\u003eHowever, \u003cem\u003eYears and Years\u003c/em\u003e lets both the Lyons family and, by extension, its viewers off the hook. The finale’s main action involves trying to locate Viktor and save him from one of the concentration camps where refugees are being sent to die. (In Davies’s savage satire, the refugees not being actively killed by the government, but by a new, lethal flu designed in a government lab somewhere that gives those in charge a veneer of plausible deniability.) But Viktor was \u003cem\u003esent\u003c/em\u003e to that camp by eldest Lyons child Stephen (\u003ca href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1239499/?ref_=nv_sr_1?ref_=nv_sr_1\"\u003eRory Kinnear\u003c/a\u003e), whose grief after Daniel died trying to save Viktor a few episodes earlier has curdled into a hate for the man Daniel was trying to save.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"hr7w7z\"\u003eAs a motivation in a fictional story, this is more or less fine. But as a motivation in a story that is trying to say something about The Way We Live Today, it’s too easy. It’s too close to an explanation, a “reason,” for a dark and horrific action, rather than allowing viewers to sit uneasily with the idea that some people might just hate refugees because they’re xenophobic or racist, that good-hearted big brothers like Stephen can turn out to be horrible people when what’s at stake isn’t someone in their very own family. But, no, Stephen has to have a big moment to reveal that he was basically good all along, just a little misguided, which is why he saves the day (by shooting one of the \u003cem\u003ereal\u003c/em\u003e villains in the leg) in the end. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"LFE3bc\"\u003eA failure of nerve, then, is the greatest failing of the \u003cem\u003eYears and Years\u003c/em\u003e finale. In it, once the British people get a good look inside the camps, they’re outraged, and not only does the whole system come down, but Vivian Rook is also arrested for the murder of those who died in the camps. Right when the show is trying to say that constructing a better world is on us — on \u003cem\u003eall\u003c/em\u003e of us — it ends up saying that, actually, if you just show people images of the worst horrors the world has to provide, they’ll revert to their better angels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"S4BG80\"\u003eBut we live in a world where there actually are camps filled with detainees along the US border, and we’ve seen images from those camps, and so far, there’s not public outrage sufficient to shut them down. I admired the way \u003cem\u003eYears and Years\u003c/em\u003e showed that sometimes direct, violent action is necessary to push back against the forces of darkness (via a few characters’ attempts to free Viktor and others in the camps), but the only person who \u003cem\u003ereally\u003c/em\u003e gets hurt is the man Stephan shoots in the leg, who survives. The finale wants hope and it wants results, but it doesn’t want to break any eggs. It doesn’t want consequences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ipoHdE\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eYears and Years\u003c/em\u003e is so good at the things it’s good at that it’s easy to miss all of the ways it falls short. It vaults forward in time with a reckless abandon that’s honestly thrilling, and it features strong performances despite the thin characterization of some members of the Lyons family. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ud8JDR\"\u003eBut its vision starts out as a bleak one and wants to give us some degree of hope to take forward. In so doing, however, it inadvertently suggests that what we need isn’t to band together to make a better reality but, instead, to wait for everybody else to come to their senses. We are living in history. We are not watching it on TV. What hurts \u003cem\u003eYears and Years\u003c/em\u003e in the end is that it’s too insistent that you keep watching, no matter what.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"f7EaFv\"\u003eYears and Years \u003cem\u003eis available for streaming \u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.hbo.com/years-and-years\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eon HBO’s streaming platforms\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","url":"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/8/4/20752322/years-and-years-finale-recap-hbo-review","published":"2019-08-04T17:30:00Z","guid":"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/8/4/20752322/years-and-years-finale-recap-hbo-review"},{"title":"“Keep that shit on the battlefield:” Beto O’Rourke calls for major gun reform following the El Paso and Dayton shootings","content":"\u003cimg alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OCExHPRb8LlJJN1nUcDQmc0OE4k=/354x0:3537x2387/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/64909240/GettyImages_1166035681.0.jpg\" /\u003e\n\n  \u003csmall\u003eBeto O’Rourke addresses the press outside the site of the El Paso Walmart shooting. | Getty Images\u003c/small\u003e\n\n  \u003cp\u003eAfter a weekend of shootings that killed 29, Democratic presidential candidates want immediate change. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp id=\"beNj3d\"\u003eDemocratic presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke’s hometown was struck with tragedy this weekend, after a \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/8/3/20753049/el-paso-walmart-cielo-vista-mall-shooting-what-we-know\"\u003emass shooting inside an El Paso, Texas, Walmart\u003c/a\u003e left 20 people dead and at least 26 people wounded Saturday. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Z6sqfw\"\u003eOn the campaign trail in Las Vegas with nine other candidates, O’Rourke, visibly emotional, said he was cutting his trip short to fly back to El Paso, which he represented while in Congress.

In the first year of the experiment, families in the treatment group were required to use their housing vouchers in areas with poverty rates under 10 percent as of 1990. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"aQAoxI\"\u003eThe first evaluations of the program found \u003ca href=\"https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/lkatz/files/experimental_analysis_of_neighborhood_effects.pdf\"\u003emixed results\u003c/a\u003e.

Did discrimination by landlords in rich neighborhoods, or discriminatory zoning laws banning apartments, keep them out?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"H1iLiE\"\u003eOne option the researchers considered was just giving a cash bonus on top of the housing voucher to families that move to higher-opportunity neighborhoods to see if that spurred more moves — but an earlier study found that even \u003ca href=\"https://nlihc.org/sites/default/files/Encouraging-Residential-Moves-to-Opportunity.pdf\"\u003eoffering a $500 bonus to Chicago families who moved to higher-opportunity neighborhoods\u003c/a\u003e did nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"3A7nmb\"\u003eWhat’s more, when the economists started talking to housing authority officials, they kept hearing that money wasn’t the main barrier — that “there’s a much richer set of more complex constraints,” as they told Hendren.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"L6toJn\"\u003eThat was certainly the experience of Nikki Manlapaz, the working mom who found a home for her and her son Theo through the program. She told me that in previous housing searches, she relied on “what I heard from friends and on Craigslist. I tried Apartments.com, but it was just basically calling the places on your own, looking at the places on your own, applying and just waiting, and usually the answer’s no.” What she needed wasn’t just money but an easier process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"pzQ1Al\"\u003eThe eventual intervention the researchers settled on involved contracting with a local nonprofit, the \u003ca href=\"http://interimicda.org/\"\u003eInterim Community Development Association\u003c/a\u003e, to offer counseling through two sets of “navigators”: family navigators, who worked with Section 8 families to help in their housing search; and housing navigators, who met with landlords in high-opportunity neighborhoods and sought to dispel any negative impressions they had about the Section 8 program, and about tenants who might have criminal records or poor credit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"W1UeOg\"\u003eThe navigators explain to families the benefits of moving to neighborhoods that seem to produce better outcomes for kids once they grow up, and walk through strategies for overcoming barriers, like poor credit and discrimination against criminal records. “We try to get in a couple meetings before they get their voucher,” Sarah Birkebak, one of the family navigators, told me. “Those initial meetings focus a lot on introducing the opportunity neighborhoods to families.” In many cases, Birkebak says, she advised families to put together “rental résumés” to explain their living situation to landlords. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Z0aER8\"\u003eMeanwhile, the housing navigators worked with landlords to expedite inspections and generally try to cut through red tape that might make landlords not want to deal with Section 8.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"fch01i\"\u003eIt’s a relatively labor-intensive intervention.

While only 14 percent of families in the control group wound up in high-opportunity neighborhoods, that $2,700 per family intervention was able to boost the share to 54 percent in the treatment group.

Compare that to the $2,700 cost of counseling, and an additional $2,500 to $3,000 more per year per family that Section 8 paid due to higher rent in their new neighborhoods, and it looks like a pretty exceptional deal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"9yimYu\"\u003eThe program doesn’t quite pay for itself by increasing future tax revenue, Hendren says — but it comes pretty close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-wide-block\"\u003e  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZKUUl6wTY2DdbBSUfy7i7X6_0Xw=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18436043/SF9A2073.jpg\"\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003eYaroslav plays in his family’s living room.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"IBCp1p\"\u003eMoving on up\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"9xYOnv\"\u003eThe next big question, then, is whether this is the kind of intervention you can easily replicate and scale — especially in a form that pays for itself. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"5JNGWI\"\u003eThe intervention was a demand-side policy: it operated primarily by changing the behavior and pitches of prospective renters.

Pennebaker barely had access to Clinton himself in the film, but instead, he chose to focus on George Stephanopoulos and James Carville, who were running his campaign at the time. The documentary went on to earn and Oscar nomination, though Clinton himself never seemed to appreciate the thing all that much—he summed up his feelings about the film to Pennebaker in a brutally short note that read, \"\u003ca href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/04/da-pennebaker-obituary\" target=\"_blank\"\u003egood movie -Bill\u003c/a\u003e.\"\u003c/p\u003e \u003ch2\u003e4. \u003ci\u003eZiggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars \u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e(1973)\u003c/h2\u003e \u003cdiv data-iframely-id=\"O2C4BfP\" data-embedded-url=\"https://youtu.be/8OUtJ9gzg3Y\" class=\"article__embed article__embed--iframely\"\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;\" data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"\u003e\u003ciframe data-img=\"\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/O2C4BfP?playerjs=1\" style=\"border:0;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;\" allowfullscreen allow=\"encrypted-media\" data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003ePennebaker was initially sent out by Bowie's label to shoot a few songs for a short promo, but after seeing Bowie do Ziggy Stardust on stage, Pennebaker decided to make a full-length feature, instead.

It\u0026#8217;s become a repeated, easy talking point for politicians looking to find a convenient scapegoat for mass shootings, that doesn\u0026#8217;t involve confronting the ease of firearm availability, or the persistent strength of far-right extremism. In wake of the Parkland shooting last February, for instance, the Trump White House\u003ca href=\"https://www.polygon.com/2018/3/8/17098056/trump-white-house-video-games-meeting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003e held a round table\u003c/a\u003e about perceived violence in video games.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is all despite the fact that there is little-to-no evidence to support the notion that video games cause mass shootings.

It is likely, moreover, that Justice Brett Kavanaugh has the five votes he needs to make this happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2008, not long after the Supreme Court struck down its much stronger gun regulations, the District of Columbia passed an emergency law that, among other things, banned assault rifles and high-capacity magazines within the District. The law was challenged, and the challenge eventually reached a panel of three Republican appointees on the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Two of those judges upheld the law.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe third judge was Kavanaugh. In his dissent, Kavanaugh called for a sweeping expansion of the Second Amendment, beyond even what his two Republican colleagues were willing to endorse. Regarding assault rifles, the future Trump appointee argued that these weapons should enjoy the same nearly unassailable level of level of constitutional protection the Supreme Court afforded to handguns in its 2008 decision in \u003ca href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/07pdf/07-290.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eDistrict of Columbia v.

Circuit judges that disagreed with Kavanaugh rested much of their opinion on the Supreme Court\u0026#8217;s 2008 statement that \u0026#8220;dangerous and unusual\u0026#8221; weapons are beyond the reach of the Second Amendment. Though the original \u003cem\u003eHeller\u003c/em\u003e decision held, for the first time in American history, that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to own a gun, it also laid out several significant limits on the right to bear arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition to permitting bans on \u0026#8220;dangerous and unusual weapons,\u0026#8221; the 2008 \u003cem\u003eHeller\u003c/em\u003e opinion also permits \u0026#8220;longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.\u0026#8221; And the section of the opinion laying out these permitted gun regulations also indicates that other, unmentioned gun laws may also be allowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is a catch, however. \u003cem\u003eHeller\u003c/em\u003e was a 5-4 decision. Several months before his recent death, retired Justice John Paul Stevens revealed to The New York Times\u0026#8217; Adam Liptak that he \u0026#8220;\u003ca href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/stevens-nra-kennedy-heller-supreme-court-eb23f34687b3/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003ehelped persuade Justice Anthony M. Kennedy\u003c/a\u003e, who was in the majority, to ask for ‘some important changes’ to Justice Scalia’s opinion.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese changes were the passages in \u003cem\u003eHeller\u003c/em\u003e indicating that the decision “should not be taken to cast doubt” on many existing kinds of gun regulations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKennedy, however, is no longer on the Supreme Court. And Kavanaugh appears unlikely to support the language Kennedy pushed to include in the \u003cem\u003eHeller\u003c/em\u003e opinion. Assault rifle bans and other bans on dangerous and unusual weapons, in other words, likely hang by a thread.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne more fact is worth noting. Before Kennedy\u0026#8217;s retirement, the Supreme Court largely avoided Second Amendment cases \u0026#8212; often over \u003ca href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/stevens-nra-kennedy-heller-supreme-court-eb23f34687b3/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eangry dissents\u003c/a\u003e by Justice Clarence Thomas. It hasn\u0026#8217;t heard such a case since 2010.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#8217;s likely that the justices avoided such cases because some members of the conservative bloc were unsure how Kennedy would vote if another Second Amendment case reached the Supreme Court. So its significant that, just months after Kavanaugh joined its bench, the court announced that it would \u003ca href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/breaking-supreme-court-will-hear-the-first-big-second-amendment-case-of-the-kavanaugh-era-0a95ed4fccf3/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003ehear its first Second Amendment case in years\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fairness, there is a chance that this case will be \u003ca href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/2019/07/city-tells-justices-new-york-gun-case-is-moot/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003edismissed as moot\u003c/a\u003e. After the court announced it would hear the most recent Second Amendment case, New York City changed the gun regulation at issue in a likely effort to prevent the Supreme Court from reaching a decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there\u0026#8217;s virtually no doubt that Kavanaugh is eager to expand the Second Amendment, and little doubt that the Supreme Court is now in much more of a hurry to hear big guns\u0026#8217; cases than it was when Kennedy was still on the bench. Many future gunmen may soon enjoy broad rights to purchase the kinds of weapons used to commit mass murder in El Paso and Dayton.\t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"promo amp-wp-article-promo\"\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"post__figure post__figure--format-full\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"post__thumbnail\"\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003ca href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/membership/?c=cr042018-7-00-wp\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cimg width=\"2917\" height=\"2038\" src=\"https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/membership-graphic_2.03-1.png?w=2917\u0026amp;h=2038\u0026amp;crop=1\" class=\"attachment-full size-full\" alt=\"\" data-attachment-id=\"1142474\" data-permalink=\"https://thinkprogress.org/membership-graphic_2-03-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/membership-graphic_2.03-1.png?w=2917\u0026amp;h=2038\u0026amp;crop=1\" data-orig-size=\"2917,2038\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{\u0026quot;aperture\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;credit\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;camera\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;created_timestamp\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;copyright\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;focal_length\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;iso\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;shutter_speed\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;title\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;orientation\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;}\" data-image-title=\"membership graphic_2.03\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/membership-graphic_2.03-1.png?w=2917\u0026amp;h=2038\u0026amp;crop=1\" data-large-file=\"https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/membership-graphic_2.03-1.png?w=2917\u0026amp;h=2038\u0026amp;crop=1\" draggable=\"false\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1920px) 1920px,(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1920px) 1920px,(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1024px) 1024px,(min-width: 512px) and (max-width: 1024px) 1024px,(min-width: 512px) and (max-width: 768px) 768px,(max-width: 512px) 512px,(max-width: 768px) 768px,2917px\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/membership-graphic_2.03-1.png?w=1920\u0026#038;crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C1341px\u0026#038;ssl=1 1920w,https://i1.wp.com/thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/membership-graphic_2.03-1.png?w=1024\u0026#038;crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C715px\u0026#038;ssl=1 1024w,https://i1.wp.com/thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/membership-graphic_2.03-1.png?w=768\u0026#038;crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C537px\u0026#038;ssl=1 768w,https://i1.wp.com/thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/membership-graphic_2.03-1.png?w=512\u0026#038;crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C358px\u0026#038;ssl=1 512w,https://i1.wp.com/thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/membership-graphic_2.03-1.png?w=2917\u0026#038;crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C2038px\u0026#038;ssl=1 2917w\" /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/a\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n","url":"https://thinkprogress.org/brett-kavanaugh-wants-to-make-it-even-easier-for-gunmen-to-obtain-assault-rifles-0291eca41d17/","published":"2019-08-04T15:12:17Z","guid":"https://thinkprogress.org/?p=1152167"},{"title":"The El Paso mass shooting is a far-right terror attack","content":"\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#8217;s the same story, over and over again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn individual is radicalized online into believing that the white race is under attack from a perceived \u0026#8220;other\u0026#8221;.

In it he goes through a laundry list of white nationalist talking points, decrying the \u0026#8220;Hispanic invasion of Texas,\u0026#8221; praising the Christchurch shooter and saying that \u0026#8220;America will soon become a one-party state\u0026#8221; thanks to increased immigration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe manifesto has not yet been officially confirmed by law enforcement, however the timing of the post, coupled with the corroborating details inside it, match up with the shooter.

In general, the poll was good news for the research community, showing a gradual-but-steady rise in the public's view of scientists. But there were a few areas of concern within the data, which showed that the public still worries about issues like scientific misconduct and conflicts of interest. And the numbers reveal a partisan divide on the situations where scientists are trustworthy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe poll relied on Pew's American Trends Panel, a group that can include up to 13,500 US residents, though not all will participate in every survey. In this case, over 4,500 were asked to share their views on science.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eA partisan divide\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScientists have consistently been one of the most respected segments of the US population, and these results are in keeping with that. When the Pew asked whether people viewed scientists as acting in the public interest, 86% of the panel said yes. That puts scientists well ahead of politicians, business people, and the media, and roughly on par with the US military. This was higher among those with a strong knowledge of science, and higher among Democrats than Republicans (though 82% of Republicans still had a positive view of scientists).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1545819#p3\"\u003eRead 9 remaining paragraphs\u003c/a\u003e | \u003ca href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1545819\u0026comments=1\"\u003eComments\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"feedflare\"\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=e3CESjwdfUY:D3-ZUSSQrVI:V_sGLiPBpWU\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=e3CESjwdfUY:D3-ZUSSQrVI:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=e3CESjwdfUY:D3-ZUSSQrVI:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=e3CESjwdfUY:D3-ZUSSQrVI:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=e3CESjwdfUY:D3-ZUSSQrVI:qj6IDK7rITs\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=e3CESjwdfUY:D3-ZUSSQrVI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","url":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1545819","published":"2019-08-04T14:00:13Z","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1545819"},{"title":"Elon Musk will update the status of Starship development on August 24","content":"\u003cdiv id=\"rss-wrap\"\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"intro-image intro-left\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/starshipmk1-800x469.jpg\" alt=\"The nose cone of Starship Mk1 peeks out from behind SpaceX facilities in Boca Chica on July 24. \"\u003e\u003cp class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/starshipmk1.jpg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"1479\" data-width=\"2521\"\u003eEnlarge\u003c/a\u003e \u003cspan class=\"sep\"\u003e/\u003c/span\u003e The nose cone of Starship Mk1 peeks out from behind SpaceX facilities in Boca Chica on July 24.

While capital is certainly an input and not an output, there is nothing quite like the closing of a round of several million in venture capital to prove that yes, the startup I’m working on is at least interesting to someone other than me. External validation shouldn’t be your motivating principle, but it \u003ci\u003eis\u003c/i\u003e motivating. Plus, it’s a great milestone to reach out to the press and start talking up the story.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so week after week, we cover the latest rounds. This company raised $4.5 million in a seed round, and this company raised $16 million in a series A. These stories — and the narratives behind them — are crisp, clean, and precise. A proverbial founder walked up and down South Park in SoMa, explained their story, collected a couple of term sheets, picked one, locked in the due diligence, and is now announcing their round. The VCs are excited, the founder(s) are excited, the employees are excited (and sometimes even the customers are excited!)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe reality for founders though is far more messy and gritty than those headlines would indicate. When I get founders off the record and out for drinks, the true story starts to emerge. That $4.5 million seed fundraise took eight months of maniacal scheduling with two hundred investors just to find a lead. And that lead didn’t \u003ci\u003elead\u003c/i\u003e lead, but took only 20% of the round. In the meantime, they raised twelve times across convertible notes and SAFEs, each one giving the company just a bit more gas in the tank to continue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I wrote that a startup raised $4.5 million in one slam dunk, what I really should have written was that they raised $150k, $300k, a few more $50k investments from randos, a couple of thousand from that startup competition, wow $500k from that amazing angel, a $750k SBIR grant from the government that took nine months too long to process, some credits from Brex, and finally at some point that lead investor showed up who gets $3-3.5 million in news value credit on their wimpy $900k check.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs an editor and a writer who covers these aggregate rounds, I struggle with how to approach them. Founders regularly tell me that they would love more transparency and less bravado around fundraises. They want to read how other founders handle the messy complexity of their fundraises, if only because they can compare their own hellish experiences with those of others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore fundamentally, our readers deserve to read the truth. A $4.5 million round led by a single venture firm writing a $3.5 million check is a very different construct than a bricolage of a random assortment of angel investors. That difference in investor and round quality does indicate something about the startup under examination, and so offering more of those details would better inform our readers as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll that is well and good, but no one really wants to hear about these difficulties. Certainly users and customers don’t want to hear about how the software they use or purchased is run by a company that is constantly days away from death. Some early-stage employees probably have the focus to ignore such morbid considerations while carrying out their functions, but many need their paychecks to come from a black box. Somehow, the checks always arrive, and that lowers the stress for everyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd even just in terms of the craft of writing, do we really want to exchange the standard funding sentence (“blah blah blah raised blah from blah with participation from blah blah blah”) with a multi-paragraph exegesis of a fundraise?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWriting is about choosing which details are salient and which to pass over. It would be exhausting every morning to read tomes of fundraise detail. Yet, our consistency in depicting fundraises as efficient and precise can create an atmosphere where if you didn’t find a lead in a few weeks and lock down the whole round, you are a failure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s not really a depiction I want to support.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so, take this as someone who talks to dozens of founders a year off the record about their fundraises, and also sat on the other side of the table as a VC for years. Fundraises are almost always really, really, tough. Very few people get commits in the first meeting, or even in the subsequent meetings. Half the investor introductions during a fundraise are often a complete waste of time if not outright damaging, psychologically or materially. There are a lot of sharks out there. It is much more common today to aggregate a bunch of mini-rounds than it was a couple of years ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is not failure, but just the path of the entrepreneur today in 2019. And at the end of that whole long and windy road, after all of those hundreds of hours of coffee meetings and PowerPoint strategy sessions and skeptical investor convos, all of that work will boil down to twenty words about how the fundraise closed, X dollars were raised, and money was seemingly wired magically to your bank account.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou, me, and really everyone can and should know the truth. But perhaps just rejoice in that headline, and get back to the next slog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"feedflare\"\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=kH7DoNlxqmw:5S9wu82oDVI:2mJPEYqXBVI\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=kH7DoNlxqmw:5S9wu82oDVI:7Q72WNTAKBA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=kH7DoNlxqmw:5S9wu82oDVI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=kH7DoNlxqmw:5S9wu82oDVI:-BTjWOF_DHI\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=kH7DoNlxqmw:5S9wu82oDVI:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=kH7DoNlxqmw:5S9wu82oDVI:D7DqB2pKExk\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=kH7DoNlxqmw:5S9wu82oDVI:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=kH7DoNlxqmw:5S9wu82oDVI:qj6IDK7rITs\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/kH7DoNlxqmw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/kH7DoNlxqmw/","published":"2019-08-04T15:15:22Z","guid":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=1864463"},{"title":"On second attempt, hoverboard inventor successfully crosses Channel","content":"\u003cp id=\"speakable-summary\"\u003eFollowing a failed attempt in July, French inventor Franky Zapata successfully crossed the Channel on top of a hoverboard this weekend.

It’s an exhaustive volume, one that works on two levels. It’s a book that you can page through, just soaking in the extraordinary illustrations and concept art from Ron Cobb, Chris Foss, H.R.

Your budding metropolis simply gets too big to handle the congestion. There is usually one intersection where, for some reason, the cars just don’t behave how you want them to. You end up cursing the terrible AI drivers or whatever system manages the traffic lights. But before you tear it all down in an attempt to fix it, there is a moment when you feel like if you had more control over the drivers or maybe the lights, you could make it work.

How you control the lights couldn’t be more simple. By default, all of the lights are set to red, stopping all cars and trucks. Tapping or clicking a traffic light once lets a single vehicle through, while tapping twice lets all vehicles through until you hit it again to change the light back to red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"az4iMj\"\u003eAside from making sure that the right number of vehicles leaves the stage, you also need to avoid causing crashes and making a vehicle wait too long at a traffic light. Racking up 10 of those in a single level causes you to fail and start over. At first, this seems simple enough to avoid. But as the game progresses, it introduces new intersections with more complicated layouts, as well as traffic that you have no control over, including trains and sometimes planes. You have to manage your time between looking at traffic, an ever-growing lineup of cars that are stopped at your lights, or deciding what lights need to be signaled and when.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"XYkoBf\"\u003eWhat really makes \u003cem\u003eTraffix\u003c/em\u003e interesting are the levels.

I’d been cc’d by accident … The context is that I had rented a herd of goats for reasons that aren’t relevant here and had sent out a mass e-mail with photographs of the goats attached to illustrate that a) I had goats, and b) it was good. Most of the responses I received expressed appropriate admiration and envy of my goats, but the message in question was intended not as a response to me but as an aside to some of the recipient’s co-workers, sighing over the kinds of expenditures on which I was frittering away my uncomfortable income. The word “oof” was used.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CNsSa56Muz2CSICdvOqvov9Umtg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18472952/mortifying3.jpg\"\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ZME6Wp\"\u003eFrom there, Kreider walks through various concerns about existing in the minds of others and seeing yourself as an object of other people’s opinions — until he comes to the final, triumphant metaphor:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp id=\"S1j57o\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eYears ago a friend of mine had a dream about a strange invention; a staircase you could descend deep underground, in which you heard recordings of all the things anyone had ever said about you, both good and bad. The catch was, you had to pass through all the worst things people had said before you could get to the highest compliments at the very bottom. There is no way I would ever make it more than two and a half steps down such a staircase, but I understand its terrible logic: if we want the rewards of being loved, we have to submit to the mortifying ordeal of being known.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"nQ41q3\"\u003eWhat a line! As it happens, Kreider himself only found out about the essay’s second life a few weeks ago. \u003ca href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734\u0026amp;xs=1\u0026amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2Fi-wrote-this-book-because-i-love-you-tim-kreider%2F1123497203%3Bjsessionid%3DC2BBB3344F38D107AFBC60188DA7EB3B.prodny_store02-atgap01%3Fean%3D9781476738994\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHe has a new book out\u003c/a\u003e — focusing on his relationships with women, fittingly enough.

She later showed me an entry on Know Your Meme displaying additional variations. I would describe my initial reaction as nonplussed, or maybe bemused. Obviously, it’s flattering to know that you’ve written something that resonates with people, but it always does some slight violence to a writer’s intention to yank a sentence out of context. But anytime you publish something, you relinquish control of it, and people get to interpret it however they want. Maybe memes just makes this process a little more literal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Z08J1a\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do you think it resonated with people?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"jfmwPb\"\u003eAs a writer I bank on the assumption that whatever’s true of me is likely true of everyone else, too, and to judge from my mail it seems as if a lot of what I write does express what other people are feeling. But as for why this particular line really resonated with people — who knows? It does seem like the current generation of young people have somewhat more than the usual horror of being seen, being known. Maybe it has something to do with the illusion of omniscient invisibility that the internet confers. I know younger people don’t use the phone at all anymore (by “use” I mean “talk on”), and I get the impression they have a lot of anxiety about going out into the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-float-right\"\u003e  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G3T3-rbop2t8k9Z5TPSgqEbAyto=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18473924/mortifying5.jpg\"\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"v8BszE\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAs the author, do you have any insight into the mortifying ordeal of being known that might help those of us who want to be loved?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"2vncil\"\u003eWell, not to be all “old man yells at cloud,” but I believe that the internet is on balance a bad thing. A friend and I call it “the sad machine,” to remind ourselves what it really is and does. (It clarifies things to use that name: “Guess I’ll switch on the ol’ sad machine for a few hours, see if that cheers me up any.”) So I’d advise them to turn off their devices and go outside and play. I’m not pretending that the trade-off between love and vulnerability is an easy one for anyone at any age, but the alternative is to be the guy in Simon \u0026amp; Garfunkel’s “I Am A Rock.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"wtO17j\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLast question: what’s the deal with the goats?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"s5GuyQ\"\u003ePeople rent them out to crop their lawns and control weeds.

FBI agents raid the houses and search the vehicles of these suspects, extracting whatever they can from any phones, computers, and hard drives they find. Sometimes, this includes files the suspects thought they had deleted or text messages and documents sent through encrypted messaging services like Signal or WhatsApp. The encryption these apps use protects messages while they’re sent over the internet so that the services themselves can’t spy on the content or hand it over to the government, but this encryption doesn’t protect messages stored on a phone or other device that is seized and searched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause whistleblowers aren’t spies, they normally don’t know how to avoid this kind of surveillance.

For example, on May 10, 2016, between 12:34 p.m. and 12:50 p.m., Albury accessed two classified documents.

If you work for a company like Google, Facebook, or Goldman Sachs, you might be under intense scrutiny on your work devices while your personal devices remain outside the reach of your employer’s surveillance (so long as you don’t rely on services it controls to communicate with journalists). And some government sources may have ways of accessing secret documents whose disclosure is in the public interest that don’t involve generating a log entry with a time stamp and associating their username with that access.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s increasingly clear that the primary evidence used against whistleblowers comes from events that happened before they contacted the media, or even before they made the decision to blow the whistle. But it’s still critical that journalists are prepared to protect their sources as best as they can in case a whistleblower reaches out to them. This includes running systems like SecureDrop, which gives sources secure, metadata-free ways to make first contact with journalists and minimizes traces of the contact on their devices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003e\u003c!-- BLOCK(promote-related-post)[19](%7B%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22relatedPostNumber%22%3A3%7D) --\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"promote-embed\" data-related-post-number=\"3\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c!-- END-BLOCK(promote-related-post)[19] --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJournalists should also take steps to reduce the amount of information about their communication with sources that tech companies can access, and that ends up on their sources’ devices, by always using encrypted messaging apps instead of insecure text messages and always using the disappearing messages feature in those apps. They should also encourage their sources not to add them to the contacts in their phone, which might get synced to Google or Apple servers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe journalistic process of verifying the authenticity of documents also carries risk to anonymous sources, but that process is essential to establish that the material has not been falsified or altered, and to maintain credibility with readers. Authentication, which often involves sharing information about the contents of a forthcoming story with the government, is a common journalistic practice that allows the government to weigh in on any risks involved in publishing the material of which the journalist may not be aware. By turning that process into a trap for journalists and sources, the government is sacrificing an opportunity to safeguard its legitimate interests and tell its side of the story.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNews organizations also need to make hard decisions about what to publish. Sometimes, they may decide that it is safer to not publish documents if the story can be reported by describing the contents of the documents and leaving it ambiguous where the revelations came from. However, these approaches diminish transparency with readers and can also limit the impact of a story, which is important to both journalists and whistleblowers.

Many, including WhatsApp and Signal, encourage users to add the phone numbers of people they message to their contacts, which often get synced to the cloud, and WhatsApp encourages users to back up their text message history to the cloud. Although Facebook, which owns WhatsApp, doesn’t have access to the content of those backed-up messages, Google and Apple do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s not enough that these apps encrypt messages. They also need to do better at promptly deleting data that’s no longer needed. End-to-end encryption protects messages as they travel from one phone to another, but each phone still has a copy of the plain text of all these messages, leaving them vulnerable to physical device searches. Disappearing messages features are a great start, but they need to be improved. Users should have the option to automatically have all their chats disappear without having to remember to set disappearing messages each time they start a conversation, and they should be asked if they’d like to enable this when they first set up the app. And when all messages in a conversation disappear, all forensic traces that a conversation with that person happened should disappear too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[21](%7B%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22right%22%7D) --\u003e\u003cblockquote class=\"stylized pull-right\" data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"right\"\u003e\u003c!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[21] --\u003eIn an era when the label “fake news” is used to discredit serious investigative journalism, original source documents serve as powerful evidence to refute such charges.\u003c!-- END-CONTENT(pullquote)[21] --\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c!-- END-BLOCK(pullquote)[21] --\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is also much more work to be done on protecting metadata.

If services don’t have access to that metadata, then they can’t be compelled to hand it over to the FBI during a leak investigation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy default, web browsers keep a detailed history of every webpage you ever visit.

Not only does it never keep a history of anything that happens in it, but it also routes all internet traffic through an anonymity network and uses technology to combat a tracking technique called “browser fingerprinting,” so that the websites you visit don’t know anything about you either. Unfortunately, simply having Tor Browser or other privacy-specific tools installed on a computer has been used as evidence against alleged whistleblowers.

Iranian media reported last month that some 8 million liters of government-subsidized Iranian fuel are smuggled daily to other countries where prices are much higher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe new claims would make this the third vessel seized by the Guard in the past two weeks, and the second accused of smuggling fuel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe U.S. Fifth Fleet, based in Bahrain, said it did not have information to confirm the reports. Maritime tracking experts also said they did not have any immediate information about the incident or details on the vessel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaritime intelligence firm Dryad Global said that, if confirmed, this is likely to be \u0026#8220;another relatively low key interception designed to signal to the West that Iran maintains the capability and intent to exercise its influence\u0026#8221; in the Persian Gulf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTensions in the Persian Gulf have escalated recently, with the United States boosting its military presence in the region and six oil tankers targeted in the Gulf of Oman in unclaimed acts of sabotage that the U.S. blames on Iran. Iran has denied any involvement in those attacks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn June, Iran shot down an American surveillance drone in the Strait of Hormuz. President Donald Trump came close to retaliating, but called off an airstrike at the last moment. Washington has since claimed that a U.S. warship downed an Iranian drone in the strait. Iran denies losing any aircraft in the area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaritime security in the region was further jolted in mid-July, when Iranian Revolutionary Guard naval forces confirmed they\u0026#8217;d seized a United Arab Emirates-based oil tanker, the Panamanian-flagged MT Riah, for allegedly smuggling some 1 million liters (264,000 gallons) of fuel from Iranian smugglers to foreign customers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso in July, the Guard seized a British-flagged vessel in the Gulf in what some Iranian officials suggested was retaliation for the seizure of an Iranian oil tanker in a British Royal Navy operation off Gibraltar, near Spain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe U.K. says the Iranian oil tanker was suspected of violating European Union sanctions on oil shipments to Syria. Iran denies the ship was bound for Syria but has not disclosed its destination. Officials in Spain initially said the tanker was seized upon request from the United States.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe current tensions stem from Trump\u0026#8217;s decision last year to withdraw the U.S. from Iran\u0026#8217;s 2015 nuclear accord with world powers and impose sweeping sanctions on the country that have crippled its economy. In response, Iran began openly breaching limits set by the nuclear agreement to pressure European signatories to provide economic relief to help offset the sanctions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaritime security around the Persian Gulf is of international importance. The Strait of Hormuz sits at the mouth of the Persian Gulf, a shipping channel for one-fifth of all global crude exports. Petroleum products from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain are exported through the strait to countries around the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome 67,533 ships sailed through strait last year, according to data from maritime publication Lloyd\u0026#8217;s List sourcing research by Russell Group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRanjith Raja, a senior analyst at data firm Refinitiv, said this latest seized ship by Iran could be a barge or supply vessel rather than a commercial merchant tanker based on the amount of fuel it was allegedly transporting. Due to the numerous supply vessels operating in the area, it was not possible to pinpoint which ship had been seized, he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/time/world/~4/8Leshilt194\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/world/~3/8Leshilt194/","published":"2019-08-04T16:49:26Z","guid":"http://time.com/?p=5643471"},{"title":"French Hoverboard Inventor Successfully Flies Over the English Channel","content":"\u003caside class=\"right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad\" id=\"right-rail__ad-5643411\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module\" data-src=\"https://time.com/5643411/franky-zapata-hoverboard-flight-english-channel/\" data-widget-id=\"SB_2\" data-ob-template=\"timemag\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(ST.

Such an action may be unprecedented in the world, but it was predictable given Zarif’s great power to impress, his media power in the world, and his importance in the administrative framework of the Islamic Republic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sanction was imposed while Washington has been constantly talking about direct negotiations and dialogue with Tehran without preconditions these days. There is also speculation that the proposal for a meeting between Iran’s foreign minister and the US president has been put forward in the meeting between Zarif and Rand Paul, a Republican senator close to Trump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eContrary to popular belief that imposing sanction on Zarif was opposite to this trend and to the proclaimed US policy of dialogue with Iran, I believe, as cited by a number of American officials and diplomats in Washington, that their biggest problem with Zarif is that they think the foreign minister of Iran lacks the power and authority to hold effectual negotiations. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo maintains that Zarif cannot make a decision about the US talks and its details, saying “Zarif is a key enabler of Ayatollah Khamenei’s policies throughout the region and around the world.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI believe that the United States has sent Iran the clear message with this measure that although it is open to talks, Iran must be represented by a figure at the negotiating table that would have the necessary authority, otherwise a real dialogue will not be shaped. However, this is what the politicians in Washington claim and have in mind, and definitely not the whole truth, as President Rouhani holds a different view. A few hours after the imposition of sanctions on Zarif, the president made it crystal clear in an address in Tabriz that “the path to diplomacy goes through the Foreign Ministry, and the head of the ministry is Foreign Minister Zarif.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoreover, the Islamic Republic has emphasized several times that it will mull over talks with the US only if the whole sanctions after the US withdrawal from the JCPOA are lifted and the activities described by Zarif as “economic terrorism” come to an end. Nonetheless, and despite the explicit policies of Tehran, the Americans speak about a change of Iran’s top negotiator by imposing sanction on Iran’s foreign minister, which seems more like a joke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Iran, Zarif still holds great power and importance in the top administrative ranks, and even a few days ago, Iran’s Leader praised him at a public speech. On the other hand, Zarif enjoys great popularity among Iranian public opinion, to the extent that a number of political factions see him as the presidential candidate for the 2021 election. Considering those factors, Iran sees no reason to replace such a smart and reliable negotiator.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe post \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\"
