We discuss the advantages that accrue to a start up founder who knows how to successfully navigate the perils and pitfalls of the entire capital raising process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe also discusses why \u003ca href=\"https://www.ycombinator.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eY Combinator\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e and other seed funds was such a game changer for start ups. They educated entrepreneurs about the process form what  was formerly a black box to something more accessible. The change to the information asymmetry altered the deal funnel and gate keeper relation that was previously controlled by a handful of connected VCs. These changes were quite significant: Since 2005, Y Combinator has funded over 2,000 startups, with 4,000 founders, that combine for a valuation of over $100B.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverall, the influence of venture capital on the American economy cannot be overstated: he notes that Venture backed companies now spend 44% of the entire R\u0026amp;D budget for public companies, and that the 656 publicly traded firms that were VC backed are 20% of the total market capitalization of public firms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis favorite books \u003ca href=\"https://ritholtz.com/2019/07/mib-scott-kupor/#more-228705\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eare here\u003c/a\u003e; A transcript of our conversation will be \u003ca href=\"https://ritholtz.com/2019/07/transcript-scott-kupor/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eavailable here\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can stream/download the full conversation, including the podcast extras on Apple iTunes, \u003ca href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2019-07-11/scott-kupor-discusses-technology-startups-podcast\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eBloomberg\u003c/a\u003e, Spotify, \u003ca href=\"https://podcasts.google.com/?feed=aHR0cDovL2ZlZWRzLmJsb29tYmVyZy5mbS9CTE04ODY0NDAzMjg4\u0026amp;episode=ODc5MjJhOTQtYTQxNS0xMWU5LTk3MzktYmYxMzJhNmFlMzBj\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eGoogle Podcasts\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://overcast.fm/+JWZRUBtfA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eOvercast\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://castbox.fm/episode/Scott-Kupor-Discusses-Technology-Startups-id966334-id169807549?country=us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eCastbox\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/masters-in-business/e/62522975?autoplay=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eStitcher\u003c/a\u003e.

Djibouti, for example, is carrying a Chinese debt equivalent to 70% of its GDP. China\u0026#8217;s top 50 borrowers owe a value equivalent to over 15% of their respective GDPs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe world’s seen this before, in the 1970’s, when banks from the U.S. and Europe issued commodity-backed loans to emerging economies in Africa and Latin America.

But there\u0026#8217;s still a lot of Chinese-issued sovereign debt out there waiting to mature.

Wayfair’s CEO, Niraj Shah, was initially caught flat-footed by the criticism, as employees staged a walkout in late June that drew support from Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe walkout hardly received universal approval. “It would be one thing if the protests were against the sale of stun guns and rubber hoses to camp supervisors,” \u003cem\u003ePolitico\u003c/em\u003e’s Jack Shafer wrote in\u003ca href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/06/28/wayfair-boycott-political-effectiveness-227251\"\u003e a representative critique\u003c/a\u003e. “But they’re protesting the sale of bedding!

But whatever one thinks of the tactical wisdom of the protestors, events like the Wayfair walkout tell us a lot about how capitalism is becoming an accomplice for social change. Consider the various types of commercial demonstrations we’ve seen in the past decade. There are consumers protesting public officials by exerting pressure on private companies, as with the #GrabYourWallet protest that compelled \u003ca href=\"http://content.fortune.com/fortune500/nordstrom-197/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eNordstrom\u003c/a\u003e to stop carrying Ivanka Trump’s clothing line. There are corporations pushing back against government policies, such as the boycott threats by major companies in 2015 that forced lawmakers in Indiana to amend a religious liberty law to protect the rights of LGBT Americans. And there are examples of employees attempting to change company policy by withholding work, such as the worldwide walkouts last November by \u003ca href=\"http://content.fortune.com/fortune500/alphabet-36/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGoogle\u003c/a\u003e workers in protest of the company’s handling of sexual harassment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn all of these cases, it is the threat of losing money—whether in the form of sales, tax receipts, or lost work—that compels entities to act. Such protests, of course, are nothing new, but what has made them especially attractive in recent years is the indispensable role social media has played in broadcasting and bolstering such efforts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eConsider the timeline of the Wayfair walkout. The \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/FizFashizzle/status/1143530739541139457\"\u003efirst tweet\u003c/a\u003e about the leaked contract to supply detention centers was sent at 10:45 a.m. Eastern Time\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eon June 25. By 11:38 a.m., disgruntled employees had set up a @wayfairwalkout account and were \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/wayfairwalkout/status/1143543982963724288\"\u003epromoting a protest for the very next day\u003c/a\u003e. The following afternoon, fewer than 27 hours after the original tweet, the walkout was underway in Boston with coverage by a phalanx of major media outlets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSuch efforts have not been without controversy, but whatever one thinks about them in any specific instance probably says more about a person’s political opinions than the phenomenon of activist capitalism, which is a bipartisan affair. Indeed, less than a week after the Wayfair walkout, conservatives were calling \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23WalkAwayFromNike\u0026amp;src=tyah\"\u003efor a boycott of Nike\u003c/a\u003e for its perceived anti-American bias in suspending production of a line of shoes featuring the 13-star version of the American flag.

Such initiatives represent more decentralized and thoroughly democratic examples of the kind of exercises in monetary might long employed by wealthy individuals to change the world around them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf we accept the notion that millionaires and billionaires can use the power of their purses to disproportionately shape society—whether by setting the culture of private companies, establishing philanthropic institutions, or using money as a carrot or cudgel to achieve political aims—the idea that there is anything wrong with small platoons of Americans joining together to work toward their own vision of an ideal world seems unsporting to say the least. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIndeed, the fact that any single individual might ever have so great a say in public affairs has always been the oligarchic defect of meritocratic societies, and the possibility that the mass communication tools freely afforded by social media can rebalance the scales in favor of social change by the many, rather than the few, seems like a shot in the arm for democracy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAre there dangers posed by the rise of activist capitalism? Sure, but they aren’t altogether different than any other threats posed by allowing the wealth of single individuals to shape the public sphere. We freely allow that private money will embolden social movements, influence institutional decision-making, underwrite the arts and sciences, and, most importantly, help to determine the aim and scope of American politics. Since money can give anyone a megaphone in the public square, the really important question is: Who gets to hold it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIncreasingly, by pooling their labor and purchasing power, a larger number of Americans are claiming their time at that megaphone. They are noisy, to be sure, and taken at once, their messages can be confusing, but if you listen closely you just might hear something extraordinary: the announcement of a new chapter in the history of American capitalism.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eJohn Paul Rollert is an adjunct associate professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.

Interestingly, one of the models points to a 10.2-inch iPad that could replace the 9.7-inch screen size Apple has offered since the iPad first debuted in 2010.

any.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the early 2000s, we used to watch a CBS sitcom called \u0026#8220;Still Standing\u0026#8221; (2002-06). The tag line was something like \u0026#8220;Bill and Judy are not your average parents; the kids are the responsible ones.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Jami Gertz vehicle, she is surrounded by likeable lesser know actors, including Renee Olstead playing her middle child/daughter.

It was so goddamned good that it sent me researching to see if she lip-synced it with a \u0026#8220;real singer\u0026#8221; doing the vocals, or if she sang the song herself. (opening, plus this 93 second \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/cNVq6945kqE?t=1085\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003efantasy sequence\u003c/a\u003e).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was actually her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she was 15 at the time.

The change to the information asymmetry altered the deal funnel and gate keeper relation that was previously controlled by a handful of connected VCs. These changes were quite significant: Since 2005, Y Combinator has funded over 2,000 startups, with 4,000 founders, that combine for a valuation of over $100B.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverall, the influence of venture capital on the American economy cannot be overstated: he notes that Venture backed companies now spend 44% of the entire R\u0026amp;D budget for public companies, and that the 656 publicly traded firms that were VC backed are 20% of the total market capitalization of public firms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis favorite books \u003ca href=\"https://ritholtz.com/2019/07/mib-scott-kupor/#more-228705\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eare here\u003c/a\u003e; A transcript of our conversation will be \u003ca href=\"https://ritholtz.com/2019/07/transcript-scott-kupor/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eavailable here\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can stream/download the full conversation, including the podcast extras on Apple iTunes, \u003ca href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2019-07-11/scott-kupor-discusses-technology-startups-podcast\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eBloomberg\u003c/a\u003e, Spotify, \u003ca href=\"https://podcasts.google.com/?feed=aHR0cDovL2ZlZWRzLmJsb29tYmVyZy5mbS9CTE04ODY0NDAzMjg4\u0026amp;episode=ODc5MjJhOTQtYTQxNS0xMWU5LTk3MzktYmYxMzJhNmFlMzBj\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eGoogle Podcasts\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://overcast.fm/+JWZRUBtfA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eOvercast\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://castbox.fm/episode/Scott-Kupor-Discusses-Technology-Startups-id966334-id169807549?country=us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eCastbox\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/masters-in-business/e/62522975?autoplay=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eStitcher\u003c/a\u003e.

Let us be your guide on how to succeed in this mighty quest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003e\u003cem\u003eMighty Quest For Epic Loot\u003c/em\u003e Basics: Movement and Combat\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-255505\" src=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/mighty-quest-gameplay.jpg\" alt=\"Mighty Quest For Epic Loot\" width=\"1536\" height=\"2048\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/mighty-quest-gameplay.jpg 1536w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/mighty-quest-gameplay-225x300.jpg 225w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/mighty-quest-gameplay-768x1024.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eMighty Quest For Epic Loot\u003c/em\u003e asks you early on if you\u0026#8217;d rather play right-handed or left-handed, and it\u0026#8217;s not just being polite. This is absolutely a game you can play with just one hand, using your thumb to drag on the screen to move your looter around, and then tapping anywhere on the screen to attack the closest enemies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only other aspect of combat you\u0026#8217;ll really need to master is the use of \u003cstrong\u003eSkills\u003c/strong\u003e. These are extra, more powerful attacks activated by dedicated virtual buttons on the opposite side of the screen from your preferred side. You can have up to three Skills equipped at any one time, though there are more than that to unlock as you advance. Every Skill has a cooldown timer before it can be activated again, and the button will grey out until it\u0026#8217;s next ready for use. Leveling up your Skills can increase the damage and duration of their other effects, as well as reducing their cooldowns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBonus tip 1: \u003c/strong\u003eTake a look at which skills can be used together to set up combos. For example, Black Hole pulls your enemies toward it, while Landslide slows them down. Either can be useful for keeping groups of monsters in one place, allowing you to hit them all with a second, more damaging Skill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter gaining a few levels, you\u0026#8217;ll also be able to equip \u003cstrong\u003eTalents\u003c/strong\u003e, which are not separate attacks but rather buffs to the damage of certain special effects caused by Skills. You can level these up as well, so it makes sense to equip and power up Talents that coincide with the Skills that suit your play style the most.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBonus tip 2:\u003c/strong\u003e To autoplay or not to autoplay? That is the question, as a certain bard once said. A few levels into your Mighty Quest experience, you\u0026#8217;ll acquire the ability to autoplay levels by tapping the \u0026#8216;play\u0026#8217; icon at the top of the screen. Doing so means your looter will run around and fight automatically, which is cool. Unfortunately, you\u0026#8217;re almost guaranteed not to find every chest or kill every monster this way, since he takes the most direct route to the end of the level at all times. On the plus side, you can assume control of your looter at any time, so autoplay is helpful in small doses even if you don\u0026#8217;t want to rely on it too often.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003eGimme the Loot: An Overview of Weapons and Armor\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-255504\" src=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/mighty-quest-main-screen.jpg\" alt=\"Mighty Quest For Epic Loot\" width=\"1536\" height=\"2048\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/mighty-quest-main-screen.jpg 1536w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/mighty-quest-main-screen-225x300.jpg 225w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/mighty-quest-main-screen-768x1024.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs you might expect, the damage you do and your HP and other stats are determined entirely by your weapons and gear in \u003cem\u003eMighty Quest\u003c/em\u003e. So you might say looting isn\u0026#8217;t just a job, it\u0026#8217;s a way of life. Ahem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are six gear slots to fill on your looter:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHelmets\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eChests (as in the part of your body, not the things that hold other things)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGauntlets\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGreaves (a.k.a. pants)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWeapons\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eShields\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery piece of Gear has a \u003cstrong\u003eMight\u003c/strong\u003e score, which is a numerical value that indicates approximately how tough it makes you in the grand scheme of things. Note that your overall Might could still be misleading — if, for example, you have some really great Greaves that increase your HP by an insane amount but your DPS is still low, you\u0026#8217;ll be hard to kill but still take a while to chop through enemies. In other words, every stat matters, but having a Might higher than the suggested score for any particular level means you\u0026#8217;ll probably be able to clear it without too much trouble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe potential of any gear comes down to two things: its color and its rank. Currently, gear comes in three colors:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBlue \u0026#8211; Common gear with no specific attributes.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGreen \u0026#8211; Set Gears that can activate special skills called \u003cstrong\u003eBlessings\u003c/strong\u003e if you find and equip multiple pieces (from two on up, depending) from the same set.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOrange \u0026#8211; These are Legendary Weapons or Epic Gears, which come with their own Blessings, no sets needed.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin these colors, gear can also be found in ranks ranging from one to five stars. However, it\u0026#8217;s also possible to bump gear up to the next rank by maxing its level out and then using special items called Promote Stones to add a star to it. In fact, you can even raise 5-star items to 6 stars in this fashion. Leveling up gear is done by the time-honored method of sacrificing other gear and items called upgrade boosters, then paying a certain amount of gold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that you understand the basics of loot, let\u0026#8217;s discuss where to find it without paying for it \u0026#8230;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003eHow to Get Epic Gear for Free\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#8217;s possible to get even the best items from the Legendary and Epic ranks without sinking money into the game, but it\u0026#8217;s kind of a multi-step process. For starters, you should know that you can earn gear simply by adventuring, as you\u0026#8217;ll often receive one to three pieces simply for clearing a level. This tends to be lower rank equipment, but can still be useful early on or as fodder to feed and upgrade your better stuff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0026#8217;ll also find 2 to 3-star gear in Rare Chests, which you can find in the Shop, accessed via the treasure chest icon on the game\u0026#8217;s bottom nav bar. You can open one Rare Chest every time you acquire five Rare Keys, or by paying 20 Gems. The best loot is in Epic Chests, which guarantee a 3 to 5-star items and take 100 Epic Keys or 150 Gems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;Who, whoa, whoa. Hold up a second. Keys? Gems? What are you talking about?\" Fair question! Keys can be acquired as rewards from the game\u0026#8217;s Daily Rewards chart, or by completing Daily Missions or Achievements. They are specific to each kind of chest, so keep that in mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGems, on the other hand, are the game\u0026#8217;s premium currency, which simply means you can purchase them for real money if you choose to do so. But you can also acquire them for free via the following methods:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eClear a level or daily trial castle for the first time \u0026#8211; You\u0026#8217;ll get a few Gems every time you clear something you\u0026#8217;ve never successfully cleared before. It won\u0026#8217;t seem like much, but they add up over time.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePlay \u003cem\u003eMighty Quest\u003c/em\u003e daily \u0026#8211; You\u0026#8217;ll find Gems on the daily login calendar every few weeks.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCheck out the current Events \u0026#8211; The Events tab in the upper-left corner of the main screen is a good way to search for extra ways to earn rewards just by playing. Quests from Events will sometimes offer up extra Gems, so keep an eye out.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis isn\u0026#8217;t an exhaustive list, so be sure to keep tabs on the Daily Missions and Achievements too (though Achievements at the time of this article seem to pay off in everything \u003cstrong\u003ebut\u003c/strong\u003e Gems). In any case, no matter how you rack up free Gems, \u003cstrong\u003eyou\u0026#8217;ll want to save them to open Epic Chests\u003c/strong\u003e. There\u0026#8217;s still luck involved, but it\u0026#8217;s absolutely possible to grab 5-star Epic or Legendary gears from these chests, and even one piece can make the early game a ton easier for you. If you have the patience, saving 1,350 gems to open 10 Epic Chests is an especially good deal since you are getting 10 for the price of nine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003eHow to Get Free Energy\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, there\u0026#8217;s an Energy system in \u003cem\u003eMighty Quest For Epic Loot\u003c/em\u003e, and while that\u0026#8217;s a little bit of a bummer, it\u0026#8217;s also not at all unexpected for a game like this. You\u0026#8217;ll use Energy any time you start a level, even if you are using an auto-clear ticket. Your max Energy does increase every time you level up as a player, which is nice. You can also exceed your max Energy temporarily by receiving more as a reward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-255506\" src=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/mighty-quest-quest-rewards.jpg\" alt=\"Mighty Quest For Epic Loot\" width=\"1536\" height=\"2048\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/mighty-quest-quest-rewards.jpg 1536w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/mighty-quest-quest-rewards-225x300.jpg 225w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/mighty-quest-quest-rewards-768x1024.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I digress.

There\u0026#8217;s both a VIP option and something called the Epic Pass. Yes, that could be confusing, but let\u0026#8217;s clear up the differences between them to lessen that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003cstrong\u003eVIP\u003c/strong\u003e subscription costs $9.99 a month and does things like boost your Energy (both max Energy and faster refill rate), gives you extra daily trials, makes a special VIP Chest available, and more. You can see the entire list of benefits here:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-255502\" src=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/mighty-quest-VIP.jpg\" alt=\"Mighty Quest For Epic Loot\" width=\"1536\" height=\"2048\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/mighty-quest-VIP.jpg 1536w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/mighty-quest-VIP-225x300.jpg 225w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/mighty-quest-VIP-768x1024.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn contrast, the \u003cstrong\u003eEpic Pass\u003c/strong\u003e is more like the Battle Pass from \u003cem\u003eFortnite\u003c/em\u003e or the many imitators it\u0026#8217;s spawned since. It offers a tiered series of rewards over the course of a \u0026#8220;season\" of a little more than two months. There are both free and paid rewards available at each tier, with the paid rewards obviously better than the free ones. Weekly missions help you make progress toward the next tier. The Epic Pass costs $8.99 per season (at least at launch), and there\u0026#8217;s also an option to buy the pass and get 10 tiers instantly for $21.99\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-255503\" src=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/mighty-quest-epic-pass.jpg\" alt=\"Mighty Quest For Epic Loot\" width=\"1536\" height=\"2048\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/mighty-quest-epic-pass.jpg 1536w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/mighty-quest-epic-pass-225x300.jpg 225w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/mighty-quest-epic-pass-768x1024.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich one is right for you really depends on what you\u0026#8217;re looking for. VIP status provides benefits that you\u0026#8217;ll be able to take advantage of every day while playing, but is more expensive. The Battle Pass is cheaper but only really pays off if you\u0026#8217;re going to play often enough to get through most of the tiers in a season.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least for the time being, there\u0026#8217;s no option to buy either of these add-ons with Gems, so you won\u0026#8217;t be able to grind them out for free like you occasionally can in other games. That means you\u0026#8217;ll have to pay if you want them, so hopefully you now have a little bit better idea of whether one or the other might be worth it for you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://toucharcade.com/2019/07/12/mighty-quest-for-epic-loot-guide-how-to-get-the-best-gear-for-free/","published":"2019-07-13T00:19:18Z","guid":"https://toucharcade.com/?p=255493"},{"title":"Dead Cells Hype Squad – The TouchArcade Show #407","content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003ca class=\"app-icon\" href=\"/games/void-tyrant\" style=\"float:left; margin-top:4px; margin-right:10px;\"\u003e\u003cimg style=\"border-radius:20px;\" src=\"https://toucharcade.com/wp-content/images/app/1385870381/100x100bb.jpg\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003eOn this week\u0026#8217;s episode of The TouchArcade Show, we kick things off talking about some new data Facebook exposed regarding who is advertising to you which is \u0026#8230; just a lil\u0026#8217; creepy.

Now, before anyone goes over-thinking this, it doesn\u0026#8217;t necessarily mean our Game of the Week pick is the highest scoring game in a review, the game with the best graphics, or really any other quantifiable \u0026#8220;best\" thing. Instead, it\u0026#8217;s more just us picking out the single game out of the week\u0026#8217;s releases that we think is the most noteworthy, surprising, interesting, or really any other hard to describe quality that makes it worth having if you were just going to pick up \u003cem\u003eone\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese picks might be controversial, and that\u0026#8217;s OK.

I don\u0026#8217;t know when the first one officially launched, but I do know that Bennet Foddy\u0026#8217;s 2008 \u003cem\u003eQWOP\u003c/em\u003e was one of the first to become a viral sensation. On mobile I\u0026#8217;ve long been a fan of Set Snail\u0026#8217;s \u003cem\u003eDaddy Long Legs\u003c/em\u003e, or Part Time Monkey\u0026#8217;s \u003cem\u003eSilly Walks\u003c/em\u003e, or the incredibly unique \u003cem\u003eDon\u0026#8217;t Trip\u003c/em\u003e from Jooon and Noodlecake. Heck, even Foddy\u0026#8217;s somewhat spiritual successor to \u003cem\u003eQWOP\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eGetting Over It\u003c/em\u003e, could be considered a wacky walking simulator of sorts. So yeah, we are spoilt for options when it comes to trying to perform one of the most basic human actions in digital form on our mobile devices, and this week I can add one more enjoyable walking experience to my list of favorites with Two Men and a Dog\u0026#8217;s \u003cem\u003eWalk Master\u003c/em\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://toucharcade.com/link/http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1459604614?mt=8\"\u003e(Free)\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/walkmaster.png\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/walkmaster.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2436\" height=\"1125\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-255516\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/walkmaster.png 2436w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/walkmaster-300x139.png 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/walkmaster-768x355.png 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/walkmaster-1024x473.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn \u003cem\u003eWalk Master\u003c/em\u003e, you play as a variety of different animals and other odd characters walking through numerous tricky environments on a set of stilts. The controls are very well done here as you\u0026#8217;ll simply slide your finger or thumb across the screen to move one stilt, and then once it\u0026#8217;s planted you\u0026#8217;ll lift your thumb up to switch to the second stilt which you\u0026#8217;ll then drag to take a step. Put one stilt in front of the other and buddy, you\u0026#8217;re walking! Of course it doesn\u0026#8217;t just end there as each level is filled with all sorts of obstacles that would make normal walking difficult, let alone walking on a set of stilts. Moving platforms, see saws, piranhas jumping out of the water, tiny volcanoes… these are all very normal occurrences in the weird world of \u003cem\u003eWalk Master\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe core mechanics are very satisfying and \u003cem\u003eWalk Master\u003c/em\u003e offers up a nice challenge across levels that are lengthy enough to be interesting but short enough to suit mobile play perfectly. It also can be played in either portrait or landscape and switches on the fly, and I really enjoy this as a one-hand-one-thumb experience. Besides just beating the regular levels, you can also unlock special Challenge levels which typically have a specific theme and a unique type of challenge. You can also use coins that you\u0026#8217;ll pick up during play to unlock a HUGE selection of characters, hats and accessories for those characters, and special types of stilts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"clear:both;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"video-responsive\"\u003e\n\t\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gG8VmaQyrmo\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eWalk Master\u003c/em\u003e is free to play with ads, but offers a one-time $2.99 IAP to remove the interstitial video ads. Opt-in ads remain for anyone who wants to earn some additional coins, or you can buy more coins as IAP, but so far I\u0026#8217;ve felt like I\u0026#8217;ve been earning enough coins to unlock stuff at a decent clip so I don\u0026#8217;t feel like buying extra coins is especially necessary. This is the type of game that you play first and foremost because it\u0026#8217;s fun and silly, and earning coins and occasionally unlocking new items is just a nice bonus.

(There is one system where two adjacent systems that start with the same three letters, which always causes confusion.)  We were close to the \u0026#8220;GQ\u0026#8221; gate when he said that, so people asked if he was sure and, since he had been drinking, he had to check.  Eventually he confirmed what he said and, as we warped, he gave us a destination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_71437\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://tagn.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/tkeescapegate.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71437\" data-attachment-id=\"71437\" data-permalink=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/2019/07/13/first-day-of-blackout-roam/tkeescapegate/\" data-orig-file=\"https://tagn.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/tkeescapegate.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1920,1138\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{\u0026quot;aperture\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;credit\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;camera\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;created_timestamp\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;copyright\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;focal_length\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;iso\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;shutter_speed\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;title\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;orientation\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;}\" data-image-title=\"TKEEscapeGate\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://tagn.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/tkeescapegate.jpg?w=500\" data-large-file=\"https://tagn.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/tkeescapegate.jpg?w=600\" class=\"size-large wp-image-71437\" src=\"https://tagn.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/tkeescapegate.jpg?w=600\u0026#038;h=356\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"356\" srcset=\"https://tagn.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/tkeescapegate.jpg?w=600\u0026amp;h=356 600w, https://tagn.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/tkeescapegate.jpg?w=1200\u0026amp;h=712 1200w, https://tagn.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/tkeescapegate.jpg?w=150\u0026amp;h=89 150w, https://tagn.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/tkeescapegate.jpg?w=500\u0026amp;h=296 500w, https://tagn.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/tkeescapegate.jpg?w=768\u0026amp;h=455 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp id=\"caption-attachment-71437\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"\u003eTake the gate? Don\u0026#8217;t take the gate?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJumping through the gate we found that the route to the destination led us back into R1O-GN.  He checked again and gave us another destination.  By that point we were getting spread out, some of us having gone back into R1O while others waited for a new desto.  I was a bit ahead of the pack, free burning for the way out.  However, as I noted last weekend in the post about \u003ca href=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/2019/07/07/post-war-moves-in-null-sec/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003edropping on PH\u0026#8217;s move ops\u003c/a\u003e, there is only one way back to where we came from, and you have to pass through 1S-SU1.  The locals were well aware of this and were waiting on the LEM gate in that system.  I was one of the first through so was too late to heed the warning about the camp.  I decided to just press on, since my only other choice was to crash the gate, and given the state of my ship it wouldn\u0026#8217;t take much to blow me up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd they got me.  I was pretty quickly blown up, then podded, then back in my hangar in 1DQ1-2.  End of the fleet op for me.  Some people did get out.  For whatever reason the hostiles didn\u0026#8217;t bubble the 1S-SU1 side of the gate, which let some people slip through.  Others turned around and went out via Vale of the Silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut, not matter what, we got our money\u0026#8217;s worth out of that fleet.  A blaze of glory was achieved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would like to summarize the outcome, but with ZKillboard down, you cannot create battle reports or even see kills for which you did not get the final blow.  For me, ZKill being blacked out is one of the downsides to this event.  I want to see the battle report.  I want to see how many or few hostiles we managed to zap before we ran off.  I want to see how the brawl played out, with nice columns of time stamped kills dammit.  I want the data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know some people are cheering it being down, and even asking that it be kept offline, but I am not in that camp.  The main argument against ZKill seems to be a nebulous argument that kill boards ruin the game, which strikes me a being akin to suggesting scores in kids sports are bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut beyond that, bragging about your kill board is so looked down upon in the \u003cem\u003eEVE Online\u003c/em\u003e community that before you can talk about your kill board you must first write a paragraph declaration about how you much you do not care about your kill board, before going on to prove that you probably really do.  Basically, we already have a system of social control around kill boards, so just let us have the information about what happened and get on with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, that was my big blackout inaugural roam.  And it was pretty good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did go on another op later in the evening which had its own bit of comedy.  We were in an Eagle fleet, flying through Delve to cover a timer, and while watching the local intel channel, it became clear that people were using their directional scanners, but perhaps not paying as close attention to the results as they should.  Several times we saw something like

and was not coordinating their effort.  That meant that our fleet, unified in doctrine and taking targets from the FC, was able to inflict quite a bit of damage relative to our numbers on the field.

another destination.  By that point we were getting spread out, some of us having gone back into R1O while others waited for a new desto.  I was a bit ahead of the pack, free burning for the way out.  However, as I noted last weekend in the post about \u003ca href=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/2019/07/07/post-war-moves-in-null-sec/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003edropping on PH\u0026#8217;s move ops\u003c/a\u003e, there is only one way back to where we came from, and you have to pass through 1S-SU1.  The locals were well aware of this and were waiting on the LEM gate in that system.  I was one of the first through so was too late to heed the warning about the camp.  I decided to just press on, since my only other choice was to crash the gate, and given the state of my ship it wouldn\u0026#8217;t take much to blow me up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd they got me.  I was pretty quickly blown up, then podded, then back in my hangar in 1DQ1-2.  End of the fleet op for me.  Some people did get out.  For whatever reason the hostiles didn\u0026#8217;t bubble the 1S-SU1 side of the gate, which let some people slip through.  Others turned around and went out via Vale of the Silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut, not matter what, we got our money\u0026#8217;s worth out of that fleet.  A blaze of glory was achieved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would like to summarize the outcome, but with ZKillboard down, you cannot create battle reports or even see kills for which you did not get the final blow.  For me, ZKill being blacked out is one of the downsides to this event.  I want to see the battle report.  I want to see how many or few hostiles we managed to zap before we ran off.  I want to see how the brawl played out, with nice columns of time stamped kills dammit.  I want the data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know some people are cheering it being down, and even asking that it be kept offline, but I am not in that camp.  The main argument against ZKill seems to be a nebulous argument that kill boards ruin the game, which strikes me a being akin to suggesting scores in kids sports are bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut beyond that, bragging about your kill board is so looked down upon in the \u003cem\u003eEVE Online\u003c/em\u003e community that before you can talk about your kill board you must first write a paragraph declaration about how you much you do not care about your kill board, before going on to prove that you probably really do.  Basically, we already have a system of social control around kill boards, so just let us have the information about what happened and get on with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, that was my big blackout inaugural roam.  And it was pretty good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did go on another op later in the evening which had its own bit of comedy.  We were in an Eagle fleet, flying through Delve to cover a timer, and while watching the local intel channel, it became clear that people were using their directional scanners, but perhaps not paying as close attention to the results as they should.  Several times we saw something like

His departure gratifies critics who believed he deserved a comeuppance. Yet political advisers fear the broader tumult inside the administration could also roil Trump’s reelection bid, feeding long-standing criticism that he hasn’t properly vetted his appointees, nor met his promise to recruit the best people. And Acosta’s fall creates a fresh vacancy in an administration that has already seen record-setting turnover.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRelying on a string of officials holding jobs on a temporary basis, Trump is sitting atop a hollowed-out administration that is lacking in the permanent leadership needed to manage escalating foreign and domestic crises, good-government experts told me. Signs suggest the churn isn’t about to stop. Trump has been calling friends and advisers lately about \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/07/john-boltons-long-game/593134/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eNational Security Adviser John Bolton\u003c/a\u003e, looking for their impressions of his performance and asking whether he needs to go, according to people who have been briefed on the calls and who, like others I spoke with for this story, requested anonymity to discuss private conversations. Meanwhile, \u003cem\u003eAxios\u003c/em\u003e, among other news outlets, reported yesterday that Trump has told confidants he \u003ca href=\"https://www.axios.com/donald-trump-remove-dan-coats-director-of-national-intelligence-2ba4275d-7624-4f4b-9026-ee0d0606ce32.html?utm_source=twitter\u0026amp;utm_medium=twsocialshare\u0026amp;utm_campaign=organic\"\u003ewants to replace Dan Coats\u003c/a\u003e, the director of national intelligence, with whom the president has had an uneasy relationship.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAcosta was the president’s first and only labor secretary. But should Trump oust Bolton—whose hawkish approach to foreign policy clashes at times with his own reluctance to use military force—he’ll have cycled through four national security advisers in less than three years. Predicting anyone’s future in the Trump White House is chancy, in part because Trump’s public demonstrations of support don’t mean much. Trump told reporters on Tuesday that he felt “very badly” for Acosta and that the plea deal he struck with Epstein in 2008 shouldn’t mar his reputation. (Another illuminating example: A year ago, then–Chief of Staff John Kelly walked into a senior-staff meeting and said that Trump had assured him \u003ca href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/john-kelly-has-told-white-house-staff-trump-asked-him-to-stay-in-post-through-2020-1533053182\"\u003ehe’d be sticking around\u003c/a\u003e through the 2020 election. Five months later, Kelly was gone.) As for Bolton, a person familiar with the matter said his job is secure and that Trump wants him to appear more frequently on television as a surrogate, laying out the administration’s foreign-policy positions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003eRead: \u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/07/alex-acosta-blames-victims-reticence-epstein-case/593713/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eInstead of an apology, Acosta offers Epstein’s victims implicit blame\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStill, the upheaval worries both Trump partisans and good-government groups, albeit for different reasons. Trump’s campaign advisers believe that high-profile firings reinforce perceptions that the administration is in upheaval, just as the 2020 election gets into full swing. And when it comes to Bolton in particular, they worry that his removal would touch off a purge within the National Security Council that Trump can’t afford. “The guys who talk to Trump are looking for \u003cem\u003eless, less\u003c/em\u003e chaos in the building,” a person close to the president told me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nSenator Mitt Romney, a Utah Republican, is no fan of Trump. But he told me he’d like to see Bolton stay put. “He has a different perspective from other folks in the White House, but he’s a very thoughtful, very experienced person,” Romney said. “While I certainly disagree with him from time to time, having a thinker who’s willing to express himself is a good thing.” Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida offered similar sentiments in a prepared statement yesterday: There is “no one better” to serve as national security adviser than Bolton.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt the halfway point in Trump’s term, many federal departments are leaderless or headed by people serving in an acting capacity, which is tantamount to a substitute teacher trying to run a classroom, said Max Stier, the president of the Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit group focused on the workings of the federal government. “Leaders matter, and permanent leaders matter a lot,” Stier told me. “This is an unprecedented level of temporary leadership across the entire federal government, but concentrated in places that are acutely worrisome.” He cited key vacancies at the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security, “where there are issues at stake right now of high consequence.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“It’s not as if there’s no one there,” Stier added, “but you have folks serving in acting roles across these critical functions who are restricted in their ability to function as well as they were meant to.”\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nReplacing Acosta, for now, is Patrick Pizzella, the deputy secretary who was tapped for the top job yesterday on an acting basis. As Stier mentioned, other Cabinet members working in a similar acting capacity include Defense Secretary Mark Esper (at a time when tensions are escalating with Iran), and the Homeland Security chief Kevin McAleenan (amid reports that migrants, including many children, are being detained in squalid conditions at the southern border). Inside the White House, Mick Mulvaney \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/04/mick-mulvaney-white-house-2020-and-mueller/588022/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eremains the acting chief of staff\u003c/a\u003e seven months after he was named to the position. He also never relinquished his title as director of the Office of Management and Budget, which he has nominally led since 2017. Russell Vought is heading that shop on an acting basis, at a moment when the government \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/12/us/politics/debt-ceiling.html\"\u003eis close\u003c/a\u003e to running out of money.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA recurrent management problem in the administration is Trump’s inability to find qualified people for top jobs and to stick with them once they’re installed. His habit is to restlessly sample people of varied backgrounds. Since taking office, he has surrounded himself with military generals and civilians, campaign loyalists and political foes, conservative ideologues and apolitical technocrats, Fox News celebrities and complete unknowns. Many have washed out, and the only ones he seems to fundamentally trust are family members, \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/11/us/politics/ivanka-trump-jared-kushner-book.html\"\u003eeven as he’s mused\u003c/a\u003e about sending his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and daughter Ivanka Trump back home to New York. Stier’s group found that just 57 percent of Trump’s nominees have been confirmed by the Senate. At a comparable period in Barack Obama’s presidency, the figure was 75 percent. Trump has withdrawn more than twice as many nominees as Obama had at this point in their respective presidencies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nThat’s translated to a parade of people coming and going. Kathryn Dunn Tenpas, a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, has studied “serial” turnover in Trump White House jobs, what she casts as a “common phenomenon.” When Stephanie Grisham replaced Sarah Sanders as Trump’s press secretary last month, she also took on the role of communications director—the fifth person to hold that job. (Anyone in a job that involves getting Trump good press is in a precarious spot, his concern about media coverage being bottomless.) Apart from the volatility atop the NSC, five different people have served as deputy national security adviser, Tenpas noted—a position crucial to coordinating foreign-policy decisions across the government.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nAcosta had hoped to hang on, counting on Trump’s loyalty. Trump praised his performance yesterday as the two spoke with the press outside the White House. “He’s Hispanic, which I so admire,” Trump said, “because maybe it was a little tougher for him, and maybe not.” But Acosta had other run-ins with the White House. Some officials had attended meetings with his deputies over the past year and complained that he wasn’t moving quickly enough to carry out Trump’s deregulatory agenda within the Labor Department, former administration officials told me. Asked for comment, Mulvaney said in a prepared statement: “I push all of the Cabinet secretaries on the deregulatory agenda, as it is a top priority of the president. That in no way should be interpreted as displeasure with any Cabinet member, including Secretary Acosta.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/07/jeffrey-epstein-indictment-hes-out-luck/593512/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eabuse, money, and power\u003c/a\u003e at the heart of the Epstein case, it’s no surprise that Acosta’s resignation is getting enormous coverage. But the drama surrounding high-profile administration departures obscures what’s happening at lower levels of the government, whose power over people’s lives is no less profound. Virtually no attention was paid to an announcement in May that a lingering hole inside Acosta’s department would remain unfilled: Scott Mugno, a former FedEx official, pulled his name from consideration to be the permanent head of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. OSHA doesn’t deal in trivialities; its mandate is workplace safety: life and death. Mugno had been waiting more than a year to be confirmed by the Senate and wanted to move on, \u003ca href=\"https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/trump-labor-safety-nominee-withdraws-on-cusp-of-confirmation\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eBloomberg Law\u003c/em\u003e reported\u003c/a\u003e. What that means is that OSHA isn’t likely to have a permanent chief for the entirety of the president’s four-year term. That’s never happened since OSHA opened, in 1971.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n“There’s really no one in charge there. With the circumstances at the Labor Department being what they are, I don’t know anyone at this point who would be willing to take that job,” John Martin, who practices workplace-safety law at Ogletree Deakins, a labor-and-employment law firm, said in an interview. “If they’re going to offer the position to someone, I would assume the person would want to know at the very least who my boss is going to be—who’s going to be the Secretary of Labor for the duration.” That question may be unanswerable. Trump’s track record is clear. Whoever gets the job probably shouldn’t expect to keep it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/AQM2d9hdzXs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/AQM2d9hdzXs/","published":"2019-07-13T09:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-593851"},{"title":"To Survive in a Wetter World, Raise Ducks, Not Chickens","content":"\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eDHAKA, Bangladesh—Here at Binni, a slightly run-down restaurant in one of Dhaka’s trendier neighborhoods, beef, chicken, and mutton dishes are slapped down on the table with a mere murmur.

And farmers typically need far fewer crabs, which are easier to take care of, to make the same profit. Besides crabs, the UNDP project is introducing cow, goat, and pig fattening and hydroponic vegetable-growing (which involves cultivating plants in a mineral-nutrient solution rather than soil) to help communities that have been left landless by river erosion and rising soil salinity.

The problem the court identified was that the secretary of commerce had lied. As the court put it, Ross had presented “an explanation for agency action that is incongruent with what the record reveals about the agency’s priorities and decision making process.” The secretary, in other words, had exceeded the legal system’s tolerance for untruthfulness.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe making of public policy, the late judge Patricia Wald maintained, is not just “a rarified technocratic process.” It is universally understood that when government officials pursue their authorized purposes, they are typically animated by multiple motives, some more nakedly political than others.

Hawaii\u003c/em\u003e was a radically different case. It involved a statute that explicitly authorized the president, not any other official, to restrict the entry of aliens into the United States. He could act based on his personal determination that their entry “would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.” In Roberts’s judgment, a challenge to the travel ban based on impermissible presidential motive could “‘inhibit the flexibility’ of the President to respond to changing world conditions.” He determined that the court’s “inquiry into matters of entry and national security [should be] highly constrained.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eHowever, the census—and most domestic public administration—involves no such considerations. There was no lurking threat to national security for census takers to police. Neither the Constitution nor Congress has given the president any administrative role in deciding the questions to be asked. The case involves routine questions of administrative law.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe president’s foremost constitutional charge is “to take care that the laws be faithfully executed.” Whatever uncertainty surrounds the meaning of “faithful execution,” honesty, at least, must be involved. In order to hasten Supreme Court involvement, the Trump administration insisted it needed a resolution of the matter by June 30—an assertion it would have had to abandon if it continued its fight. For some reason, the lawyers who had argued the administration’s cause in two courts were not ready for the task. The Justice Department jettisoned its original legal team in order to bring in lawyers from the Office of Immigration Litigation, the Civil Frauds Division, and the Consumer Protection Branch, none of which have any obvious expertise regarding the census. It never explained why the original lawyers were removed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eEvents have revealed that the Trump Administration’s handling of the census question and the ensuing litigation has reeked from the beginning of prevarication and contempt for law and orderly process. In case anyone missed it, both the president and Barr—whose eager embrace of his role as Trump partisan further degrades his office with each passing day—underscored the political aim underlying the citizenship question campaign: to permit experiments in legislative redistricting that would lower the representation of heavily Democratic cities and increase the strength of rural Republican strongholds. In his remarks in the Rose Garden Thursday, Trump actually invited states to undertake such gerrymandering because the Supreme Court “said it would not review certain types of districting decisions.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eTrump’s appeal to partisanship was a rare moment of candor amid a speech otherwise full of malarkey. But if the president’s handling of the census case is any indication, neither he nor his enablers have any inclination to close the ever-present gap between what Trump says and what is actually happening. Whether the federal judiciary will demand some measure of good faith from Trump in future disputes remains to be seen, but his contrivances will surely create other occasions to test the courts’ resolve.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/kgtZ7DzymU8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/kgtZ7DzymU8/","published":"2019-07-13T10:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-593893"},{"title":"Robert Mueller Must Finish the Job","content":"\u003cp\u003eMuch drama surrounds former Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s upcoming testimony—on July 17, or perhaps on July 24—before two committees of the House of Representatives. It flows in no small part from Mueller’s character, \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/05/robert-mueller-sticking-facts/590494/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eas a man out of time\u003c/a\u003e, whose extraordinary commitment to values uncommon in today’s world have made him both an icon and a curiosity. I know of his long-standing commitment to those values not just from reading the papers, but from serving with him decades ago, as new assistant U.S. attorneys in San Francisco in 1977 and as colleagues in leadership roles at Main Justice in 1989 and 1990.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBob Mueller is a marine, who takes the core values of honor, courage and commitment seriously. Time and again, he has answered the call to step in and do his best in dire circumstances—in Vietnam, where he was decorated for courageous conduct under fire; as a line homicide prosecutor in the nation’s capital, \u003ca href=\"http://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,166567,00.html\"\u003ebecause\u003c/a\u003e “there’s just too many young people dying violently in this city”; in 1998, as the United States attorney in a San Francisco office in such difficult straits that President Bill Clinton called him back to fix it; and as the director of the FBI, who just one week into the job, on September 11, 2001, was handed the new task of remaking the bureau for the worldwide War on Terror. In that last role, Mueller stayed two years past the end of his term—the longest tenure for a director since J. Edgar Hoover—when pressed by President Barack Obama. And, of course, in 2017 he answered the call to serve in the predictably thankless job of special counsel.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis extraordinary commitment to public service and seeing hard jobs through to the end is consistent with the Marine Corps motto, \u003cem\u003eSemper fidelis\u003c/em\u003e. “Always faithful.” That means placing loyalty to country, its institutions—and, under normal circumstances, the commander in chief—above all else. And it means loyalty to rules and the subtleties of rules. Mueller is a rule follower, a model of rectitude and reserve, as anyone can see from the way he has conducted himself.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor two years, Mueller uttered not a single public word as he pursued his investigation, ignoring ceaseless verbal attacks from the president. His silence was consistent with traditional prosecutorial practice, but highly uncharacteristic of most players in our media culture, including many prosecutors. When he finished, following the playbook laid out in the special-counsel regulations, he turned over his remarkable 448-page report to his nominal supervisor, Attorney General William Barr, on March 22, and sat back silently awaiting next steps.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen Barr wrote a cryptic letter on March 24 purporting to summarize the report’s conclusions, but expressly stating that the mountain of summarized evidence was legally insufficient to show obstruction of justice, Mueller responded three days later with a confidential note to Barr saying that the letter “did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance of the Office’s work and conclusions.” But still, Mueller said nothing publicly for two more months. Only after Barr had further obfuscated matters at an April 18 press conference and in a May 1 testimony before Congress did Mueller hold a brief, tight-lipped press conference on May 29 at the Department of Justice.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMueller recounted with emphasis the parts of the report detailing Russia’s extraordinary interference in our election. He also repeated the report’s reasoning that the departmental policy barring indictment of the president must be honored, and also the report’s extrapolation of that rule to bar any affirmative finding of criminal wrongdoing that the president would have no procedural way to refute. At the same time, paraphrasing the words of the report, he said that if “we had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so”—and they did not say so. Mueller closed by saying that he hoped this would be the last time he would be speaking on this matter, noting that his report was his testimony and he should not be expected to answer further questions about it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe next day, on May 30, Barr offered a gratuitous interview to Jan Crawford of CBS News, mocking Mueller’s determination that no conclusion about Trump’s criminality could be drawn. “The opinion says you cannot indict a president while he is in office, but he could’ve reached a decision as to whether it was criminal activity.” Thus, Barr explained, “when he didn’t make a decision, the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and I felt it was necessary for us as the heads of the department to reach that decision.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBy rejecting—even appearing to ridicule—Mueller’s punctilious insistence that fairness foreclosed any finding of likely criminality by the president, because department policy barred an actual indictment, Barr thus opened the way for his own formal finding on that subject. And in reaching a finding of no criminality without ever discussing the evidence, Barr plainly relied on \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/06/bill-barrs-dangerous-pursuit-executive-power/592951/?utm_source=feed\"\u003ehis own twisted vision of an autocratic president\u003c/a\u003e constitutionally empowered to shut down any investigation—even an investigation into his own conduct. It was a vision he had spelled out in detail in a 19-page memo attacking “Mueller’s ‘Obstruction’ Theory,” which he submitted to Rod Rosenstein in June 2018, perhaps as an audition for the job of attorney general.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnyone who has carefully read Volume II of the Mueller report knows that it offers a very readable account of repeated acts by the president carefully tailored to interfere with and disrupt the investigation, and that it offers an enormous amount of evidence to substantiate its narrative. That is why more than 1,000 current and former prosecutors have come together to say that but for the departmental rules categorically foreclosing it, indictment of the president for obstruction would be well justified.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut very few people have actually read the report. And for the others, Barr’s careful campaign of cryptic and misleading public statements has muddled the message very badly. Indeed, it has left most people at best puzzled, and some with the mistaken view that evidence showing serious misconduct probably does not exist.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThus, if the arduous task Mueller undertook as special counsel included informing the American people and Congress about the facts and law surrounding the president’s conduct in a way they would be likely to understand, he is not yet done. He needs to be more direct about what the investigation found. And there seems little doubt that an unambiguous direct statement by Mueller of his own prosecutorial judgment based on the work of his team and their assessment of the law—as other independent counsels have provided—would carry enormous weight, and do much to set the public record straight. He needs to tell us whether, in his view, the president obstructed justice.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePerhaps his recent decision to testify before two committees on July 17, after saying on May 29 that he hoped that would be the last time he would have to explain his report, shows that Mueller himself has come to this realization. If so, and if he has decided to give us the benefit of his professional judgment, his path to that decision may have been aided by reflections on the meaning of loyalty in the circumstances America finds itself in. Still, the decision to take that step cannot be easy for this Marine. The very idea of investigating criminality by the commander in chief sits uneasily with a soldier’s unconditional acceptance of the president’s power over his own life, including to order actions that will result in his certain death. But that issue has been on the table since the start, and is a bridge Mueller must have crossed many months, or even years, ago.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGiven his demonstrated commitment to honoring the chain of command and respecting rules, might Mueller be reluctant to express his own judgment, since Barr has said that the president’s extreme powers under Article II make him virtually incapable of committing obstruction of justice? It seems unlikely. Accepting that view would render Mueller’s entire investigation of Trump’s alleged interference an idle exercise. And, again, it seems to be a bridge Mueller crossed some time back. The Mueller report expressly addresses the attorney general’s constitutional vision and rejects it. Barr’s view lacks legal support, and is inconsistent with the independent role Mueller was commanded to play as special counsel.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFinally, what about Mueller’s stated reason, based on notions of fair play, for declining even to express a judgment about probable criminality by the president? There—and only there—Barr seems to have it right. A speculative opinion of the Office of Legal Counsel foreclosing indictment of the president, based on no explicit constitutional or statutory language, should not be expanded so as to prevent a special counsel from doing his job. Mueller should accept Barr’s interpretation on this issue of departmental guidance, and give us the benefit of his professional judgment on the legal significance of the facts he has found. It is the only way he can finish the job, and the country’s future depends on it.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/e-8K1l9CKDw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/e-8K1l9CKDw/","published":"2019-07-13T10:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-593743"},{"title":"Why New Zealanders Love DIY Coffins","content":"\u003cp class=\"dropcap\"\u003eT\u003cspan class=\"smallcaps\"\u003ehere are coffins,\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"smallcaps\"\u003e \u003c/span\u003eand then there is the Batesville Z94, better known as the Promethean.

Members start by selecting a coffin style (the classic “toe pincher” seems to be enjoying a revival). Next, the measuring and sawing of wood begins (MDF—think IKEA furniture—is common). After gluing and drilling comes the decision about how basic or elaborate the exterior should be (themes have ranged from hand-painted nature scenes to Elvis).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe trend started in the town of Rotorua, on New Zealand’s North Island.

Bruce Miller’s Hulu series loves, above all things, to humanize its most horrific characters, and so Dowd’s Aunt Lydia—much like Yvonne Strahovski’s Serena Waterford—switches modes between ruthlessness and vulnerability at a dizzying pace. In a recent episode of Season 3, “Household,” a visibly chastened Lydia wept at the sight of handmaids whose mouths had been sewn shut. “When I get tired,” Lydia told June (played by Elisabeth Moss), “I try to think of all the good I can do in God’s world. And if I can help just one person, one soul, that’s enough.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd yet. Just a few episodes earlier, Lydia had tased June in the stomach while struggling to climb a flight of stairs—an act of sadistic retribution for Lydia’s physical frailty. The scene echoed a moment in Season 1 when Lydia tased a pregnant June for quoting a Bible passage in protest. Aunt Lydia has cut out handmaids’ eyes and tongues, and, as a form of ritualized punishment, chained one of them to a gas stove so her arm could be burned. Lydia has emotionally, mentally, physically, and sexually tortured the handmaids in her care, under the auspices of “saving” them. And the character has done all this, Dowd’s performance makes clear enough, because she \u003cem\u003eenjoys it. \u003c/em\u003eThe cruelty, as my colleague Adam Serwer wrote in an \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/10/the-cruelty-is-the-point/572104/?utm_source=feed\"\u003einfluential 2018 essay\u003c/a\u003e about the Trump administration, is the point. And many of the president’s supporters, Serwer wrote, find not just comfort but also community in cruelty—“an answer to the loneliness and atomization of modern life.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis week’s episode of \u003cem\u003eThe Handmaid’s Tale\u003c/em\u003e, “Unfit,” flashed back to Lydia’s pre-Gilead existence as an elementary-school teacher. While the narrative jump wasn’t an attempt to fully explain how Lydia became the person she is, \u003ca href=\"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/la-et-st-handmaids-tale-aunt-lydia-20190711-story.html\"\u003eMiller has said\u003c/a\u003e, it offered up a reasonably succinct portrayal of her path from warm and caring to vengeful and bitter. In the flashback, Lydia is an educator after having given up family law and is caring for a boy named Ryan (Ian Ho) whose mother hasn’t arrived to pick him up on time. This version of Lydia seems like a different species from the one brutalizing handmaids in the show’s present: With her maternal affect, her twinkling eyes, and her long, loose hair, she’s as threatening as \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Tale_of_Mrs._Tiggy-Winkle\"\u003eMrs. Tiggy-Winkle\u003c/a\u003e. As Lydia chats with the school principal, Jim Thorne (John Ortiz), she reveals that Ryan regularly comes to class without having eaten breakfast and with only a bag of potato chips for lunch. When Ryan’s mother, Noelle (Emily Althaus), arrives, Lydia is gentle rather than abrasive, inviting them both to eat dinner at her home.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA few months later, Lydia has forged a bond with Noelle and Ryan, even though she disapproves of Noelle’s lifestyle—her casual cursing in conversation and her chain of married or abusive boyfriends. Ryan, in a moment that sends shivers up the spine, refers to his teacher as “Aunt Lydia.” Noelle does Lydia’s makeup against her protestations and encourages her to start dating again. The scene is tender, as Noelle gently applies powder on Lydia’s cheeks, and Lydia seems to vibrate with happiness and gratitude at being touched by another person for the first time in too long.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile the Republic of Gilead hasn’t yet imposed its draconian regime on America, there are glimpses of what’s to come. In her semi-flirtatious conversation with Principal Thorne, Lydia quotes a passage from Hebrews 13:2: “Don’t forget to show hospitality to strangers, for thereby some have entertained angels.” Lydia left her job in family law, it’s hinted, because the “system” has “all been privatized,” a breezily vague allusion to the fact that lawyers for parents who struggle to take care of their children are no longer needed in a country that simply takes those children into custody. And, when Lydia kisses Thorne with ferocious ardor after a karaoke date, and he gently rebuffs her, she takes out her humiliation on Noelle, reporting her to the authorities for being an unfit mother and having Ryan taken into foster care. “We are required by law to report moral weakness,” Lydia spits at a horrified Thorne. Her hair is now tied severely back, and she’s clad in a drab olive green that evokes her future uniform as a Gilead enforcer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLydia, “Unfit” seemed to say, was once good. The episode didn’t delve into some of the other formative moments of her past, like her failed marriage or the death of her nephew, but it offered a window into a moment when Lydia made herself vulnerable and was shown up in return as someone whose desires belied her pious facade. Lydia’s ability to betray another woman she’d grown close to showed early evidence of a growing misogyny—her suspicion of women who, unlike her, follow their urges, and her willingness to harm even the women she professes to love. One of Lydia’s favorite handmaids is Janine (Madeline Brewer), whom she indulges with a doting manner and occasional treats. But in the third-season episode “God Bless the Child,” Lydia savagely beats Janine in front of hundreds of other people after Janine expresses a wish to see her daughter again.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe extent to which Lydia loses control shocks even the commanders and wives around her. The scene is a telling one. You can sense the lies Lydia tells herself: that she punishes the handmaids only to protect them, and that she’s trying to save Janine from the death sentence of refusing to give up her child. You can see Lydia’s mania once she lets go, no more capable of stopping herself from hitting someone else than she is of reining in her passion for Thorne. But you can also see Lydia’s sadism. She thrills at inflicting pain on people who are more vulnerable than she is.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis kind of cruelty—the kind that causes Aunt Lydia to look, with the unmistakable relish of the enforcer, upon a staged ceremony of handmaids thinking they’re about to be hanged—isn’t justifiable. “Unfit” sought to explore some of Lydia’s own damage, and how easily pain can fester into the need to project it onto others. Lydia’s shame for her own repressed desires, and her subsequent humiliation when she’s exposed, is what \u003cem\u003eThe Handmaid’s Tale\u003c/em\u003e theorizes has made her such a monster. Lydia, Miller \u003ca href=\"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/la-et-st-handmaids-tale-aunt-lydia-20190711-story.html\"\u003etold the \u003cem\u003eLos Angeles Times\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, “ostensibly thinks that she’s helping this kid by separating him from the mom.” But I’d argue that she doesn’t. There’s no altruism in her eyes when she reports Noelle, not even a flicker of phony concern. Rather, Lydia is discovering that she can let loose her rage onto other people and enjoy doing so.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe show portrays Lydia’s sadism but doesn’t really seem to comprehend it. In order to make Lydia more than a two-dimensional villain, it has to underplay her most crucial instincts. But you’re either a person who’s able to draw satisfaction from the pain of others, or you’re not. And in Gilead, Lydia has found a system where she can liberate all her vengeful feelings under the guise of institutional care.

Prior to her straight-sets (6–2, 6–2) upset of Serena Williams in the women’s singles final at Wimbledon today, Halep’s only Grand Slam singles title had come on \u003ca href=\"https://www.espn.com/tennis/story/_/id/23742969/simona-halep-wins-french-open-beating-sloane-stephens\"\u003ethe red clay at the French Open\u003c/a\u003e, a slow, high-bouncing surface that rewards the meticulous construction of points as opposed to aggressive shot making.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut Halep’s triumph over Williams on the lush, low-bouncing grass of Wimbledon’s Centre Court made clear that the 27-year-old Romanian, who came into the match as an obvious underdog, is so much more than a defense-oriented grinder. There’s no question that her speed and sound footwork are her greatest strengths; they allow her to cover the court beautifully and frustrate any opponent by consistently keeping the ball in play. But in the early stages of the final, the precision and force with which she hit her groundstrokes are what elicited countless \u003cem\u003eooh\u003c/em\u003es from the gathered crowd. Chris Evert, who performed color-commentary duties for ESPN, repeatedly marveled at the power and placement of Halep’s shots from the back of the court. The Romanian played at such a high level that her win seemed like a foregone conclusion from the start.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHalep’s victory felt eerily similar, in many respects, to the classic 2008 men’s singles final between Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. (Federer and Nadal met yesterday in the men’s semifinal, with Federer prevailing in the less spectacular sequel.) Like Federer in 2008, Williams came into this year’s final as the player who had already won multiple Wimbledon titles; her powerful serve and groundstrokes are particularly difficult to deal with on grass. And like Nadal in 2008, Halep entered the contest as someone who had never proved that she could play her absolute best tennis on this surface.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut in today’s final, as in the 2008 match, it was the underdog who frustrated the more established champion, by neutralizing her opponent’s strengths and firing winners from all parts of the court. Watching Halep scramble from sideline to sideline and send some of Williams’s most formidable shots back over the net—sometimes with nearly as much pace and often at wickedly acute angles—was a throwback to the way Nadal took down Federer to write his own name into the lore of tennis’s most hallowed tournament.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHalep accomplished a similar feat today: One of the points of the match occurred at 4–2 in the second set, when Halep hit a forehand on the run with a perfect combination of spin and pace. The ball landed deep on Williams’s side of the court, and all the American could do was weakly parry it back across the net, allowing Halep to crush a backhand down the opposite line for a winner. It was a beautiful example of how court coverage, point construction, and ball striking allowed Halep to keep Williams off balance all afternoon.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn her post-match, on-court interview, Halep admitted that this was the best match she had ever played. She has been ranked No. 1 in the world, but defeating Williams at Wimbledon is unquestionably her career-defining moment thus far. As for Williams, another loss in a Grand Slam final will raise questions about whether, at 37, she still has enough stamina to win her sport’s biggest titles. She certainly still has the skill; in mixed doubles, she hit the shot of the tournament, a \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/Wimbledon/status/1148661985216737280?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1148661985216737280\u0026amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.espn.com%2Ftennis%2Fstory%2F_%2Fid%2F27167192%2Fserena-fell-short-final-wimbledon-was-full-memorable-moments\"\u003eforehand return\u003c/a\u003e that dropped like an anvil after clearing the net and cut sideways across the court, out of the reach of her opponent.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHalep is a worthy champion, and her form today suggests that her best moments as a professional tennis player lie ahead. Williams remains a titan of the sport and is often and deservingly described as the “greatest of all time.” She dominated headlines this fortnight at the All England Club for the \u003ca href=\"https://www.theringer.com/2019/7/10/20688418/serena-williams-andy-murray-wimbledon-mixed-doubles\"\u003ejoyous mixed-doubles partnership\u003c/a\u003e she forged with Andy Murray and the exceptional play she exhibited in the singles draw prior to the final. (She hilariously reacted to a fine she received for court damage by \u003ca href=\"http://www.espn.com/espnw/sports/article/27149949/avenger-serena-fined-10k-damaging-court\"\u003elikening herself to an Avenger\u003c/a\u003e.) Williams is still one Grand Slam singles title away from equaling Margaret Court’s all-time record, but Halep looks like the player with the better chance of adding to her own count of Grand Slam titles in the near future.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/XtgsEeqy1CA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/XtgsEeqy1CA/","published":"2019-07-13T16:03:09Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-593929"},{"title":"There’s No Understanding Donald Trump","content":"\u003cp\u003eIt’s been barely two weeks since Donald Trump became the first American president to step onto North Korean soil, with all attendant theorizing about what the move meant, or didn’t.

Who was outwitting whom?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlthough it was just two weeks in the past, that moment feels like two centuries ago, given the nonstop series of crises and “Breaking News!” emergencies since then. For instance: the census showdown; the Epstein/Acosta disasters; the leaked British Ambassador cables; more rumblings about Iran and China; the horrors of migrant detention-camp conditions, and the long-threatened kickoff this weekend of ICE roundup raids.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eToday I got a reminder note from a reader who had written in just after that “historic” encounter on the Korean DMZ. He argues that the uninterrupted torrent of (usually Trump-generated) emergencies since then reinforces the point he originally made.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHis point involved a structural failure of analysis in the Trump years. That is: the people most accustomed to “analyzing” political actions and decisions—journalists, historians, political veterans, people who pride themselves on figuring out what is “really” going on—are the ones least able to recognize what the world is experiencing with Donald Trump.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is obviously not a brand-new insight. But the reader states the case trenchantly enough that I think it’s worth sharing. Two weeks ago, after the Korean episode, the reader wrote:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eI had an epiphany sometime around the midterms, after about 2 years of watching and reading heavy duty analysis by so many serious folks who, because it's their job I suppose, tend to *project* seriousness, intent, thought, strategy, forethought, planning, and other such things, each time Trump does something. No matter how loose the cannon gets, most serious journalists default to a polite interpretation that suggests, say, Trump had something in mind when he just did that ridiculous thing.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003ePut another way, they’re suggesting he’s crazy like a Fox, not just an idiot\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eAt some point I found myself trying to explain to a friend why Trump did something kooky. As I considered everything I concluded what he was doing was strictly for the attention. It was for one news cycle. No strategy, no planning, no idea about implications. And no intention of following up even a day later.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s when it hit me: he’s running a reality tv show out of the Whitehouse. Every day is a new episode, and every single move is designed to get better Nielsen ratings, improve the brand, or whatever it is that drives that peculiar form of celebrity. Mostly he’s feeding the monster that is 24/7 cable news.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eThink about it this way: you’ve spent your life as a journalist, traveling, flying, writing, running, thinking about how sausages and laws are made. You view the world, your daily routine, even your own self ... through that lens. If by some glitch in the matrix you found yourself Commander in Chief then that is the lens by which you’d view your new job. Everything you’ve done before would impact your schedule, your routine, and how you view the world.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eMore importantly, your serious effort over many years to think long and hard, to write out your thoughts, to bring wisdom and facts to the observations you share, even the reasons you share, how you pick what is a priority for the next issue … all those things would have an impact on the way in which you’d present your public face, your presidential face. In turn, people covering your administration would figure out the above almost immediately and do what they do accordingly.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eTrump is a guy who has known only a very narrow slice of the world (NY real estate), has never been curious, or thoughtful, and certainly never cared about the ideals of good government, nor the welfare of others. For decades he has mixed his person with his public persona to the point of reaching some warped public media brand that eventually landed him on a fake tv show about how he runs the fake parts of his mostly fake company. And then one day, through a glitch in the matrix, he woke up the President of these United States.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eSo he put on a show. Some people liked it. He’s worked every day to get those ratings up. He blows his top when they have a bad day—not because a little kid dies in a camp, not because something doesn't get out of a committee, not because of anything substantive being analyzed by reporters—no, he’s mad because of the bad optics, because someone upstaged him in an interview, because someone coughed while he was talking.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eAmerica has elected a carnival barker with absolutely no clue about history, government, the machinations of global finance, nor even GOP politics. There is no plan, there is no strategy, there is no underlying wisdom or thought with each step. There’s today’s show, a manic struggle to find new content, cliff hangers, figuring out who gets killed off next. Our economy, foreign policy, place on the world stage, is based on tv production values, or some formula.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eOnce you see it you can’t unsee it and suddenly everything makes sense.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003ePS have you ever seen the riff by John Mulaney making the case that Trump is like a horse loose in a hospital?

First of all, Ben-Gurion established the renewed sovereignty of the Jewish people in our ancestral homeland. That\u0026#8217;s an historic achievement. He also laid the foundations for the Israeli Army to guarantee that that reality persists. The way I\u0026#8217;ve tried to contribute to the country \u0026#8212; and I think it\u0026#8217;s changed dramatically \u0026#8212; is in the development of Israel as a global technological power. The rise of Israel among the community of nations is the rise of Israeli innovation and technology, both in the civilian field and the military and intelligence field. Israel has now become an important power in the world in these two leading respects.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTIME: What are the factors that contributed to that shift for Israel?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNETANYAHU: The most important one, and one that I\u0026#8217;ve fought for and worked hard for, is to open up Israel\u0026#8217;s economy, open it up to competition, open it up to the free movement of ideas and goods and people, open it up to success, and open it up to failure. Turning Israel into a free market economy I think was the second critical factor that made Israel the power, the rising power that it is among the countries. The first was the high intensity use of our most gifted men and women in our military for intelligence purposes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTIME: What can be done to help the millions of people who live in the Occupied Territories who haven\u0026#8217;t benefited economically or personally from that rise?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNETANYAHU: Well, I\u0026#8217;d separate Gaza from the West Bank, from Judea Samaria, because there the Palestinian economy is on a much better footing, probably double the per capita income that they have in Gaza. Gaza is basically controlled by Hamas, which is a militant Islamic organization that really doesn\u0026#8217;t allow any kind of real development to take place because they take all the money that comes in from international support \u0026#8212; and there\u0026#8217;s quite a bit of it \u0026#8212; and they put it into turning tunnels into a terror machine. Because militarily, we\u0026#8217;re in charge of the West Bank, we control the territory militarily. There\u0026#8217;s no siphoning off of money for that purpose. And in fact, it\u0026#8217;s doing better. I like to see more and more and more investments go to \u0026#8212; in the private sector \u0026#8212; go to the Palestinian areas for joint Israeli Palestinian efforts. Some of that is taking place any way. And I think what Jared Kushner and Jason Greenblatt has embarked in Bahrain could be tremendously beneficial to the Palestinians.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTIME: But the Palestinian officials wouldn\u0026#8217;t even show up in Bahrain for that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNETANYAHU: Let the markets do their thing. Because if we can get this ball rolling then I think it would enhance Palestinian lives, and I think it will also enhance peace. It\u0026#8217;s not a substitute \u0026#8212; economic development is not a substitute for political negotiations. It\u0026#8217;s not a substitute for political solutions but it sure makes it a lot easier, and I \u0026#8212; this automatic boycott by the Palestinians of a conference that is meant to give them a better life, and then to lay the foundations for political negotiations for peace, which is what the Trump plan is going to propose, I think that this automatic boycott is boycotting their own future. That\u0026#8217;s what the Palestinians are doing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTIME: Is the Trump plan going to propose annexation of settlements in the West Bank?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNETANYAHU: Well, I think we have to leave it to the plan as it comes out, and I\u0026#8217;ll be able to respond to that when it\u0026#8217;s \u0026#8212;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTIME: Is there something you\u0026#8217;re looking for in that plan?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNETANYAHU: I think everybody recognizes that under any peace proposal, any realistic peace proposal, there are areas in Judea and Samaria that have already become basically part of Israel already. And I separate that as a fact rather than as an ideological-political position. It\u0026#8217;s a fact. Half of Jerusalem is beyond the proverbial green line. The \u0026#8217;67 separation. Does anyone believe that we\u0026#8217;ll tear up half of Jerusalem? Nobody believes that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTIME: Many say the series of taking more and more of the steps off the table has driven the Palestinians away from the peace process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNETANYAHU: Oh, I don\u0026#8217;t \u0026#8212; they were offered everything, just about everything in Camp David in 2000, with President Clinton and the then Prime Minister Barak, and they walked away from that. They walk away each time. They walked away with Olmert. They walked away with Obama when President Obama and John Kerry wanted to propose a framework for negotiations. I said, you know \u0026#8212; I was reelected. I had my reservations, but I said, yeah, I\u0026#8217;ll go there. For peace, I\u0026#8217;ll be there and we\u0026#8217;ll negotiate. They wouldn\u0026#8217;t go there. So they walk away. They serially walk away from any negotiations that will present a workable peace. And a workable peace means \u0026#8212; it ultimately means compromise. They don\u0026#8217;t have to announce in advance what their compromise will be. I don\u0026#8217;t expect that from them, and they shouldn\u0026#8217;t expect it from us. But we should be able to get into a room and begin to discuss it. They refused to enter the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTIME: Retired Israeli generals have suggested that any sort of annexation of West Bank settlements would result in the collapse of security cooperation imposing incredible economic and security costs on Israel. Do you disagree that that\u0026#8217;s the case?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNETANYAHU: Well, listen, I heard the same thing about the Golan, that if the United States recognized our effective sovereignty over the Golan Heights, it would collapse any possibility of a process with Syria, and so on. It wasn\u0026#8217;t true then, it\u0026#8217;s not true here because the Palestinians themselves know that the areas \u0026#8212; which are by the way a very small part, the populated areas are a very small part of the West Bank of Judea and Samaria. That that\u0026#8217;s going to stay part of Israel. They know it. So let\u0026#8217;s stop the pretense. How about let\u0026#8217;s just talk straight, you know? If you want, if you are a maximalist and you demand, basically what you\u0026#8217;re really seeking is the dismantling of Israel, the dissolution of the Jewish state. Going back to the orchards of Jaffa or Akko, these are places \u0026#8212; Israeli towns on the seacoast \u0026#8212; and you really want to reverse the last 70 years of history, then you\u0026#8217;d take these positions, the maximalist positions that the Palestinians take. And nobody challenges it! In fact, they\u0026#8217;ve been pampered too long. The reason we can\u0026#8217;t get peace is because nobody goes to the heart of the problem, which is the persistent Palestinian refusal to recognize the Jewish state in any borders. And when I ask them, okay, will you sit down with us to negotiate such a compromise? And then they don\u0026#8217;t. And that has to be addressed and challenged. And I\u0026#8217;m glad somebody is doing it, or appears to be doing it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTIME: Former Prime Minister Olmert still insists that Abbas is the man to make peace. Is that not the case?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNETANYAHU: Let\u0026#8217;s see. You know? Let\u0026#8217;s see. I don\u0026#8217;t choose the leaders for the Palestinians. It\u0026#8217;s not that they have exactly the same democratic functions that we have, but I don\u0026#8217;t intervene in the choice, in the process by which the Palestinian leadership comes to the fore. But let them come, let them negotiate. Why boycott? Why say no? No to Bahrain, an economic conference that is intended to bring billions of dollars of investment. Can you imagine this? Billions of dollars to the Palestinians, and no to the Trump plan before you\u0026#8217;ve even heard it? That\u0026#8217;s supposed to bring a political solution? How can you do that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTIME: First-year members of Congress, first-year Democrats, have been critical of Israel quite vocally recently. Representative Ilhan Omar said that Israel was an apartheid regime. What is your response to this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNETANYAHU: I think it\u0026#8217;s \u0026#8212; I think it\u0026#8217;s nonsense. But it\u0026#8217;s shameful nonsense because the one true democracy in the Middle East is Israel, the one country that ensures the full civic equality of its Jewish and non-Jewish citizens. Anybody can be in Israel. Everyone is equal under the law. Everyone has the right to be elected, and in fact, are elected to the Knesset, to the government. So a) the legal structure is the exact opposite of what she\u0026#8217;s describing, and it\u0026#8217;s only so in Israel. When you look around the Middle East, you see Christians being slaughtered, synagogues and churches being destroyed. Muslims of one sect destroying Muslims of other sects, and so on. The militant Islam and its firebrands are tearing the place apart. And this is what this representative has to say? Why is she not speaking out against the torture and hanging of gays in so many parts of the Middle East. In Iran. Why is she not speaking about the executions, the wholesale executions that go on in the marketplace inside Gaza against innocent Palestinians? Why is she not speaking about the way women are treated as chattel, not only enslaved but also murdered. I don\u0026#8217;t hear any of that in so many of the countries around us. She has to talk about Israel, the one place where we have, you know, where we have a woman Supreme Court Justice, and where we have women fighter pilots, and where we have women who are taking part in every realm, aspect of life? I mean it\u0026#8217;s just absurd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTIME: When you look at the economic data, Israeli Arabs have not benefited as much as other citizens of Israel from the economic boom. What do you have to say about that? What could be done?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNETANYAHU: Well, I\u0026#8217;ve been working very hard to change that. If you actually go beyond the \u0026#8212; all these stereotypes \u0026#8212; and you look at what we\u0026#8217;re doing, what my government has done is to take $15 billion shekels \u0026#8212; that\u0026#8217;s a lot of money in Israel \u0026#8212; and put it into a multi-year plan that has already had a measurable effect for improving the lives, and especially the infrastructure in the Arab sector. That\u0026#8217;s a massive amount of money for roads, for schools, for clinics, for transportation. Transportation is important inside the communities because if a woman, an Arab woman in Israel, an Arab citizen of Israel, a woman wants to go to work, it\u0026#8217;s very hard for her to get to work if she wants to go to \u0026#8212; have herself educated. She has to get there. And if she doesn\u0026#8217;t have her own private transportation \u0026#8211;. You have to take care of public transportation. I did! Well, look, can you imagine there wasn\u0026#8217;t any in Israel for so many years? We\u0026#8217;ve done the same in so many other fields, and I\u0026#8217;m glad because I want to see all of the citizens of Israel \u0026#8212; Arabs and Jews alike \u0026#8212; to have the same opportunity to benefit in this amazing success story that\u0026#8217;s called the state of Israel\u0026hellip;.. So this is something I\u0026#8217;m genuinely committed to. It\u0026#8217;s not something that I just say. We actually passed these budgets, and we don\u0026#8217;t just create budgets out of thin air. It always comes at the expense of something else. I thought this was important. So important that I was willing to prioritize it and put it in as part of our budgets, and I\u0026#8217;m very glad to see and to hear the Arab citizens of Israel say, \u0026ldquo;This is good! We want to be part of Israel. We want to be part of Israeli society.\u0026rdquo; Are there gaps? Sure. Are we closing those gaps? You bet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTIME: Do you worry that down the road in the U.S. there\u0026#8217;s going to be less support for Israel in a future administration? And are you under pressure to give now in the peace process, or give some concessions now because future administrations may be less friendly to Israel?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNETANYAHU: Uh, look, I think there\u0026#8217;s a continual effort on the part of Israel, certainly under my government, to reach out to \u0026#8212; first of all to the American people because ultimately in our democracies, our twin democracies, and we are exactly that, we\u0026#8217;re twin democracies, ultimately the power rests with the public. And it rests with public opinion. And Israel has to continually make its case before American public opinion. It\u0026#8217;s generally been successful because the support for Israel has risen dramatically, and \u0026#8230; consistently, over the last 40 years. And it encompasses the vast majority of the American people. But we also have opposition. We also have a lot of vilification, a lot of stereotyping of Israel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTIME: You\u0026#8217;ve been a polarizing figure among American Jews.

What, more than any other prime minister that I know to incorporate the diaspora Jews, the Jews of the United States, and other countries, to make them feel at home in Israel. To make arrangements and such things as conversion, marriage. And then prayer sites. It always involves, because of our system, compromises. These are never perfect solutions. But I\u0026#8217;ve actually incorporated into law our communal responsibility with our fellow Jews abroad. So I\u0026#8217;m often described in some circles in the way that you describe, but it\u0026#8217;s not true. It doesn\u0026#8217;t reflect on \u0026#8212; it doesn\u0026#8217;t reflect my basic tendency. I want every Jew to feel at home in Israel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTIME: Has the Trump Administration\u0026#8217;s policy on Iran made Israel more unsafe?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNETANYAHU: The answer categorically is no. What has made Israel \u0026#8212; what has challenged Israel\u0026#8217;s security is Iran\u0026#8217;s goal, one, to have nuclear weapons, which they intend to use to annihilate Israel. And second, their attempts to bring their Army or pieces of their Army into Syria, right in Israel\u0026#8217;s backyard with the express purpose of destroying Israel, with those forces.\u003cbr /\u003e\nWe have acted militarily against the Iranian attempt in Syria, and will continue to do so, because how would you act if you knew that somebody\u0026#8217;s coming, right next to your neighborhood, and pledges to bring missiles and other lethal weapons to kill you and destroy you? Obviously, you\u0026#8217;d try to stop them, which is what we\u0026#8217;re doing in Syria. And equally, we appreciate the fact that President Trump has put crippling sanctions on the Iranian economy because what we see is those sanctions are actually drying up some of the funds that go to this war front in Syria. We see that very, very clearly. So I think on the contrary, that\u0026#8217;s made us absolutely safer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTIME: If Iran starts stockpiling nuclear material beyond the JCPOA and other agreements, what kind of action are you willing to take?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNETANYAHU: We\u0026#8217;ll take whatever action is necessary to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTIME: Does that include an open strike on Iranian nuclear facilities?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNETANYAHU: Whatever action is necessary will be taken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTIME: Are those facilities too far underground to be impacted by strikes?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNETANYAHU: Let\u0026#8217;s consider what an intelligent journalist like you would consider an intelligent response to that. If I say yes or if I say no. I think neither one is satisfactory, so I\u0026#8217;m just going to say we\u0026#8217;ll take whatever action is needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTIME: The elections are coming up in September.

They didn\u0026#8217;t have to go through these 13 years of my service in the office. They have it after 13 days. After 13 minutes. But there\u0026#8217;s a very large majority, a very large part of the Israeli public that appreciates what we\u0026#8217;ve been doing for the country. For its economy, for its security, for its diplomatic standing, for the state.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTIME: Have the corruption investigations weakened you politically?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNETANYAHU: I don\u0026#8217;t think so.

They think it\u0026#8217;s concoction and I know it\u0026#8217;s a concoction because there\u0026#8217;s nothing there. So ultimately nothing will remain.

And how might that detract from your running of the country?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNETANYAHU: Well, number one, I won\u0026#8217;t pass, and didn\u0026#8217;t intend to pass, any special immunity laws. That\u0026#8217;s just not true. I mean it\u0026#8217;s repeated ad nauseam.

We have perfectly good \u0026#8212; there\u0026#8217;s a perfectly good immunity law in Israel. Whether I\u0026#8217;ll need it or not, first let\u0026#8217;s see what happens in the hearing. I think the hearing should come to nothing. If it doesn\u0026#8217;t, then an Israeli prime minister can serve or can ask for immunity for his period of service.

And I have done things including dozens and dozens of economic reforms and a leveraging of the special capabilities that we\u0026#8217;ve developed here through market reforms and innovation and technology and cybersecurity; and water and agriculture and transportation; and life sciences. We\u0026#8217;ve taken these extraordinary abilities that Israel is now producing and have transferred it to security and political alliances around the world. I think the people of Israel see this.

In the joint statement, the panels said the longer hearings \u0026#8220;will allow the American public to gain further insight into the special counsel\u0026#8217;s investigation and the evidence uncovered regarding Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and President Trump\u0026#8217;s possible obstruction of justice and abuse of power.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMueller has expressed his reluctance to testify and said he won\u0026#8217;t go beyond what\u0026#8217;s in his 448-page report. But Democrats have been determined to highlight its contents for Americans who they believe have not read it. They want to extract information from the former special counsel and spotlight what they say are his most damaging findings against Trump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDemocrats are expected to ask Mueller about his conclusions, including that he could not exonerate Trump on obstruction of justice after detailing several episodes in which Trump tried to influence the investigation. Mueller also said there was not enough evidence to establish a criminal conspiracy between Trump\u0026#8217;s presidential campaign and the Kremlin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne thing Judiciary members want to focus on in questioning Mueller is whether Trump would have been charged with a crime were he not president. Mueller said in a May news conference that charging a president with a crime was \u0026#8220;not an option\u0026#8221; because of longstanding Justice Department policy. But Democrats want to know more about how he made that decision and when.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA separate closed-door session with two of Mueller\u0026#8217;s deputies is expected to be canceled, for now.

A separate person familiar with that testimony said that the person is David Archey, the senior FBI official who was involved in Mueller\u0026#8217;s probe.

While every member of the smaller Intelligence panel was expected to be able to question Mueller, fewer than half of Democrats and Republicans on the Judiciary panel would have been able to do so in the original two-hour timeframe. At a separate hearing on Thursday, several Republicans complained about the setup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;I have been elected just like anyone else here,\u0026#8221; said Arizona Rep.

Doug Collins, said: \u0026#8220;I appreciate news the chairman has taken seriously the concerns Judiciary Republicans raised this week. The new format will allow all Judiciary Republicans to question the special counsel on July 24.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#8217;s unclear whether Mueller\u0026#8217;s testimony will give Democratic investigations new momentum. In the news conference, Mueller indicated that it was up to Congress to decide what to do with his findings. But Democrats have had little success so far in their attempts to probe his findings as the White House has blocked several witnesses from answering questions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat means the committees may have to go through a lengthy court process to get more information.

Area 51 also trended on Twitter for several hours, which yielded scores of jokes about what an event involving a bunch of anime fans and alien-seeking Facebook users would look like. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"6dd75B\"\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"\u003e\n\u003cp lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003earea 51 memes are KILLIN me \u003ca href=\"https://t.co/yQcwMILqRT\"\u003epic.twitter.com/yQcwMILqRT\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e— M (@maddieeadie_) \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/maddieeadie_/status/1149438253503827968?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"\u003eJuly 11, 2019\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cscript async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"JRw8ja\"\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"\u003e\n\u003cp lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003eHow im gonna enter area 51 Vs how im gonna leave \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Area51?src=hash\u0026amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"\u003e#Area51\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://t.co/ih1MDZmFep\"\u003epic.twitter.com/ih1MDZmFep\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e— Im a penguin (@Gabriel_rod12) \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/Gabriel_rod12/status/1149730952534528003?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"\u003eJuly 12, 2019\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cscript async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"lckLk2\"\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"\u003e\n\u003cp lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe aliens in Area 51 getting ready to be freed after they get that omw text \u003ca href=\"https://t.co/APFVZD0j8Z\"\u003epic.twitter.com/APFVZD0j8Z\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e— Matthew A.

The reasons emerged this year when he was interviewed in the Spectator. “If Lolita was offered to me today,” Dan Franklin said, “I’d never be able to get it past the acquisition team — a committee of 30-year-olds, who’d say: ‘If you publish this book we will all resign.’” He pointed to #MeToo and social media as fundamental factors: “You can organise outrage at the drop of a hat.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli id=\"9jrBtD\"\u003eAlso at the Guardian: There’s a vandal on the loose in Kent, and he’s ripping apart the pages of secondhand books at charity shops. \u003ca href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jul/11/book-ripper-on-vandalism-spree-hunted-herne-bay\"\u003eThey call him “the book ripper”\u003c/a\u003e:\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"CftVqm\"\u003eRyan Campbell, the chief executive of the charity Demelza, which runs a bookshop on Mortimer Street, told the Guardian that since April, around 100 books in the shop have had their pages torn in half horizontally before being reshelved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Bj8wev\"\u003e“We think it’s been going on for a few months but it’s hard to tell – if you find a ripped book in a secondhand shop you don’t think too much about it, so it’s taken us a while to piece it together.

Like so many divinatory games, young women have long been the keepers and practitioners. In our patriarchal society, young men have been emboldened to select their own paths, to determine who and what they wanted to become — leaving boys with no true need for fortune telling or luck. Why bother with divination when you can control the future? Adolescent girls, however, were never afforded this promise. Thus, girls have long been drawn to games of chance, of luck, of peering into a future that seemed to already have been decided for them.

Last December, as the delisting proposal was being drafted, the Center for Biological Diversity and the Humane Society submitted a petition to Interior requesting just that. The petition described a variety of regions that are ripe for recovery, including the Pacific Coast, the Midwest, the southern Rockies, and the Northeast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"6rvwy3\"\u003eBy focusing on multiple large areas like this, Interior could tailor protections based on conservation need while still committing to the intention of the ESA, recovery throughout wolves range, they said.

Germany’s biggest bank is cutting a fifth of its workforce—some 18,000 positions—and curtailing its investment banking and trading units. Its most “\u003ca href=\"https://qz.com/1660263/deutsche-bank-to-cut-18000-jobs-in-radical-restructuring-plan/\"\u003eradical\u003c/a\u003e” restructuring yet will see it focus on more staid corporate banking for primarily European customers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Frankfurt, Germany-based company is getting all the attention now, but it isn’t an outlier. Every big bank has undergone a profound rethink since 2008. That year, multiple top firms in Manhattan were swallowed up by other banks, and Lehman Brothers collapsed. The Royal Bank of Scotland fell from the skies shortly after. Government watchdogs in the US and Europe who yanked the financial system back from the brink then set about constructing a safer, more stable financial industry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey largely succeeded. That means risky things like buying and selling securities aren’t the moneymakers they used to be. Goldman Sachs, known for its trading prowess, has gone into retail banking. Its nemesis Morgan Stanley shifted into wealth management—a move that has \u003ca href=\"https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2018/01/25/morgan-stanleys-unexciting-model-takes-the-prize-on-wall-street\"\u003epaid off\u003c/a\u003e (paywall).

By 1670, the Akwamu directed their attention to Accra, which had become an important trading centre where Portuguese, Dutch, English, Swedes and Danes engaged in coastal trade.

Asameni holds a Danish flintlock gun in his right hand and a bunch of keys in his left hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAkwamu resistance to the Danish at the castle was not because the Akwamu were against the transatlantic slave trade. Resistance was not a moral or ethical act. Rather, the Akwamu collaborated with the Danish. Akwamu objections concerned the manner by which the transatlantic slave trade was conducted.The story of Asameni and Christiansborg Castle’s keys reveals the complexities of African agency during the transatlantic slave trade, in particular, resistance and collaboration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe keys to the castle provide material evidence that the Akwamu Empire seized power from the Danes and as a consequence influenced the terms of the transatlantic slave trade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the final analysis, as the Akwamu are quick to point out, the Danish only paid 600 pieces of silver to reoccupy Christiansborg Castle. There are 1000 pieces of silver still outstanding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eI am most grateful to Akwamuhene Odeneho Kwafo Akoto III.

My neighborhood was festooned with every possible permeation of the symbol, ready to house the \u003ca href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/million-people-crowed-nyc-worldpride-mayor/story?id=64090338\"\u003emillions of people swarming to Manhattan\u003c/a\u003e to recognize and celebrate WorldPride.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was painstakingly maneuvering through the crowd when I felt a hand gently touched my shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why not just ‘free hugs’?” a man asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked down at my shirt, emblazoned with “Free Mom Hugs” in giant letters surrounded by multi-colored hearts. I paused and looked up at him, trying to keep my voice strong even though my heart beat solidly with every word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because mom hugs are ‘I will never give you up’ hugs. They are ‘I’m always here for you’ hugs. They are kind and soft and angry and protective, and the best ones feel like something you will carry with you forever. Mom hugs are unconditional— and everyone deserves one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened his arms, and I gave him a hug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought of my own children and this stranger before me. I held him just a bit tighter. When I let go there were tears running down his face and I had to choke back my own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I will take it with me,” I heard him say as he turned and walked back through the crowd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hope he did. I know I have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment, I was someone’s safe space. I don\u0026#8217;t take that lightly. Our world has few enough of those: places where you feel accepted and valued, where you don’t feel constantly attacked, or made to feel like you’re falling short, or relegated. A safe space is give-and-take: I promise to see the best in you and help you be your best, and you promise to do the same. We work on it together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSafes spaces provide the feeling of being able to exist as who you are, to be accepted, and even loved and celebrated for it. Where you know someone will stand up for the good in you when you aren\u0026#8217;t able to yourself. Feeling protected and valued for who you are is paramount to our experience as humans. While we talk a lot about equality. it can’t happen until we find ways to make the spaces we all exist in safe ones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am lucky to live largely in safe spaces, but that hug reminded me that too often and for too many, safe spaces scarce. Pride month reminds us all of that. It has everything to do with carving out and fighting for safe spaces for people who historically have been unable to have them, and to recognize that many people still live in fear and insecurity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yes, Pride is a lovely month. I revel in my rainbow-festooned neighborhood, adore the freedom and joy that overflows with the sheer presence of so many free to express who they are, and love who they choose, and exist in a space where that is celebrated. But one month is not enough, and a 30-day marketing scheme certainly is not enough. The rainbows, while beautiful, are not what we need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs bosses and business leaders, our job is to create safe spaces for the people we manage that are capacious and live far beyond fleeting moments or commercial trends. Our job is to create an ongoing culture of safety. It is our responsibility to cultivate spaces that can expand to hold our whole team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCreating a space of this type is an entirely different beast. Of course, everyone\u0026#8217;s safe space is different, so developing them for our teams and the individuals that comprise can be difficult and unwieldy. But it is possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBelow are a handful of practices we can put into place every day that, over time, can build an environment that fosters empathy and support, encourages bravery and acceptance, and that challenges and rewards our teams and employees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eRemember that failing is part of the process\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=\"pull-quote\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"quote-line\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe greatest work comes from teams made of people who feel safe to be who they are.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"quote-line\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003eThe first step in creating safe spaces is acknowledging your own shortcomings and fears, and living them out-loud with your team. Vulnerability is courageous. Being able to admit that you’re having a bad day, or that you don’t know something, goes a long way in creating an atmosphere where failing is part of the process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRemember that you are the living example of a good portion of your team’s five-year plan. They look to you to see what’s in the future, as a road map for what might be possible in their own careers. Your team members should understand that perfection has no place in a creative atmosphere and that it’s okay to ask for help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe greatest work comes from teams made of people who feel safe to be who they are. Your team should feel free to speak their own individual truths. As their boss, you hired each one of them because they had something unique and beautiful to offer. From time to time, it’s your job remind them of that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWork how you want them to work: fearlessly. This can be exceptionally hard some days and come as complete second nature on others. The hard days are the days I must quiet my ego and remind myself that leadership isn’t about building a blind following, but a unified and connected team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am not supposed to be a hero (as much as I would adore that title—stupid ego), but a \u003cem\u003eleader\u003c/em\u003e: someone who is open and guiding, not someone who sets unrealistic examples of what to aspire to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen your team sees you as impenetrable, unflappable, always confident without hesitation, they will also see someone striving toward perfection. Even more dangerous is that they might perceive you are living that perfection. But no matter who you are, the path to perfection is riddled with fear that every wrong turn or small misstep potentially adds up to ultimate failure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen risks become liabilities, creativity cannot thrive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe best work environments thrive in a space where creativity is free to roam and flourish. Creativity thrives in a space where you are safe to be yourself—an imperfect, curious, try-it-one-more-time self. Creativity fails more often than it succeeds, which is why it feels so good when we get it right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, admit your faults, your bad days, your struggles, and show your team how you overcome, push through, and deal with them. Reward curiosity and determination. Create an environment where upraised voices are valued and listened to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is the root of building a space where people feel free to be themselves and the beginnings of a space where the best work is fostered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat starts with admitting that sometimes we falter, and sometimes we fail—and that’s okay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eListen to the in-between\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs much work as you may put in to building this culture of expression and support, remember that each member of your team will need different things in order to thrive in it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe are, after all, individuals. One person’s safe space can look markedly different from another’s. That is why you have to pay attention to the “in-between.” There is often important information contained in the spaces between things that are said. Meaning, it’s important to pay attention to what is not explicitly said, and why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLearn about your team members as individuals, outside of their projects and work activities. Pay close attention to what happens during work tasks. Hear when a person doesn’t speak, and listen to the “how” of when they do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost likely, this will tell you what empowers them and what makes them feel most themselves. Take note of the moments you can see them truly step into their own light and shine bright.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, find ways to recreate those moments for them and help them create more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eGet comfortable with being uncomfortable\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNone of this is easy. The hardest part may be confronting our own insecurities, faults, and biases. There will be conversations that feel uncomfortable and unexplored spaces where you may feel lost and a bit ungrounded. Know that finding yourself in those places likely means you’re headed in the right direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCreativity is a team sport. So is creating the best possible environment for it to flourish. Lean on your team when you need to. Learn from them. Shine light on them, unabashedly. Celebrate each other and revel in what you can become when you’re together. It will make all the uncomfortable moments worth it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSafe spaces are hard to find and even harder to maintain; but opening your mind, heart, and processes to build them pays off in giant dividends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA space where people are willing to help nourish one another’s growth, do the hard work alongside one another, and protect the hearts of those around them will foster the feeling of being seen, known, and protected. That, in turn, will grow astonishing things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe all deserve to have the place we work every day make us feel appreciated for exactly who we are. As managers, leaders, and mentors, a safe space is no longer a “nice to have” on our list of responsibilities—it is an absolute requirement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe can talk about diversity all we like, but if we don’t create the environments that will protect that variety of experience and thought, it’s all just sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo now that the rainbows have left our corporate logos and the posters have come down, it’s time to continue the real, everyday work.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://qz.com/work/1664471/how-to-build-self-spaces-at-work/","published":"2019-07-13T17:30:17Z","guid":"https://qz.com/1664471//"}]},{"url":"https://www.vice.com/en_us/rss","items":[]},{"url":"https://feeds.gothamistllc.com/gothamist05","items":[]},{"url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/rssfeedsdefault.cms","items":[{"title":"Top

How does Netanyahu\u0026#8217;s Israel look different from Ben-Gurion\u0026#8217;s Israel?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNETANYAHU: Well, it has some of the same elements and foundations. First of all, Ben-Gurion established the renewed sovereignty of the Jewish people in our ancestral homeland. That\u0026#8217;s an historic achievement. He also laid the foundations for the Israeli Army to guarantee that that reality persists. The way I\u0026#8217;ve tried to contribute to the country \u0026#8212; and I think it\u0026#8217;s changed dramatically \u0026#8212; is in the development of Israel as a global technological power. The rise of Israel among the community of nations is the rise of Israeli innovation and technology, both in the civilian field and the military and intelligence field. Israel has now become an important power in the world in these two leading respects.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTIME: What are the factors that contributed to that shift for Israel?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNETANYAHU: The most important one, and one that I\u0026#8217;ve fought for and worked hard for, is to open up Israel\u0026#8217;s economy, open it up to competition, open it up to the free movement of ideas and goods and people, open it up to success, and open it up to failure. Turning Israel into a free market economy I think was the second critical factor that made Israel the power, the rising power that it is among the countries. The first was the high intensity use of our most gifted men and women in our military for intelligence purposes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTIME: What can be done to help the millions of people who live in the Occupied Territories who haven\u0026#8217;t benefited economically or personally from that rise?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNETANYAHU: Well, I\u0026#8217;d separate Gaza from the West Bank, from Judea Samaria, because there the Palestinian economy is on a much better footing, probably double the per capita income that they have in Gaza. Gaza is basically controlled by Hamas, which is a militant Islamic organization that really doesn\u0026#8217;t allow any kind of real development to take place because they take all the money that comes in from international support \u0026#8212; and there\u0026#8217;s quite a bit of it \u0026#8212; and they put it into turning tunnels into a terror machine. Because militarily, we\u0026#8217;re in charge of the West Bank, we control the territory militarily. There\u0026#8217;s no siphoning off of money for that purpose. And in fact, it\u0026#8217;s doing better. I like to see more and more and more investments go to \u0026#8212; in the private sector \u0026#8212; go to the Palestinian areas for joint Israeli Palestinian efforts. Some of that is taking place any way. And I think what Jared Kushner and Jason Greenblatt has embarked in Bahrain could be tremendously beneficial to the Palestinians.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTIME: But the Palestinian officials wouldn\u0026#8217;t even show up in Bahrain for that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNETANYAHU: Let the markets do their thing. Because if we can get this ball rolling then I think it would enhance Palestinian lives, and I think it will also enhance peace. It\u0026#8217;s not a substitute \u0026#8212; economic development is not a substitute for political negotiations. It\u0026#8217;s not a substitute for political solutions but it sure makes it a lot easier, and I \u0026#8212; this automatic boycott by the Palestinians of a conference that is meant to give them a better life, and then to lay the foundations for political negotiations for peace, which is what the Trump plan is going to propose, I think that this automatic boycott is boycotting their own future. That\u0026#8217;s what the Palestinians are doing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTIME: Is the Trump plan going to propose annexation of settlements in the West Bank?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNETANYAHU: Well, I think we have to leave it to the plan as it comes out, and I\u0026#8217;ll be able to respond to that when it\u0026#8217;s \u0026#8212;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTIME: Is there something you\u0026#8217;re looking for in that plan?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNETANYAHU: I think everybody recognizes that under any peace proposal, any realistic peace proposal, there are areas in Judea and Samaria that have already become basically part of Israel already. And I separate that as a fact rather than as an ideological-political position. It\u0026#8217;s a fact. Half of Jerusalem is beyond the proverbial green line. The \u0026#8217;67 separation. Does anyone believe that we\u0026#8217;ll tear up half of Jerusalem? Nobody believes that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTIME: Many say the series of taking more and more of the steps off the table has driven the Palestinians away from the peace process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNETANYAHU: Oh, I don\u0026#8217;t \u0026#8212; they were offered everything, just about everything in Camp David in 2000, with President Clinton and the then Prime Minister Barak, and they walked away from that. They walk away each time. They walked away with Olmert. They walked away with Obama when President Obama and John Kerry wanted to propose a framework for negotiations. I said, you know \u0026#8212; I was reelected. I had my reservations, but I said, yeah, I\u0026#8217;ll go there. For peace, I\u0026#8217;ll be there and we\u0026#8217;ll negotiate. They wouldn\u0026#8217;t go there. So they walk away. They serially walk away from any negotiations that will present a workable peace. And a workable peace means \u0026#8212; it ultimately means compromise. They don\u0026#8217;t have to announce in advance what their compromise will be. I don\u0026#8217;t expect that from them, and they shouldn\u0026#8217;t expect it from us. But we should be able to get into a room and begin to discuss it. They refused to enter the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTIME: Retired Israeli generals have suggested that any sort of annexation of West Bank settlements would result in the collapse of security cooperation imposing incredible economic and security costs on Israel. Do you disagree that that\u0026#8217;s the case?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNETANYAHU: Well, listen, I heard the same thing about the Golan, that if the United States recognized our effective sovereignty over the Golan Heights, it would collapse any possibility of a process with Syria, and so on. It wasn\u0026#8217;t true then, it\u0026#8217;s not true here because the Palestinians themselves know that the areas \u0026#8212; which are by the way a very small part, the populated areas are a very small part of the West Bank of Judea and Samaria. That that\u0026#8217;s going to stay part of Israel. They know it. So let\u0026#8217;s stop the pretense. How about let\u0026#8217;s just talk straight, you know? If you want, if you are a maximalist and you demand, basically what you\u0026#8217;re really seeking is the dismantling of Israel, the dissolution of the Jewish state. Going back to the orchards of Jaffa or Akko, these are places \u0026#8212; Israeli towns on the seacoast \u0026#8212; and you really want to reverse the last 70 years of history, then you\u0026#8217;d take these positions, the maximalist positions that the Palestinians take. And nobody challenges it! In fact, they\u0026#8217;ve been pampered too long. The reason we can\u0026#8217;t get peace is because nobody goes to the heart of the problem, which is the persistent Palestinian refusal to recognize the Jewish state in any borders. And when I ask them, okay, will you sit down with us to negotiate such a compromise? And then they don\u0026#8217;t. And that has to be addressed and challenged. And I\u0026#8217;m glad somebody is doing it, or appears to be doing it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTIME: Former Prime Minister Olmert still insists that Abbas is the man to make peace. Is that not the case?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNETANYAHU: Let\u0026#8217;s see. You know? Let\u0026#8217;s see. I don\u0026#8217;t choose the leaders for the Palestinians. It\u0026#8217;s not that they have exactly the same democratic functions that we have, but I don\u0026#8217;t intervene in the choice, in the process by which the Palestinian leadership comes to the fore. But let them come, let them negotiate. Why boycott? Why say no? No to Bahrain, an economic conference that is intended to bring billions of dollars of investment. Can you imagine this? Billions of dollars to the Palestinians, and no to the Trump plan before you\u0026#8217;ve even heard it? That\u0026#8217;s supposed to bring a political solution? How can you do that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTIME: First-year members of Congress, first-year Democrats, have been critical of Israel quite vocally recently. Representative Ilhan Omar said that Israel was an apartheid regime. What is your response to this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNETANYAHU: I think it\u0026#8217;s \u0026#8212; I think it\u0026#8217;s nonsense. But it\u0026#8217;s shameful nonsense because the one true democracy in the Middle East is Israel, the one country that ensures the full civic equality of its Jewish and non-Jewish citizens. Anybody can be in Israel. Everyone is equal under the law. Everyone has the right to be elected, and in fact, are elected to the Knesset, to the government. So a) the legal structure is the exact opposite of what she\u0026#8217;s describing, and it\u0026#8217;s only so in Israel. When you look around the Middle East, you see Christians being slaughtered, synagogues and churches being destroyed. Muslims of one sect destroying Muslims of other sects, and so on. The militant Islam and its firebrands are tearing the place apart. And this is what this representative has to say? Why is she not speaking out against the torture and hanging of gays in so many parts of the Middle East. In Iran. Why is she not speaking about the executions, the wholesale executions that go on in the marketplace inside Gaza against innocent Palestinians? Why is she not speaking about the way women are treated as chattel, not only enslaved but also murdered. I don\u0026#8217;t hear any of that in so many of the countries around us. She has to talk about Israel, the one place where we have, you know, where we have a woman Supreme Court Justice, and where we have women fighter pilots, and where we have women who are taking part in every realm, aspect of life? I mean it\u0026#8217;s just absurd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTIME: When you look at the economic data, Israeli Arabs have not benefited as much as other citizens of Israel from the economic boom. What do you have to say about that? What could be done?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNETANYAHU: Well, I\u0026#8217;ve been working very hard to change that. If you actually go beyond the \u0026#8212; all these stereotypes \u0026#8212; and you look at what we\u0026#8217;re doing, what my government has done is to take $15 billion shekels \u0026#8212; that\u0026#8217;s a lot of money in Israel \u0026#8212; and put it into a multi-year plan that has already had a measurable effect for improving the lives, and especially the infrastructure in the Arab sector. That\u0026#8217;s a massive amount of money for roads, for schools, for clinics, for transportation. Transportation is important inside the communities because if a woman, an Arab woman in Israel, an Arab citizen of Israel, a woman wants to go to work, it\u0026#8217;s very hard for her to get to work if she wants to go to \u0026#8212; have herself educated. She has to get there. And if she doesn\u0026#8217;t have her own private transportation \u0026#8211;. You have to take care of public transportation. I did! Well, look, can you imagine there wasn\u0026#8217;t any in Israel for so many years? We\u0026#8217;ve done the same in so many other fields, and I\u0026#8217;m glad because I want to see all of the citizens of Israel \u0026#8212; Arabs and Jews alike \u0026#8212; to have the same opportunity to benefit in this amazing success story that\u0026#8217;s called the state of Israel\u0026hellip;.. So this is something I\u0026#8217;m genuinely committed to. It\u0026#8217;s not something that I just say. We actually passed these budgets, and we don\u0026#8217;t just create budgets out of thin air. It always comes at the expense of something else. I thought this was important. So important that I was willing to prioritize it and put it in as part of our budgets, and I\u0026#8217;m very glad to see and to hear the Arab citizens of Israel say, \u0026ldquo;This is good! We want to be part of Israel. We want to be part of Israeli society.\u0026rdquo; Are there gaps? Sure. Are we closing those gaps?

And it rests with public opinion. And Israel has to continually make its case before American public opinion. It\u0026#8217;s generally been successful because the support for Israel has risen dramatically, and \u0026#8230; consistently, over the last 40 years. And it encompasses the vast majority of the American people. But we also have opposition. We also have a lot of vilification, a lot of stereotyping of Israel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTIME: You\u0026#8217;ve been a polarizing figure among American Jews.

What, more than any other prime minister that I know to incorporate the diaspora Jews, the Jews of the United States, and other countries, to make them feel at home in Israel. To make arrangements and such things as conversion, marriage. And then prayer sites. It always involves, because of our system, compromises. These are never perfect solutions. But I\u0026#8217;ve actually incorporated into law our communal responsibility with our fellow Jews abroad. So I\u0026#8217;m often described in some circles in the way that you describe, but it\u0026#8217;s not true. It doesn\u0026#8217;t reflect on \u0026#8212; it doesn\u0026#8217;t reflect my basic tendency.

What has made Israel \u0026#8212; what has challenged Israel\u0026#8217;s security is Iran\u0026#8217;s goal, one, to have nuclear weapons, which they intend to use to annihilate Israel. And second, their attempts to bring their Army or pieces of their Army into Syria, right in Israel\u0026#8217;s backyard with the express purpose of destroying Israel, with those forces.\u003cbr /\u003e\nWe have acted militarily against the Iranian attempt in Syria, and will continue to do so, because how would you act if you knew that somebody\u0026#8217;s coming, right next to your neighborhood, and pledges to bring missiles and other lethal weapons to kill you and destroy you? Obviously, you\u0026#8217;d try to stop them, which is what we\u0026#8217;re doing in Syria. And equally, we appreciate the fact that President Trump has put crippling sanctions on the Iranian economy because what we see is those sanctions are actually drying up some of the funds that go to this war front in Syria. We see that very, very clearly.

I think the hearing should come to nothing. If it doesn\u0026#8217;t, then an Israeli prime minister can serve or can ask for immunity for his period of service.

In the joint statement, the panels said the longer hearings \u0026#8220;will allow the American public to gain further insight into the special counsel\u0026#8217;s investigation and the evidence uncovered regarding Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and President Trump\u0026#8217;s possible obstruction of justice and abuse of power.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMueller has expressed his reluctance to testify and said he won\u0026#8217;t go beyond what\u0026#8217;s in his 448-page report. But Democrats have been determined to highlight its contents for Americans who they believe have not read it. They want to extract information from the former special counsel and spotlight what they say are his most damaging findings against Trump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDemocrats are expected to ask Mueller about his conclusions, including that he could not exonerate Trump on obstruction of justice after detailing several episodes in which Trump tried to influence the investigation. Mueller also said there was not enough evidence to establish a criminal conspiracy between Trump\u0026#8217;s presidential campaign and the Kremlin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne thing Judiciary members want to focus on in questioning Mueller is whether Trump would have been charged with a crime were he not president. Mueller said in a May news conference that charging a president with a crime was \u0026#8220;not an option\u0026#8221; because of longstanding Justice Department policy. But Democrats want to know more about how he made that decision and when.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA separate closed-door session with two of Mueller\u0026#8217;s deputies is expected to be canceled, for now.

A separate person familiar with that testimony said that the person is David Archey, the senior FBI official who was involved in Mueller\u0026#8217;s probe. That person also declined to be named because the committee had not announced it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe closed-door interviews with the deputies had appeared to be in doubt for several days after the Justice Department has recently pushed back on the arrangement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the hearing neared, members of both parties had complained about the lack of time for questioning. While every member of the smaller Intelligence panel was expected to be able to question Mueller, fewer than half of Democrats and Republicans on the Judiciary panel would have been able to do so in the original two-hour timeframe. At a separate hearing on Thursday, several Republicans complained about the setup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;I have been elected just like anyone else here,\u0026#8221; said Arizona Rep.

Doug Collins, said: \u0026#8220;I appreciate news the chairman has taken seriously the concerns Judiciary Republicans raised this week. The new format will allow all Judiciary Republicans to question the special counsel on July 24.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#8217;s unclear whether Mueller\u0026#8217;s testimony will give Democratic investigations new momentum. In the news conference, Mueller indicated that it was up to Congress to decide what to do with his findings. But Democrats have had little success so far in their attempts to probe his findings as the White House has blocked several witnesses from answering questions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat means the committees may have to go through a lengthy court process to get more information. Around 80 Democrats have said they think an impeachment inquiry should be launched to bolster their efforts, but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has so far rebuffed those calls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/time/topstories/~4/VWpX71zEJYE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/VWpX71zEJYE/","published":"2019-07-13T13:40:24Z","guid":"http://time.com/?p=5625942"},{"title":"Simona Halep Beats Serena Williams to Win Wimbledon","content":"\u003caside class=\"right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad\" id=\"right-rail__ad-5625954\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module\" data-src=\"https://time.com/5625954/halep-wins-wimbledon-serena-williams/\" data-widget-id=\"SB_2\" data-ob-template=\"timemag\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWIMBLEDON, England \u0026mdash; Simona Halep was not focused on trying to prevent Serena Williams from winning a 24th Grand Slam title.

When the notion of Russian influence on the 2016 presidential campaign was just starting to bubble up shortly before the general election, Trump told reporters in Florida “I never met Putin, I don’t know who Putin is.” He said the opposite in \u003ca href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-i-met-putin-got-along-with-him-great_b_587e80c6e4b06a0baf649111\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003e2015\u003c/a\u003e.

She had been partying for three days straight with her teammates, ever since the moment they won their second consecutive \u0026#8212; and fourth overall \u0026#8212; World Cup championship in Lyon, France. But the party was far from over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer left foot was propped high in the air, putting her left knee about parallel with her shoulder. The World Cup trophy was in her left hand, and resting atop her knee. In her right hand, was a bottle of champagne. She turned to her friend, Ashlyn Harris \u0026#8212; a back-up goalkeeper for the U.S. Women\u0026#8217;s National Team (USWNT) whose documentation of the group\u0026#8217;s post-victory celebration bender will go down in the annals of women\u0026#8217;s sports history \u0026#8212; and told the whole world through Instagram stories, \u0026#8220;I deserve this. I deserve this. Everything.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo some, this might be considered an off-the-cuff, light-hearted statement. But it was far from that. This was an earth-shattering declaration, a pointed rebuttal to everyone who has ever told women that their worth was tied directly to humility and modesty; a mantra for women everywhere who feel pressured to tone down their happiness to make others more comfortable, to turn down compliments or brush-off accolades. It was the opposite of, \u0026#8220;thank you,\u0026#8221; and a complete rejection of, \u0026#8220;I\u0026#8217;m sorry,\u0026#8221; a phrase that most women utter, on average, 100 times a day, often to nobody in particular, as they merely move around the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a motto that summed up the entire World Cup run of the USWNT. Three months before the tournament began, they sued U.S. Soccer for equal pay, taking the fight for equality onto the biggest stage in the sport. Once in France, they smashed \u003ca href=\"https://time.com/5621639/team-usa-2019-world-cup-records/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003erecord after record\u003c/a\u003e and celebrated with abandon at every turn \u0026#8212; drawing massive amounts of criticism for being too demonstrative about their happiness. They didn\u0026#8217;t apologize; they just kept winning, and sipping tea. And then, when the last whistle blew in Lyon, France, to solidify their 2-0 victory over the Netherlands in the final, they kicked off a globe-trotting, ass-shaking, champagne-soaked, expletive-laden party, which the players \u0026#8212; particularly Harris \u0026#8212; shared with the public on social media.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeing these women cussing and pouring champagne on one another, holding signs asking for beers, unapologetically flaunting their drunken happiness in public \u0026#8212; in a display that rivaled the shirtless shenanigans of J.R. Smith when the Cleveland Cavaliers won the NBA championship, or the over-the-top water-fountain antics of Alex Ovechkin when the Washington Capitals won the Stanley Cup Finals last year \u0026#8212; wasn\u0026#8217;t just entertaining; it was down-right inspiring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther elite female athletes acclaimed the champs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;I\u0026#8217;m kind of obsessed with them right now. I just can\u0026#8217;t. Like, they\u0026#8217;re so dope,\u0026#8221; Ariel Atkins, a second-year player for the WNBA\u0026#8217;s Washington Mystics, told ThinkProgress. \u0026#8220;They\u0026#8217;re not trying to flex for the media and trying to be like, all preppy and professional all the time. I mean, they are who they are, And that \u003cem\u003eis\u003c/em\u003e professionalism, being exactly who you are and showing people that athletes are humans too.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAtkins admitted that like the rest of the world, she\u0026#8217;s spent a lot of time over the last week watching Harris\u0026#8217;s Instagram stories. So has Sophie Cunningham, a rookie for the Phoenix Mercury.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;They are so badass. Having them go out there and being feisty the way they have been, it has been inspiring to me. For them to go out there, to see them having fun, now I want to win a championship so this team can experience that,\u0026#8221; Cunningham said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;They\u0026#8217;re not hiding who they are. They are themselves. I think that is so awesome for all women and men to see.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis all began on Sunday, after the confetti was cannoned and the trophies delivered, when the players got back to the tarp-covered locker room, put on their goggles, turned up the music, and started popping bottles. We got to see what it looked like, in real time, as the weight of the world was lifted off of their shoulders, and the women began to realize what exactly they had accomplished. The early mornings and healthy eating, the skipped parties and long workouts, the time away from family and friends and all the doubts that this team faced when it came to France, it had all been worth it. Heck, the President of the United States had even come after Rapinoe during the tournament, after a clip of her saying, \u0026#8220;I\u0026#8217;m not going to the fucking White House\u0026#8221; went viral, and the team only got stronger after that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo of course they partied. Alex Morgan twerked. Crystal Dunn chugged beer. Tobin Heath sang, \u0026#8220;We are the champions\u0026#8221; at the top of her lungs. Harris documented it all, and then turned the camera on herself and said, in instantly-iconic fashion, \u0026#8220;You\u0026#8217;re fucking welcome for this content, bitch.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\"\u003e\n\u003cp lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003eAshlyn Harris’ instastories are the best thing on the internet rn \u003ca href=\"https://t.co/JLDjftOSpj\"\u003epic.twitter.com/JLDjftOSpj\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026mdash; em (@East_From_Eden) \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/East_From_Eden/status/1147945901991911428?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"\u003eJuly 7, 2019\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cscript async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the locker-room celebration, the players went to an after-party, where they danced on the bar, took shots, and did a lot more shouting.

Tuesday, after waking up early to go to Good Morning America, they had a private roof-top player\u0026#8217;s-only pool party, and then took the party to a Yacht in the East River.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome how, on Wednesday morning, they were still standing and able to participate in the parade, which became about far more than their World Cup victory, and turned into a rally for equality. All along the parade route, fans held signs that read, \u0026#8220;Equal Pay.\u0026#8221; And the players \u0026#8212; who, it must be stressed, were surrounded by the U.S. Soccer officials they are suing during this celebration \u0026#8212; actually used their lawsuit as confetti during the parade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the players stood in City Hall \u0026#8212; still drinking \u0026#8212; and waiting to come out on stage for the speech portion of the program, Harris took to Instagram to show copies of the lawsuit in the trees outside, and strewn across the floor of City Hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;Our lawsuit is in the fucking trees,\u0026#8221; Harris said.

Diana Taurasi, a guard for the Phoenix Mercury and the WNBA\u0026#8217;s all-time leading scorer, said that because of the year-round demands on female basketball players, they never get the time to celebrate like the USWNT did this week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 1.1rem;\"\u003e\u0026#8220;We usually win something, and we never get to celebrate it.

Because the world never gets to see women let loose like this. Under every single social media post about these antics, there are floods of people calling the players classless, arrogant, and embarrassing, and scolding them for not being good enough role models for little girls everywhere. But the best part of the celebration was that is wasn\u0026#8217;t about anyone else; this team has worked so hard, not only to be the best at their craft, but to fight for equal pay for the next generation, and to stand up for the rights of women, the LGBTQ community, and minorities.

Given the dates of those atrocities, many of those women are now reaching the late stages of their lives, as are men who were impressed into wartime labor in Japanese factories to fight the Allies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLate last year, \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/29/world/asia/south-korea-wartime-compensation-japan.html\"\u003eKorea’s highest court ordered Mitsubishi\u003c/a\u003e to pay essentially reparations for the company’s use of slave labor throughout the Japanese occupation and World War II, a decision that mirrored the court’s earlier judgment against Nippon Steel \u0026amp; Sumitomo Metal a few weeks before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the Korean court system has attempted to claw back those reparations from Japanese companies, Japan has not sat still.

SK Hynix — another Korean company — was the second largest manufacturer of DRAM chips with a roughly 31% share. Samsung and other Korean manufacturers are also market leading in industries like semiconductors and LCD displays.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKorea’s electronics companies have deep supply chains in Japan, which produce everything \u003ca href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-southkorea-japan-laborers-analysis/supply-chain-pain-south-korea-chipmakers-and-their-suppliers-seek-to-bypass-tokyo-curbs-idUSKCN1U31GS\"\u003efrom photoresist chemicals and materials for semiconductors to the actual manufacturing equipment and parts required to operate factories\u003c/a\u003e.

While it has had a topsy-turvy few weeks, the stock price for Samsung Electronics is now almost back to where it was this time last year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn other words, Japan’s punch was more like a stimulus. Whoops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuch short-term gains may be amusing for trade policy watchers, but any returns are likely to be short-lived of course. And the news is much worse for semiconductors. \u003ca href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Samsung-s-advanced-chip-debut-risks-delay-after-Japan-crackdown\"\u003eAs the Nikkei Asian Review noted this week\u003c/a\u003e, “Any disruption in the supply of EUV photoresist — a coating product used in the extreme ultraviolet lithography vital to the most complex semiconductors — could set back Samsung’s plans to launch its 7-nanometer chips around the turn of the year.” The company has stockpiled some materials, but if the trade war extends from weeks to months, it will eventually have to succumb from the damage to its supply chain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of which is to say that what started as a trade spat might boil over into shrinking quantities of memory chips, displays, and next-generation semiconductors — in other words, pretty much everything you need to build a computer or smartphone today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are a couple of lessons for the tech industry here. First, while Silicon Valley and other tech regions enjoy a mostly ahistorical outlook, the antecedents of the world are always brimming just beneath the surface. The comfort women situation may seem tangential to the day-to-day challenges of building a hardware product, but politics — particularly visceral, human politics — has a way of interceding far from its remit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecond, even in a globalized world where national politicians lust for economic growth (and certainly Prime Minister Abe and President Moon are heavily invested in growing their respective economies), networked and cross-border supply chains are increasingly fragile. Just as \u003ca href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/20/u-s-mitigates-huawei-ban-by-offering-temporary-reprieve/\"\u003eHuawei discovered the dangers of relying on American technology\u003c/a\u003e over the past year, now Korean companies are learning about the dangers of depending on Japan’s high technology industry for critical components.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"embed breakout\"\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"QWyNL5tzaz\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/20/why-startups-need-to-be-careful-about-export-licenses-and-the-huawei-ban/\"\u003eWhy startups need to be careful about export licenses and the Huawei ban\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ciframe title=\"\u0026#8220;Why startups need to be careful about export licenses and the Huawei ban\u0026#8221; \u0026#8212; TechCrunch\" class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/20/why-startups-need-to-be-careful-about-export-licenses-and-the-huawei-ban/embed/#?secret=QWyNL5tzaz\" data-secret=\"QWyNL5tzaz\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThird, the development of 5G wireless technology standards and associated hardware devices just increasingly gets battered. The U.S. has specifically targeted Huawei over 5G, but Samsung also \u003ca href=\"https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-technology-provides-foundation-sprint-mobile-5g-network-chicago/\"\u003ehas 5G modems and network equipment underway\u003c/a\u003e, which are now threatened in Japan and South Korea’s trade war. As wireless technology has become essential to global commerce and entertainment the past few decades, the political importance of controlling this technology has increased dramatically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUltimately, what’s the resolution to this new trade war? Well, that’s part of the challenge. President Moon doesn’t want to agree to a quick truce, worrying that such a rapid negotiation would appear to be giving in to Japan’s demands — a symbolism that he is unlikely to accept. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Abe faces the opposite forces, with the Japanese government holding the line that all claims to reparations over the comfort women and wartime slavery were settled by the two countries’ bilateral trade agreement from the 1960s and other diplomatic agreements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet, both politicians need economic growth to succeed, and compromising their leading companies from selling their leading exports is not a route to that outcome. Both are principled leaders, but both are ultimately pragmatic. And so as it happens, it may not be the State Department that gets a deal over the line. No, maybe it’s time Tim Cook gets on his iPhone and talks about, well, iPhones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"feedflare\"\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=yZ-tjEyvw24:IctTIF7DcKQ:2mJPEYqXBVI\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=yZ-tjEyvw24:IctTIF7DcKQ:7Q72WNTAKBA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=yZ-tjEyvw24:IctTIF7DcKQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=yZ-tjEyvw24:IctTIF7DcKQ:-BTjWOF_DHI\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=yZ-tjEyvw24:IctTIF7DcKQ:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=yZ-tjEyvw24:IctTIF7DcKQ:D7DqB2pKExk\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=yZ-tjEyvw24:IctTIF7DcKQ:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=yZ-tjEyvw24:IctTIF7DcKQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/yZ-tjEyvw24\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/yZ-tjEyvw24/","published":"2019-07-13T14:20:48Z","guid":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=1855293"},{"title":"Startups Weekly: Zoom, Superhuman and small reactions to big scandals","content":"\u003cp id=\"speakable-summary\"\u003eHello and welcome back to Startups Weekly, a weekend newsletter that dives into the week’s noteworthy startups and venture capital news.

I\u0026#8217;m not here to share my own opinions on Zoom\u0026#8217;s security or lack thereof, what I\u0026#8217;d like to point out is the company\u0026#8217;s poor reaction to the PR nightmare. Yes, Zoom ultimately provided a fix, but initially, it failed to solve the underlying issue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZoom\u0026#8217;s major hiccup comes shortly after users and onlookers \u003ca href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/02/superbacklash/\"\u003eattacked the exclusive email service Superhuman\u003c/a\u003e.

They do this on your behalf, but without the permission of the recipient of your emails.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuperhuman was much faster than Zoom to offer an official response amid complaints. Just a couple of days after a blog post outlining security flaws within the service went viral, Superman announced it was going to remove location logging altogether, get rid of all existing location data, turn off read receipts by default and make them an opt-in feature for users. This is all nice and good and definitely shifted attention away from the key issue: Pixel-tracking (embedding the commonly used advertising tool of a “pixel” in emails to report back to senders info like whether an email’s been opened or not). Superhuman still has the exact same pixel-tracking capabilities, what\u0026#8217;s changed is that users just need to turn on the feature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"embed breakout\"\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"\u003e\n\u003cp lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIt may be recency bias, but I cannot think of a worse response to a security issue than what we\u0026#39;ve seen with Zoom over the past few days \u003ca href=\"https://t.co/qmTOc5XGr8\"\u003ehttps://t.co/qmTOc5XGr8\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026mdash; Greg Otto (@gregotto) \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/gregotto/status/1149085740422311937?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"\u003eJuly 10, 2019\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cscript async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStartups and public companies alike will do what they can to maintain features that benefit their businesses and will go to great lengths to shift consumer attention away from key issues, even when that means putting their own users at risk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyways\u0026#8230;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2019/\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTC Sessions: Mobility\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe hosted our first-ever mobility-focused conference this week in San Jose.

There is a reason it is hard to hire in Silicon Valley today, and it isn’t just that there are a lot of startups.

Now, with startups jumping to unicorn status in sometimes as short as a handful of months, that risk-reward ratio seems to be even more off-kilter for those early employees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it doesn’t just have to be a \u003ca class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/brex\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"brex\"\u003eBrex \u003cspan class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e-scale transformation either. The rapid increase in the size and valuation of series A rounds of financing the past three years means that engineers and salespeople who might have an employee number in the low double digits are suddenly seeing their options struck at a couple of hundred million in valuation. Exits, meanwhile, aren’t suddenly getting richer to compensate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started to notice this pattern over the past few weeks in the course of several conversations with software engineering friends of mine who had gotten excited about very early-stage companies — say, just a handful of employees — but who walked away from their offer letters due to already sky-high company valuations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, there is an argument to be made that joining these sorts of companies is precisely where the best opportunities lie. Sure, the valuations are already high, but these are startups with the financial resources and the backing that might allow them to compete effectively. So maybe the equity is smaller and more expensive, but ultimately, if the startup is more likely to be successful, the expected value function might actually be favorable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe. Yet it is also hard to see how these startups, which despite their rich valuations have barely laid any foundation for success, are a safer bet than a similarly-valued startup with years of experience under its belt and a growth strategy based upon dependable results. Even worse, early employees are perhaps taking even more financial risk, since the preference stack of the venture capital could mean that smaller exits are particularly unfavorable to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlus, the shrinking opportunity window for leading startups means that the difference in financial outcome between two early employees — what could be millions of dollars upon an exit — could have been decided based on who joined the week before the other. That doesn’t seem fair or right, but is increasingly widespread in our industry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs with most macroeconomic structural changes, there’s not much for anyone to do. Founders aren’t going to take lower valuations or less money just to make the lives of their early employees a bit more rosy, and certainly venture capitalists aren’t going to lowball their offers in a hyper-competitive investment environment. Indeed, the very excitement of a sudden unicorn may be the best attraction for candidates to hear a startup’s pitch and ultimately join.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut when it comes to that Silicon Valley dream of a nice house from a decent return on exit, it’s getting narrower and less widely-distributed. Blitzscaling is making a lot of people a lot of wealth, but early employees? Not so much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"feedflare\"\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Ip2i0p779jM:BKMDEg3nnbc:2mJPEYqXBVI\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Ip2i0p779jM:BKMDEg3nnbc:7Q72WNTAKBA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Ip2i0p779jM:BKMDEg3nnbc:yIl2AUoC8zA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Ip2i0p779jM:BKMDEg3nnbc:-BTjWOF_DHI\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=Ip2i0p779jM:BKMDEg3nnbc:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Ip2i0p779jM:BKMDEg3nnbc:D7DqB2pKExk\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=Ip2i0p779jM:BKMDEg3nnbc:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Ip2i0p779jM:BKMDEg3nnbc:qj6IDK7rITs\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/Ip2i0p779jM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/Ip2i0p779jM/","published":"2019-07-13T15:38:51Z","guid":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=1855298"},{"title":"Roblox EC-1, immigration requirements doubling, grief in the workplace, and cannabis startups","content":"\u003ch2\u003eThe Roblox EC-1\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"speakable-summary\"\u003eFollowing in the wake of our deep profiles of \u003cb\u003e\u003ca class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/patreon\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"patreon\"\u003ePatreon\u003c/b\u003e \u003cspan class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e and \u003cb\u003eNiantic\u003c/b\u003e, we have our next EC-1 package, this time on children’s gaming platform \u003cb\u003e\u003ca class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/roblox\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"roblox\"\u003eRoblox\u003c/b\u003e \u003cspan class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.

Assistant, Siri, Cortana, and Bixby. But how would people feel about personalities translating to automobiles, laptops and other household items? Would we want a single seamless personality across all devices, or would we prefer to build new relationships with each of these things? Would we want these things to understand and empathize with us? Do we really need these things to “feel” what we feel or do we just need the experience that they “get” us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHumans have an innate habit of anthropomorphizing objects around them, especially those that move, grow, or talk to them. As technological advances enable robotics and IoT devices with greater intelligence, humans are likely to assign personality to more devices that they interact with in their daily life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vacuum cleaner, which was once a simple tool, is now a Roomba with a cheerfully clueless personality as it makes happy chimes and bumps its way through the living room. And while replacing a standard vacuum cleaner is no big deal, many Roomba users demand that they get their exact same robot back from repairs and that it not be “killed” and scrapped for parts. They view it almost as a part of the family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTools on the other hand, are replaceable. And the more an intelligent system or piece of hardware feels like a tool, the more replaceable it becomes. In Star Trek, the crew doesn’t spare a second thought about replacing and upgrading the ship computer, which speaks to them in a monotonous disembodied voice because they view it as a tool. However upgrades or maintenance of Commander Data, an android crewmember, bring substantial concern because his human shape and personality make him feel alive and relatable. Further, studies have shown that humans are more likely to forgive mistakes if they are coming from a device that they view as “alive” whereas they have no such leniency for things they view as tools.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow does this apply to our future? Logically, a company concerned about improving retention and engagement, assigning a device a strong personality seems like an obvious way to capitalize on human anthropomorphization, and grant you leeway on bugs, while boosting retention and engagement. However, the real challenge is choosing how much personality to inject.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1273483\" title=\"sleepingrobot\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sleepingrobot-e1454681731820.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"624\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sleepingrobot-e1454681731820.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sleepingrobot-e1454681731820.jpg?resize=150,138 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sleepingrobot-e1454681731820.jpg?resize=300,275 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sleepingrobot-e1454681731820.jpg?resize=768,704 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sleepingrobot-e1454681731820.jpg?resize=680,624 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sleepingrobot-e1454681731820.jpg?resize=50,46 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePersonality Risk?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"m_4140862025551765628gmail-m_-28749614186499778gmail-page\" title=\"Page 2\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"m_4140862025551765628gmail-m_-28749614186499778gmail-section\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"m_4140862025551765628gmail-m_-28749614186499778gmail-layoutArea\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"m_4140862025551765628gmail-m_-28749614186499778gmail-column\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoing back to the cultural differences, having too much personality in a device can be a potential risk factor: some people may enjoy a new digital friend, but others may find the idea of a tool trying to be personable with them annoying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn extreme example of this can be found in the book (and movie) The HitchHiker’s Guide to the Galaxy where doors with “real people personalities” that sigh happily as people walk through them, which can get extremely annoying over time. However, designers today are already thinking about when to “tone down” the personality of their devices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDigital assistant designers today are cautious about how they use the assistant’s voice. For example, they are careful not to use the assistant’s voice for anything that could interrupt or otherwise irritate the end user, including alarms, timers, and even intercom broadcasts. Google Home lets users make outgoing phone calls, but not receive calls in (thus avoiding the assistant bothering you by ringing), and Amazon has been hesitant in its adoption of prompts or push notifications on Alexa. Major voice assistants have even started reducing how talkative they are. Google and Amazon have recently reduced the number of confirmation remarks for simple commands like “turn off the lights” to avoid users getting annoyed by hearing “okay, turning off the lights” when they just want to sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePersonality of Robotics\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobotics are an obvious place to inject artificial personalities, as humans already personify most robots. Researchers at Stanford are experimenting with methods of navigating human occupied spaces such as doorways and hallways with their Jackrabbot project. They use tones and gestures to display appeasement and frustration as it navigates in crowds of people. Other projects are even more direct in evoking emotion. Tombot robotics, for example, builds a golden retriever robot that acts as a support animal. Other companies are taking a horizontal approach: Embodied builds software designed to run on various robots to enable more lifelike and meaningful interactions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eImplications\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAttaching personality to consumer products can create a greater sense of connection to the devices that we use. This attachment can make the use of these devices more “sticky,” increasing engagement over the long term, and potentially boosting the attach rate of services. However, this may be a delicate line to navigate: products that have too much personality can irk users and cause them to abandon the product entirely. Tamagotchi is a notable example of this phenomenon. Best practice may be to simply have a slider that allows users to adjust how much personality they want in their devices: from utilitarian tool to best friend. That way, humans have control over their things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"feedflare\"\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Oi9DtjQ7olM:p1yzkMY6Kkc:2mJPEYqXBVI\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Oi9DtjQ7olM:p1yzkMY6Kkc:7Q72WNTAKBA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Oi9DtjQ7olM:p1yzkMY6Kkc:yIl2AUoC8zA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Oi9DtjQ7olM:p1yzkMY6Kkc:-BTjWOF_DHI\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=Oi9DtjQ7olM:p1yzkMY6Kkc:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Oi9DtjQ7olM:p1yzkMY6Kkc:D7DqB2pKExk\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=Oi9DtjQ7olM:p1yzkMY6Kkc:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Oi9DtjQ7olM:p1yzkMY6Kkc:qj6IDK7rITs\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/Oi9DtjQ7olM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/Oi9DtjQ7olM/","published":"2019-07-13T16:30:12Z","guid":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=1854735"}]},{"url":"https://www.theverge.com/rss/full.xml","items":[{"title":"Facebook’s $5 billion FTC fine is an embarrassing joke","content":"\u003cimg alt=\"Mark Zuckerberg is laughing at you\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qDSuAeFexZc4cHgCRQo52X9LOPw=/0x0:1014x676/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/64720728/mark-zuckerberg-theverge-stock-10_1020.0.jpg\" /\u003e\n\n\n  \u003cp id=\"cz9SOo\"\u003eFacebook’s stock went \u003cem\u003eup\u003c/em\u003e after news of \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/12/20692253/facebook-ftc-settlement-fine-5-billion-justice-department\"\u003ea record-breaking $5 billion FTC fine\u003c/a\u003e for various privacy violations broke today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"kelRUp\"\u003eThat, as the \u003cem\u003eNew York Times’\u003c/em\u003e Mike Isaac points out, is the real story here: the United States government spent months coming up with a punishment for Facebook’s long list of privacy-related bad behavior, and the best it could do was so weak that Facebook’s stock price went up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"mZelAi\"\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"\u003e\n\u003cp lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003ethe fact that fb shares surged instead of sank on the FTC news is the story \u003ca href=\"https://t.co/SztA1iAyOg\"\u003ehttps://t.co/SztA1iAyOg\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://t.co/qDrzaR8J4Q\"\u003epic.twitter.com/qDrzaR8J4Q\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e— rat king (@MikeIsaac) \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/MikeIsaac/status/1149784643731972097?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"\u003eJuly 12, 2019\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cscript async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"9F91re\"\u003eFrom some other perspectives, that $5 billion fine is a big deal, of course: it’s the biggest fine in FTC history, far bigger than the $22 million fine levied against Google in 2012.

The book opens with her defecting from the Imperial Navy, going through a Rebellion camp and eventually being processed back into their service. This isn’t a straightforward change of heart — while Quell wasn’t a fanatical believer in the Imperial cause, she rationalized her service as an Imperial pilot by deciding that the Emperor was at least keeping the galaxy from dissolving into chaos.

Military science fiction has a long tradition within the genre that explores this concept, but \u003cem\u003eStar Wars\u003c/em\u003e itself has largely steered clear of those tropes. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ZjTiQn\"\u003eIn many ways, books like \u003cem\u003eAlphabet Squadron\u003c/em\u003e and games like \u003cem\u003eBattlefront II\u003c/em\u003e have had the cumulative cultural experience of recent, real-world conflicts bubble in around the edges.

We could still be talking about episode 1 right now, analyzing where the series is going and what it’s exploring while our attachments to the characters grow.

Hit-and-miss horror auteur Alexandre Aja knows how to deliver lean, mean horror action. \u003cem\u003eCrawl \u003c/em\u003eis far less tongue-in-cheek than his \u003cem\u003ePiranha \u003c/em\u003eremake, but it doesn’t build to a fever pitch or deliver dynamite setpieces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"fO39zG\"\u003eIt does, however, maintain its tension in a way that outshines many of this year’s summer thrill rides. The setup is an ingenious hybrid of disaster movie and creature feature: College student Haley (Scodelario) drives to her old family home in the midst of a hurricane to make sure her dad (Barry Pepper), who hasn’t been answering his phone, is safe. She finds him gator-bitten and unconscious, and as their house floods, she realizes the alligators are pouring in along with the rainwater. Father and daughter must avoid both drowning and massive alligator teeth; much of the movie’s 87 minutes takes place in the rapidly flooding house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"I3TwOE\"\u003eThat limitation is a major asset.  \u003cem\u003eCrawl \u003c/em\u003ehas plenty of computer effects, but unlike so many movies whose reach exceeds their effects budget (especially in disaster-movie circumstances that seemingly call for large-scale destruction), it doesn’t require its characters to spend the entire movie in front of obvious green screens in a desperate simulation of epic scope. The weather effects are obviously computerized, but the house itself is a real set, flooded with at least some real water. When Haley first ventures into the basement to find her dad, Aja plays up the muck, gunk, and early hints of gore for all they’re worth. Because the set dressing feels so tactile, the movie creates a genuine sense of atmosphere in a potentially generic setting.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9EMgk1R0yoynlkj5ngJ-iDGfATI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18308227/crl27889r.jpg\"\u003e\n      \u003ccite\u003ePhoto: Paramount Pictures\u003c/cite\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"wOdu9o\"\u003eContent to explore its small-scale setting, the movie never drifts off into location-hopping weightlessness as Haley swims, jumps, and, yes, crawls around various tight passages and makeshift waterways. When the alligator bites come, they feel especially toothsome thanks to practical gore effects, and the stuntwork creates a more believable athleticism for its character—much moreso than stars who must be replaced by a CGI wire-frame cartoon every time they do something superheroic. If \u003cem\u003eCrawl\u003c/em\u003e doesn’t have a standout setpiece, it’s because the whole thing moves so quickly and efficiently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"bVBfYy\"\u003eThis includes the obligatory emotional backstory, which is basically a feature-length version of the “gymnastics” foreshadowing involving Malcolm’s daughter in \u003cem\u003eThe Lost World\u003c/em\u003e. Haley is a competitive swimmer. (Guess what stroke she specializes in?) Her dad is her former coach who may have pushed her too hard. Of course a bizarrely coordinated alligator attack turns into a proving ground for her swim skills, and maybe even a catalyst for family healing. This is all about as corny as it sounds, but like \u003cem\u003eThe Shallows\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eCrawl\u003c/em\u003e treats its lead character’s boilerplate with dignity, anchored by Scodelario’s no-fuss lead performance. It’s silly, sure, but it also has a pleasing clarity — nothing in this movie feels like it was frantically and haphazardly rewritten in the editing room. Alligators chase a resourceful swimmer; what’s to rewrite?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"MYEbeg\"\u003eYet even the studios that make movies like \u003cem\u003eCrawl\u003c/em\u003e don’t always seem to understand the relative blessings they have on their hands.

The Air Force, he says, will eventually be renamed as Space and Air Force. It appears as though this new command will replace France’s existing Joint Space Command, which is already responsible for France’s existing space assets, and coordinating with the militaries of other European nations. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"MLxr1U\"\u003eWhile it has the third-oldest space agency, France has begun to focus more on space in recent years. \u003ca href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2019/01/from-paris-to-orbit-frances-new-space-strategy/\"\u003eAccording to \u003cem\u003eBreaking Defense\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, the country plans to spend 3.6 billion euros between now and 2025, and in December 2018, it launched a new military reconnaissance satellite, the CS0-1, with more to follow in the coming years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"pMu30n\"\u003eIn recent years, a number of countries have begun to recognize space as a distinct “domain” of warfare — a distinct location or concept where warfare can take place, such as on land, sea, air, or space, or within digital systems.

The vehicles are expected to be smaller and faster than the crewed vehicles that the Army currently fields.

To build a network that reaches critical mass and generates significant returns, a startup has to convince other enterprises that its blockchain can provide the security, scalability, and resilience they expect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat means making it clear to enterprises how integrating the blockchain network will benefit them, as well as addressing the concerns that have prevented those organizations from it until now. If that\u0026#8217;s the position you\u0026#8217;re in, here\u0026#8217;s how to approach that conversation:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cb\u003e1. Address decentralization head-on.\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen startups create a blockchain network, they need to benefit from their investment and risk without retaining control over the blockchain solution they have built. That\u0026#8217;s because controlling the solution makes it just another software-as-a-service product, as opposed to an exact decentralized blockchain solution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first thing startups must do, then, is separate ownership from control. Ownership vs. Control can be difficult in the beginning of the business, when fewer parties are involved. However, it’s possible to start with centralized control and clearly define when that control will be moved to a governing body made up of a mix of users with different interests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cb\u003e2. Prioritize rules for data and logic.\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA well-designed governing body has the incentive to improve the network, grow the network, and create a fair return for all users. Fair return is only possible, though, if the network has rules for data management, code management, and node control as early as possible. It can only grow if everyone understands who owns and can analyze what data, and who can authorize changes in business rules and data logic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce data is provided, it’s difficult to change the rules on how it can be used, so startups must carefully consider foundational data policies as early as possible. Even if governance is more centralized at first, all of the network’s users should have some input in designing initial policies to meet their needs and expectations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cb\u003e3. Grow faster with trusted third parties.\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe core value of blockchain is the ability to identify high-value problems and solve them by bringing together the right parties. In that same vein, blockchain-based startups shouldn’t hesitate to consider what areas of their operations can be handled by new types of service providers who can help with many aspects of governance, blockchain network operations, smart contract creation, and auditing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllowing experienced third parties to handle these tasks gives startups more freedom to focus on users. That means more time to implement improvements and grow the network in ways that benefit everyone on it. Startups can prove that, unlike prior solutions, a well-governed blockchain network truly operates in the interest of its users.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cb\u003e4. Focus on boosting efficiency.\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlockchain technology offers a significant boost to productivity. Today’s enterprises mostly operate on software purchased from major vendors like SAP, Oracle, or Microsoft. When they work with business partners that have different systems, those systems don’t always agree on details like order fulfillment status and special pricing rules. When the details don\u0026#8217;t agree with each other \u0026#8212; the result is time wasted having to resolve exceptions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlockchain technology allows enterprises to radically simplify how they operate together. Using shared logic and data across the entire network eliminates the potential for variations and disputes. This feature alone makes transactions more efficient and delivers significant cost savings for every enterprise involved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cb\u003e5. Blockchain value shift value by eliminating intermediaries.\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile their reservations about blockchain sometimes hinder enterprises, they may also be hemmed into specific ways of doing things because of a lack of transparency or trust. In those cases, they may rely on a third party — a marketplace provider, for example — to overcome some of these issues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBold startups are taking on that status quo and offering new solutions built on blockchain that use a decentralized approach, eliminating the need for intermediaries. The \u003ca class=\"editor-link editor_tip\" title=\"\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/03/11/blockchain-metrics-will-add-transparency-to-investing-and-better-inform-investors/\" data-original-title=\"\"\u003eunparalleled transparency and trust\u003c/a\u003e that blockchain provides are creating new flexibility in how the business operates. The operations lead to value shifting from intermediaries to enterprises — and the customers who buy their products and services.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile blockchain startups have more challenges to face than more conventional companies, those that can navigate this new area and allow enterprises to be early adopters of this emergent technology will have a stake in some of the most valuable and long-lived business networks ever to be established.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe post \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\"

Department Agrees to Drop Charges in Sleazy Las Vegas Sting “Operation Bo-Tox”","content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cu\u003eThe FBI spent\u003c/u\u003e more than two years chasing alleged money launderers in Las Vegas and Florida as part of “Operation Bo-Tox,” a code name referencing the toxin used in cosmetic procedures to reduce wrinkles. But the case finally collapsed this week, when the Justice Department moved to drop all charges against the lead defendant, Emile Bouari, as part of a pretrial diversion agreement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to the FBI’s internal files, agents in 2014 believed that Operation Bo-Tox would expose a network of money launderers who ran weight loss, aesthetician, and other health and beauty businesses in Las Vegas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharles Ro, the FBI agent who supervised the undercover sting, described the case as an investigation of a “Middle Eastern criminal enterprise” — an apparent reference to Bouari, who was born in Lebanon and operated a weight loss clinic in Las Vegas. Bouari’s Lebanese heritage represented the case’s only connection to the Middle East.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"promote-embed\" data-related-post-number=\"1\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Justice Department’s capitulation in Bouari’s case is remarkable, given the time and resources the bureau invested and the fact that Bouari publicly acknowledged that he laundered money for the FBI’s undercover agents. But as his trial neared, Bouari had signaled to the DOJ that he intended to put the bureau itself on trial, delving into the agents’ dubious conduct and questioning whether they had legal authority to start the investigation in the first place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There were huge issues in how and why the FBI targeted me,” Bouari told The Intercept. “No probable cause. They came after me with a personal vendetta and in a highly invasive sting. The case would have revealed terrible issues of abuse of power.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs The Intercept described in \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/08/12/las-vegas-fbi-sting-diet-clinics-money-laundering/\"\u003ea feature story\u003c/a\u003e last year, the FBI invested heavily in Operation Bo-Tox, deploying an informant and an undercover agent in Las Vegas and sending them on two trips to Miami, where they hung out in strip clubs (FBI recordings captured the agent and informant discussing their sexual conquests and negotiating with a stripper). The agents’ efforts were intended to engage Bouari, who had no previous criminal history, and nearly two dozen of his friends and colleagues, in money laundering schemes. But after two years of undercover work, the FBI had nabbed only Bouari, his girlfriend Kimberly Milko, and a friend of theirs, Mary Green, who together allegedly laundered $590,000 and collected $52,900 in fees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Certain FBI agents led by Chuck Ro chased 21 innocent people, indicted four, imprisoned two, resulting in one dismissal and now this deferred prosecution,” Bouari told The Intercept.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonday\u0026#8217;s agreement, more than five years after the FBI first targeted Bouari, suggests that the Justice Department has come to view Operation Bo-Tox as largely a waste of time and resources. Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Knief told U.S. District Court Judge James C. Mahan the government had agreed to drop all charges against Bouari so long as he stays out of legal trouble for the next six months, holds down a job, and cooperates with a pretrial services officer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe charges against Milko and Green are still pending. Bouari’s brother Ghassan was also indicted with the group, despite not having been involved in any of the alleged financial transactions, and spent 18 months in pretrial detention before prosecutors dropped all charges against him in August 2017.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmile Bouari spent more than two years in detention because prosecutors claimed that he was a danger to the community. He was released on his own recognizance in May 2018, but the brothers’ businesses went under while they were in jail. (In February 2018, Ghassan Bouari \u003ca href=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nvd.128719/gov.uscourts.nvd.128719.1.0.pdf\"\u003esued\u003c/a\u003e the U.S. government and the agents involved in the case, alleging that his rights had been violated as a result of the government’s malicious prosecution.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe U.S. Attorney’s Office and the FBI office in Las Vegas did not response to requests for comment on Monday’s agreement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-center  width-fixed' style='width: 1000px;'\u003e\n\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-article-large wp-image-203766\" src=\"https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/08/emile-and-kim-1533671426-1000x750.jpg\" alt=\"emile-and-kim-1533671426\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"caption\"\u003eEmile Bouari and Kim Milko.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class='caption source' style=''\u003ePhoto: Courtesy of Emile Bouari\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eLove and Loathing in Las Vegas\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs The Intercept described last year, Bouari believed that the FBI’s decision to target him in an undercover sting resulted from “a love triangle,” according to a statement Bouari’s lawyer, Mont E. Tanner, made in a court.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBouari and Milko described to The Intercept how Paul Padda, a former federal prosecutor who is now a private lawyer in Las Vegas, had developed a flirtatious relationship with Milko during a period when she and Bouari had broken up. Bouari and Milko separately described how, after they had reconciled, Padda approached their table at a Las Vegas restaurant one night, pointed his finger at Bouari, and said, “I fucked your woman and she loved it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePadda has denied that this incident occurred; he has also denied having the relationship with Milko that Bouari and Milko described.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhatever the circumstances, there was bad blood between Padda and Bouari and Milko. Someone anonymously posted statements on the website Ripoff Report, describing Padda as “a real sleaze bag” and “a terrible attorney” who “has defended pedophiles.” In January 2014, Padda filed a defamation lawsuit over the statements, first naming “John Does” as defendants and then naming Bouari and Milko after he received subpoenaed records from their internet service provider.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin weeks of Padda filing his lawsuit, a short Moroccan man named Michel Benamar showed up at the FBI’s Las Vegas office with a story to tell: Benamar claimed that Bouari had embezzled $1 million from a business partner, though he couldn’t provide the name of the person who had purportedly been fleeced. Benamar also said that Bouari was willing to launder money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis tip was the only information the FBI had that Bouari was involved in criminal activity, and Benamar’s credibility was questionable. Just seven months earlier, Benamar had been arrested for writing four bad checks to Vegas casinos. In addition, Benamar had a $2.8 million civil judgment against him in Alabama for failing to pay back loans related to a vending machine business. Nevertheless, Ro, the FBI agent, made Benamar an FBI informant and launched Operation Bo-Tox.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"shortcode\" data-shortcode=\"newsletter\" data-campaign=\"\" data-cta=\"\" data-headline=\"\" data-layout=\"\" data-subhead=\"\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a sealed motion filed in November 2018 and provided to The Intercept, another lawyer for Bouari, William H. Brown, alleged that Padda had a previously unknown connection with Benamar. Before becoming an FBI informant, the motion says, Benamar had worked as an informant for Jason Hahn, a Las Vegas police detective-turned-private investigator, who is listed as “\u003ca href=\"https://www.paulpaddalaw.com/about-us/jason-hahn/\"\u003ea valuable asset\u003c/a\u003e” on Padda’s law firm’s website.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Emile Bouari believes (and has conveyed this to the government) that he was targeted by FBI Agent Charles Ro essentially at the behest, and for the benefit, of Ro’s friend (and former local AUSA) Paul Padda, and that in service of this vendetta another Padda friend/associate (former Metro Detective Jason Hahn) coordinated the planting of informant Michel Benamar to serve as a catalyst, and pretext, for the government’s investigation, and to entrap Bouari,” the motion said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Intercept could not independently verify Benamar’s relationship with Hahn, who did not respond to requests for comment. Padda and Ro know each other in “a professional capacity,” Padda’s lawyer Ryan J. Stonerock told The Intercept. Padda and Ro are both listed as advisers to the International Organization of Asian Crime Investigators \u0026amp; Specialists, a nonprofit organization that hosts an \u003ca href=\"http://www.ictoct.com/asian-organized-crime.html\"\u003eannual conference\u003c/a\u003e on transnational crime and terrorism, but Stonerock said that while Padda had agreed to do legal work for the organization, he had not attended any meetings or events and was not aware that he was listed as an adviser.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition, Padda would not describe what, if any, conversations he had with Ro about Bouari’s case. Neither Padda nor Ro responded to recent requests for comment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eProblem FBI Agents\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Operation Bo-Tox, Ro and his partner on the case, Dennis Lao, had a reputation as problem agents. In 2010, while assigned to the FBI’s office outside Los Angeles to investigate Asian organized crime, the pair traveled to the Philippines for an undercover investigation in which Ro posed as a broker for Mexican drug cartels interested in importing weapons and Lao as Ro’s bodyguard. The sting led to the arrest of three Filipinos for transporting weapons to the U.S., including assault rifles and grenade and mortar launchers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut witnesses told an investigator for the defendants’ lawyers that as they pursued the case, undercover FBI agents, including Ro, had spent money on alcohol and sex at a club in Manila that reportedly employed underage prostitutes. The FBI disclosed in court that agents had spent $14,500 in eight days in the Philippines, including $3,000 for a single evening at one strip club and other expenditures labeled “entertainment and cocktail (tips included).” One of the agents working with Ro and Lao testified in court that he had sex with an employee of the club and gave her $80 — but claimed the money was for her sick father, not payment for prostitution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn \u003ca href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/30/politics/read-women-lawsuit-fbi-gender-discrimination/index.html\"\u003ea recent class action

in a derogatory way with male trainees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe FBI did not respond to questions about Ro, who\u003ca href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/chuck-ro-9799a4176/\"\u003e

In a recent field test, the program worked with U.S. Marines at the Air Ground Combat Center in Twentynine Palms, California, to track progress on two complementary systems that allow infantry squads to collaborate with AI and autonomous systems to make better decisions in complex, time-critical combat situations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e“We are in a race with potential adversaries to operationalize autonomy, and we have the opportunity to demonstrate autonomy in a way that we don’t believe any nation in the world has demonstrated to date,” said Lt. Col. Phil Root (USA), the Squad X program manager in DARPA’s Tactical Technology Office. “Developing hardware and tactics that allow us to operate seamlessly within a close combat ground environment is extremely challenging, but provides incredible value.”\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe exercises in early 2019 in Twentynine Palms followed experiments in 2018 with CACI’s BITS Electronic Attack Module (BEAM) Squad System (BSS) and Lockheed Martin’s Augmented Spectral Situational Awareness and Unaided Localization for Transformative Squads (ASSAULTS) system. The two systems, though discrete, focus on manned-unmanned teaming to enhance capabilities for ground units, giving small squads battalion-level insights and intelligence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the most recent experiment, squads testing the Lockheed Martin system wore vests fitted with sensors and a distributed common world model moved through scenarios transiting between natural desert and mock city blocks. Autonomous ground and aerial systems equipped with combinations of live and simulated electronic surveillance tools, ground radar, and camera-based sensing provided reconnaissance of areas ahead of the unit as well as flank security, surveying the perimeter and reporting to squad members’ handheld Android Tactical Assault Kits (ATAKs). Within a few screen taps, squad members accessed options to act on the systems’ findings or adjust the search areas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBetween Lockheed Martin’s two experiments to date, Root says the program-performer team identified a “steady evolution of tactics” made possible with the addition of an autonomous squad member. They also are focused on ensuring the ground, air, and cyber assets are always exploring and making the most of the current situation, exhibiting the same bias toward action required of the people they are supporting in the field.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCACI’s BEAM-based BSS comprises a network of warfighter and unmanned nodes. In the team’s third experiment, the Super Node, a sensor-laden optionally-manned, lightweight tactical all-terrain vehicle known as the powerhouse of the BEAM system, communicated with backpack nodes distributed around the experiment battlespace – mimicking the placement of dismounted squad members – along with an airborne BEAM on a Puma unmanned aerial system (UAS). The BSS provides situational awareness, detects of electronic emissions, and collaborates to geolocate signals of interest.

For the CACI system, that included an opportunity to test the technology downrange to get real-world information, not simulation. At the most recent experiment with the BSS, service representatives used the system to locate and identify objectives in real time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor both systems, feedback has included a desire for a user interface so intuitive that training takes an hour or less and any available action is accessible in two screen taps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStaff Sergeant Andrew Hall with the Marine Corps Tactics and Operations Group (MCTOG), an advisory teammate to DARPA’s Squad X Experimentation program, says the ability to provide early input will guard against developing a product that either isn’t used or is used improperly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e“The feedback process, in conjunction with the actual experimentation, gives the Marines the ability to use the technology and start seeing what it can do and, more specifically, what it can’t do,” Hall said.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the conclusion of third experiment, the CACI system is moving into Phase 2, which includes an updated system that can remain continuously operational for five or more hours.

Hincks at his residence in Jerusalem on June 25. \u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe following excerpts from the \u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003econversation have been condensed and edited for clarity.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTIME: You are on track to surpass Ben-Gurion as the \u0026#8212; as Israel\u0026#8217;s longest-serving Prime Minister. How does Netanyahu\u0026#8217;s Israel look different from Ben-Gurion\u0026#8217;s Israel?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNETANYAHU: Well, it has some of the same elements and foundations. First of all, Ben-Gurion established the renewed sovereignty of the Jewish people in our ancestral homeland. That\u0026#8217;s an historic achievement. He also laid the foundations for the Israeli Army to guarantee that that reality persists. The way I\u0026#8217;ve tried to contribute to the country \u0026#8212; and I think it\u0026#8217;s changed dramatically \u0026#8212; is in the development of Israel as a global technological power. The rise of Israel among the community of nations is the rise of Israeli innovation and technology, both in the civilian field and the military and intelligence field. Israel has now become an important power in the world in these two leading respects.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTIME: What are the factors that contributed to that shift for Israel?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNETANYAHU: The most important one, and one that I\u0026#8217;ve fought for and worked hard for, is to open up Israel\u0026#8217;s economy, open it up to competition, open it up to the free movement of ideas and goods and people, open it up to success, and open it up to failure. Turning Israel into a free market economy I think was the second critical factor that made Israel the power, the rising power that it is among the countries. The first was the high intensity use of our most gifted men and women in our military for intelligence purposes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTIME: What can be done to help the millions of people who live in the Occupied Territories who haven\u0026#8217;t benefited economically or personally from that rise?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNETANYAHU: Well, I\u0026#8217;d separate Gaza from the West Bank, from Judea Samaria, because there the Palestinian economy is on a much better footing, probably double the per capita income that they have in Gaza. Gaza is basically controlled by Hamas, which is a militant Islamic organization that really doesn\u0026#8217;t allow any kind of real development to take place because they take all the money that comes in from international support \u0026#8212; and there\u0026#8217;s quite a bit of it \u0026#8212; and they put it into turning tunnels into a terror machine. Because militarily, we\u0026#8217;re in charge of the West Bank, we control the territory militarily. There\u0026#8217;s no siphoning off of money for that purpose. And in fact, it\u0026#8217;s doing better. I like to see more and more and more investments go to \u0026#8212; in the private sector \u0026#8212; go to the Palestinian areas for joint Israeli Palestinian efforts. Some of that is taking place any way. And I think what Jared Kushner and Jason Greenblatt has embarked in Bahrain could be tremendously beneficial to the Palestinians.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTIME: But the Palestinian officials wouldn\u0026#8217;t even show up in Bahrain for that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNETANYAHU: Let the markets do their thing. Because if we can get this ball rolling then I think it would enhance Palestinian lives, and I think it will also enhance peace. It\u0026#8217;s not a substitute \u0026#8212; economic development is not a substitute for political negotiations. It\u0026#8217;s not a substitute for political solutions but it sure makes it a lot easier, and I \u0026#8212; this automatic boycott by the Palestinians of a conference that is meant to give them a better life, and then to lay the foundations for political negotiations for peace, which is what the Trump plan is going to propose, I think that this automatic boycott is boycotting their own future.

And I separate that as a fact rather than as an ideological-political position. It\u0026#8217;s a fact. Half of Jerusalem is beyond the proverbial green line. The \u0026#8217;67 separation. Does anyone believe that we\u0026#8217;ll tear up half of Jerusalem? Nobody believes that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTIME: Many say the series of taking more and more of the steps off the table has driven the Palestinians away from the peace process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNETANYAHU: Oh, I don\u0026#8217;t \u0026#8212; they were offered everything, just about everything in Camp David in 2000, with President Clinton and the then Prime Minister Barak, and they walked away from that. They walk away each time. They walked away with Olmert. They walked away with Obama when President Obama and John Kerry wanted to propose a framework for negotiations. I said, you know \u0026#8212; I was reelected. I had my reservations, but I said, yeah, I\u0026#8217;ll go there. For peace, I\u0026#8217;ll be there and we\u0026#8217;ll negotiate. They wouldn\u0026#8217;t go there. So they walk away. They serially walk away from any negotiations that will present a workable peace. And a workable peace means \u0026#8212; it ultimately means compromise. They don\u0026#8217;t have to announce in advance what their compromise will be. I don\u0026#8217;t expect that from them, and they shouldn\u0026#8217;t expect it from us. But we should be able to get into a room and begin to discuss it. They refused to enter the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTIME: Retired Israeli generals have suggested that any sort of annexation of West Bank settlements would result in the collapse of security cooperation imposing incredible economic and security costs on Israel. Do you disagree that that\u0026#8217;s the case?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNETANYAHU: Well, listen, I heard the same thing about the Golan, that if the United States recognized our effective sovereignty over the Golan Heights, it would collapse any possibility of a process with Syria, and so on. It wasn\u0026#8217;t true then, it\u0026#8217;s not true here because the Palestinians themselves know that the areas \u0026#8212; which are by the way a very small part, the populated areas are a very small part of the West Bank of Judea and Samaria. That that\u0026#8217;s going to stay part of Israel. They know it. So let\u0026#8217;s stop the pretense. How about let\u0026#8217;s just talk straight, you know? If you want, if you are a maximalist and you demand, basically what you\u0026#8217;re really seeking is the dismantling of Israel, the dissolution of the Jewish state. Going back to the orchards of Jaffa or Akko, these are places \u0026#8212; Israeli towns on the seacoast \u0026#8212; and you really want to reverse the last 70 years of history, then you\u0026#8217;d take these positions, the maximalist positions that the Palestinians take. And nobody challenges it! In fact, they\u0026#8217;ve been pampered too long. The reason we can\u0026#8217;t get peace is because nobody goes to the heart of the problem, which is the persistent Palestinian refusal to recognize the Jewish state in any borders. And when I ask them, okay, will you sit down with us to negotiate such a compromise? And then they don\u0026#8217;t. And that has to be addressed and challenged. And I\u0026#8217;m glad somebody is doing it, or appears to be doing it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTIME: Former Prime Minister Olmert still insists that Abbas is the man to make peace.

It\u0026#8217;s not that they have exactly the same democratic functions that we have, but I don\u0026#8217;t intervene in the choice, in the process by which the Palestinian leadership comes to the fore. But let them come, let them negotiate. Why boycott? Why say no? No to Bahrain, an economic conference that is intended to bring billions of dollars of investment. Can you imagine this? Billions of dollars to the Palestinians, and no to the Trump plan before you\u0026#8217;ve even heard it? That\u0026#8217;s supposed to bring a political solution? How can you do that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTIME: First-year members of Congress, first-year Democrats, have been critical of Israel quite vocally recently. Representative Ilhan Omar said that Israel was an apartheid regime. What is your response to this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNETANYAHU: I think it\u0026#8217;s \u0026#8212; I think it\u0026#8217;s nonsense. But it\u0026#8217;s shameful nonsense because the one true democracy in the Middle East is Israel, the one country that ensures the full civic equality of its Jewish and non-Jewish citizens. Anybody can be in Israel. Everyone is equal under the law. Everyone has the right to be elected, and in fact, are elected to the Knesset, to the government. So a) the legal structure is the exact opposite of what she\u0026#8217;s describing, and it\u0026#8217;s only so in Israel. When you look around the Middle East, you see Christians being slaughtered, synagogues and churches being destroyed. Muslims of one sect destroying Muslims of other sects, and so on. The militant Islam and its firebrands are tearing the place apart. And this is what this representative has to say? Why is she not speaking out against the torture and hanging of gays in so many parts of the Middle East. In Iran. Why is she not speaking about the executions, the wholesale executions that go on in the marketplace inside Gaza against innocent Palestinians? Why is she not speaking about the way women are treated as chattel, not only enslaved but also murdered. I don\u0026#8217;t hear any of that in so many of the countries around us. She has to talk about Israel, the one place where we have, you know, where we have a woman Supreme Court Justice, and where we have women fighter pilots, and where we have women who are taking part in every realm, aspect of life? I mean it\u0026#8217;s just absurd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTIME: When you look at the economic data, Israeli Arabs have not benefited as much as other citizens of Israel from the economic boom. What do you have to say about that? What could be done?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNETANYAHU: Well, I\u0026#8217;ve been working very hard to change that. If you actually go beyond the \u0026#8212; all these stereotypes \u0026#8212; and you look at what we\u0026#8217;re doing, what my government has done is to take $15 billion shekels \u0026#8212; that\u0026#8217;s a lot of money in Israel \u0026#8212; and put it into a multi-year plan that has already had a measurable effect for improving the lives, and especially the infrastructure in the Arab sector. That\u0026#8217;s a massive amount of money for roads, for schools, for clinics, for transportation. Transportation is important inside the communities because if a woman, an Arab woman in Israel, an Arab citizen of Israel, a woman wants to go to work, it\u0026#8217;s very hard for her to get to work if she wants to go to \u0026#8212; have herself educated. She has to get there. And if she doesn\u0026#8217;t have her own private transportation \u0026#8211;. You have to take care of public transportation. I did! Well, look, can you imagine there wasn\u0026#8217;t any in Israel for so many years? We\u0026#8217;ve done the same in so many other fields, and I\u0026#8217;m glad because I want to see all of the citizens of Israel \u0026#8212; Arabs and Jews alike \u0026#8212; to have the same opportunity to benefit in this amazing success story that\u0026#8217;s called the state of Israel\u0026hellip;.. So this is something I\u0026#8217;m genuinely committed to. It\u0026#8217;s not something that I just say. We actually passed these budgets, and we don\u0026#8217;t just create budgets out of thin air. It always comes at the expense of something else. I thought this was important. So important that I was willing to prioritize it and put it in as part of our budgets, and I\u0026#8217;m very glad to see and to hear the Arab citizens of Israel say, \u0026ldquo;This is good! We want to be part of Israel. We want to be part of Israeli society.\u0026rdquo; Are there gaps? Sure. Are we closing those gaps?

And it rests with public opinion. And Israel has to continually make its case before American public opinion. It\u0026#8217;s generally been successful because the support for Israel has risen dramatically, and \u0026#8230; consistently, over the last 40 years. And it encompasses the vast majority of the American people. But we also have opposition. We also have a lot of vilification, a lot of stereotyping of Israel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTIME: You\u0026#8217;ve been a polarizing figure among American Jews.

What, more than any other prime minister that I know to incorporate the diaspora Jews, the Jews of the United States, and other countries, to make them feel at home in Israel. To make arrangements and such things as conversion, marriage. And then prayer sites. It always involves, because of our system, compromises. These are never perfect solutions. But I\u0026#8217;ve actually incorporated into law our communal responsibility with our fellow Jews abroad. So I\u0026#8217;m often described in some circles in the way that you describe, but it\u0026#8217;s not true. It doesn\u0026#8217;t reflect on \u0026#8212; it doesn\u0026#8217;t reflect my basic tendency.

What has made Israel \u0026#8212; what has challenged Israel\u0026#8217;s security is Iran\u0026#8217;s goal, one, to have nuclear weapons, which they intend to use to annihilate Israel. And second, their attempts to bring their Army or pieces of their Army into Syria, right in Israel\u0026#8217;s backyard with the express purpose of destroying Israel, with those forces.\u003cbr /\u003e\nWe have acted militarily against the Iranian attempt in Syria, and will continue to do so, because how would you act if you knew that somebody\u0026#8217;s coming, right next to your neighborhood, and pledges to bring missiles and other lethal weapons to kill you and destroy you? Obviously, you\u0026#8217;d try to stop them, which is what we\u0026#8217;re doing in Syria. And equally, we appreciate the fact that President Trump has put crippling sanctions on the Iranian economy because what we see is those sanctions are actually drying up some of the funds that go to this war front in Syria. We see that very, very clearly. So I think on the contrary, that\u0026#8217;s made us absolutely safer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTIME: If Iran starts stockpiling nuclear material beyond the JCPOA and other agreements, what kind of action are you willing to take?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNETANYAHU: We\u0026#8217;ll take whatever action is necessary to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTIME: Does that include an open strike on Iranian nuclear facilities?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNETANYAHU: Whatever action is necessary will be taken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTIME: Are those facilities too far underground to be impacted by strikes?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNETANYAHU: Let\u0026#8217;s consider what an intelligent journalist like you would consider an intelligent response to that.

But there\u0026#8217;s a very large majority, a very large part of the Israeli public that appreciates what we\u0026#8217;ve been doing for the country.

it?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBastille Day is a French national holiday, which marks the storming of the Bastille in the 1700s, and is known as La Fête Nationale Française in France.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimilarly to Independence Day \u0026#8211; every July 4 \u0026#8211; in the United States, the date marks the beginning of republican democracy and the end of tyrannical rule.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the 18th century, France was in deep economic and political crisis and people were unhappy with King Louis XVI\u0026#8217;s reign, which was dominated with food shortages and high taxes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Bastille was a medieval fortress and prison, which held many political dissidents, and had become a symbol of oppression and injustice in Paris.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn July 14, 1789, an angry mob stormed the Bastille and released the prisoners \u0026#8211; of which there were just seven at the time \u0026#8211; before stealing the weapons stored inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe invasion was significant at the time because it proved to revolutionaries that the King had little control over his armed forces and undermined his power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the beginning of what later became known as the French Revolution and the monarchy was eventually overthrown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKing Louis and his wife Queen Marie Antoinette were arrested and eventually executed \u0026#8211; along with other supporters of the royal family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBastille itself was completely destroyed \u0026#8211; and people took rocks to make mementos like bracelets and brooches \u0026#8211; and only a memorial stands on the site.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first Bastille Day celebrations took place on the first anniversary of the storming, in the spot where the Eiffel Tower now stands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe iconic landmark officially opened in 1889 \u0026#8211; exactly a century after the storming of Bastille and was built to celebrate the 100th anniversary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople danced in the street and flew the French flag \u0026#8211; a tradition still in place to this day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA politician named Benjamin Raspail proposed that July 14 should become a holiday in France in 1880.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#8217;s been held every year since to remember those who fought for freedom and justice in society.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_3939618\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"\u003e\u003cimg class=\"wp-image-3939618 size-thesun-article-image\"

Elaborating on his visit to Iran, he said later that Iran’s culture is impregnated with a love for cinema. He added Iran is the land of hospitable and kind people. According to Sean Penn, Iranians take to the streets when their national football team is set to play against other teams. He then talked about his earlier expectations of Iran and said he thought he would face an Islamic country with a dark situation and bearded men with black eyes before arriving in Iran. But the reality on the ground was totally different for him.

He made his third visit to Iran as a member of a tourist group recently. In a piece on his experiences in Iran during his second visit to the country, he said he felt surprised to see how much progress the country has made in a span of about 10 years.

‘Freeze for Freeze’ Plan Can’t Work for Long: Expert","content":"\u003cp\u003ePresident Emmanuel Macron\u0026#8217;s top diplomatic adviser, Emmanuel Bonne, recently made a trip to Tehran for two days of high-level talks, as European officials discuss ways to keep the nuclear pact alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eccording to European diplomats, options considered include a so-called freeze-for-freeze plan based on which Iran would stop ramping up its nuclear activities and the US would restore sanctions to the previous levels to allow dialogue to resume.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRahman Qahremanpour believes this plan is like a temporary break in a volleyball match, after which the players have to return to play again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn an interview with \u003cem\u003eEntekhab\u003c/em\u003e news website, he said “What Iran says is slightly different from what the French authorities say.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the French plan, it is said that the United States would extend the exemption for Iran\u0026#8217;s oil sales in order to allow Tehran to sell its oil to the three major buyers i.e. Japan, China and India. In return for that, Iran should stop its nuclear steps as they are and not develop them anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is a \u0026#8220;Freeze-for-Freeze\u0026#8221; rather than calling for lifting sanctions. Because the scope of the sanctions is very wide and includes sanctions by the Security Council and the initial and secondary sanctions of the United States, said Qahremanpour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If the reports are true, Macron had consulted with Donald Trump at the G20 summit before making this offer to Iran, and he also talked to President Hassan Rouhani after his talks with the President of the United States. It seems there is some kind of harmony between France and the United States, and perhaps the American side has expressed its satisfaction. In such a case, it is likely that the United States will also attend the EU Ministerial Meetings, which will be held on July 15, or will attend the meeting of the Joint Commission of the JCPOA and hold some meetings on its sidelines.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsked whether this could be a good solution in the current situation, the Iranian analyst noted such a project is like a break in a volleyball match, after which players have to return to play again. “We should wait and see how this comeback will be? Will this temporary break lead to direct negotiations between Iran and the United States, or would it lead to negotiations in the framework of the JCPOA? So far, there is ambiguity about this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is certain is that the freeze-for-freeze plan, if successful, cannot lead to negotiations between Iran and the United States in the short run. Although the Americans may attend the P5+1 talks, it should be borne in mind that this negotiation formula does not have any achievements for Trump. He cannot take advantage of such talks for his electoral goals, or claim that he has brought Iran to the negotiating table. This is a solution that satisfies both sides, but the point is that negotiations within the framework of the P5+1 will not necessarily lead to the abolition of primary and secondary US sanctions against Iran. Therefore, the least benefit of such negotiations is to preserve the status quo. This comes as Iran, in its macro policies, is looking to put an end to the current situation,” added Qahremanpour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to the analyst, the current impasse has simple solutions. One of these solutions is the return of the United States to the JCPOA. However, the US does not agree with this, saying that it wants to negotiate issues beyond the JCPOA. Meanwhile, Europe needs to take a serious decision and put pressure on Washington to force Trump to move back from its positions. Unfortunately, Trump wants to move unilaterally. But, naturally, Iran does not like to give concessions to such a person. Therefore, it is needed to come up with a solution which can keep Trump satisfied in his electoral campaign, and make Iran able to defend its positions inside the country.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTherefore, perhaps a dialogue within the framework of the P5+1 will be useful, if the United States is willing to give concessions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe post \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ifpnews.com/exclusive/frances-freeze-for-freeze-plan-cant-work-for-long-expert/\"\u003eFrance’s ‘Freeze for Freeze’ Plan Can’t Work for Long: Expert\u003c/a\u003e appeared first on \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ifpnews.com\"\u003eIran Front Page\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://ifpnews.com/exclusive/frances-freeze-for-freeze-plan-cant-work-for-long-expert/","published":"2019-07-13T09:11:50Z","guid":"https://ifpnews.com/?p=146308"},{"title":"‘US Seeks to Gain Control over Maritime Traffic in Persian Gulf’","content":"\u003cp\u003eThe United States assumes that by implementing such a plot it can control Iran\u0026#8217;s oil carrier ships in the Persian Gulf, Qassem Mohebali said in an interview with \u003cem\u003eEntekhab.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBritish authorities claim Iranian boats attempted to impede a British oil tanker in the Persian Gulf but were driven off by the HMS Montrose warship.

The IRGC navy said its forces were conducting their normal routines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In the past few days, especially after the seizure of a giant Iranian oil tanker by Britain, some Iranian officials talked of retaliatory moves, and even Iranian foreign minister called it a piracy,\u0026#8221; Mohebali added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course, the Americans are seeking to take control of the maritime traffic in the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden and the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait,” he noted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Their recent plan is to allegedly maintain the security of the ships and their traffic with a fixed flag.

Trump’s success as a president must be judged by his campaign promises which included the disbandment of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), building a wall at the US-Mexico border, leaving the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and ending the costly wars that U.S. had led all over the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e NATO\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\nOver his presidential campaign, Trump had said that NATO is an obsolete and dysfunctional treaty, but a few months after he entered the White House, he yielded in and officially accepted NATO’s article five.

Later, Yedioth Ahronoth, Israeli daily newspaper said the assassination was planned by Mossad and was carried out in cooperation with UAE’s intelligence service.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are many similar examples, in another one, we see that UAE’s secret service agent enters the Gaza Strip through Egypt, under the cover of a Red Crescent volunteer to spy on Hamas and Palestinian resistant groups in order to give information to the Zionist regime.\u003cbr /\u003e\nApart from activities against Palestinians, UAE has also tried to sabotage Muslim Brotherhood (Ikhwan Al-Muslimin) in Egypt through its media channels such as Al-Hayat, Al Youm Al Sabee, and Al-Masry Al-Youm. Furthermore, UAE gave full financial support and security help to certain groups in order to topple Muslim Brotherhood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUAE is a big supporter of Egypt’s current government. The country keep spending billions of dollars to carry out Zionists’ plans in Middle East and suppress any democratic movement in the region that is based on public votes and people’s determination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn example of UAE’s interference in Libya is the story of Yusef Mobarak. He was arrested in Al-Aqiq Airport in Tripoli after the intelligence service of Libya’s Government of National Accord accused him of taking pictures from high-security centers and foreign embassies in Tripoli. After investigations, it was revealed that Yusef was a main link to Khalifa Haftar, the renegade military commander of Libya, and was particularly supported by UAE and Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, Egypt’s president.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone knows that UAE’s army has given modern weapons and high-tech tanks to Khalifa Haftar and has supported the renegade commander against Tripoli. UAE’s interference in Libya is aimed at keeping the country entangled in wars and chaos, so that Libya can become a heaven for the intelligence services of the United States, Israel and UAE.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUAE has also been seriously interfering in Tunisia. The country is putting enormous political and economic pressure on Tunisia to expand its control over it and crush all the public movements. They have forced Tunisia to choose between surrendering to UAE and suffering under a security crisis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYemen is another country that is crushed by UAE’s interference. UAE has done a dirty job in Yemen by destroying Yemen’s infrastructures and killing thousands of innocent Yemeni citizens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe octopus of UAE has extended its claws to Oman as well. Oman intelligence service discovered an Emirati spy network that was supposed to predict and influence what happens in Oman after Sultan Qaboos. The network was trying to make strong bonds with anti-government tribes such as Al Shuluh tribe which has close relationships with UAE, especially with Ras al Khaimah emirate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother UAE spy network was discovered in Turkey and brought shame to Emirati leaders. According to Turkish media, UAE was trying to support some of the government dissidents and army commanders including Fethullah Gülen. Turkish intelligence service also discovered that Mohammed Dahlan entered Turkey under a fake identity and by using an Emirati passport. In this secret trip, he had meetings with the opponents of Turkish government.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUAE is also trying to expand its reach to the Islamic Republic of Iran as well. The country has already given financial support and intelligence to some terrorist cells that worked against Iran. Once again, UAE’s efforts to interfere in Iran was proved when it was revealed that Global Hawk drone was sent to Iran from an Emirati base.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApart from having a destructive role in Middle Eastern countries, UAE is quickly expanding its relationship with the Zionist regime. Now, Zionists have representative offices in Abu Dhabi and can freely travel to UAE.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll these facts show that Al Nahyan family and specially Mohammed bin Zayed, the Crown Prince of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, are the main causes of war in Arab World and division among Muslims.
