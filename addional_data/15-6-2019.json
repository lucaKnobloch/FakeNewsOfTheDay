However, what made this dinner party different was that the key talking point-- terpenes (more on that later)--was something about which this group of seasoned foodies knew very little. And what made it memorable was that a leading voice in the culinary industry showcased how cooking with cannabis can elevate cuisine even in the absence of a high.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough it takes plenty of moving parts to assemble a restaurant, cannabis has the rare opportunity to create sweeping changes across the entire hospitality industry. The incorporation of cannabis products into the dining room given its devoted fan base can have a serious economic impact on a restaurant's bottom line, not to mention impact the dining experience. The National Restaurant Association recently released a \u003ca href=\"https://restaurant.org/research/reports/foodtrends\"\u003ereport\u003c/a\u003e finding that almost 77% of chefs surveyed chose drinks and food infused with cannabis and cannabidiol (CBD) as the top two trends in the industry for 2019.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, before restaurants and guests can officially embrace this plant without fear of retribution, federal and state officials will have to agree on a plan--a process that has proven thus far to be extremely complex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThe Law (As of Today)\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt's unsettling to think the meal you are eating could have you entering a plea by the end of the night, but the legality of consuming cannabis is a topic of debate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) in accordance with the \u003ca href=\"https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/21cfr/21usc/811.htm\"\u003eControlled Substances Act\u003c/a\u003e (CSA) currently classifies marijuana--the dried leaves, flowers, stems, and seeds from the hemp plant \u003cem\u003ecannabis sativa\u003c/em\u003e--as an illegal, S\u003ca href=\"https://www.dea.gov/drug-scheduling\"\u003echedule 1\u003c/a\u003e drug.

Research suggests cannabinoids interact with the human endocannabinoid system (ECS) and can trigger various physical responses in individuals, such as a sense of relaxation or reduced inflammation. However, they do not make people high, unless they are being activated by THC. Like other plants, there are plenty of ways chefs can prepare them, with some of the most popular infusions coming in the way of oils, butters, and honey. A cannabis-focused dinner might also include the stems, seeds, and flowers from the plant in order to provide a full sensory experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo matter what food or drink you're enjoying, portion size should come into play, and that especially rings true when consuming edible cannabis products with THC, which are typically measured in milligrams. \"The fact of the matter is that everyone's endocannabinoid system is different,\" Burkons explains. \"What's just right for one person may be too much for another, and not do a thing for somebody else. But when guests don't know yet where they land on that scale, or what type of cannabis experience they prefer, the industry standard is \"start low, go slow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOften, people who ingest THC might not feel the effects until 45 minutes to an hour later, so there's a significant responsibility on servers to explain all of the necessary information in order to ensure the safety of all guests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhere to Make a Reservation: Private Dinners, Neighborhood Joints, and\u0026#8230;Consumption Lounges?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe legal complexities of the cannabis industry as they stand have made incorporating cannabis into restaurants difficult. \"Businesses may feel the pinch of limited banking services most acutely, as federal laws strongly discourage federally chartered institutions from providing essential banking services to anyone within arms reach of a cannabis plant, \" says Andrew Aamot, president and CEO of Colorado's \u003ca href=\"https://www.stravacraftcoffee.com/\"\u003eStr?va Craft Coffee\u003c/a\u003e, which makes a CBD-infused coffee that it distributes to restaurants and cafes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause of these constraints, hospitality professionals that are involved with cannabis have chosen to pursue the private events route like Altered Plates, or partner with companies that make cannabis-related products in order to showcase them at their place of business. Though chefs might not be actually making cannabis dishes in their own kitchens just yet, several restaurants have given their guests a sense of what might be expected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"inline-image-default-width aligncenter\"  \u003e\u003ca href=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/alexander-stein-watermelon-margarita-2-cc-alexander-stein.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg data-attachment-id=\"2649747\" data-permalink=\"http://fortune.com/longform/how-to-eat-drink-cannabis/alexander-stein-watermelon-margarita-2-cc-alexander-stein/\" data-orig-file=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/alexander-stein-watermelon-margarita-2-cc-alexander-stein.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"2880,1920\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{\u0026quot;aperture\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;credit\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;camera\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;created_timestamp\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;copyright\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;focal_length\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;iso\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;shutter_speed\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;title\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;orientation\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Alexander-Stein-Watermelon-Margarita-2-(CC-Alexander-Stein)\" data-image-description=\"\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Watermelon margarita with Azuca hemp infused syrup at Bubby\u0026#8217;s.

That is why an alternative solution has been discussed by members of the cannabis hospitality industry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMuch like Prohibition unintentionally gave rise to speakeasies, the idea of dedicated cannabis-friendly consumption lounges is appealing to some members of the community.

For over ten years, the MPVA has also been conducting an analysis of water quality across the peninsula in different water catchments, dams, and streams that feed into, and are used by vineyards. Finally, as instances of phylloxera--a vineyard disease that has been responsible for wiping out entire wine regions throughout history--have been discovered in other parts of Australia, studying rootstock and phylloxera-resistant vines is of high importance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"inline-image-medium-width aligncenter\" style=\"max-width:683px;\" \u003e\u003ca href=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/polperro_200-e1560179480602.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg data-attachment-id=\"2647893\" data-permalink=\"http://fortune.com/longform/australia-mornington-peninsula/polperro_200/\" data-orig-file=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/polperro_200-e1560179480602.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"2000,3000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{\u0026quot;aperture\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;2.8\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;credit\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;camera\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;Canon EOS 5DS R\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;created_timestamp\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;1493741823\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;copyright\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;focal_length\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;85\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;iso\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;320\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;shutter_speed\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0.0025\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;title\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;orientation\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Polperro_200\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/polperro_200-e1560179480602.jpg?w=200\" data-large-file=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/polperro_200-e1560179480602.jpg?w=683\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-2647893\" src=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/polperro_200-e1560179480602.jpg?w=683\u0026#038;h=1024\" alt=\"\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/polperro_200-e1560179480602.jpg?w=683\u0026amp;h=1024 683w, https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/polperro_200-e1560179480602.jpg?w=1366\u0026amp;h=2048 1366w, https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/polperro_200-e1560179480602.jpg?w=100\u0026amp;h=150 100w, https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/polperro_200-e1560179480602.jpg?w=200\u0026amp;h=300 200w, https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/polperro_200-e1560179480602.jpg?w=768\u0026amp;h=1152 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"image-caption\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"credit\"\u003ePolperro Wines\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vast majority of wineries are still family-owned and family-run. larger corporations haven't invested in the Mornington Peninsula for a myriad of reasons. Existing plots are small: the average size of a vineyard in this area is 3.9 hectares (9.6 acres)--compared to Australia's Barossa Valley, where the average vineyard size is 17.6 hectares (43.5 acres). Furthermore, a scarcity of land means there isn't much room to grow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrape prices also deter companies seeking to create a scalable business. One metric tonne (1.1 U.S. ton) of Pinot Noir grapes in the Mornington Peninsula is worth AUD $3,266 (U.S. $2,278) on average, compared to AUD $2,078 (US $1,450) in the Yarra Valley, another Australian region known for Pinot Noir. In turn, the wines themselves are pricey: $50 to $80 per bottle on average.

About 5% of the company\u0026#8217;s workforce is is \u0026#8220;truly remote,\u0026#8221; says Paul Wolfe, senior vp of global human resources. \u0026#8220;People want flexibility. Technology affords us that flexibility,\u0026#8221; he adds, noting that the desire for flexibility is not a generational thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWorking from home is \u0026#8220;\u003ca href=\"https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/why-working-home-future-looking-technology\"\u003ea future-looking technology\u003c/a\u003e,\u0026#8221; Stanford Graduate School of Business professor Nicholas Bloom told the TEDxStanford audience in 2017. \u0026#8220;I think it has enormous potential.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn research Bloom did with a Shanghai-based corporation fo 20,000 employees, he found a 13% improvement in performance by those who worked at home. The factors that led to the productivity boost included spending less time commuting and more time working, along with an enhanced ability to concentrate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026#8217;s also this bonus perk: \u0026#8220;Resignations at the company dropped by 50% when employees were allowed to work from home,\u0026#8221; noted Bloom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eCommunication is key\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe key to making the relationship with remote staffers work? Communication.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;There are so many ways to communicate today,\u0026#8221; says Wolfe. But, he adds, the best way to build a solid foundation for future communication is to get to know your employees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026#8217;s no better way to do that than with face-to-face interaction. Yet of the eight member of Wolfe\u0026#8217;s team, seven work remotely. So Wolfe gets his team together twice a year for in-person meetings, relying on team-building exercises like volunteering to help the team members get to know each other better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUltimately that helps team members understand tone in messages, instead of imagining what\u0026#8217;s being left unsaid. For example, team members will come to better understand that Emma goes quiet when she is stressed or that Sven is at his best when he is brainstorming with other team members.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;Face-to-face and voice-to-voice is the most important,\u0026#8221; Wolfe says. \u0026#8220;You can pick up body language and intonation.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWolfe admits that he\u0026#8217;s prone to sending a quick message via Google\u0026#8217;s chat program, leaving a lot to interpretation, but the in-person meetings help keep misinterpretation at bay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;We\u0026#8217;re all human beings at the end of the day,\u0026#8221; he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eStaffing for success\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen looking for new remote team members, there are specific skills hiring managers should seek out, says Wolfe. For example, look for motivated self-starters with good time management skills, as well as the ability to think through projects, set clear milestones, and meet deadlines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey also need good communication skills but \u0026#8220;that goes both ways,\u0026#8221; he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe best way to find those workers is paying attention during the interview process, Wolfe adds. Ask questions, like how they think through feedback before passing it along and, definitely, what forms of communication they prefer. The boss can\u0026#8217;t always be the driver. Relationships are always about compromise, and that includes bringing everybody\u0026#8217;s communication style to the team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThe right tool for the job\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith so many different communications tools, which is the best one to use? The answer largely depends on the situation. For instance, Wolfe recommends starting every project with a video meeting, where milestones can be set. Then have a weekly email or other set communication so everybody knows where things stand, and what needs to be done. It\u0026#8217;s also vital to establish owners for tasks and establish clear objectives, he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for that video meeting (or any other form of technology put into play), Wolfe suggests that every member of the team--even those who work together in the same office--dial in individually. That helps avoid the desire to go on mute and have side conversations. \u0026#8220;Everybody is on the same level playing field,\u0026#8221; says Wolfe. If individual dial-ins aren\u0026#8217;t possible, he recommends that the facilitator must make sure to engage remote workers in the video call by asking them by name if they have questions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eNo employee left out\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#8217;s almost a given that water cooler conversations and desk drive-bys when employees are in an office together make it easy to share quick hits of inspiration or changes to projects. But don\u0026#8217;t leave remote workers out in the cold on the information that pops up in these impromptu talks.

At $100, this bottle is undervalued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"inline-image-default-width aligncenter\"  \u003e\u003ca href=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/bruichladdich-bottle-bruichladdich-islay-barley-6yo-d2011-r2018-700-whitebg-e1559831873728.png\"\u003e\u003cimg data-attachment-id=\"2645587\" data-permalink=\"http://fortune.com/2019/06/15/best-scotch-whisky-whiskey/bruichladdich-bottle-bruichladdich-islay-barley-6yo-d2011-r2018-700-whitebg/\" data-orig-file=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/bruichladdich-bottle-bruichladdich-islay-barley-6yo-d2011-r2018-700-whitebg-e1559832121382.png\" data-orig-size=\"2064,2250\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{\u0026quot;aperture\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;credit\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;camera\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;created_timestamp\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;copyright\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;focal_length\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;iso\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;shutter_speed\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;title\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;orientation\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Bruichladdich-Bottle-Bruichladdich Islay Barley 6YO D2011 R2018 700 WhiteBG\" data-image-description=\"\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Bruichladdich Islay Barley\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/bruichladdich-bottle-bruichladdich-islay-barley-6yo-d2011-r2018-700-whitebg-e1559832121382.png?w=275\" data-large-file=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/bruichladdich-bottle-bruichladdich-islay-barley-6yo-d2011-r2018-700-whitebg-e1559832121382.png?w=939\" class=\"wp-image-2645587 size-large\" src=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/bruichladdich-bottle-bruichladdich-islay-barley-6yo-d2011-r2018-700-whitebg-e1559832121382.png?w=939\u0026#038;h=1024\" alt=\"\" width=\"939\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/bruichladdich-bottle-bruichladdich-islay-barley-6yo-d2011-r2018-700-whitebg-e1559832121382.png?w=939\u0026amp;h=1024 939w, https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/bruichladdich-bottle-bruichladdich-islay-barley-6yo-d2011-r2018-700-whitebg-e1559832121382.png?w=1878\u0026amp;h=2048 1878w, https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/bruichladdich-bottle-bruichladdich-islay-barley-6yo-d2011-r2018-700-whitebg-e1559832121382.png?w=138\u0026amp;h=150 138w, https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/bruichladdich-bottle-bruichladdich-islay-barley-6yo-d2011-r2018-700-whitebg-e1559832121382.png?w=275\u0026amp;h=300 275w, https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/bruichladdich-bottle-bruichladdich-islay-barley-6yo-d2011-r2018-700-whitebg-e1559832121382.png?w=768\u0026amp;h=837 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 939px) 100vw, 939px\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"image-caption\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"caption\"\u003eBruichladdich Islay Barley\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"credit\"\u003eBruichladdich\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eBruichladdich Islay Barley 2011 ($65)\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe distillers at Bruichladdich (that's \"Brook-laddy\") talk about whisky the way winemakers talk about wine, and for good reason.

Regardless of how you feel about the final seasons of the series, no one is eager to see this watch ended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"inline-image-default-width aligncenter\"  \u003e\u003ca href=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/craigellachie-33_lifestyle-e1559832241966.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg data-attachment-id=\"2645588\" data-permalink=\"http://fortune.com/2019/06/15/best-scotch-whisky-whiskey/craigellachie-33_lifestyle/\" data-orig-file=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/craigellachie-33_lifestyle-e1559832241966.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"3000,2121\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{\u0026quot;aperture\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;credit\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;camera\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;created_timestamp\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;copyright\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;focal_length\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;iso\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;shutter_speed\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;title\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;orientation\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Craigellachie 33_Lifestyle\" data-image-description=\"\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Craigellachie 33\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/craigellachie-33_lifestyle-e1559832241966.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/craigellachie-33_lifestyle-e1559832241966.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2645588\" src=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/craigellachie-33_lifestyle-e1559832241966.jpg?w=1024\u0026#038;h=724\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"724\" srcset=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/craigellachie-33_lifestyle-e1559832241966.jpg?w=1024\u0026amp;h=724 1024w, https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/craigellachie-33_lifestyle-e1559832241966.jpg?w=2048\u0026amp;h=1448 2048w, https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/craigellachie-33_lifestyle-e1559832241966.jpg?w=150\u0026amp;h=106 150w, https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/craigellachie-33_lifestyle-e1559832241966.jpg?w=300\u0026amp;h=212 300w, https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/craigellachie-33_lifestyle-e1559832241966.jpg?w=768\u0026amp;h=543 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"image-caption\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"caption\"\u003eCraigellachie 33\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eCraigellachie 33 Years Old ($3,000)\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.caskers.com/craigellachie-23-year-old-single-malt-scotch-whisky/?gclid=Cj0KEQjw8-LnBRCyxtfMl-Cbu48BEiQA6eUMGuCC_DuuvbFtzCK2Z8RQ9im5RvwXTMmCS1bMuZSW0W4aAm3D8P8HAQ\"\u003eCraigellachie\u003c/a\u003e remains relatively unknown to many consumers despite its having produced quality scotch whiskies in Speyside since the late 1800s, largely because most of those whiskies end up in various blended whiskies. That all changed in 2014 when Craigellachie began rolling out a series of limited release single malts under its own name, aged 13, 17, and 23 years. In December, Craigellachie capped the series with a somewhat brash 33-year-old, a uniquely punchy expression from a region better known for light and floral. With only 1,700 bottles produced in total, it's the kind of bottle serious scotch collectors covet, but there are still about 100 bottles available at retail (we checked). If the $3,000 price tag comes in a bit too high, the $300 23-year-old's collision of vanilla, baking spices, tropical fruits, and wafting campfire smoke make it the perfect (and more accessible) cornerstone bottle for any home whisky bar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eMore must-read stories from \u003c/span\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003eFortune\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003e:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003e--Move over ros?, \u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/2019/05/31/hard-seltzer-drinks-rose/?utm_campaign=fortunemagazine\u0026amp;utm_source=twitter.com\u0026amp;utm_medium=social\u0026amp;xid=soc_socialflow_twitter_FORTUNE\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003ehard seltzer\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003e is the new drink of summer\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003e--The \u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/2019/06/09/wine-country-tasting-rooms/\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003ewine country tasting room is dead\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight:400;\"\u003e.

Does it start with the art or the ingredient?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsually it's a little more organic. I'll walk around to the art, and then I'll sit down and try to gain inspiration. Sometimes it mimics the look, like when our pastry chef did pulled sugar to look like our custom Dale Chihuly blown-glass sculpture. Other times it might not mimic the look as much as a texture or feel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLynn Boggess has this cool style where he uses acrylic, and he uses so much paint that it comes off the canvas because it's so thick. He does all nature paintings. One is vibrant green and has a lot of texture, and I wanted to have that same feel of textures of green. I came up with a dish that reminded me of that painting, and we serve it on a green plate. When you take a bite you kind of connect with the art.

We have these custom wood bowls by Jason van Duyn, who harvests his wood locally and also makes bowls for our 62-degree poached-egg dish with grits from heirloom red corn that we grow.

Sea grapes are one of the more unusual things I've brought in. It's like salty seaweed caviar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDo you have \"aha moments\" when you finally figure out how to interpret a work of art?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0026#8217;t figure out an entr?e for this season. You can't just have courses here and there without any synergy. You need a progression; you want peaks and valleys in your flavor profiles. The entr?e idea came to me at night. Charles Walker's \u003cem\u003eWashington Park\u003c/em\u003e series--\u003cem\u003eXLIV, XLV, XLVI\u003c/em\u003e--is three paintings side by side, all similar but all different. That inspired me to do three preparations of a dish, so each person gets lamb three ways--lamb loin, lamb belly, and lamb consomm?. When I thought of this in the middle of the night, I picked up my phone and took notes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow long does it take you to come up with a new season of the Art Tour?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes I'll start working two months out. We have all menu concepts done a month before rollout, which gives the servers time to study. We give them multiple tests before they step on the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYour servers are becoming docents.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey like it. It gives them another arsenal to work with. The guests don't know what they're getting beforehand. There's a small easel with stock cards for each course, showing a photo of the painting or sculpture. Then the server explains the inspiration and connection with the food. Some people see food as art anyway. After dinner they can walk around the hotel and see it in person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhen you look at fine art now, are you always thinking about what it looks like on a plate?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes.

There\u0026#8217;s a set of virtual buttons for movement directions, attacking, and defending. The twist comes in the form of a timer bar at the top of the screen which is slowly running out of time from the moment you start. So, while you may feel compelled to take your time exploring, it\u0026#8217;s in your best interest to hurry the heck up, because if that timer runs out before you make it to the exit of a floor, your game is over. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaking matters worse is that any wrong movement will penalize you by taking a chunk out of the timer bar. That means if you accidentally move forward into an enemy instead of pressing the attack button, you now have less time to make it to the exit. Rack up multiple mistakes on a single level, and well, you\u0026#8217;re pretty much screwing yourself. Compounding all this is that as you progress in the game the actions required become more complex, so while a bat on level 1 takes a single swing of an axe, a later enemy may require you to swing your sword, then defend with your shield, then swing your sword again. Obviously because you\u0026#8217;re also under a time crunch, these seemingly simple actions become all the more vexing as the pressures mount and each mis-tap costs you another chunk of your already limited time. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"clear:both;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"video-responsive\"\u003e\n\t\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z1eItK8eCg8\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this way \u003cem\u003eSprint RPG\u003c/em\u003e is more akin to something like \u003cem\u003eTimber Man\u003c/em\u003e or \u003cem\u003eThe Firm\u003c/em\u003e or even many rhythm games, as it\u0026#8217;s not necessarily the action itself which is challenging, but performing the action under the intense pressure of the clock while you\u0026#8217;re slowly devolving into full-blown panic mode is where the difficulty lies.

I was borderline obsessed with \u003cem\u003eTiny Tower\u003c/em\u003e back in the day, as was most everyone I knew, and I\u0026#8217;ve been a huge fan of LEGO ever since I was old enough to step on them with bare feet. This just seemed like a match made in heaven. Then last month we noticed that \u003cem\u003eLEGO Tower\u003c/em\u003e was \u003ca href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2019/05/14/lego-tower-available-for-pre-order/\"\u003eavailable for pre-order on the App Store\u003c/a\u003e with an expected release date of July 1st. Well, if you\u0026#8217;re not patient enough to wait a couple of weeks, then you can actually check out \u003cem\u003eLEGO Tower\u003c/em\u003e a bit early as this week NimbleBit released the game as an open beta on Testflight and the Google Play Store. Just \u003ca href=\"https://toucharcade.com/community/threads/lego-tower.397188/\"\u003ehead over to our forums\u003c/a\u003e to find the link to the beta and you\u0026#8217;ll be on your way!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"clear:both;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"video-responsive\"\u003e\n\t\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hvXCGZhn-qo\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026#8217;ve only just started playing the beta of \u003cem\u003eLEGO Tower\u003c/em\u003e, and I\u0026#8217;m already getting obsessed all over again. This is like the ultimate \u0026#8220;Just one more [insert blank]!\" video game as you build new floors, hire new staff, and collect just a staggering amount of pieces to customize your LEGO Minifigure. If you weren\u0026#8217;t a fan of the pixel art of the previous \u003cem\u003eTiny Tower\u003c/em\u003e games, you\u0026#8217;ll be happy to see the shiny high-resolution artwork in \u003cem\u003eLEGO Tower\u003c/em\u003e, where many of the floor themes are actually based on real life LEGO sets, which is just indescribably cool. So if you\u0026#8217;re a \u003cem\u003eTiny Tower\u003c/em\u003e addict like so many of us and you just can\u0026#8217;t wait then check out the open beta of \u003cem\u003eLEGO Tower\u003c/em\u003e today, otherwise look for the official launch on July 1st.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://toucharcade.com/2019/06/14/lego-tower-open-beta/","published":"2019-06-15T00:38:17Z","guid":"https://toucharcade.com/?p=254221"}]},{"url":"https://www.nintendolife.com/feeds/latest","items":[{"title":"Feature: The Making Of The PC Engine, The 8-Bit Wonder That Took On Nintendo","content":"","url":"https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/06/feature_the_making_of_the_pc_engine_the_8-bit_wonder_that_took_on_nintendo","published":"2019-06-15T13:00:00Z","guid":"https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/06/feature_the_making_of_the_pc_engine_the_8-bit_wonder_that_took_on_nintendo"},{"title":"Random: Have We Been Missing A Zelda Easter Egg In Mario 64 All These Years?","content":"","url":"https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/06/random_have_we_been_missing_a_zelda_easter_egg_in_mario_64_all_these_years","published":"2019-06-15T11:00:00Z","guid":"https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/06/random_have_we_been_missing_a_zelda_easter_egg_in_mario_64_all_these_years"},{"title":"Talking Point: What Are You Playing This Weekend?

For many establishment Democrats of a certain age—say, those who are now eligible for Medicare—the lesson from that time is clear: Impeaching Bill Clinton was a bad idea that hurt the presidency, the country, and most of all, the House Republican majority.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eHow Pelosi handles the growing calls from her caucus to begin removal proceedings against Donald Trump will illuminate the degree to which she herself believes that lesson. But as she struggles to manage pressure from roughly a quarter of House Democrats, interviews with some of her old friends and colleagues, and others who were in the trenches of the Clinton impeachment battle, offer a window into Pelosi’s reluctance to pull the pin on that particular grenade just yet. For now, she seems to be keeping her options open, waiting to see whether Congress can unearth new allegations that might shift public opinion.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e“I know Nancy, and I know that she’s thinking to herself and saying, \u003cem\u003eGoal No. 1 here is beating this guy\u003c/em\u003e,” said former Representative Tom Downey of New York, who has been close to Pelosi for years. “Once you do impeachment, that’s all we’ll do. It will dominate the news, back and forth.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/02/nancy-pelosi-has-emerged-best-anti-trump-leader/581953/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: The second coming of Nancy Pelosi\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e“I think it was a disaster for the Republicans,” said former Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, who was a senior member of the House Judiciary Committee and a fierce Clinton defender at the time of the impeachment vote, in December 1998. “I was strategizing about how I was going to defend the unpopular position of not impeaching Clinton” when the Republicans decided to move ahead, Frank told me, bringing the GOP under widespread attack “for being too partisan, for destabilizing the country, for being antidemocratic.”    \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eDrew Hammill, Pelosi’s deputy chief of staff, told me she was too busy to talk about her own takeaways from the Clinton impeachment. But the House speaker has hardly kept her broader views a secret, making it clear that she prefers to have the relevant House committees continue their investigations into Trump’s potential misdeeds, and pressing the courts for access to documents and witnesses as needed in the face of the White House’s stonewalling. She hasn’t totally ruled out impeachment, but unlike some of her colleagues, she has been wary to commit. “Well, it’s not off the table,” Pelosi \u003ca href=\"https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2019/06/11/nancy-pelosi-trump-impeachment-raju-intv-nr-vpx.cnn/video/playlists/top-news-videos/\"\u003etold\u003c/a\u003e CNN’s Manu Raju on Wednesday. “I don’t think you should impeach for political reasons, and I don’t think you should not impeach for political reasons. It’s not about politics. It’s not about Democrats and Republicans. It’s not about partisanship. It’s about patriotism to our country.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWhat Pelosi surely has in the back of her mind is how, in the ’90s, impeachment essentially put an end to the GOP policy agenda. “Their brand became impeachment,” said Jake Siewert, who was the deputy press secretary in the Clinton White House when the House Republicans voted on articles of impeachment. “That’s all they were known for. It actually elevated the loudmouths in their party because they were the ones who went on TV.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e“To the extent the GOP had a policy agenda—which they had, in the wake of the ‘Contract With America,’ as a party of ideas—it just became an anti-Clinton party,” Siewert added. “I think that, in and of itself, was a heavy price to pay.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThere are important legal and political differences between 1998 and today. Then, the special prosecutor Kenneth Starr, operating under different authority from Robert Mueller, showed nothing close to Mueller’s circumspection in his final report on the Lewinsky affair. Indeed, against the guidance of some of his own advisers, Starr delivered what amounted to a count-by-count indictment of Clinton to Congress, which even a majority of House Democrats voted to release to the public in its entirety, sight unseen. The immediate effect was that more than 65 major newspapers called on Clinton to resign, with the \u003cem\u003eLos Angeles Times\u003c/em\u003e denouncing him as “a middle-aged man with a pathetic inability to control his sexual fancies.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eBut the ultimate reaction to the numbing litany of lewd details in the report was an overwhelming public backlash against Starr and the Republicans, which was only exacerbated by the release of Clinton’s own videotaped grand-jury testimony, in which he largely came off as a steady and sympathetic responder to the prosecutors’ relentless questioning.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe biggest lesson of the Clinton impeachment proceedings—the one that is surely not lost on Pelosi—is the purely political one. On the day the House GOP impeached Clinton, public support for the president stood at only about 35 percent—roughly comparable to Trump’s \u003ca href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/\"\u003e40-odd percent\u003c/a\u003e approval rating in the polls now. Following the Senate’s acquittal of Clinton by a wide margin, the president’s overall approval rating \u003ca href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/116584/presidential-approval-ratings-bill-clinton.aspx\"\u003eremained at about 60 percent\u003c/a\u003e through the rest of his time in office.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eMy colleague Ronald Brownstein \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/06/did-clintons-impeachment-actually-hurt-republicans/591175/?utm_source=feed\"\u003ehas argued\u003c/a\u003e that the political damage to the Republicans has been overstated in hindsight. That yes, the party lost five House seats in the 1998 midterm elections (the first time since 1834 that a second-term president had gained seats in a midterm during his sixth year in office, as Brownstein notes), and another two in 2000, but it still retained control of the House majority. What’s more, Republicans won the presidency two years later, in part, on the strength of George W. Bush’s pledge to “restore honor and dignity” to the Oval Office. However, as Downey told me, that argument understates the essential narrowness, even the luck, of Bush’s slender win. After all, he lost the popular vote to Al Gore, prevailed by just 537 votes to win in contested Florida, and ultimately took office after a one-vote victory in the Supreme Court.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/06/impeachment-trump-chabot/591340/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: A Republican explains why Clinton was guilty and Trump is not\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e“I believe the Democrats’ goal generally is to defeat Trump, so the political [reality], in my view, has got to govern, and I think for Pelosi, it does,” said one veteran Democratic lawyer involved in the Clinton impeachment, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of their continuing work for the Clintons. “The minute Trump was impeached, there’d be a Senate trial set in one month, and a vote three weeks after that. He could say, ‘They charged me, and I’m cleared.’ Better, I think, to go the ballot-box route,” the lawyer said. “If he wins, you can move forward with impeachment in a second term. But I really think the final lesson, for me, is you move forward now, you really are going to be handing Trump a victory at the worst possible time.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eFrank echoed that thought. “What Pelosi starts with,” he said, “is, \u003cem\u003eWe’re not getting rid of Donald Trump\u003c/em\u003e, so what is the effect of a very partisan impeachment? The outcome would be as partisan as it was in the Clinton case, and I think that motivates Nancy … I think Pelosi realizes there are better issues that can dominate” Democrats’ offensive against Trump, such as the economy and health care. She also likely realizes, Frank told me, “that impeachment will be a problem for Democratic candidates—not everywhere, but in districts that are in the middle.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWhat is all but impossible to convey to anyone who was not in the thick of the action 20 years ago is the surreal nature of the whole impeachment process. In the middle of his Senate trial, Clinton delivered his annual State of the Union address to a packed joint session of Congress, making no mention of the storm enveloping him and instead pledging to use some $2.7 billion of a projected budget surplus to buttress Social Security.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e“Clinton was an entirely different guy” from Trump, recalled Carol Browner, who was the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency in those days. “In the middle of the impeachment fight, he didn’t take the bait. The order of the day was to just keep doing your job.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eSiewert said the cadre of Democrats pressing Pelosi for a quick move to impeachment risks jeopardizing the party’s broader appeal. “Congressional Democrats are still new to power,” he said. “They don’t have a strong, publicly defined policy agenda at the moment, so if the party spends the next year just trying to impeach the president, that risks becoming what the party stands for.” Perhaps Pelosi worries that will become \u003cem\u003eall\u003c/em\u003e it stands for.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/JDcXQQeuzSo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/JDcXQQeuzSo/","published":"2019-06-15T11:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-591652"},{"title":"From Public Shame to the Courtroom","content":"\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe writer Jon Ronson once observed that every day in the social media era, “a new person emerges as a magnificent hero or a sickening villain.

Like countless undergraduates of all races, classes, genders, and generations, they hoped to leave with alcohol but weren’t yet of age to purchase it legally.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eA fake I.D. was produced and rejected.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIn the moments that followed, Allyn Gibson, the owner’s son, would try to keep the fake I.D., pursue the male student who used it as he fled to the back of the store, chase him into the street yelling “shoplifter,” and detain him even as the other students, who were women, attempted to intervene on behalf of their friend. Soon, Oberlin police arrived and arrested the three undergraduates. A police report accused them of trying to shoplift two bottles of wine. Many classmates jumped to the conclusion that they’d been mistreated and launched protests almost immediately.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e“Chants of ‘No justice, no peace’ reverberated across campus from early morning into late last night as hundreds of protesters lined West College Street, calling for a boycott of Gibson’s Bakery,” the student newspaper \u003ca href=\"https://oberlinreview.org/11713/news/students-call-for-gibsons-bakery-boycott/\"\u003ereported\u003c/a\u003e. “According to a flyer distributed by protesters, this incident was far from Gibson’s first instance of alleged racial bias.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe same article quoted a black employee of the store who dismissed racism as a motive. “If you’re caught shoplifting, you’re going to end up getting arrested,” he said. “When you steal from the store, it doesn’t matter what color you are. You can be purple, blue, green, if you steal, you get caught, you get arrested.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIt is easy to understand why some college students would reflexively side with their peers, especially early on, as conflicting eyewitness accounts spread by hearsay across the small campus. The student government passed a resolution calling for the university to “cease all support, financial and otherwise,” of the bakery, which had a longstanding contract with Oberlin’s food services vendor.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eLater, when the male student was charged with felony robbery rather than shoplifting, even as his fake I.D. suggested at the very least that his initial intent was to make a purchase, many at Oberlin perceived a miscarriage of justice and wondered if race played a role in the charging decision. That, too, is easy to understand.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIf this was merely a matter of hasty student protests going too far before all the facts emerged, the eight-figure lawsuit would not have been warranted.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eBut the jury heard a story in which adults at Oberlin chose to fuel the mob’s excesses while pandering to its false narrative.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThat the narrative was suspect should have been obvious almost immediately. Administrators were present at early legal hearings where the male student offered to plead guilty to misdemeanor theft, a plea deal that David Gibson, the bakery’s owner, explicitly approved. (A judge rejected the deal, citing student protests at Oberlin and the bad precedent that could result from the perception of reducing the chagres under pressure.

(The same association has also caused gender studies to be targeted by the far left, who believe that support for the subject from the EU, which they believe has a capitalist agenda, has compromised the field.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp bis_size='{\"x\":50,\"y\":3037,\"w\":672,\"h\":203,\"abs_x\":242,\"abs_y\":5202}'\u003eIn countries where few people speak English, the strategic use of the word \u003cem bis_size='{\"x\":50,\"y\":3069,\"w\":53,\"h\":23,\"abs_x\":242,\"abs_y\":5234}'\u003egender\u003c/em\u003e underscores the notion of a meddlesome Western construct.

An election committee of 1,200 people, usually with pro-Beijing leanings, selects the chief executive. This has meant that since the 1997 handover, the Chinese Communist Party has loomed large over politics here.

There is an existential feel to the demonstrations here—unlike in 2014, when they demanded universal suffrage to choose the chief executive, Hong Kongers are not fighting for greater freedoms; they are instead fighting to keep the remaining freedoms they have.

I always feel like there are multiple sparks, and then they conjoin, and then you have a match, and then hopefully it becomes a torch. But I can tell you some of them. One is that I came upon an out-of-print book of essays by Alexander Woollcott, who was of course one of the Algonquin round-table figures, and a critic and columnist for \u003cem\u003eThe New Yorker\u003c/em\u003e.

She was very open talking to me about the five abortions that she’d had in the course of her life—something she spoke about with absolutely no regret or remorse whatsoever—the dozens of lovers that she had, the various venereal diseases that she had, the time that Milton Berle bought her a car.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe primary focus of her life was unbridled sensual exploration. She never married, never had kids. She still lives in the same apartment that she moved into in 1952. And when I asked her, “Did you ever regret not getting married and not having children?” she just rolled her eyes and said, “Who the hell wants to have sex with the same guy for 60 years?” Except she didn’t say “have sex”; she used a much more vulgar term.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eO’Leary:\u003c/strong\u003e A lot of the action is set at the Lily Playhouse, and there is a tension between catering to the working-class neighborhood audience and creating this great big show. It made me wonder how much you think about your very fervent audience and what they want from you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGilbert:\u003c/strong\u003e I think you’re referring to Aunt Peg in the book, my protagonist’s aunt who runs a really shabby, rundown, almost-burlesque theater in Midtown. [It’s] just far enough away from the bright lights of Broadway to not be glamorous, and just close enough to 10th Avenue to be serving the working-class people of Hell’s Kitchen. She’d also done the same thing during [World War I] for soldiers. She’d come out of the war with a feeling that people are very stressed and in a lot of pain and they need diversion and I’m here to provide it.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo I feel like this book is my version of this. At a time that’s not dissimilar to how people were feeling in 1940; there’s a tremendous cloud of dread hanging over the entire dumpster fire of the world right now. I don’t know anybody who’s not stressed and anxious and depressed. What I wanted to give at this moment is a book that would go down like a tray of champagne cocktails and give you a little bit of diversion.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen I wrote \u003cem\u003eThe Signature of All Things\u003c/em\u003e, for instance, I really did want to write a big, serious, epic, intellectual novel. I knew that I would lose a lot of my readers by doing that and I was okay with that. I feel like my readers and I don’t owe anything to one another.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eO’Leary:\u003c/strong\u003e Really?

And the reason I know that is because they often don’t. They bought millions of copies \u003cem\u003eEat, Pray, Love\u003c/em\u003e, but they bought dozens of copies of \u003cem\u003eCommitted\u003c/em\u003e, the book that came after it, because they didn’t want that one. I couldn’t make them if I tried. Likewise, I feel great love and intimacy for them and the interactions that we have, but I don’t feel like I owe them anything either. I should create the work that I want to create and they’re welcome to come along with it if they want to.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eO’Leary: \u003c/strong\u003eI want to ask you about the Brave Magic retreat that you and Cheryl Strayed have done. There was a \u003ca href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/brave-magic-elizabeth-gilbert-cheryl-strayed-only-black-person_n_5bc4e9b7e4b0fed45beb7b4a\"\u003epiece\u003c/a\u003e by a writer named Laura Cathcart Robbins in \u003cem\u003eHuffPost \u003c/em\u003eabout being the only black woman there.

And I was really glad that she wrote it, because it was thoughtful and important. It was an awakening for me as well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eO’Leary\u003c/strong\u003e: How so?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGilbert:\u003c/strong\u003e It was ... God. There’s a limit to how much I want to talk about this, in a way, and it’s only because I don't think we need white people talking about white privilege that much. But I will say that it’s changed the way that I’m operating. It was a tricky situation because it was an open registration event. We set aside a number of scholarship tickets for people who could apply based on need. It was in Northern California, which is very white, at the Redwoods, which is very white. Our readers are very white.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere’s also something problematic about me saying black women should love my work. But I was distressed by the same exact thing that the woman who was there was distressed by, and I was really grateful that she wrote about it. I’ve been working with my speaking agent and the people who I create these events with to try to figure out how to remedy that. A lot of it is just about going to different locations. So for instance, how about I don’t do that retreat in Napa Valley? Why don’t I go to Jackson, Mississippi, instead and just bring it to a different audience?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI’ve also, in the last year, been doing that exact same retreat for free at various nonprofit organizations. And there is also something problematic about assuming that the reason that there weren’t black women in the audience is because it cost too much.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI’m trying to create events where I can take my spotlight and put it on somebody who might not have the spotlight that I have, and create more diversity not just in the audience, but on the stage. All of this is stuff that I’m working toward remedying; it’s an imperfect science. But what she said needed to be said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eO’Leary: \u003c/strong\u003eI’ve noticed that in your work and in your reflections on life, you treat things like Ideas and Grief with capital letters, as their own things that exist and don’t necessarily belong to you. Can you explain that concept?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGilbert: \u003c/strong\u003eThe simplest way to explain my general world view is it’s kind of pagan. I think that everything is animate and everything has consciousness and will. I don’t think it is a metaphor. When I speak about [an idea] having will and consciousness, it comes and gets your attention and kind of uses you, almost parasitically, to make itself come into being.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt seems to make it easier to do that work … you’re a little bit off the hook. It’s kind of [like], “I can make bigger leaps of faith because I believe that a lot of [life] is a mystery and that it’s not all coming from me.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eO’Leary: \u003c/strong\u003eYou used the phrase “off the hook.” I wonder if there is the potential to abdicate responsibility for one’s own emotions and experiences by using this as an animating philosophy. Does it let you skate through life without thinking about the consequences and maybe how they affect other people?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGilbert:\u003c/strong\u003e I don’t think life itself will let you do that. I think when you’re out of integrity, you’ll find out very quickly because exactly that will happen: You’ll get hurt or other people will get hurt and the consequences will rain down upon you and you’ll know it. So there’s a sort of a self-correcting mechanism in there. Also, I think that I have a tremendous amount of reverence for creativity itself, and for the privilege that I have to engage with it, and so the responsibility that I feel is to show up at the very highest possible level that I can. That’s how I remain responsible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eO’Leary:\u003c/strong\u003e The book also wrestles with the idea of being a person of honor and not turning away from your mistakes.

I do fall in love a lot, thank goodness. I put a lot of myself out there in the world. But I behave with honesty, and I think all addiction is based on dissembling and lying, and I can’t do that anymore. Not for very long, anyway, without finding myself in a lot of pain.

I don’t have any rules about it, actually. I wouldn’t know how to set them. I don’t have a social media manager. I’ve never had a meeting with an expert about how to do this. I just share when I’m ready to share, and I couldn’t even begin to tell you what the calculus is for that other than just deciding that it’s time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eO’Leary:\u003c/strong\u003e I was looking back through \u003cem\u003eEat, Pray, Love\u003c/em\u003e, [and] I wonder if, for you, it feels like a book of a person in her 30s, where your 30s are consumed with who you are and making it true, and your 40s are like, “Oh, my back hurts and I don’t really care what anyone thinks of me.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGilbert: \u003c/strong\u003eI hadn’t read it in 10 years, but the 10-year anniversary came up recently and my publisher asked me to write a foreword to it.

I was struck by how much shame there was in that book and how apologetic I was as a narrator, about myself, and how embarrassed I was by the fact that I wanted to go on a spiritual journey. I kind of roll myself under the bus a lot in that book.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere is a paragraph that really struck me and actually made me very sad, which is when I was in Italy. I’m having this great meal and I’m actually feeling good and I’m writing about how, for the first time in three years, I actually feel good. And then I said something that was like, “I know that eventually I’m going to have to settle down and become a responsible, productive, contributing adult. I promise that I will do that soon but just a little while longer let me just do this now.”  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd I think that insecurity of a 34-year-old woman who’s saying, “Conventional life; I tried it … I’m going to go do this thing, but I promise it’s just for a year and then I’ll settle down again and I’ll be normal again” didn’t work for me.

You’ve all worked, waited, and -- in your different ways -- sacrificed to make this day a reality. Speaking as the parent of two recent college graduates, I ask members of the Class please to turn and wave your recognition, and love, and thanks to the parents and other supporters who have stood behind you and are feeling boundless pride, and bittersweetness at seeing the adults you’ve become, and relief of several kinds at the step you’re taking now.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve just done the first part of my job, in helping you notice this wonderful sunny day.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eI’m about to do the second part, which is to be brief. Two days ago, I was in China, where I’ve lived for two years and was involved in news of the disastrous earthquake. Two days from now, I’ll be on my way back to Beijing. The reason I’m here today is a connection between your college and my family that stretches back 65 years. I’d like to tell that story and then say why I think it matters for you who are graduating today.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003chr class=\"c-section-divider\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the summer of 1943, 65 years ago, James A. Fallows, my father, had just graduated from Jenkintown High School, not far from here. He was 18 years old – in fact, tomorrow will be his 83rd birthday, and I’ll join him in California to tell him about this event – and his country was at war. His older brother Bob was already in the Army. My dad’s main choices were to become a military pilot or a military doctor. The placement tests said Doctor, and so he came to Collegeville as an Ursinus pre-med student and Navy cadet, under the V-12 program.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eHis time here was rich, as yours probably has been. He was on the football and wrestling teams. He acted in plays. He sang in the Messiah chorus – impressive, since he can’t sing – and went to crack-of-dawn military drills when the bugle played Reveille on the campus. It was a different time.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe football team was successful, though they cheated, in a low-tech, pre-video way. He was a lineman, both offense and defense. He would wear a blue stocking on his right leg, and red on his left – and the man on either side of him on the line would do the reverse. The result was that linemen on the other team would look down and be puzzled, seeing a pair of blue or red legs that seemed to belong to two different people. When the ball was hiked, torsos and legs seemed to move in confusing directions. It helped Ursinus win, especially against academically less gifted teams. He liked it here.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eBut my dad’s time here, if rich, was brief. After two years at Ursinus, he had finished enough pre-med courses to qualify, by competitive exam, for Harvard Medical School, where he enrolled at age 20. He went from there to be a Navy doctor, then a small-town doctor, husband for more than 55 years to his childhood sweetheart from Jenkintown, father to four children, pillar of the small community in California where he raised his family. The finest man I know.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eBut because of the rushed wartime schedule, unlike today’s members of the class of ’08, my father never graduated from Ursinus. Until three years ago when the college, in a gesture that meant a tremendous amount to people now in their 80s, awarded its V-12 students their diplomas. I had hoped my dad could join us today, which he can’t – but I know that as you get your diplomas, he’ll be looking at his, mounted on his living room wall.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003chr class=\"c-section-divider\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eI tell you this because I’m a proud son, as sons and daughters should be – but also because his time in Collegeville, compared with yours, helps me introduce three ideas I’d like to mention briefly. They have to do with the times you’ll live in and the traits you’ll show, and I think of them as: challenge; curiosity; and character.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eWe hear almost too often about the challenges that shaped my father’s generation – the grandparents of today’s graduates. They grew up during the Depression, the then they fought a long world war and cold war. As if that weren’t enough, then they had to raise the Baby Boomers, my own unpopular generation. Their times were tough – for instance, the life expectancy for an American man born in 1925, like my father, was only into his mid 50s—twenty years less than for someone born in 1986, like most of you.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eBecause of the way this “greatest generation” – your grandparents, my parents – met it challenges, we honor them, but I think we sometimes misunderstand what challenge can mean. We’re tempted to think that it takes extreme challenge to bring out the greatness in people – Pearl Harbor, 9/11 - and, correspondingly, that when times do really get tough people will automatically rise to their best.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eI’m not sure about either assumption. Sometimes people and societies don’t in fact rise to meet their biggest tests – I fear our nation’s overall response to the challenges of 9/11 will be seen, in history, as falling into this category– and sometimes the real test of greatness in people and generations is coping with challenges that don’t take the obvious Pearl Harbor form.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eThis, I think is your generation’s chance for greatness. You already know some of the huge array of problem which, if they’re going to be solved at all, will require your minds and commitment and talent and self-sacrifice. Perhaps number one is preserving the global environment, and its range of species, and its climate system – every day in China I see reasons why that’s crucial and difficult. Every day in China I also see a billion-plus people struggling to condense a century of economic development into a few years. I don’t think they’re struggling to “take American jobs” or \"threaten America’s place in the world” – they have too many problems of their own, as we’re reminded by the devastation there just this week. But they are changing your world.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eI’m actually optimistic about your America’s prospects in dealing with China– and with India, and with the Middle East, and with questions of global harmony and domestic equality –as long as we newly embrace rather than stifle the traditional American virtues of openness, equality, innovation, and opportunity. And as long as you recognize the challenge to serve – not in the V-12 but in your era’s ways. Perhaps in the military, as a teacher, as a parent, as an entrepreneur, as volunteer. Sixty-five years from now, many of you will be back here, and you’ll want to hear that you were a greatest generation too.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003chr class=\"c-section-divider\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eSecond, curiosity. My dad always knew that he had been pulled out of Ursinus too soon. And that was a huge advantage. Having missed half of his normal college education, he gave himself ten educations in the ensuing years. He taught himself Greek, and then Hebrew, and polished up his Latin – and there were more. He became a painter, and sculptor, with his work in shows. He taught himself to sail, and play the piano, and to become a cowboy and head of local mounted police. He took up computers in his 50s and became a local webmaster. Now, at 83, he’s wondering whether to switch to the Mac.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eHe went overboard, because that’s who he is – but his is an extreme example of what a great college education should do for everyone. You’ve had a vastly better education than he had here, because you’ve had it in full and because Ursinus itself has is now so justly celebrated for the excellence of its life-changing undergraduate approach. You’ve shared an intellectual bond from Gilgamesh onward. But these years will have been wasted, Gilgamesh and all, if they’re not the beginning of a process of curiosity-driven self education that lasts the rest of your lives.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eYou can use your upcoming reunions as a handy benchmark. At each five-year interval – your 5th reunion, your 50th –be prepared to tell your classmates about the new thing you’ve recently learned. Guitar; Arabic; the tango; whatever. Here’s another benchmark: by the time of your 10th reunion, please spend at least one year overseas. There is no better way to learn about your own country than to see it from afar.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003chr class=\"c-section-divider\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eThird, character: Your parents know what I have learned from seeing my own children grow: that a lot of what we are as people, we are from the start. But we’re pushed to be the best versions of our inborn possibilities by parents in the beginning, then by teachers and mentors, and in the long run by ourselves.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eProbably because he was so busy rushing through Ursinus, my dad – like another practical-minded Philadelphian, Benjamin Franklin – always emphasized that our character is the accumulation of things we actually do each day. In the end, we are our habits, so it’s worth developing good ones.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eSome are obvious. Seriously, don’t smoke! Or, type IMs while you drive. Get in the habit of sports and exercise – by your tenth reunion, you’ll know who has and hasn’t. Get in the habit of being happy. We all have problems, which we can’t control; what we can control is how we look at them. Get in the habit of being excited. It’s a big world, with no excuse for being bored. It’s fun to have feuds and enemies – I’ve had my share– but break the habit of nursing grudges. Here’s a tip: always write angry letters to your enemies. Never mail them. Remember that anything hostile you say about people will get back to them. Especially if it’s in email.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eMoney: you’re going to have enough of it. Use the privilege of this education to know that you’re not going to starve, so you might as well spend your life doing something you love and are proud of. By your 20th reunion, and even more your 50th, you’ll see that satisfaction in work and family is scarcer – and far more rewarding – than the money race can ever be. Some people will always be better off than you, so don’t waste time envying them. Instead think of those you admire – and construct your own personal Mt. Rushmore, seeing what traits you can emulate.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eTake every chance to tell your spouse, when you have one, and your children that you love them. When in doubt, phone your mom.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eOne final habit: Whenever you have the chance to deliver a sincere compliment, be sure to do it. My father is proud to be from Ursinus; I am proud of you; and we all are proud of you new graduates. These are sincere compliments, every one. Make the most of this wonderful day. #\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/zHqIB8BKu78\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/zHqIB8BKu78/","published":"2019-06-15T19:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:374-591805"}]},{"url":"https://feeds.feedburner.com/time/topstories?format=xml","items":[{"title":"Hong Kong Suspends Controversial China Extradition Bill After Massive Protests","content":"\u003caside class=\"right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad\" id=\"right-rail__ad-5607678\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module\" data-src=\"https://time.com/5607678/hong-kong-extradition-bill-suspended/\" data-widget-id=\"SB_2\" data-ob-template=\"timemag\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHong Kong\u0026#8217;s leader Carrie Lam announced Saturday her government will suspend a controversial bill allowing criminal suspects to be extradited to China, after massive street protests that gripped the city this week descended into violence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLam has faced unprecedented pressure to scrap the legislation, which its critics say could become a backdoor for China to round up political and commercial adversaries.

There’s no reason to keep the male chicks alive; they’re not useful for meat, as broiler chickens are bred in a totally different manner, to maximize size and quantity of meat. In the past, animal welfare advocates have proposed breeding “dual-purpose” chickens, which could be raised humanely for meat as well as serving as hens, to get around this, but got little traction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"xHYODg\"\u003eBut ending chick culling has become possible recently due to technology. In 2016, United Egg Producers, which represents the vast majority of egg producers in the US, \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/6/9/11896096/eggs-chick-culling-ended\"\u003eannounced it would replace culling\u003c/a\u003e with “in-ovo egg sexing.” This is a process that can determine the sex of chicks before they develop inside their egg. That enables egg producers to terminate the male eggs and potentially use them to \u003ca href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/vaccine/how-fluvaccine-made.htm#egg-based\"\u003ehelp make vaccines\u003c/a\u003e or for pet food (most humans would presumably be grossed out by cooking fertilized eggs).

Janesville was one of those places with GM. So was Beloit, with Beloit Corporation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"fOy6FK\"\u003eDiane now is very much the new Beloit Corporation.

[It] feels a little weird, only because it kind of cut across the political spectrum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ULWXMl\"\u003eSo, a little bit of context. When I went to Beloit in June of 2017, the political discussion on the national level was polarized. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"BBg9A9\"\u003eSo I kind of thought, “I’m going to this place in a state that had historically been very anti-Trump ... and then suddenly turned Trump. And Diane Hendricks was a huge Republican donor. In a lot of ways, people give her credit for having turned the state and gotten the people on the political side on board with Trump.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"0690mE\"\u003eI thought, going to Beloit, that depending on where on the political spectrum people stood, that they would feel very strongly for or against Diane. And it wasn’t at all that way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"j2mncy\"\u003eAnybody I spoke to, whether they identified as Democrat or Republican, all felt the same way: that it was a huge deal that Diane had put so much money and time and effort into making Beloit a place that mattered, because for so long, Beloit didn’t matter to anyone. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"1mONCj\"\u003eDylan Matthews\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"pFg4d0\"\u003eHendricks is pretty vocally anti-union and has been a huge supporter of former Republican Gov. Scott Walker’s efforts to kneecap labor in Wisconsin. Did people bring up the role of unions much when you were talking about how the county changed?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"gSor1Q\"\u003eAlexandra Stevenson\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"2IlQOt\"\u003eIt’s really interesting, actually, because she was caught on tape a couple years ago asking Scott Walker to break up the labor unions.

But as Brandom notes, the perception of support from some of the internet’s most noxious quarters risks damaging the campaign’s reputation, and doing so unfairly. There are plenty of valid reasons — his inexperience in government, some of his more out-there platform items — to not back him, but a fear that he’s associated with the alt-right is not among them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"NXtQ3U\"\u003eTo build the Yang Gang going forward, Yang will have to find a way to harness the enthusiasm for him on sites like Reddit without its worst elements tarring unfairly him by association.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"fyU0yb\"\u003eBut his mere candidacy, and presence on a debate stage, matters.

Brett Kavanaugh, appointed by Donald Trump and reviled by liberals, wrote an opinion for the unanimous court:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe exceedingly narrow question in this case concerns remaining-in burglary. The question is whether remaining-in burglary (i) occurs only if a person has the intent to commit a crime at the exact moment when he or she first unlawfully remains in a building or structure, or (ii) more broadly, occurs when a person forms the intent to commit a crime at any time while unlawfully remaining in a building or structure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamar Alonzo Quarles, convicted of a felony in Michigan, argued that one of his previous crimes shouldn\u0026#8217;t be used against him for sentencing under a federal \u0026#8220;armed career criminal\u0026#8221; statute that makes punishment more severe for repeat offenders. Based on Quarles\u0026#8217; counsel\u0026#8217;s reading of Michigan burglary law\u0026#8217;s \u0026#8220;remaining-in\u0026#8221; clause, outlining intent, he didn\u0026#8217;t have the necessary mindset for the previous offense to count as the act of a career criminal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe justices then had to decide how to read \u0026#8220;remaining-in\u0026#8221;—not whether Quarles is indeed a career criminal, whether the system is fair, or anything else.

The whole court agreed that the Armed Career Criminal Act doesn\u0026#8217;t define burglary specifically because that would make each variation in state criminal laws seem to exempt a defendant from the federal act if the definitions didn\u0026#8217;t perfectly match. In fact, however, the idea behind the federal law was to capture as many offenses as possible, not to exclude crimes that don\u0026#8217;t meet a word-for-word definition. If the court read the law like Quarles did, it would be concluding that Congress \u0026#8220;enacted a self-defeating statute,\u0026#8221; Kavanaugh wrote, and that was deemed an incorrect interpretation by all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVery dry stuff, nothing to shout about on a Sunday chat show.

Sonia Sotomayor is a liberal and Kavanaugh is a conservative, but Sotomayor let Kavanaugh\u0026#8217;s words speak for her when it came down to the very narrow question before the court in \u003cem\u003eQuarles. \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWho is a person?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn another case decided on June 10, \u003ca href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/17-1594_1an2.pdf\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eReturn Mail, Inc. v.

Return Mail argued that the USPS, a government entity, wasn\u0026#8217;t a \u0026#8220;person\u0026#8221; and thus could not avail itself of the administrative review process. The USPS claimed it was a “person” in this context and a federal court agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"page\" title=\"Page 2\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"layoutArea\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"column\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe majority of the Supreme Court sided with Return Mail, however. It concluded that the government isn\u0026#8217;t a “person” and can\u0026#8217;t institute review proceedings at the Patent Board. As Sotomayor explained, \u0026#8220;In the absence of an express definition of the term \u0026#8216;person\u0026#8217; in the patent statutes, the court applies a \u0026#8216;longstanding interpretive presumption that person does not include the sovereign,\u0026#8217; and thus excludes a federal agency like the Postal Service.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBreyer wrote the dissent, acknowledging the presumption the majority relies on, but arguing that it isn\u0026#8217;t a hard-and-fast rule that can never be overcome. In his view, in this particular context, the government could count as a person for the purposes of administratively challenging a patent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis case represents the real work justices do, analyzing words in a legal context, not practicing politics. Landmark cases that make history—like \u003cem\u003eBrown v. Board of Education, \u003c/em\u003ewhich integrated racially segregated schools, or \u003cem\u003eObergefell v.

The law denies states jurisdiction over the outer continental shelf and deems an adjacent state’s laws relevant only if they are applicable and consistent with other federal laws. In Newton\u0026#8217;s case, the nine justices concluded that California\u0026#8217;s minimum-wage requirements couldn\u0026#8217;t be considered in a matter involving employment on the outer continental shelf because the federal Fair Labor Standards Act already addresses work on federal territories and leaves no gap that California\u0026#8217;s laws might fill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe unanimous conclusion in no way indicates that all nine justices are anti-labor.

That is driven by a number of factors, maybe most importantly nuclear proliferation in North Korea, which has led to increased investment in missile defense. The Trump administration has also pushed to increase offensive capabilities as it withdraws from arms-control deals. Finally, defense spending in general has grown under this administration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThe missile market isn\u0026#8217;t only domestic\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExports of missile-defense systems in particular have grown in recent years as a way to reward allies—and, presumably, investors in military contracting firms. So far in 2019, Raytheon has been approved by the US government to export nearly $2.5 billion of missile-related goods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGregory Sanders, who researches federal defense contracting at CSIS, says that missile spending at home and abroad isn\u0026#8217;t the only reason for the consolidation. The combined companies are promising to cut fat from their supply chain, which could mean more profit and lower costs for purchasers, as well as potential layoffs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThe risk for the Pentagon\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonopoly effects could lead to higher costs for the Defense Department, though \u003ca href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/evaluating-consolidation-and-threat-monopolies-within-industrial-sectors\"\u003ea recent study\u003c/a\u003e conducted by Sanders and his colleagues suggests that there isn\u0026#8217;t a relationship between major cost-overruns and consolidation. Indeed, one possible result of the United Technologies deal is an entity that could compete directly with Lockheed Martin and Boeing, the two largest US defense contractors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as in the consumer tech sector, the traditional way of evaluating market concentration—examining consumer prices—is getting a re-evaluation. One concern for military planners is whether consolidation will lessen the amount of investment in research and development and hurt US defense innovation.

A woman in a light-pink dress appears to have fallen in a field, and is crawling through the high grass back toward a distant farm house. According to a description offered on the fifth floor of the Museum of Modern Art in New York, where it hangs, the woman was Wyeth\u0026#8217;s neighbor, crippled by polio and immortalized in a style known as magic realism.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStaring at \u0026#8220;Christina\u0026#8217;s World\u0026#8221; today, it seems to reflect our modern relationship with farms and the people who work on them. According to the US Census Bureau, 80% of Americans live in dense urban and suburban areas. And so it isn\u0026#8217;t such a stretch to see ourselves in the woman—so far away from the places that provide our food, places that are mentally and emotionally distant and often seem out of reach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWyeth\u0026#8217;s work was created at the tail-end of a movement in American art called social realism, which is marked by its commentary on the social, economic, and political situation during the Great Depression. Within that style exists a branch of work called American Regionalism, which highlighted American life and landscapes—almost all painted in a naturalist style—that often showed just how difficult farm life could be. Thomas Hart Benton, for instance, traveled the country painting agrarian scenes. His 1945 painting \u0026#8220;\u003ca href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/217201/cotton-pickers\"\u003eCotton Pickers\u003c/a\u003e\u0026#8221; draws attention to the unjust economic reality and backbreaking labor endured by cotton pickers in rural Georgia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cspan class=\"pull-quote\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"quote-line\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eBack in rural America, though, a farming crisis was underway.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"quote-line\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe artists working on agrarian art today are still painting those same fields the social realists were drawn to back in the 1930s and 1940s. But you can argue that the art form evolved in an unsettling way. The social realists were brave in that they drew attention to the back-breaking work carried out by farm laborers, often under an oppressive summer sun. Today, contemporary painters rarely include those laborers because, in many cases, they truly are no longer there. And that’s just as stark an image, because it’s representative of how humanity is removed from the food system in favor of increased mechanization. Tractors and farm technology today use artificial intelligence to manage massive crops, and the consolidation of animal agriculture into massive farming operations has helped to create an opaque system that\u0026#8217;s out of sight and out of mind to an increasingly non-rural population.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was during this period of change that agrarian art stopped reflecting reality, explains Amanda Mobley Guenther, a curator at the \u003ca href=\"https://bonecreek.org/about/history/\"\u003eBone Creek Museum of Agrarian Art\u003c/a\u003e in David City, Nebraska. Bone Creek claims to be the only exclusively agrarian art museum in the United States.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;After the social realism movement, which had its height in the 1940s, we had the 1960s, which had other social movements taking precedence,\u0026#8221; Mobley Guenther says. \u0026#8220;In the 1960s and 1970s there were all these other things going on, at least in American art history.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack in rural America, meanwhile, a farming crisis was underway.

Americans are eating more meat than ever, much of it sourced from \u003ca href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jul/21/giving-up-beef-reduce-carbon-footprint-more-than-cars\"\u003elarge and unsustainable systems\u003c/a\u003e. By some estimates, beef, in particular, requires 28 times more land, 11 times more water, and winds up pumping five times more emissions into the environment than other animal protein. And when production of it is compared to vegetables and grains, the impact of beef per calorie is even more intense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome people are clued into this reality. They\u0026#8217;ve incorporated Meatless Mondays into their dietary regimen or have figured out other ways to avoid eating meat. But there are far more people who aren\u0026#8217;t aware of how unsustainable the industrial meat system is. They don\u0026#8217;t know how it operates, and can\u0026#8217;t visualize what it even looks like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral curators will point out the obvious, that for agrarian painters who make a living off their artwork, there just isn\u0026#8217;t much of a market for the macabre scenes of today\u0026#8217;s feedlots and crammed chicken houses. And that\u0026#8217;s a commentary on its own. At some point, the way we make our food became so consolidated and so grotesque that people stopped wanting to see it, even in art form. There are some cases of photography exploring the topic, including in a \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/10/09/magazine/big-food-photo-essay.html\"\u003e2016 New York Times Magazine section\u003c/a\u003e on farming, but examples are few and far between.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s this distance that creates the problem.

So why does the \u003cem\u003eMona Lisa\u003c/em\u003e seem so special?  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThe mystery of her identity\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe story told by one of Leonardo’s first biographers, Giorgio Vasari, is that this oil portrait depicts Lisa Gherardini, second wife of a wealthy silk and wool merchant Francesco del Giocondo (hence the name by which it is known in Italian: \u003cem\u003eLa Gioconda\u003c/em\u003e). \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeonardo likely commenced the work while in Florence in the early 1500s, perhaps when he was hoping to receive the commission to take on a massive wall painting of \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Battle_of_Anghiari_(Leonardo)\"\u003eThe Battle of Anghiari\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccepting a portrait commission from one of the city’s most influential, politically-engaged citizens might well have helped his chances. A recently discovered marginal note by Agostino Vespucci, \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20131105050239/http://www.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/Englisch/news/monalisa.html\"\u003eone-time assistant to the diplomat and writer Niccolò Machiavelli,\u003c/a\u003e records that Leonardo was working on a painting of “Lisa del Giocondo” in 1503.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Italian painter Raphael, a great admirer of Leonardo, leaves us a sketch from around 1505-6 of what seems to be \u003ca href=\"https://www.wga.hu/frames-e.html?/html/r/raphael/7drawing/3/09drawin.html\"\u003ethis work\u003c/a\u003e. When Leonardo later moved to France in 1516, he took this still unfinished work with him. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, art scholars have increasingly voiced doubts about whether the image in the Louvre can indeed be Vasari’s Lisa, for the style and techniques of the painting match far better Leonardo’s later work from 1510 onwards.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdditionally, a visitor to Leonardo’s house in 1517 recorded seeing there a portrait of “a certain Florentine woman, done from life,” made “at the instance of the late magnificent Giuliano de Medici.” Medici was Leonardo’s patron in Rome from 1513 to 1516. Was our visitor looking at the same image Vasari and our marginal diarist describe as Lisa, or another portrait of a different woman, commissioned later? \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll in all, just who we are seeing in the Louvre remains one of the work’s many mysteries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eA portrait stripped bare\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn comparison to many contemporary images of the elite, this portrait is stripped of the usual trappings of high status or symbolic hints to the sitter’s dynastic heritage. All attention is thus drawn to her face, and that enigmatic expression. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore the 18th century, emotion was more commonly articulated in painting through gestures of the hand and body than the face. But in any case, depictions of individuals did not aim to convey the same kinds of emotions we might look for in a portrait photograph today—think courage or humility rather than joy or happiness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdditionally, a hallmark of elite status was one’s ability to keep the passions under good regulation. Irrespective of dental hygiene standards, a broad smile in artworks thus generally indicated ill-breeding or mockery, as we see in Leonardo’s own study \u003cem\u003eFive Grotesque Heads\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur modern ideas about emotions leave us wondering just what Mona Lisa might have been feeling or thinking much more than the work’s early modern viewers likely did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eA 20th century phenomenon\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, there is a real question as to whether anyone before the 20th century thought much about the \u003cem\u003eMona Lisa\u003c/em\u003e at all.

They\u0026#8217;ll probably be around a lot longer than humans, even as the planet experiences intense climatic changes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome marine biologists have assumed the squid population would take a hit in waters with higher concentrations of carbon dioxide.

The rapid change is expected to have a profound effect on ocean ecosystems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarbon dioxide dissolved in water winds up forming carbonic acid. That increased acidity could wind up creating a chain reaction that\u0026#8217;s harmful to most animals.

If you have it, the amazon.com/spark URL will take you there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough Amazon won\u0026#8217;t talk about why its Instagram experiment is ending, it\u0026#8217;s not too hard to make some guesses. Beyond its lack of originality and transactional nature, Instagram itself has grown into a far more formidable competitor since Spark first launched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast fall, Instagram fully embraced its shoppable nature \u003ca href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/17/instagram-shopping/\"\u003ewith the introduction of shopping features across its app\u003c/a\u003e that let people more easily discover products from Instagram photos. It also added a new shopping channel and \u003ca href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/19/instagram-checkout/\"\u003ein March, Instagram launched its own in-app checkout option\u003c/a\u003e to turn product inspiration into actual conversions. It was certainly a big move into Amazon territory. And while that led to \u003ca href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-06-01/sorry-amazon-instagram-shopping-is-the-future-of-online-retail\"\u003eheadlines\u003c/a\u003e about Instagram as the future of shopping, it\u0026#8217;s not going to upset Amazon\u0026#8217;s overall dominance any time soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition to the shifting competitive landscape, Spark\u0026#8217;s primary stakeholder, Amazon VP of Consumer Engagement \u003ca href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/cheechew/\"\u003eChee Chew\u003c/a\u003e departed at the beginning of 2019 for Twilio. While at Amazon, Chew was heavily invested in Spark\u0026#8217;s success and product managers would even tie their own efforts to Spark in order to win his favor, sources said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, Amazon\u0026#8217;s notifications section had been changed to include updates from Spark. And Spark used to sit a swipe away from the main navigation menu on mobile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFollowing Spark\u0026#8217;s closure, Amazon\u0026#8217;s navigation has once again been simplified. It\u0026#8217;s now a clutter-free \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburger_button\"\u003ehamburger menu\u003c/a\u003e. Meanwhile, Amazon\u0026#8217;s notifications section no longer includes Spark updates \u0026#8212; only alerts about orders, shipments, and personalized recommendations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition, it\u0026#8217;s likely that Spark wasn\u0026#8217;t well adopted. Just 10,000 Amazon customers used it during its first 24 hours, we heard. With Chew\u0026#8217;s departure, Spark lost its driving force. No one needed to curry favor by paying it attention, which may have also helped contribute to its shuttering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e6/14/19, 10:20 PM ET: Updated with further context after publication.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"feedflare\"\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=QtMuYmK5-hc:me594veiD2c:2mJPEYqXBVI\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=QtMuYmK5-hc:me594veiD2c:7Q72WNTAKBA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=QtMuYmK5-hc:me594veiD2c:yIl2AUoC8zA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=QtMuYmK5-hc:me594veiD2c:-BTjWOF_DHI\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=QtMuYmK5-hc:me594veiD2c:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=QtMuYmK5-hc:me594veiD2c:D7DqB2pKExk\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=QtMuYmK5-hc:me594veiD2c:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=QtMuYmK5-hc:me594veiD2c:qj6IDK7rITs\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/QtMuYmK5-hc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/QtMuYmK5-hc/","published":"2019-06-15T00:18:20Z","guid":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=1844483"},{"title":"Meet TezLab, the Fitbit for Tesla vehicles","content":"\u003cp id=\"speakable-summary\"\u003eSome of the best real-time insights into \u003ca class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/tesla-motors\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"tesla-motors\"\u003eTesla \u003cspan class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e and its global fleet of electric vehicles — outside the confines of its Silicon Valley headquarters — might be through the lens of TezLab, a tiny upstart in Brooklyn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, a little more than two years after its founding, TezLab is on the verge of hitting what its founders believe is a tipping point of users, a milestone that could finally trigger a path to monetization.

But it \u003cem\u003eexists\u003c/em\u003e, allowing Tesla\u0026#8217;s own first-party app to communicate with the cars to do things like read battery charge status and lock doors. When reverse-engineered, it\u0026#8217;s possible for a third-party app to communicate directly with the API. (Tesla CEO Elon Musk has talked recently about opening up the API to third-party developers)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;Essentially, the plumbing is already built to connect to the server,\u0026#8221; Schippers told TechCrunch recently. \u0026#8220;This was the catalyst for us.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Tesla vehicle buying trend was triggered at HFC. Schippers, Schenk and a number of other software engineers and staffers at HFC bought, and still own, Tesla vehicles like the Model 3. The company\u0026#8217;s HFC fund provided the initial $350,000 to build the first version of TezLab.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eRepository of data\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTezLab hasn\u0026#8217;t captured anywhere near every Tesla owner. But Schippers believes they\u0026#8217;re getting close to reaching a critical mass of users. More than 200 owners are downloading the app each week, and that rate is accelerating, he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTezLab has 16,000 total installs on the Apple App Store and Google Play, according to \u003ca class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/sensor-tower\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"sensor-tower\"\u003eSensor Tower \u003cspan class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. The figures are all unique, new installs. The firm doesn\u0026#8217;t count re-installs or downloads to multiple devices belonging to the same user. However, that total install number is likely closer to 18,000 because many are listed under TestFlight, an online service used to test apps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn comparison, Tesla delivered 245,506 vehicles globally in 2018. TezLab doesn\u0026#8217;t expect every Tesla owner to download the app. Instead, Schippers is initially aiming for 10% of owners — a target he believes is within reach — and eventually higher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven at its current numbers, TezLab has become a massive repository of Tesla data.

It can quickly spot phantom drain issues, if the Tesla API goes offline or chart spikes in charging use.

It relies on the phone’s pressure-sensitive display to let you reassign controls to a more convenient location on the screen. It works similarly to 3D Touch on the iPhone, changing the screen’s response depending on how hard you push on it, except it’s more useful. MagicTouch can be activated in-game by swiping in from the top right corner of the screen while gaming in landscape mode (games in portrait mode, like \u003cem\u003ePokémon Go\u003c/em\u003e, aren’t supported). Its interface asks you to choose which two button mappings you’d like to change, and where you’d like them to live on the screen.

It’s already designed with tremendous control customization, allowing players to change the location of literally every button, as well as their size and transparency. Where MagicTouch compliments it is by letting me make two multifunction buttons, made possible with the phone’s pressure-sensitive touchscreen. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"lM7iQm\"\u003eOriginally, \u003cem\u003ePUBG\u003c/em\u003e’s controls put the “Sprint” button where your finger naturally rests to move the character. I’d prefer to be able to sway my avatar left and right to avoid gunfire, while managing inventory on the right side of the screen. Usually, that involves tapping the “Inventory” button near the bottom corner of the screen. MagicTouch lets me create a secondary action right over the “Sprint” button that, when I press the screen hard enough, opens the inventory on the right side without lifting a finger. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"hNnOPM\"\u003eMagicTouch lets you customize one button on the right side, too, and for \u003cem\u003ePUBG\u003c/em\u003e, I knew exactly what else I wanted to change. You can already move the camera, whether in third- or first-person view, by moving a finger around in the right half of the screen. That’s fine, but I don’t want to have to lift that finger to find the “Fire” button when I stumble upon another player. So, I anchored a MagicTouch button to this part of the screen that fires my weapon when I press hard enough. It feels like this is the way the game is intended to be played.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S6jLWEc3wGctuQNIizIKHw8NDRE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16333859/jbareham_190611_3481_0177.jpg\"\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"d1aScs\"\u003eMagicTouch isn’t limited to \u003cem\u003ePUBG\u003c/em\u003e.

Black Shark 2 is built for gaming, and while that doesn’t \u003cem\u003ehave\u003c/em\u003e to necessitate garish looks, this phone is full of divisive hardware details. A bright green chamfered edge runs all the way around the phone, and the back of the Black Shark 2 looks like a flashy sports car.

Kickstarter provided seed funding for the new platform, and Baio and McMillan had brought on people to develop and run the company, but explained that while the concept was a good idea, they “couldn’t find a way to make the business viable.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"wTTRf9\"\u003eThe issue appears to have come down to how to generate revenue in a stable and reliable way.

Even if we went the traditional route and raised venture capital, it didn’t appear likely to survive once that funding ran out. We were building this for the community we care about, and many of the artists and creators in our community are already financially insecure and vulnerable. The idea of launching something with so much uncertainty and risk felt irresponsible and unfair.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"96nqHn\"\u003eBaio and McMillan noted that they ended up shutting the project down last month, and will be returning the remaining seed funding to Kickstarter.

In less than a week, the once-revered Justice Minister of President Bolsonaro\u0026#8217;s government, Sergio Moro, now faces widespread calls to resign from the same large Brazilian media outlets that spent years transforming him into an untouchable icon of integrity and uncritically applauding his every move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven more grave, the improprieties revealed by our reporting have cast serious doubt on the validity of numerous guilty verdicts issued by Judge Moro and the anti-corruption task force, beginning \u0026#8211; most importantly \u0026#8211; with the conviction and imprisonment of former President Lula da Silva last year at exactly the time that he was the overwhelming front-runner to win the presidency in 2018. That conviction by Judge Moro, which we now know was the by-product of highly improper and unethical conduct, is now scheduled to be reviewed by the Supreme Court as early as next week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe archive we received from our source is vast, and contains many more explosive stories yet to be reported. Just last night, \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/06/14/sergio-moro-enquanto-julgava-lula-sugeriu-a-lava-jato-emitir-uma-nota-oficial-contra-a-defesa-eles-acataram-e-pautaram-a-imprensa/\"\u003ewe published another story\u003c/a\u003e exposing even more serious improprieties by Judge Moro, widely regarded as the anchor of legitimacy for the Bolsonaro government, that has led for more calls for him to resign. Because of the importance but also complexity of these issues for those outside of Brazil, we created a video explaining what this archive is about, what these revelations mean, and why the consequences of our reporting are so significant not only for Brazil but for the entire democratic world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ciframe width='100%' height='400px'

Research (WTD 71), and staffs from Commander, U.S. Naval Forces Europe and Commander, U.S. Sixth Fleet to conduct serious tests of newest Mk 18 Mod 2 unmanned undersea vehicles (UUV) during the exercise Baltic Operations (BALTOPS) 2019.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe team will test and experiment with Mk 18 Mod 2 unmanned undersea vehicles (UUV) using multiple, modular sensor components that expand their capability as part of the exercise Baltic Operations (BALTOPS) 2019 Mine Warfare Task Group. The experimentation and testing they conduct throughout the exercise provides commanders with a decisive competitive edge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e“Maintaining open sea lines of communication including ports and key landing areas is a critical part of maintaining sea power and sea control, and mine warfare is a key part of that effort that cuts across warfare domains,” said U.S. Navy Rear Adm. Scott Robertson, commander of the BALTOPS 2019 Mine Warfare Task Group and commander of Naval Surface and Mine Warfighting Development Center. “Getting underway with our partners and allies to exercises those skills, refine doctrine and tactics, techniques, and procedures, and to experiment with new technology keeps us stronger together.” \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Mk 18 Mod 2 UUVs employed by the researchers have two sensor mission packages. The Small Synthetic Aperture Minehunter (SSAM II) is used for high-area coverage mine hunting, and the Autonomous Topographic Large Area Survey Forward Looking Sonar (ATLAS FLS) is used for intelligence preparation of the operating environment and to mine hunt above the sea floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Mk 18 Mod 2 experimentation provides valuable insight for BALTOPS multinational  commanders to make tactical and operational-level decisions about where to direct landing forces in the exercise. Not only did the system perform well, it surveyed areas in a much more rapid time frame than other systems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e“It is great seeing U.S. MCM UUV capabilities performing efforts in my home region, which I have been working with throughout the last couple years,” said Bundeswehr Senior Chief Nico Bermann, assigned to MCMDIV 31 as part of the Personnel Exchange Program. “This tied together with the data gathering and shown interoperability will benefit future mine countermeasure exercises like BALTOPS. It will also contribute tremendously the development of common tactics and procedures.” \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn additional objective the researchers have during the exercise include collecting performance measurements in an operationally relevant environment for future improvements to systems to support commanders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe data collected during the exercise will inform future Commander, U.S. 6th Fleet Expeditionary Mine Countermeasures (ExMCM) launch-and-recovery, command-and- control, and tactics, techniques, and procedures which will directly support partner and allies working together in a complex and dynamic security environment in the Baltic region.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e“This year’s exercise participation continues upon past efforts to effectively employ UUV assets in the Baltic Sea,” said LCDR Daniel NeSmith, attached to U.S. 6th Fleet’s Mine Countermeasures Detachment located in Rota, Spain. “Researchers from allied and partner nations continue to jointly study emerging technologies in different environmental conditions.

His screen success in America was a rarity among Italian filmmakers, and he prided himself on knowing the tastes of modern moviegoers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was one of the few Italian directors close to the Vatican, and the church turned to Zeffirelli\u0026#8217;s theatrical touch for live telecasts of the 1978 papal installation and the 1983 Holy Year opening ceremonies in St. Peter\u0026#8217;s Basilica. Former Italian Premier Silvio Berlusconi also tapped him to direct a few high-profile events.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Zeffirelli was best known outside Italy for his colorful, softly-focused romantic films. His 1968 \u0026#8220;Romeo and Juliet\u0026#8221; brought Shakespeare\u0026#8221;s story to a new and appreciative generation, and his \u0026#8220;Brother Sun, Sister Moon,\u0026#8221; told the life of St. Francis in parables involving modern and 13th-century youth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;Romeo and Juliet\u0026#8221; set box-office records in the United States, though it was made with two unknown actors, Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussey. The film, which cost $1.5 million, grossed $52 million and became the most successful Shakespearian movie ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the 1970s, Zeffirelli\u0026#8217;s focus shifted from the romantic to the spiritual. His 1977 made-for-television \u0026#8220;Life of Jesus\u0026#8221; became an instant classic with its portrayal of a Christ who seemed authentic and relevant. Shown around the world, the film earned more than $300 million.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere Zeffirelli worked, however, controversy was never far away. In 1978, he threatened to leave Italy for good because of harsh attacks against him and his art by leftist groups in his country, who saw Zeffirelli as an exponent of Hollywood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other hand, piqued by American criticism of his 1981 movie \u0026#8220;Endless Love,\u0026#8221; starring Brooke Shields, Zeffirelli said he might never make another film in the U.S. The movie, as he predicted, was a box office success.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZeffirelli wrote about the then-scandalous circumstances of his birth in his 2006 autobiography, recounting how his mother attended her husband\u0026#8217;s funeral pregnant with another man\u0026#8217;s child. Unable to give the baby either her or his father\u0026#8217;s names, she intended to name him Zeffiretti, after an aria in Mozart\u0026#8217;s \u0026#8220;Cosi fan Tutti,\u0026#8221; but a typographical error made it Zeffirelli, making him \u0026#8220;the only person in the world with Zeffirelli as a name, thanks to my mother\u0026#8217;s folly.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mother died of tuberculosis when he was 6, and Zeffirelli went to live with his father\u0026#8217;s cousin, whom he affectionately called Zia (Aunt) Lide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was during this period of his childhood, living in Zia Lide\u0026#8217;s house with weekly visits from his father, that Zeffirelli developed passions that would shape his life. The first was for opera, after seeing Wagner\u0026#8217;s \u0026#8220;Walkuere\u0026#8221; at age 8 or 9 in Florence. The second was a love of English culture and literature, after his father started him on thrice weekly English lessons with a British expatriate living in Florence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis experiences with the British expatriate community under fascism, and their staunch disbelief that they would be victimized by Benito Mussolini\u0026#8217;s regime, were at the heart of the semi-autobiographical 1991 film \u0026#8220;Tea with Mussolini.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe remained ever an Anglophile, and was particularly proud when Britain conferred on him an honorary knighthood in 2004 \u0026mdash; the only Italian citizen to have received the honor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a youth, Zeffirelli served with the partisans during World War II. He later acted as an interpreter for British troops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lifelong bachelor turned from architecture to acting at the age of 20 when he joined an experimental troupe in his native city.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a short-lived acting career, Zeffirelli worked with Luchino Visconti\u0026#8217;s theatrical company in Rome, where he showed a flair for dramatic staging techniques in \u0026#8220;A Streetcar Named Desire\u0026#8221; and \u0026#8220;Troilus and Cressida.\u0026#8221; He later served as assistant director under Italian film masters Michelangelo Antonioni and Vittorio De Sica.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1950, he began a long and fruitful association with lyric theater, working as a director, set designer and costumist, and bringing new life to works by his personal favorites \u0026mdash; Mozart, Rossini, Donizetti and Verdi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver the next decade, he staged dozens of operas, romantic melodramas and contemporary works in Italian and other European theaters, eventually earning a reputation as one of the world\u0026#8217;s best directors of musical theater.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth La Scala and New York\u0026#8217;s Metropolitan Opera later played host to Zeffirelli\u0026#8217;s classic staging of \u0026#8220;La Boheme,\u0026#8221; which was shown nationally on American television in 1982.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZeffirelli returned to prose theater in 1961 with an innovative interpretation of \u0026#8220;Romeo and Juliet\u0026#8221; at London\u0026#8217;s Old Vic. British critics immediately termed it \u0026#8220;revolutionary,\u0026#8221; and the director used it as the basis of frequent later productions and the 1968 film.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis first film effort in 1958, a comedy he wrote called \u0026#8220;Camping,\u0026#8221; had limited success. But eight years later, he directed Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton in Shakespeare\u0026#8217;s \u0026#8220;The Taming of the Shrew,\u0026#8221; and made his distinctive mark on world cinema.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Zeffirelli decided to do \u0026#8220;La Traviata\u0026#8221; on film, he had already worked his stage version of the opera into a classic, performed at Milan\u0026#8217;s La Scala with soprano Maria Callas.
