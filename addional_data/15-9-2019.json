Forget plans, just meet me in the middle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCory Booker? Okay, you’ve been there and done that, but what have you done for us lately? You didn’t solve the problems in Newark and now you want us to give you the keys to the Oval Office because..? I can’t figure out a reason why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Andrew Yang, who triumphed by speaking English as opposed to political-speak, blew his whole candidacy by turning it into a game show. Yup, he was gonna give a grand to ten families every month…and then let’s see what happens? Everybody else laughed. And when he said he knew about doctors because he was Asian, implying that the profession was filled with Asians, he demonstrated that he’s living in a bubble, that he doesn’t know the rules, that there are certain things you can’t say, but he did! Over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMayor Pete? He said some good things, he appeared wise, he regained some luster, but not enough to recover from the police problems in his hometown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich leaves us with the three real candidates…Joe, Bernie and Elizabeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWarren avoided the question. Which was especially bad since Bernie answered it. Will Medicare For All make taxes go up? Of course it will, own it and move on. But she waffled to her detriment. And by time she found her voice again, even spoke, deep into the debate, when she was hitting them over the fence with no problem, nobody was watching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBernie killed, but his voice was shot, you couldn’t stop thinking he’d yelled so much that he’d worn himself out. One thing you can say for Bernie, and Elizabeth too, is that they’re passionate. Actually, they were the only two on stage who were. They were convinced what they were saying was true, they uttered it with emphasis, this stuff was important to them. The others? You wondered why they were on stage, because they certainly have no chance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther than Joe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ll tell you, he’s from another era, with those teeth. As fake as can be. Bernie’s are yellow, Elizabeth’s imperfect, yet Joe’s look like Jim Carrey’s in “The Mask.” And he’s constantly fake smiling. Hell, that was the playbook in the last century, today we’re looking for authenticity and credibility, and the way Joe acts you just don’t buy it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he was creaky. He always seemed on the verge of forgetting something, a name, what he was talking about, it was uncomfortable watching him, you were willing him to get it right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he also came from the “trust me” school. Been there, done that, I’m the man. But Castro killed him by pointing out his selective embracement of Obama, saying he was with Barack when it suited him, and distancing himself when it didn’t. You can’t have it both ways. And the truth is Obama’s been out of office nearly three years, and the time has changed. Hell, we all like Obama, except for those who believe he was born in Kenya, but that doesn’t make him a great President. Hell, no one’s been a better ex-President than Jimmy Carter, he’s been on the right side of everything, advocating, unafraid of standing up to those who are wrong, but his term in office? Not so great.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet’s see, Obama lost both houses of Congress and many governorships and state houses, to the point where he couldn’t get his agenda through. And as soon as he was gone, Trump and the Republicans eradicated/overturned almost all of his policies, clean water just today. But this is the guy we’re advocating and adoring? I don’t think so. Obama’s closer to a boy band. Hell, late twenty and thirtysomethings are going to see the Backstreet Boys, but today’s chart is dominated by Drake and Post Malone. We ain’t going backwards folks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd after the candidates argued over health care, they became so lovey-dovey, team-like, that the debate was impossible to watch. Once again, the pundits had said not to have a circular firing squad and everybody agreed. The end result? The audience tuned out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there were few specifics, other than trumpeting their CVs. That’s why Bernie and Elizabeth stood out, there were some hooks in what they said. I mean when you talk broadly and say you’re gonna throw fifty mil at this or that…no one believes it, it’s too general, it doesn’t affect me if it even happens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Warren owned public schools. And someone else, either Yang or Castro, said that charter schools are not better than public ones. And Warren essentially came out against vouchers. Like I said, there was some substance there. But most of it was uttered after the audience had tuned out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo what it came down to, assuming you watched, was emotion and image. Who was the most likeable, who was the most sincere, who had the best delivery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrump pushes the envelope every damn day and tonight everybody but Sanders bunts. Got to give Bernie credit, he stays true to his ethos, he’s always the same guy, it’s appealing, but tonight with his gruff voice he wasn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for moving the needle?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot amongst the headliners, the big three, Bernie, Biden and Warren.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike I said, Kamala is history, she killed her chances tonight, put a stake right through her own heart. Can Castro make hay from his appearance, be the new Harris? Possible, but doubtful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo what we want is the three leaders on stage, sans kumbaya, a no holds barred cage match that reveals the true identity of these people, who they really are.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBiden will be overwhelmed and fold. He’s not good with direct attacks, he’s too busy going through his mental Rolodex, trying to figure out how to come back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSanders will fight hard. But we’ve seen this act before, back in 2016, it’s hard for him to generate heat today, even though so many of his positions are right and he’s got the aforementioned passion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich leaves us with Elizabeth Warren. She’s the candidate by default.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe want to be led forward, which Biden certainly won’t do, he’s too much of an insider inured to the past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBernie’s Metallica. All rough-edged, delivering his message with emphasis, hammering it home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Elizabeth Warren is closer to Ariana Grande. Someone who has a backbone who is the flavor of the moment. Warren’s not Taylor Swift, she’s not that devious and manipulative, she’s playing for her positions, not herself, and that’s appealing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut this show was not. Makes you want to give up on politics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne thing’s for sure, Trump was speaking English, he made the debates his own, he owned the stage, he defined the game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that appealed to people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVery little appealed to people tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"pf-content\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e~~~\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVisit the archive:

After moving to San Francisco for his MBA, he found his way to the city of Asheville, N.C., where he noticed a population unfamiliar with the deliciousness known as Indian street food. If the success of Irani’s first restaurant is any indication of what the reaction was to chaat, lamb burgers, and uttapam crepes, it’s safe to say this vibrant cuisine was well received. The restaurant group now counts five locations and a spice company across three different cities, including one of the most revered of all Southern food institutions, a barbecue joint. “What identifying as a Southerner means is that I now participate in the region\u0026#8217;s growth and evolution instead of being a passive bystander,” explains Irani, who’s hospitality group also sponsors a trip to India for select staff members. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image is-resized\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Bhel-Puri-with-Ingredients-Molly-Milroy.jpg?w=990\" alt=\"Bhel Puri with Ingredients - Molly Milroy\" class=\"wp-image-2696898\" width=\"650\" srcset=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Bhel-Puri-with-Ingredients-Molly-Milroy.jpg 3713w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Bhel-Puri-with-Ingredients-Molly-Milroy.jpg?resize=145,150 145w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Bhel-Puri-with-Ingredients-Molly-Milroy.jpg?resize=290,300 290w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Bhel-Puri-with-Ingredients-Molly-Milroy.jpg?resize=768,794 768w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Bhel-Puri-with-Ingredients-Molly-Milroy.jpg?resize=990,1024 990w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Bhel-Puri-with-Ingredients-Molly-Milroy.jpg?resize=205,212 205w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Bhel-Puri-with-Ingredients-Molly-Milroy.jpg?resize=486,503 486w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Bhel-Puri-with-Ingredients-Molly-Milroy.jpg?resize=97,100 97w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Bhel-Puri-with-Ingredients-Molly-Milroy.jpg?resize=58,60 58w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Bhel-Puri-with-Ingredients-Molly-Milroy.jpg?resize=149,154 149w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Bhel-Puri-with-Ingredients-Molly-Milroy.jpg?resize=1045,1080 1045w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Bhel-Puri-with-Ingredients-Molly-Milroy.jpg?resize=381,394 381w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Bhel-Puri-with-Ingredients-Molly-Milroy.jpg?resize=392,405 392w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Bhel-Puri-with-Ingredients-Molly-Milroy.jpg?resize=162,168 162w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Bhel-Puri-with-Ingredients-Molly-Milroy.jpg?resize=450,465 450w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Bhel-Puri-with-Ingredients-Molly-Milroy.jpg?resize=151,156 151w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Bhel-Puri-with-Ingredients-Molly-Milroy.jpg?resize=322,333 322w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Bhel-Puri-with-Ingredients-Molly-Milroy.jpg?resize=372,385 372w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Bhel-Puri-with-Ingredients-Molly-Milroy.jpg?resize=600,620 600w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Bhel-Puri-with-Ingredients-Molly-Milroy.jpg?resize=90,93 90w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Bhel-Puri-with-Ingredients-Molly-Milroy.jpg?resize=119,123 119w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Bhel-Puri-with-Ingredients-Molly-Milroy.jpg?resize=115,119 115w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Bhel-Puri-with-Ingredients-Molly-Milroy.jpg?resize=476,492 476w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Bhel-Puri-with-Ingredients-Molly-Milroy.jpg?resize=501,518 501w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3713px) 100vw, 3713px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eBhel Puri at Chai Pani.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"image-credit\"\u003eCourtesy of Molly Milroy\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBridging the gap between the old world and new is something all immigrants must face.

The chef is also quick to point out that Indian food really isn’t that different from what people might think of when they hear the phrase “Southern fare.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Vish-Dish-1-Credit-Jeffery-Grimes.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Vish Dish 1 Credit Jeffery Grimes\" class=\"wp-image-2696768\" srcset=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Vish-Dish-1-Credit-Jeffery-Grimes.jpg 4032w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Vish-Dish-1-Credit-Jeffery-Grimes.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Vish-Dish-1-Credit-Jeffery-Grimes.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Vish-Dish-1-Credit-Jeffery-Grimes.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Vish-Dish-1-Credit-Jeffery-Grimes.jpg?resize=1024,768 1024w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Vish-Dish-1-Credit-Jeffery-Grimes.jpg?resize=281,212 281w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Vish-Dish-1-Credit-Jeffery-Grimes.jpg?resize=671,503 671w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Vish-Dish-1-Credit-Jeffery-Grimes.jpg?resize=100,75 100w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Vish-Dish-1-Credit-Jeffery-Grimes.jpg?resize=60,45 60w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Vish-Dish-1-Credit-Jeffery-Grimes.jpg?resize=154,116 154w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Vish-Dish-1-Credit-Jeffery-Grimes.jpg?resize=1440,1080 1440w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Vish-Dish-1-Credit-Jeffery-Grimes.jpg?resize=525,394 525w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Vish-Dish-1-Credit-Jeffery-Grimes.jpg?resize=392,294 392w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Vish-Dish-1-Credit-Jeffery-Grimes.jpg?resize=224,168 224w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Vish-Dish-1-Credit-Jeffery-Grimes.jpg?resize=620,465 620w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Vish-Dish-1-Credit-Jeffery-Grimes.jpg?resize=208,156 208w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Vish-Dish-1-Credit-Jeffery-Grimes.jpg?resize=444,333 444w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Vish-Dish-1-Credit-Jeffery-Grimes.jpg?resize=513,385 513w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Vish-Dish-1-Credit-Jeffery-Grimes.jpg?resize=600,450 600w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Vish-Dish-1-Credit-Jeffery-Grimes.jpg?resize=90,68 90w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Vish-Dish-1-Credit-Jeffery-Grimes.jpg?resize=80,60 80w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Vish-Dish-1-Credit-Jeffery-Grimes.jpg?resize=164,123 164w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Vish-Dish-1-Credit-Jeffery-Grimes.jpg?resize=115,86 115w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Vish-Dish-1-Credit-Jeffery-Grimes.jpg?resize=656,492 656w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Vish-Dish-1-Credit-Jeffery-Grimes.jpg?resize=691,518 691w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Vish-Dish-1-Credit-Jeffery-Grimes.jpg?resize=1376,1032 1376w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Vish-Dish-1-Credit-Jeffery-Grimes.jpg?resize=1044,783 1044w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Vish-Dish-1-Credit-Jeffery-Grimes.jpg?resize=632,474 632w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Vish-Dish-1-Credit-Jeffery-Grimes.jpg?resize=536,402 536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 4032px) 100vw, 4032px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eRice dish from Vishwesh Bhatt\u0026#8217;s Snackbar.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"image-credit\"\u003eCourtesy of Jeffrey Grimes\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFrom rice grown in the Mississippi \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/fortune500/delta-air-lines-68/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDelta\u003c/a\u003e to black pepper and cumin which have been part of the region since America became a player in the spice trade, the connection between regions is closer than geography might suggest. “Let’s not forget that the “New World” was “discovered” by someone looking for a sea route to India,” Bhatt notes. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eDinner \u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“To me, a lot of my experiences cooking Indian cuisine in the South has been about finding familiarity in a cuisine that is not familiar,” recalls Maneet Chauhan.

After two years as a cottage business out of her home, the shop allows her to expand her business to folks looking for less than entire wedding or birthday cake. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Bellingham-Restaurants-Saltadena-chocolate-Salt-Pepper-Cake-Slice.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Bellingham Restaurants-Saltadena-chocolate Salt \u0026amp; Pepper Cake Slice\" class=\"wp-image-2696741\" srcset=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Bellingham-Restaurants-Saltadena-chocolate-Salt-Pepper-Cake-Slice.jpg 2880w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Bellingham-Restaurants-Saltadena-chocolate-Salt-Pepper-Cake-Slice.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Bellingham-Restaurants-Saltadena-chocolate-Salt-Pepper-Cake-Slice.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Bellingham-Restaurants-Saltadena-chocolate-Salt-Pepper-Cake-Slice.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Bellingham-Restaurants-Saltadena-chocolate-Salt-Pepper-Cake-Slice.jpg?resize=1024,682 1024w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Bellingham-Restaurants-Saltadena-chocolate-Salt-Pepper-Cake-Slice.jpg?resize=281,187 281w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Bellingham-Restaurants-Saltadena-chocolate-Salt-Pepper-Cake-Slice.jpg?resize=755,503 755w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Bellingham-Restaurants-Saltadena-chocolate-Salt-Pepper-Cake-Slice.jpg?resize=100,67 100w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Bellingham-Restaurants-Saltadena-chocolate-Salt-Pepper-Cake-Slice.jpg?resize=60,40 60w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Bellingham-Restaurants-Saltadena-chocolate-Salt-Pepper-Cake-Slice.jpg?resize=154,103 154w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Bellingham-Restaurants-Saltadena-chocolate-Salt-Pepper-Cake-Slice.jpg?resize=591,394 591w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Bellingham-Restaurants-Saltadena-chocolate-Salt-Pepper-Cake-Slice.jpg?resize=392,261 392w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Bellingham-Restaurants-Saltadena-chocolate-Salt-Pepper-Cake-Slice.jpg?resize=252,168 252w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Bellingham-Restaurants-Saltadena-chocolate-Salt-Pepper-Cake-Slice.jpg?resize=697,465 697w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Bellingham-Restaurants-Saltadena-chocolate-Salt-Pepper-Cake-Slice.jpg?resize=234,156 234w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Bellingham-Restaurants-Saltadena-chocolate-Salt-Pepper-Cake-Slice.jpg?resize=500,333 500w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Bellingham-Restaurants-Saltadena-chocolate-Salt-Pepper-Cake-Slice.jpg?resize=578,385 578w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Bellingham-Restaurants-Saltadena-chocolate-Salt-Pepper-Cake-Slice.jpg?resize=600,400 600w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Bellingham-Restaurants-Saltadena-chocolate-Salt-Pepper-Cake-Slice.jpg?resize=90,60 90w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Bellingham-Restaurants-Saltadena-chocolate-Salt-Pepper-Cake-Slice.jpg?resize=185,123 185w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Bellingham-Restaurants-Saltadena-chocolate-Salt-Pepper-Cake-Slice.jpg?resize=115,77 115w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Bellingham-Restaurants-Saltadena-chocolate-Salt-Pepper-Cake-Slice.jpg?resize=738,492 738w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Bellingham-Restaurants-Saltadena-chocolate-Salt-Pepper-Cake-Slice.jpg?resize=777,518 777w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2880px) 100vw, 2880px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eSaltadena\u0026#8217;s signature flavor, Chocolate Salt and Pepper cake.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"image-credit\"\u003eCourtesy of Jessie Bennett Photography\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHer slices come in flavors like chocolate salt and pepper, lemon raspberry, and the fascinating vanilla bean cake with sweet corn buttercream inside and salted honey buttercream outside, sprinkled with freeze-dried corn dust and salted caramel crispy pearls. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she also makes an individual treat called Lil Scrappies.

The fog is so thick and ever-present the locals have named it Karl. But inside, surrounded by whitewashed walls and blonde wood, a small team are designing and shipping distinctive women\u0026#8217;s shoes made entirely of recycled water bottles knitted into a soft, flexible flat. The shoes have captured the attention of women across the country—and some big investors, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eDown a steep stairway and through a cavern of rooms, sits the Rothy’s design studio. Amidst vibrant spools of thread made from water bottles and mood boards with color swatches, Creative Director Erin Lowenberg and her team have been working since January on a new silhouette: an ankle boot called The Chelsea, which launched this week.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe company that made its mark with ballet-style flats and then expanded with a sneaker is giving its customers what they have been asking for since nearly the beginning, which is to be able to wear their Rothy’s all year-round. Customers gave prodigious feedback about wanting a shoe that covered more of their foot and Rothy’s, which thinks a lot about their product being at “the front of the closet,” wanted to have “more seasonal relevance in the back half of the year,” Lowenberg said.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe design team used the Chelsea boot as inspiration for its version, both for its practicality and as a proven silhouette that “we could make beautiful and comfortable,” Lowenberg said. They began with the Rothy\u0026#8217;s sneaker’s sole as the foundation, given its additional height and thickness. The team quickly determined that to align with the previous silhouettes’ washability and materials, they wouldn’t introduce a zipper or leather, which meant the boot would need to stretch open and have a pull tab in the back. And which meant like all the previous designs, with no laces or closures, the fit had to be perfect.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSome might argue that Rothy\u0026#8217;s timing has been pretty perfect as well. The company has burst onto the scene as little known practices in the retail world have come under public scrutiny in the last couple of years, particularly the problem of what to do with the millions of units of clothing and shoes that go unsold each season. Some end up donated, a lot of it ends up in a landfill and then the remainder is—literally—incinerated. Rothy\u0026#8217;s hasn\u0026#8217;t just made use of innovative materials, it has designed a whole supply chain that has taken the industry’s traditional chain bogged down with scrapped material, overproduction of product and energy costs on transporting excess down to “virtually zero,” according to its founders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStartup story\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eRothy\u0026#8217;s was founded back in 2012, when co-founder Roth Martin, who was ready to leave the gallery world, noticed the proliferation of Lululemon yoga pants in San Francisco—on his wife, at the grocery store, downtown, everywhere. And while the stretchy black pants had gone from being a niche piece to a wardrobe staple, swinging from styled casually to more put together, there was not a shoe equivalent. Over dinner one night, Martin told his friend, Stephen Hawthornthwaite, about what appeared to be an opportunity for a woman’s flat that was comfortable enough to be a staple, but more stylish than a workout shoe—and used innovative materials. Hawthornethwaite, it so happened, was looking to exit finance for something more entrepreneurial.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWithin a year, the duo had determined that the flat would be made out of plastic water bottles, something in plentiful supply and not entirely new to the textile world, thanks to Patagonia’s fleeced yarn. The Rothy’s pair decided to develop a non-fleeced yarn from the plastic bottles (that have been melted into pellets and then extruded into soft, flexible strands) that could be knitted. The next step in sustainability was in how to use the yarn. They had discovered during this process how wasteful shoe manufacturing could be, how much raw material ends up on the cutting room floor, and so they decided to eliminate the cutting process. If they could develop a 3D knitting process for the entire upper, which hadn’t been done, then Rothy’s would be using only material that went into the shoe, no more.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnother year was spent in a factory in Maine making prototype after prototype—“it was a very long development time to get this process correct,” Martin says. But the 3D knitting meant no cutting at all, which meant no seams, which meant no additional construction, which meant the fit had to be perfect. The pair concluded that the scale and skill to achieve this meant going to China. There is a very small margin for error in the printing process, and the depth in skilled labor with the programming and the finishing work done by hand, including stitching the upper to the rubber sole, in 55 more steps off the knitting machine, was only available there. Martin and Hawthornthwaite also knew they couldn’t contract it out. “It is so hard to do, it’s why we had to set up our own manufacturing process that’s not one that’s easy to replicate,” Martin said.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2015, they set up shop in Dongguan with two knitting machines and a programmer. The following year, they began selling their first batch online in the U.S., while continuing to build out a factory in the southern Chinese city.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe flat was an immediate success and the company soon added a pointed toe style, now the most popular, and then a loafer and a sneaker. Rothy’s high-touch direct-to-consumer model and heavy social media made an immediate impact. The aesthetic and the sustainability story are intertwined and interdependent. The women who wear Rothy’s enjoy the water bottle origin story of their shoe, that it telegraphs a message as innovative or responsible as you want, but they wouldn’t wear them if they didn’t love how they look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOn the \u0026#8216;gram\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe company continuously refreshes its connection with the consumer, sending regular emails with updates on a color launch, styling ideas or teasing a new silhouette. The shoe company has over 250,000 followers on Instagram and such a developed brand identity that its Rothy’s wearers, not its marketing department, who are responsible for the thousands of posts of #rothysinthewild and #liveseamlessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThree years in, Rothy’s wearers acknowledge each other with a shared look or brief nod and are used to being approached in public, “Are those the….?” Everyone who owns a pair of Rothy’s has, at least once, stepped out of their pair and insisted that an inquirer try them on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eLowenberg and her team keep the interest level high, launching new hues and patterns every few months, while swapping out colors and one-off designs and sending them into retirement. Some might come back, some might never return. It’s a constant curation, while certain classics—a navy loafer, the black point (worn by Meghan Markle in New Zealand on her first international tour)—remain in stock. This year, they launched a “honeycomb” style and added a mesh texture for the summer. The design team likes to surprise and delight with small capsule launches, a birds-eye pattern or a bright coral camo or an orange pull tab on a normally all-charcoal sneaker, capsules that are “fun and they aren’t meant to be massive volume drivers, as much as they’re emotional and they keep our website fresh and it’s what we can do differently than any other footwear brand that isn’t knit,” she explained.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMartin and Hawthornethwaite bootstrapped the financing of the development process, and once they went to market, the shoes were profitable. The limited outside capital in the early days was by design, Martin said, and the first $5 million from Lightspeed Venture Partners in April 2017 was unsolicited. Jeremy Liew, who was the first investor in Snapchat, said he and his partners noticed the brand as the flats proliferated amongst friends and colleagues. “The fact the product generated that sort of enthusiasm, that reputation, not just in people loving the product and buying it, but evangelizing it to their friends.” So Lightspeed called Rothy’s, which wasn’t looking to raise capital, and convinced the company their capital could help meet the demand.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eRothy’s pulled in $140 million in revenue in 2018 and President and COO Kerry Cooper confirms the expectation that Rothy’s will double that by the end of this year. At the end of 2018, \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/fortune500/goldman-sachs-group-74/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGoldman Sachs\u003c/a\u003e infused $35 million into the company, bringing its outside funding up to $42 million and a valuation of $700 million.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSome of the funding was used to open Rothy’s tiny flagship store on Fillmore Street in May of last year, and the company has plans to add five more stores this fall, in markets like New York, Washington, D.C. and Boston, where there are large pockets of knitted flats wearers.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd some of that capital has been continuing to fund the real growth-driver that is in Dongguan, China. The Rothy’s factory now is 250,000 square feet, has over 450 employees and 260 knitting machines, 20 of which are used just for product development.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAlmost 99% of the shoes in the United States are imported from elsewhere, 70% from China. In the last few years, amid political and trade uncertainties, as well as some rising labor costs, some bigger shoe brands have been slowly reducing their dependence on Chinese factories, diversifying their manufacturing to other countries in Asia, India and Bangladesh, and even Mexico. Now the industry is bracing for the impact of the 15% tariffs on Chinese imports, including almost all footwear, that went into effect on Sept. 1. The CFDA, the FDRA and more than 200 companies, called for their cancellation and spelled out  the uncertainty of the supply chain, as well as the equal uncertainty on the shared hit to company and customer of rising costs, as much as $4 billion. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eCooper acknowledges that Rothy’s is all in on China. There is no option to diversify, based on tariffs. The company will absorb the impact, though doesn’t seem terribly worried it will lower the margin. “For us, there is so much skilled labor in China, and the supply chain is so strong that our production in China is incredibly efficient. Ultimately, we’re not concerned about tariffs impacting our bottom line,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eEven if Rothy’s remains the last American company producing shoes in Dongguan, the company’s decision to build its own factory, rather than contract out, might be the biggest factor in Rothy’s success. Because unlike \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/fortune500/nike-91/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eNike\u003c/a\u003e or Converse or Keds, Rothy’s owns and controls its entire supply chain, down to the materials used and the elimination of production excess. Because of its DTC model, it now has years of data about what silhouettes sell in what colors in what markets. When Rothy’s launches a new color, it knows after one day of selling if it will continue making it that night, producing just enough pairs to keep stock in line with demand. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe company generally has a good sense of what the Rothy’s customer likes, but there are always surprises. Lowenberg was delighted that the point in copper, a springtime hue, was so popular it briefly surpassed the black point. On the flip side, a subtle black and navy camo print she thought was going to be a hit got a cool reception. And while points almost always outperform flats in the same color, the round-toe has surged past in the fig python. And so they adjust.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe course correction is much smaller than ordering 18 months out and producing (and shipping) too much or not enough by the end of the selling cycle. When Rothy’s was on the cusp of launching its first non-knitted silhouette in the spring, a sandal made of vegan leather, it only discovered quality issues in the final sample batch less than 48 hours before going on sale. The team decided to pull the launch, better to not go into production if quality was remotely a question mark—and emailed customers, who’d days earlier gotten news of the sandal, to let them know it was called off. It was an unexpected step from the company, who pushed up its launch of honeycomb in summer colors ten days early, that quickly receded because the explanation made sense. (Cooper says the sandal will still make its appearance in 2020.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLasting impact\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMartin is now interim CEO after Hawthornthwaite stepped back in June for health reasons. He thinks that while the company\u0026#8217;s shoes are certainly innovative, it\u0026#8217;s Rothy\u0026#8217;s production strategy that could have the biggest impact. \u0026#8220;We’re not committing materials to something that’s maybe not going to get sold and we’re not committing to shipping it around the world unnecessarily. We’re not committing to making boxes to put products in that may not get sold and the industry is just broken in this way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe four-year process to create and reliably produce the shoe’s perfect fit, and which had been such a headache, ended up eliminating many of the challenges the rest of the footwear industry is now facing as brands grapple with how to address sustainability. There are few smaller brands like Rothy’s or Allbirds, another San Francisco-based shoe start-up that focused on using sustainable materials (in thier case wool and foam produced from sugar cane waste) to make one product really well with mindful manufacturing and then slowly expanded.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor some, the talk of sustainability is buzzy, but its meaning elusive—what does sustainability mean and who defines it? Sanford Bernstein’s Luca Solca says an industry shift is early in stage and that “today all certifications are self-defined and the heads of sustainability [at brands] are, in most cases, former heads of PR.” The luxury goods analyst believes that integrating better processes upstream in their manufacturing is the only “serious option” for shoe companies to transform.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAndy Polk, senior vice president at the FDRA, is optimistic that small steps will beget large change. “You really have to define what it means for your brand,” he said, and then companies need to measure things like shoe waste and what’s recyclable, water waste, energy usage, and digging in with suppliers, freight companies, warehouses. “Part of the ecosystem of mapping it out and figuring out where you can make improvements,” Polk said, implementing smaller changes and then going further on material and production innovation. The trade organization, of which 90% of the American shoe industry belongs, has turned much of its efforts to providing resources and tools for brands and retailers to shift to more sustainable models. One component of this is sharing knowledge amongst peers, of which Polk wishes that Rothy’s was doing more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“They have done a great job of focusing on the consumer and telling that story,” he said, but he thinks that Rothy’s has “an opportunity to be a real leader” and be more forthcoming and open about their own processes, which would encourage other brands to invest where needed and take on the risk of transforming their practices. “You know, a rising tide lifts all boats,” Poilk said.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSolca also thinks that a transparency, of sorts, is what will drive industry change and that smaller niche players, who “put their money where their mouth is on craftsmanship and sustainability” and make that apparent to the consumers on each product will pressure larger brands to do the same. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd the boot\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, the boot is kicking off in eight colors, three of which are patterns. You can see the bones of the sneaker in it, though the antique white of the sole is meant to look less sporty. Lowenberg says her current favorite is a muted charcoal and olive palette that looks like a modern neutral. “I love doing these neutrals,” she said. “Our customer loves an elevated, beautiful basic.”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis one is called Fog Melange. Perfect for fall—or year-round, in San Francisco.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eMore must-read stories from \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—\u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/09/08/spotify-playlists-wine-pairings/\"\u003eYour next Spotify playlist\u003c/a\u003e might be curated with wine pairings in mind\u003cbr\u003e—Tips and treats for \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/07/27/pet-travel-tips/%E2%80%8E\"\u003estress-free travel with pets\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e—\u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/31/sothebys-rare-watches-luxury-item-auctions/%E2%80%8E\"\u003eThe future of auctions might rely on luxury items\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e—This photographer is trying to shoot all \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/longform/frank-lloyd-wright-buildings-photos/%E2%80%8E\"\u003e431 Frank Lloyd Wright buildings\u003c/a\u003e around the world\u003cbr\u003e—How Etsy crafted an \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/07/25/etsy-ecommerce-growth-strategies/\"\u003ee-commerce comeback\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://flipboard.com/@fortune\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eFollow Fortune on Flipboard\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e \u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003eto stay up-to-date on the latest news and analysis.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://fortune.com/2019/09/15/sustainable-startup-rothys-eco-chelsea-boot-footwear/","published":"2019-09-15T15:41:12Z","guid":"https://fortune.com/?p=2695046"}]},{"url":"https://www.hotelbusiness.com/feed","items":[]},{"url":"https://rss.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Business.xml","items":[{"title":"Casper Dreams of Being Bigger Than Mattresses","content":"","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/13/business/casper-sleep.html?emc=rss\u0026partner=rss","published":"2019-09-15T03:03:48Z","guid":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/13/business/casper-sleep.html"},{"title":"Two Major Saudi Oil Installations Hit by Drone Strike, and U.S. Blames Iran","content":"","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/14/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-refineries-drone-attack.html?emc=rss\u0026partner=rss","published":"2019-09-15T01:06:14Z","guid":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/14/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-refineries-drone-attack.html"},{"title":"G.M. and Autoworkers in Talks on New Labor Contract","content":"","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/14/business/gm-and-autoworkers-in-talks-on-new-labor-contract.html?emc=rss\u0026partner=rss","published":"2019-09-15T01:16:27Z","guid":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/14/business/gm-and-autoworkers-in-talks-on-new-labor-contract.html"},{"title":"Vaping Bad: Were 2 Wisconsin Brothers the Walter Whites of THC Oils?","content":"","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/15/health/vaping-thc-wisconsin.html?emc=rss\u0026partner=rss","published":"2019-09-15T06:45:13Z","guid":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/15/health/vaping-thc-wisconsin.html"},{"title":"Opioid Defendants Seek to Disqualify Judge Overseeing 2,300 Cases","content":"","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/14/health/ohio-opioid-lawsuit-judge.html?emc=rss\u0026partner=rss","published":"2019-09-15T04:23:37Z","guid":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/14/health/ohio-opioid-lawsuit-judge.html"},{"title":"A Harvard Professor Doubles Down: If You Take Epstein’s Money, Do It in Secret","content":"","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/14/business/lessig-epstein-ito-mit.html?emc=rss\u0026partner=rss","published":"2019-09-15T02:32:12Z","guid":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/14/business/lessig-epstein-ito-mit.html"},{"title":"They’re Coming!

Debate","content":"\u003cp\u003eIt was boring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe whole world tuned in…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then the whole world tuned out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is why Roger Ailes succeeded, he knew it was all about showbiz, and the only person on stage who seemed to know this was Julian Castro. Yes, he was the big winner of the night, even though he called out Biden and was half-wrong. You see Castro came to win. A back of the pack softie, Castro demonstrated his fighting spirit, he stood up to Biden, laughed and rolled his eyes when somebody said something he thought was stupid or irrelevant. Now we know who Castro is. He certainly replaced Kamala Harris on the leaderboard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNever pay heed to the analysts. By attacking Trump and nobody on stage, Harris took herself right out of the picture. She seemed like she really didn’t want to be there, like a prosecutor on Friday who wants to wrap up and get out of court. She’s toast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs are the rest of the seven dwarves, other than the aforementioned Castro.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeto O’Rourke, he even said some good stuff, but who cares? He was last year’s flavor, now he’s just another young guy trying to make a name for himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKlobuchar? A strict mother who was pissed with the shenanigans who kept telling us she knew better and to trust her, that she could bring the whole country together…huh? Forget plans, just meet me in the middle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCory Booker? Okay, you’ve been there and done that, but what have you done for us lately? You didn’t solve the problems in Newark and now you want us to give you the keys to the Oval Office because..? I can’t figure out a reason why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Andrew Yang, who triumphed by speaking English as opposed to political-speak, blew his whole candidacy by turning it into a game show. Yup, he was gonna give a grand to ten families every month…and then let’s see what happens? Everybody else laughed. And when he said he knew about doctors because he was Asian, implying that the profession was filled with Asians, he demonstrated that he’s living in a bubble, that he doesn’t know the rules, that there are certain things you can’t say, but he did! Over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMayor Pete? He said some good things, he appeared wise, he regained some luster, but not enough to recover from the police problems in his hometown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich leaves us with the three real candidates…Joe, Bernie and Elizabeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWarren avoided the question. Which was especially bad since Bernie answered it. Will Medicare For All make taxes go up? Of course it will, own it and move on. But she waffled to her detriment. And by time she found her voice again, even spoke, deep into the debate, when she was hitting them over the fence with no problem, nobody was watching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBernie killed, but his voice was shot, you couldn’t stop thinking he’d yelled so much that he’d worn himself out. One thing you can say for Bernie, and Elizabeth too, is that they’re passionate. Actually, they were the only two on stage who were. They were convinced what they were saying was true, they uttered it with emphasis, this stuff was important to them. The others? You wondered why they were on stage, because they certainly have no chance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther than Joe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ll tell you, he’s from another era, with those teeth. As fake as can be. Bernie’s are yellow, Elizabeth’s imperfect, yet Joe’s look like Jim Carrey’s in “The Mask.” And he’s constantly fake smiling. Hell, that was the playbook in the last century, today we’re looking for authenticity and credibility, and the way Joe acts you just don’t buy it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he was creaky. He always seemed on the verge of forgetting something, a name, what he was talking about, it was uncomfortable watching him, you were willing him to get it right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he also came from the “trust me” school. Been there, done that, I’m the man. But Castro killed him by pointing out his selective embracement of Obama, saying he was with Barack when it suited him, and distancing himself when it didn’t. You can’t have it both ways. And the truth is Obama’s been out of office nearly three years, and the time has changed. Hell, we all like Obama, except for those who believe he was born in Kenya, but that doesn’t make him a great President. Hell, no one’s been a better ex-President than Jimmy Carter, he’s been on the right side of everything, advocating, unafraid of standing up to those who are wrong, but his term in office? Not so great.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet’s see, Obama lost both houses of Congress and many governorships and state houses, to the point where he couldn’t get his agenda through. And as soon as he was gone, Trump and the Republicans eradicated/overturned almost all of his policies, clean water just today. But this is the guy we’re advocating and adoring? I don’t think so. Obama’s closer to a boy band. Hell, late twenty and thirtysomethings are going to see the Backstreet Boys, but today’s chart is dominated by Drake and Post Malone. We ain’t going backwards folks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd after the candidates argued over health care, they became so lovey-dovey, team-like, that the debate was impossible to watch. Once again, the pundits had said not to have a circular firing squad and everybody agreed. The end result? The audience tuned out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there were few specifics, other than trumpeting their CVs. That’s why Bernie and Elizabeth stood out, there were some hooks in what they said. I mean when you talk broadly and say you’re gonna throw fifty mil at this or that…no one believes it, it’s too general, it doesn’t affect me if it even happens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Warren owned public schools. And someone else, either Yang or Castro, said that charter schools are not better than public ones. And Warren essentially came out against vouchers. Like I said, there was some substance there. But most of it was uttered after the audience had tuned out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo what it came down to, assuming you watched, was emotion and image. Who was the most likeable, who was the most sincere, who had the best delivery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrump pushes the envelope every damn day and tonight everybody but Sanders bunts. Got to give Bernie credit, he stays true to his ethos, he’s always the same guy, it’s appealing, but tonight with his gruff voice he wasn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for moving the needle?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot amongst the headliners, the big three, Bernie, Biden and Warren.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike I said, Kamala is history, she killed her chances tonight, put a stake right through her own heart. Can Castro make hay from his appearance, be the new Harris? Possible, but doubtful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo what we want is the three leaders on stage, sans kumbaya, a no holds barred cage match that reveals the true identity of these people, who they really are.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBiden will be overwhelmed and fold. He’s not good with direct attacks, he’s too busy going through his mental Rolodex, trying to figure out how to come back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSanders will fight hard. But we’ve seen this act before, back in 2016, it’s hard for him to generate heat today, even though so many of his positions are right and he’s got the aforementioned passion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich leaves us with Elizabeth Warren. She’s the candidate by default.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe want to be led forward, which Biden certainly won’t do, he’s too much of an insider inured to the past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBernie’s Metallica. All rough-edged, delivering his message with emphasis, hammering it home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Elizabeth Warren is closer to Ariana Grande. Someone who has a backbone who is the flavor of the moment. Warren’s not Taylor Swift, she’s not that devious and manipulative, she’s playing for her positions, not herself, and that’s appealing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut this show was not. Makes you want to give up on politics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne thing’s for sure, Trump was speaking English, he made the debates his own, he owned the stage, he defined the game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that appealed to people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVery little appealed to people tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"pf-content\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e~~~\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVisit the archive:

Plot Against Persona","content":"\u003cp class=\"dropcap\"\u003eIt’s always been intuitive to think of Lana Del Rey as a “character”: some fiction combining Jessica Rabbit and Joan Didion, drawn up around 2010 by the real human Lizzy Grant. And it’s always been wrong, supposedly. “Never had a persona,” Del Rey tweeted earlier this month. “Never needed one. Never will.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat statement came amid Del Rey’s diss of an essay by the NPR music critic Ann Powers. In more than 3,500 careful words about the new album \u003cem\u003eNorman Fucking Rockwell\u003c/em\u003e, Powers had saluted Del Rey’s use of pastiche, cliché, and, yes, persona. She also said that some of the songwriting felt “uncooked.” Del Rey didn’t like that. “I don’t even relate to one observation you made about the music,” \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/LanaDelRey/status/1169486181626630144?s=20\"\u003eshe tweeted\u003c/a\u003e at Powers. “There’s nothing uncooked about me.

Music criticism is in a relevance crisis—publications are closing and streaming threatens to render parts of the job obsolete—so why are musicians sweating negative feedback so much? Maybe the world of social media makes artists more exposed and encourages them to hit back. And maybe the role of the persona, a crucial concept in pop history, is in flux.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDel Rey’s assertion that she’s never had a persona is laughable given how much flack she’s gotten for seeming to live in costume. She has a stage name that \u003ca href=\"https://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/music/has-lana-del-rey-earned-her-gangster-nancy-sinatra-reputation-1.357214\"\u003eshe said the music industry coaxed her to adopt\u003c/a\u003e. She has a fashion shtick so well-defined that people can go as her for Halloween. She writes lyrics in a style that makes it seem like she wormholed from an early ’70s LSD cult and then tried to learn modern slang from a Rihanna song. Her defenders have always said that it \u003ca href=\"https://www.spin.com/2012/01/deconstructing-lana-del-rey/\"\u003eshouldn’t matter that she’s artificial\u003c/a\u003e, as all great pop musicians are. But it’s clear now that that’s not actually how she wants to be defended: She rejects the premise of the entire conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e* * *\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"dropcap\"\u003eIn 2013, an old song by Lana Del Rey \u003ca href=\"https://www.stereogum.com/1415431/lana-del-rey-blasts-lady-gaga-in-leaked-so-legit/mp3s/\"\u003eleaked\u003c/a\u003e, and it was a doozie: a diss track against Lady Gaga. Before either woman had become famous, both had played in New York City nightlife circuits. It appeared they were friends, but the Del Rey song, “So Legit,” seemed to blast Gaga as talentless and fake. “You’re looking like a man, you’re talking like a baby,” Del Rey sang, airing some very-common-in-2009 idiocies directed at Gaga. “How the fuck is your song in a Coke commercial? Crazy.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe notion of a divide between Del Rey and Gaga—both of whom have grappled with charges of inauthenticity over the years—is instructive. Back at the start of her career, Gaga entranced the press as a shapeshifting cartoon creature who gave sassy-cryptic interviews. There was no doubting that the “fame monster” Gaga was an entertaining fabulation, even though she’d go around \u003ca href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/lady-gaga-worships-queen-and-refuses-to-wear-pants-80060/\"\u003esaying things like\u003c/a\u003e, “The largest misconception is that Lady Gaga is a persona or a character. I’m not—even my mother calls me Gaga. I am 150,000 percent Lady Gaga every day.” Such statements could be brushed off as method acting. After all, her obvious predecessors—Madonna, Prince—often didn’t break character in their early days. David Bowie \u003ca href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/flashback-ziggy-stardust-commits-rock-and-roll-suicide-at-final-gig-53974/\"\u003eheld funerals\u003c/a\u003e for his personas once he was ready to move on from them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMove on, Gaga did. After pushing her couture and her sonic bombast ever more outlandishly through 2013’s \u003ci\u003eArtpop\u003c/i\u003e, she began an act of striptease, with pared-back albums and a \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/09/lady-gagas-illness-is-not-a-metaphor/540369/?utm_source=feed\"\u003edocumentary\u003c/a\u003e that purported to show the “real” her. She talks now about Gaga as, yes, a persona, something outside of herself. “It is a bit of a creation,” \u003ca href=\"https://time.com/4361123/lady-gaga-stefani-germanotta-true-self/\"\u003eshe said\u003c/a\u003e in 2016. “But it’s other people that have created [it] through what I’ve made; their perception of what Gaga is, is a separate entity from me.” But the persona isn’t gone: See all of her high-concept \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/10/does-lady-gaga-sell-out-star-born/572074/?utm_source=feed\"\u003erunway moments promoting \u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/10/does-lady-gaga-sell-out-star-born/572074/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eA Star Is Born\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/em\u003e(the showtunes-singing Italian American family girl we see in latter-day Gaga projects is a performance, too). In taking on that movie role, Gaga underlined the idea that she, like her character, Ally, built up a persona that she could then remove at will.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDel Rey arrived at fame in 2012, and she seemed both out of time and perfectly timed. Just as Instagram’s nostalgic filters and the bricolage identity-curation platforms like Pinterest were catching on, here was someone gluing together disparate references using a Super 8 aesthetic. Her music combined Golden Hollywood strings with hip-hop skittering, which fit the lyrics of someone who called herself “gangster Nancy Sinatra.” If this was “pop,” it was also weird. The music unfolded too slowly to fit with the \u003cem\u003euntz-untz\u003c/em\u003e trends that Gaga led. Del Rey was out of step in a deeper way, too: her politics.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDel Rey’s shtick was insistently feminine—“This Is What Makes Us Girls,” went the title of \u003ci\u003eBorn to Die\u003c/i\u003e’s glorious closing track—but it wasn’t \u003ci\u003efeminist\u003c/i\u003e in an obvious way. In her breakout single, “Video Games,” she doted on a remote, neglectful man. Most of her debut’s songs did something similar to this while also contemplating death and suffering as something glamorous. This was unusual in the 2012 moment, when explicit embraces of “empowerment” had become key to pop performance. Sympathetic reviewers over the years found ways to read Del Rey as subversive: She satirized that which she sang about, and she made space for female sadness, and she embraced the freedom to be whoever she wanted. All such readings required leaning heavily on the notion of persona. Del Rey \u003ci\u003ehad \u003c/i\u003eto be singing one thing when she really meant another.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eShe didn’t say that was so, though. In 2015, \u003ca href=\"https://www.nme.com/features/a-letter-from-lana-del-rey-the-full-nme-cover-interview-757009\"\u003eshe said\u003c/a\u003e, “I definitely don’t need a persona to create music, it’s not a David Bowie type of thing necessarily.” In another interview she \u003ca href=\"https://www.complex.com/music/lana-del-rey-interview-2017-cover-story\"\u003ebrushed off the idea\u003c/a\u003e that she was working in the realm of exaggeration, instead hinting at biography: “You know, there’s a lot of stuff I could’ve not said in the songs and I said it anyway. It didn’t always serve me to talk about some of the men I was with and what that was like, and then not comment on it further.” One track that surely seemed like parody, 2014’s “Fucked My Way to the Top,” she clarified, was truth telling about \u003ca href=\"https://www.thefader.com/2014/06/04/cover-story-lana-del-rey-is-anyone-she-wants-to-be\"\u003ea relationship she had\u003c/a\u003e with a label executive.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMaybe Del Rey’s just trolling. But at a certain point it becomes weird to not take her own words at face value. Over the years, she’s basically kept singing about the same things, with ever so slight shifts. On the title track of her new album, \u003ci\u003eNorman Fucking Rockwell\u003c/i\u003e, she mocks the overconfident male type who she would have once swooned for—but she does, however, still swoon. Though her four albums since \u003ci\u003eBorn to Die \u003c/i\u003ehave been very good, they’ve not been very evolutionary. One album will lean \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/07/lana-del-rey-lust-for-life-review/534816/?utm_source=feed\"\u003emore pop\u003c/a\u003e and one will lean \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/09/lana-del-rey-honeymoon-review-stopping-time-alone/406027/?utm_source=feed\"\u003emore opera\u003c/a\u003e. There’s more space, and nuance, and harmonic yumminess on \u003ci\u003eNorman Fucking Rockwell\u003c/i\u003e than ever before. Mostly, though, there’s Lana Del Rey being Lana Del Rey. Which is who?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e* * *\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"dropcap\"\u003eAnn Powers’s essay imagined that Del Rey is exactly who she’s said she’s been. It started by taking something the musician said in an interview, about spending most of her time at the beach, not as some fabulous exaggeration from a pop trickster but as an actual biographical tidbit—and then speculated on \u003ci\u003ewhich\u003c/i\u003e beach might suit her. It went on to evaluate Del Rey on the terms she’s always asked to be evaluated on: as a “singer-songwriter” in the lineage of “Joni Mitchell or Tori Amos” with “piano, lyric poetry, a voice cultivated by singing hymns and lullabies” to achieve “legible expressiveness.” Across \u003cem\u003eNorman Fucking Rockwell\u003c/em\u003e, Powers wrote, Del Rey presents herself as “a woman sitting at a keyboard, singing what she needs to say.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePowers went on to say, however, that Del Rey’s singer-songwriterliness wasn’t what made her “an interesting artist.” Instead it was “her compulsion to collapse logic, to violate boundaries musically, through imagery and within her storytelling.” This is correct. It’s Del Rey’s meta-meanings, the way she signals and evokes and alludes, that make her obsession-worthy—not what’s in the words but what’s in between them, and around them. When Del Rey \u003ca href=\"https://www.thefader.com/2019/05/20/lana-del-rey-sublime-doin-time-song-of-the-summer\"\u003epicks Sublime’s “Doin’ Time” up\u003c/a\u003e from the used-CD bin and delivers a deadpan femme-fatale version, she is conveying not just a melody but also something more ambiguous about gender and place and genre and love. “For Del Rey, the mash-up of affects and references is the point,” Powers wrote. “It is emotion’s actuality.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eEmotion’s actuality\u003c/em\u003e should be the songwriter’s dream, and Powers said Del Rey achieved it. So why the singer objected isn’t quite clear—though her clapback gives the impression that she thinks Powers overcomplicated things\u003cspan\u003e. “My gift is the warmth I live my life with and the self reflection I share generously,” she tweeted, which is a funny statement on multiple levels. The Del Rey who comes across in song is many things, but “warm” is not among them. She certainly doesn’t seem to be simply \u003cem\u003esharing\u003c/em\u003e her feelings, like a diarist. She is mediating them. She is slotting them in a cultural context. They’re all the more powerful for that.\u003c/span\u003e It’s tempting to wonder if \u003cspan\u003eDel Rey bristled \u003c/span\u003e\u003ci\u003ebecause\u003c/i\u003e\u003cspan\u003e Powers got it right: She noticed how the magic trick works.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOr the disagreement could really be about persona. Powers wrote of Lizzy Grant creating a “character” out of her subconscious (and America’s), but what if it’s not a character? What if it’s literally her? In Del Rey’s Twitter bio, there is a quote: “Do I contradict myself? Very well then, I contradict myself; I am large - I contain multitudes.” That’s a Walt Whitman line that’s become such a platitude—who earnestly quotes Whitman in 2019 other than \u003ca href=\"https://www.pajiba.com/tv_reviews/recap-no-one-in-the-roy-family-knows-their-role-in-successions-tern-haven.php\"\u003eTV parodies of pretentious literary men\u003c/a\u003e?—that to a clever critic/listener/fan, it might seem like an in-joke. But maybe the hackneyed nature of Del Rey’s reference points—as Powers wrote, “no shout-out to Sylvia Plath can feel new, not since about 1981”—is not knowing after all. Maybe Del Rey has no interest in cliché as cliché. Maybe she wants to remove the meta-meaning and get back to the meaning. She just wants to say that she contains multitudes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDiscussions of “persona” in 2019 can’t help but entail citations of another dead male intellectual who’s been \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/08/tool-fear-inoculum-preview-why-band-matters/596419/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eover-quoted\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/1857/11/thom-yorke-anima-album-review-terrifying-beauty/592750/?preview=SPmF9NPKQpxQjKuRr1nSIfsrg80\u0026amp;utm_source=feed\"\u003eof late\u003c/a\u003e, Carl Jung. In Jung’s schemas, the perfection of the self requires bringing one’s persona—their “mask”—into accord with their ego and shadow. Identity crisis is ongoing, productive, and all-encompassing. In Del Rey’s music, however, there are no identity crises. She is not torn between being who someone else wants her to be and being who she is. Who she is \u003cem\u003eis\u003c/em\u003e someone who wants to be what someone else—some man, usually, historically—wants her to be. In an era of people willfully working out their identity in public, this steady blankness has made her one of the most striking and strangest figures around. We have no choice but to wonder if she’s kidding. That’s her intrigue.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOther players in pop music have, in disparate but related ways, moved to sideline persona as a helpful schematic: Fans are forbidden to separate the art and the artist. Take \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/04/billie-eilish-when-we-all-fall-asleep-spooky-fun/586303/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eBillie Eilish\u003c/a\u003e, one of the most fully realized, outlandish, superstar-level characters to arrive on the scene since Gaga. Blocky-graphic clothes and dead-eyed ghoul grins and music videos laden with spiders and goop—she’s a performance artist, most obviously. But she’s also a performer of great intimacy. On social media, her aesthetic is shaky verité. She insists that her goth-pop, hodgepodge songs connect to her actual experiences of nightmares and mental illness and ambition and heartbreak. You follow her and you do not get the sense of someone playing a role. You do not get curious about who she really is. You are instead mesmerized by her appearance of internal and exterior unity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGo down the list of today’s trending pop stars and you see similar stories of persona and person expertly made indistinguishable so as to inspire obsession among followers online. Ariana Grande once had the feel of being the Nickelodeon character she played and just transferring over to the music world; now, she mines the actual (or reported) drama of her grown-up life for quirky singalongs that tie in with whatever story she’s telling on Instagram. Cardi B’s music is absolutely an extension of the too-fabulous-to-believe human audiences have been shown on reality TV. Few mind the didacticism of the messages Lizzo slings in song because they are so deeply, ebulliently rooted in the life that we see her living in the public eye. These stars put on highly constructed spectacles for a living. They also insist on being seen as that thing once considered anathema to such spectacles: authentic.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s always been the case that personas are something for critics to investigate and for stars to deny the existence of. But such denials have never been as imperative for success as they are now. If Del Rey’s music has all along represented some credible version of her own reality, it’s all the more dazzling. Just imagine if this glamour, the pathos, the tragedy were actually real? And if it is fantasy, as so many have suspected, it is a fantasy of cohesion: life lived according to the tropes of art. Either way, it is not in her interest to encourage deconstruction. Firing off a logically preposterous, ethically dubious, but alluringly vicious barb at someone who earnestly attempts to do so is very much the kind of thing a Lana Del Rey would do.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/aphuI2alQzk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/aphuI2alQzk/","published":"2019-09-15T11:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-597883"},{"title":"A Prison Lifer Comes Home","content":"\u003cp class=\"dropcap\"\u003eHaywood “Red Dog” Fennell was finishing up work for the day, headed back to his cell at Pennsylvania’s largest-capacity prison, when a friend called him over, eager to share the news that had lit up the men’s tiny TV screens and sent shouts and whistles echoing down the long, cavernous cell block. It was June 25, 2012, and the U.S. Supreme Court had just ruled that mandatory life sentences without the possibility of parole were unconstitutional for juveniles. Pennsylvania had imposed that sentence on more kids than any other state—some 500 of them, many now in their 40s, 50s, and 60s.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMen who still had their mothers called home to share the news. The jailhouse lawyers got creative with petitions to speed their release. The religious men said prayers. Fennell didn’t see much cause to celebrate. Forty-eight years of incarceration for a role in a fatal mugging when he was 17, and 11 denied commutation applications, had hardened him against fantasies of freedom. Besides, Fennell was 20 years old by the time he was convicted and sentenced. He figured the Supreme Court decision didn’t even apply to him.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut then lawyers started coming from the Philadelphia public defender’s office, driving up the country road to Graterford state prison, set in what had once been rolling farm country and turned into suburban sprawl during Fennell’s time inside. Pennsylvania was resisting the ruling, declaring that it wasn’t retroactive, but the lawyers said it was only a matter of time before a court would disagree. Indeed, in 2016, a follow-up Supreme Court decision made it clear: The 2012 decision must be applied retroactively to the more than 2,000 people like Fennell who had been serving mandatory life sentences without parole for crimes committed when they were juveniles.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eToday, Pennsylvania, which incarcerated more juvenile lifers than any other state, has become the nation’s leader in releasing them: Just over 200 have been let out so far. Criminal-justice experts are looking to the state’s experience as a test case for states around the country grappling with the reality that ending mass incarceration, an increasingly bipartisan goal, will eventually require releasing long-term offenders convicted of violent crimes, who make up a large proportion of those in prison. While the implications of this are often framed as part of a broad public-safety debate, Fennell’s experience of it is profoundly personal: How do you find your place in the world as an old man when you’ve never lived in it as an adult?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"dropcap\"\u003eFennell was 17 years old when two officers arrived at his mother’s house in the middle of a May night in 1968 to take him to the police station. They denied his mother’s pleas to accompany him.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAccording to later testimony from one of those officers, Fennell sat with him, and no lawyer, for about an hour that morning before agreeing to make a statement about the night in question. Fennell later testified that the officer told him that if he made a statement, he would not get more than a year in jail. He felt pressured and scared. “Nobody there was my color, nobody my age—all cops,” he said later. “They took advantage of my ignorance, of my family’s ignorance of the legal system.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the signed statement, he said that, late on May 19, 1968, he had come upon a brawl. He joined in, mistaking the man on the ground for someone who owed him money. Before realizing his mistake, he punched the man. The victim was not his debtor, but a 42-year-old neighborhood man, Joseph Hayes; the two other boys appeared to be mugging him. The three boys left, but Fennell and one of the others returned later to see whether Hayes was alive; he was. The man grabbed Fennell’s leg, and Fennell threw a bottle at his head, or maybe onto the ground. (Fennell’s description of this varied throughout the statement. In court, he said he didn’t hit Hayes with the bottle, which he maintains today.) The other boy, Stephen Watkins, pulled out an object—Fennell assumed it was a knife—and began to pound Hayes with it, at which point Fennell retreated.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHayes died in the hospital later that night, from fatal stab wounds. Fennell later said he hadn’t seen that Watkins was stabbing Hayes, and declined to testify against him. He also maintained he didn’t kill Hayes or conspire to mug him, and would not plead otherwise. The case went to trial, and a jury found him guilty of first-degree murder, which in Pennsylvania came with a mandatory life sentence without the possibility of parole, including for juveniles. Fennell was the only one convicted in the incident. At 20, Fennell shipped off to prison.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt the time, Pennsylvania governors regularly commuted life sentences. Fennell figured he’d be out after 10 or 15 years, and didn’t let prison get in the way of his ambition to be a family man. A woman named Bernadette, a “good old church girl” he had been courting, on and off, since he was 15, visited him frequently from the start. What had been a casual relationship on the outside became serious. She traveled to visit him with friends, with his family, and sometimes on her own. He had two kids from a previous relationship—a son, Haywood “Butch” Carter, and a daughter, Darniece Carter—whom Bernadette would bring with her.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 1979, when Fennell was living in the Outside Service Unit, a cluster of trailers huddled against the prison wall, he and Bernadette decided to get married. He and some other prisoners decorated the OSU visiting room with crepe paper, balloons, and ribbons. The prisoners’ wives catered a feast. “Even the guards came out to dance,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe way Fennell tells it, he and Bernadette would meet up on the sly when he was working off-site, helped by benevolent guards. “I would disappear for a little bit,” he said with a mischievous smile. In this way, he and Bernadette had three daughters together.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOver the years, as a sort of anniversary present, Fennell would offer Bernadette an out. “If you’re tired and you want to move on, I can accept that,” he would tell her. She didn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFennell first applied for commutation in 1978, just before Republican Governor Richard Thornburgh took office, which would mark the start of a tough-on-crime era in Pennsylvania. Thornburgh’s predecessor commuted 251 life sentences, and Fennell, who had served less than a decade by then, didn’t make the cut. Thornburgh would release only seven lifers, setting the tone for a future in which clemency was reserved for only a rare handful of cases.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 1994, Fennell’s fading hopes of clemency were extinguished entirely after then-Governor Robert Casey commuted the sentence of a juvenile lifer named Reginald McFadden. Within months, McFadden killed two people and raped a third. McFadden’s crimes horrified the nation, spurring state legislators to tighten the laws governing commutation, including in Pennsylvania.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNot long after that, Graterford state prison stopped allowing lifers in the OSU. From then on, Fennell would live in a cell roughly the size of a parking space. By the time the Supreme Court decision came down in 2016, he was an \u003ca href=\"https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Old%20Head\"\u003eold head\u003c/a\u003e—but youthful still, with a quick, boyish smile under an ever-present thin mustache. He had watched the rise of mass incarceration from the inside, as the prison system expanded from eight Pennsylvania state correctional institutions to 26. During a half century of laboring for the Department of Corrections, he laid parking lots for the new prisons, and led work crews building prison churches and mosques. By then, he figured he knew all there was to know about carpentry, masonry, plumbing, and roofing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“There’s not a piece of heavy equipment I haven’t learned how to operate or fix,” he said in 2016, waiting for the court to revise his sentence. He said he had a job lined up at his niece’s construction company. He also had an idea to get the cheapest tools he could find, and do odd jobs for free for friends who’d supported him.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd, finally, he’d be able to be a family man. Fennell had observed thousands of young black men from Philadelphia come through on their way to the far-flung facilities he helped build. “He watched these correctional officers who came in young grow up. He watched me grow from a young kid to a grown man,” said Samuel Gladden, a released juvenile lifer 25 years Fennell’s junior. Fennell, he said, helped raise them all. Now, Fennell hoped, he’d finally be the father he’d always wanted to be, even a grandfather and great-grandfather, to a flock he’d given up trying to count, let alone recall their names.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne thing he was sure of: He’d finally be with Bernadette, his wife of 37 years. “I’m going to have to learn how to live with her,” he said, anticipating his homecoming. “I’m going to have to take very soft, tender steps in adjusting to living. It’s her house. She’s used to being in her house by herself.” But in November 2016, when Fennell finally found himself led into a Philadelphia courtroom to receive a new sentence, making him immediately eligible for parole, he sneaked a quick glance at the gallery to see who’d come to support him. Bernadette was not there.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"dropcap\"\u003eSix months later, it was Fennell’s older brother, Edward Jackson, who showed up to drive him home from prison, along with Fennell’s son, Butch, and his daughter-in-law. Fennell had listed four possible addresses on his discharge form, Bernadette’s first, but in the car, Ed informed Fennell that he’d be crashing at his house. The entourage rolled up to Ed’s house and was greeted by a swarm of people who wanted to see the man who had been away longer than most of them had been alive. “The whole block was out,” Fennell recalls. His sister was there, and a gaggle of relatives from multiple generations—some he hadn’t met. A local news station was on-site too. At age 66, Fennell was one of the oldest and longest serving of Pennsylvania’s 521 juvenile lifers. The news clip showed him laughing and bear-hugging relatives. Sitting on the stoop, he turned up his abundant charm, asking the camera cute questions about the Philadelphia he left behind: Where was the pay phone? Where were the shoe shiners?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFennell’s wife, Bernadette, and their three daughters arrived later in the evening, after they had finished work. They came bearing gifts—a windbreaker, shirts, and dress shoes for church—but didn’t stay long.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEd’s daughter, Shanique—not yet born when Fennell went inside—had been one of his biggest boosters while he was incarcerated, calling state senators and groups such as the Innocence Project, which seeks exonerations for those who are wrongfully convicted, to try to get him out. Shanique was the one who had called the TV crew to film Fennell’s welcome home. A couple of days later, she, her husband, and their son took him to a department store for some non-state-issued threads. The last time Fennell selected clothing, it was the 1960s. Now he gravitated toward a fedora with a feather. “Let’s get you things you can wear right now,” Shanique told him.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eShanique’s husband took out his iPhone and captured Fennell modeling a potential outfit. He turned in front of the mirrors outside the dressing-room stalls, checking himself out in a pink button-down Shanique had picked out. When a stranger exited a dressing room and passed behind him, he jumped.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAbout two weeks after Fennell’s release, Shanique put out the word to family and friends to come celebrate at a less spontaneous gathering, and bring basics for her uncle: T-shirts, underwear, socks. About 20 people showed up. Bernadette and their three daughters didn’t, but Fennell didn’t take it personally. He figured the gathering just wasn’t their scene—all that alcohol and dancing. He came away from the party well supplied. The most generous of his friends was William Covington, a retired correctional officer, and his wife, Bunny. The couple came with boxes upon boxes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"full-width\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" height=\"966\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/09/red_dog_covingtons/54f90e9e1.jpg\" width=\"960\"\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"caption\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eTop\u003c/em\u003e: William Covington, a retired correctional officer, credits Haywood Fennell with saving his life after he was attacked by two inmates decades ago.

The two friends pass time watching TV. (Emily Jan / The Atlantic)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eFennell and Covington had met in Eastern State Penitentiary, a fortress-like former prison in the middle of Philadelphia. They reunited at Graterford when they both ended up relocated there. Fennell liked that Covington talked to him like a human, not an inmate; Covington enjoyed Fennell’s conversation. One day in June 1980, Covington was attacked by inmates while he was guarding a doorway. Someone stabbed him and threw him over a second-floor walkway. Fennell sprang to the rescue, lifted his friend over his shoulders, and delivered him to the medics. Their friendship, cemented in that moment, grew through years of conversation on the prison grounds. When Covington retired, he and Bunny became frequent visitors to the prison.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA photo of Fennell and Covington with stylized script that reads “lifelong friends” is on display in the Covingtons’ living room. Covington is a hair taller than Fennell, his skin a few shades darker. Covington is ill and can’t drive, so soon after Fennell arrived home, Covington handed him the keys to his white pickup truck. They often passed the time at Covington’s home watching ball games on TV or old Westerns. For Fennell, it was a daily thrill just to get out of the house, after so many years of being locked into his cell at a set time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThough not behind prison walls, Fennell would be under parole supervision for the rest of his life, not completely free from the Department of Corrections. Still, he was rapidly checking off boxes for a civilian life: clothing, a yard to putter in, a room of his own—actually, a corner of an unfinished basement with a twin bed, a few shirts hanging from a pipe, and a TV jammed up against the water heater. Realizing he could live, if modestly, on the $830 a month he got from Social Security, the bulk from spousal benefits, he abandoned the idea of looking for work; he was past retirement age, after all.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut material things were the easy part. He was still working out how to navigate family life, and repay relatives for decades’ worth of visits, letters, and phone calls—for not giving up on him.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"dropcap\"\u003eA variety of support groups have formed in Pennsylvania to help juvenile lifers adjust to life outside. Some are peer-led, and one is organized by the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections. Fennell sometimes attends the state-run meeting. The specter of Reggie McFadden, the commuted prisoner who went on a murder spree soon after he was released, haunts him, and he wants to do what he can to keep himself and the other juvenile lifers in line. He encourages them to take his number and call when they feel out of control. He’d rather they took their frustrations out on him than on a family member or stranger.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe returned juvenile lifers are living through a historic moment, the mass release of people who’ve been locked up for their entire adult lives. They recognize the weight of that, and its fragility—how their success could pave the way for others to be released, but also how this moment would be shattered by just one of them committing a violent crime.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn July, they got a grim reminder of how precarious this moment of possible reform could be. News spread across Pennsylvania of a series of six alleged killings by five recent parolees, among them Keith Burley, who had been paroled less than four months earlier from a sentence for third-degree murder when he allegedly fatally stabbed his girlfriend’s 8-year-old son. While the Pennsylvania secretary of corrections \u003ca href=\"https://whyy.org/articles/pa-corrections-secretary-cautions-against-knee-jerk-reaction-after-parolee-murders/\"\u003ecautioned against a “knee-jerk” \u003c/a\u003ebacklash, calls to review the parole process began echoing around the state, from prosecutors, the correctional officers’ union, and lawmakers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s not yet clear what shape any reforms might take—or how they might affect those juvenile lifers still seeking parole. Parole Board Chairman Ted Johnson called the cohort of released juvenile lifers one of his biggest success stories. They’ve been given more support than nearly any other group. The Pennsylvania Department of Corrections did its best to untangle decades of paperwork and get everyone a photo ID, and it offered vouchers for six months’ rent. It even provided virtual-reality tours of the halfway house where some would be staying.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf just over 200 released, six have faced new charges, but only one has been convicted of a new crime, contempt. That’s less than a 3 percent recidivism rate. “When you’re looking at the percentages of the guys who’ve come back in court, and compare that to our overall, which is around 40 percent, you really know you’ve done a good job,” Johnson said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat outcome supports a theory the U.S. Supreme Court first advanced in 2005, when it outlawed the death penalty for juveniles. The Court took stock of “evolving standards of decency,” as well as a growing body of neuroscience suggesting kids’ immaturity makes them less culpable than adults. It also emphasized that kids, more than adults, are amenable to change. The low recidivism rates likely also reflect the reality that criminal behavior declines dramatically as people age out of their teens and early 20s.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt the May meeting run by the state, though, it was evident that the men were in different stages of assimilating into life outside prison. Fabian Lopez, out just two weeks, appeared to be in a honeymoon phase. “Oh my God. I can’t describe it. It’s a dream,” he said. But he was already deep in the aggravations of reentry, struggling to obtain a birth certificate and a Social Security number so he could shoulder his way back into the workforce. Several weeks after that, word rippled through the juvenile-lifer community and into the prisons that Lopez was dead—a fatal overdose, according to the Philadelphia medical examiner.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThomas Roach, the oldest man to be released, married his childhood sweetheart at age 68, went through a work-readiness program, landed a counseling job, and is building credit to purchase his first home, all in just 14 months—the benchmarks of adulthood, accessed at hyper-speed. Recently, though, he lost that job; he said he was fired after a background check revealed his long-ago criminal history. Roach attributes what success he’s had to his own hard work, rather than to any support provided by the government. “Everything I got, I got it on my own. The state and the city abandoned us,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFennell is prone to skipping the support-group meetings, especially in inclement weather, but some men find them helpful. One, Damon Allen, said it was instructive to learn basic life skills he had never had to pick up in prison: how to manage laundry, or nutrition, or a bank account. On this night, a parole staffer led the men through a discussion of their strengths and weaknesses. It was meant, she said, to help the men become their best selves. Afterward, she reminded them to pay their supervision fees.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJoanna Visser Adjoian, a co-founder of the Youth Sentencing \u0026amp; Reentry Project (YSRP), a Philadelphia nonprofit that works with juveniles in the adult criminal-justice system, said organizations across the city convened in 2016 to support the homecomings with services such as job training, legal assistance, and housing. But as it became clear that there would not be government funding to help pay for that work, it grew difficult to sustain. In 2018, Adjoian’s organization launched a website called the Reentry Navigator, and encourages juvenile lifers, many of them incarcerated since before the invention of the internet, to log in and find resources to help themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"full-width\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" height=\"927\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/09/red_dog_walgreens-1/31a03ca7b.jpg\" width=\"960\"\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"caption\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eTop left\u003c/em\u003e: Fennell runs errands in the North Philadelphia neighborhood where he lives.

(Emily Jan / The Atlantic)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eRecent similar mass releases have created a growing understanding of what’s required to help older people succeed in reentry. In Maryland, where more than 190 people sentenced on violent crimes before 1981 were released under a 2012 state-supreme-court decision regarding flawed jury instructions, the Open Society Institute of Baltimore kicked in $400,000 to cover basic social services, referrals to health care and drug treatment, and emergency grants to cover a month’s rent, a phone bill, or just a bag of groceries.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“We were dealing on the bottom level of the \u003ca href=\"https://www.thoughtco.com/maslows-hierarchy-of-needs-4582571\"\u003eMaslow pyramid of needs\u003c/a\u003e,” said Rebecca Bowman-Rivas, who administered that support through the University of Maryland Law and Social Work Services Program. Even with 40-year-old convictions, people were routinely rejected from senior housing and fired from jobs because of their records.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJohn Pace, who now works for YSRP as a reentry coordinator, wants to move beyond the focus on basic needs and help formerly incarcerated people thrive. “I don’t want to be in survival mode,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"dropcap\"\u003eFennell’s son, Butch, who was two months old when Fennell was incarcerated, was elated at his father’s return. “It’s what I envisioned growing up: being able to be there with him, for him, and vice versa,” Butch said. When Butch was in his 20s, he briefly joined his father in prison, with a conviction for selling narcotics; that had been the first time they’d spent time together outside a visiting room. On the outside, their favorite thing to do was perambulate the city streets, side by side. “I call him my walkie,” Butch said—slang for best friend, prison lingo for the person you walk the yard with.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut some of Fennell’s other bonds were becoming strained. Fennell’s sister Diana said visiting prison did not prepare her for day-to-day interactions with her brother. In brief interactions at prison, she said, “you don’t have to deal with normal-life, everyday things.” Now she found herself retreading the dynamics of her childhood, when Fennell would boss her around. On his first visit to her house, she said, he cursed loudly in front of an elderly neighbor, which she felt was disrespectful. After that, she didn’t invite him back, and when he came to visit her son anyway, she took to retreating to her bedroom. Fennell’s view of their relationship contradicts hers: He doesn’t remember getting in trouble for cursing, and didn’t notice her making herself scarce.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs for Bernadette, their relationship seemed to have evaporated. They’d text, and Fennell would sometimes call to ask her out. “Sometimes she answers,” he said, “sometimes she don’t.” Through Diana, she declined to be interviewed for this story.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFennell wanted more than anything to be an exemplary family man. Working out how to accomplish that, when even his wife kept her distance, was the hard part. His $830 a month included a few hundred in Supplemental Security, but he mostly relied on close to $600 in Social Security spousal benefits, thanks to Bernadette’s years in the workforce. He said he’s offered to refund her a portion of that, but she declined.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe realized at one point that what he had for riches was a part of his identity he’d kept all through his prison years—an affinity and skill for manual labor. About seven months after he was released, close to Christmas of 2017, he repainted Ed’s kitchen in the middle of the night, to surprise Ed and his wife, Eleanor, and to stay out of the way when they needed it. “Eleanor likes to hang out there, so I wouldn’t inconvenience her,” Fennell said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNext, he restored the tiles in his cousin’s basement. That went over well, so he offered to fix her doors and shampoo her carpets. He used a trick he’d learned in jail: add just a little bit of floor stripper to the shampoo and water.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"full-width\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" height=\"640\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/09/IMG_8036/2369386bf.jpg\" width=\"960\"\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"caption\"\u003eHelping family, neighbors, and friends with landscaping and household maintenance gives Fennell a sense of purpose.

He started extending himself to neighbors, friends, friends of friends. “It’s a beautiful thing to create something,” he said. “It gave me a thrill. No high-school diploma, no college degree—God blessed me to be mechanically inclined.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThough Fennell has never stopped insisting that he didn’t murder anyone, he’s racked with guilt over something else: being away from his wife and kids for so long. “They grew up without me and depended on who?” he said. Back in prison, he had often envisioned burglars targeting his wife and girls. “I never felt comfortable in jail because no male was protecting them,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt felt like every time he tried to show he cared about his third daughter, Felicea, he accidentally upset her. Felicea, now in her 30s, considered herself a daddy’s girl. She said, “I thought it was going to be all peaches and roses, and we’d just fall into this comfortable space, and it would be like he’s never been anywhere else, like he’d never been away … The reality of it was so totally different.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eShe felt like he still saw her as a little girl, in need of fatherly advice—and criticism. A particularly sore subject was her choice to have a child out of wedlock. That child was 11 when Fennell came home, and he still remarked on it. “He felt that he wasn’t here to protect us from certain things, but I’ve never held him responsible for that,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFennell denied being bothered by the fact that Felicea wasn’t married; what stung, he said, is that no one had told him right away when she was pregnant. “I didn’t even know she was dating,” he said. “It hurts because I wasn’t there to watch them grow, I wasn’t included.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" height=\"448\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/09/IMG_8120/95e0137ff.jpg\" width=\"672\"\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"caption\"\u003eAbove his bed, Fennell keeps tokens and messages of love from his children. (Emily Jan / The Atlantic)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt was hard for Fennell to leave his prison baggage behind. Some mornings, he woke up in his twin bed and waited quietly for someone to unlock his door. Even after he remembered himself and got up, he hesitated to make breakfast, to the mild irritation of his sister-in-law. “She tells me all the time, ‘You live here! You stop that. You do what you want to do. I’m tired of telling you it’s all right to go get something from the refrigerator,’” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 2018, when he learned to text, Fennell started using these quiet hours, before anyone else was awake, to compose a daily batch of text messages to family members. “You know about 6-something, you’re going to get that text,” Felicea Fennell said. “I call him the weatherman, because it’s always something about the weather. Sometimes it’s, ‘Good morning, be safe. Love you.’ Unless he’s upset with me; then it will be a couple of days.” Whereas face-to-face communication could be fraught, composing a text message was uncomplicated—a bit like the letters he used to write home from prison. It took Fennell nearly an hour to write all the texts, but the return was worth it: “Then, throughout the day, \u003cem\u003eDing! Ding! Ding!\u003c/em\u003e”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFennell’s small, quiet life is unfolding amid a major overhaul in the U.S. prison system that could put many more people in his position. After three decades of rapid growth, the nation’s incarceration rate has fallen about 15 percent since 2007, reflecting declines in violent crime and reforms in some states with large numbers of incarcerated people. But so far, states that have released prisoners have mostly focused on low-level offenders sentenced long ago to harsh terms under mandatory-minimum drug laws and nonviolent three-strikes laws. In Pennsylvania, advocates for further shrinking prison populations—for example, by releasing geriatric prisoners—have pointed to the newly released juvenile lifers as examples of model prisoner reentry.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMarsha Levick, the chief legal officer of the Philadelphia-based Juvenile Law Center, a legal-advocacy nonprofit focused on juvenile-justice issues, believes Pennsylvania’s juvenile lifers are the proof needed to more aggressively change the justice system as a whole. Levick argued the case that set Fennell free—that of Henry Montgomery, a juvenile lifer who’d been at Angola prison in Louisiana for 52 years. “As a nation, we’re not there yet. We’re not ready to embrace a different model of justice,” she said. “But we’re certainly having a more robust conversation than I think we’ve ever had.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eProgress, though, is lurching and uneven. Other states with large numbers of juvenile lifers aren’t experiencing the same movement toward mass \u003ca href=\"https://www.encyclopedia.com/social-sciences/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/decarceration\"\u003edecarceration\u003c/a\u003e.

The bright-yellow plastic chair Fennell sat on was bolted to the floor. Only a few other patients sat in the sparse office. A cooking show flickered on a television fixed to the back wall, the perky hostess showing viewers how to roast brussels sprouts, as Fennell considered a question about the conditions under which he would want to be resuscitated. It perplexed him. For nearly his entire life, most of his decisions were made for him, and now he was supposed to tell a doctor what to do? “Yeah, if I get a heart attack or something, I want y’all to do something to help me,” he said out loud in the direction of the form. He let out an exaggerated groan. “I don’t understand this stuff,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFennell comes here once a month for a checkup, one of the very few consistent obligations in his life these days. Planning ahead is not his forte, but he is always on call, volunteering his labor with an almost manic drive. He has planted a large bush at the Covingtons’; mowed at least three yards on his block, plus others beyond; painted a neighbor’s front door and porch trim; cleared poison ivy from a friend of a friend’s fence; hauled his still sturdy, 5-foot-9 frame over the rear fence of a relative’s rowhouse to fell a weed tree so thick, she couldn’t open the back door; and washed too many cars to count.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe takes special care with Ed’s car, a navy-blue Chrysler 300. At least once a week, Fennell fills a bucket with cold water, grabs a rag, and wipes down the sedan, which he describes with reverence: “It’s the car that brought me to freedom.” Ed, who is 77 and beset with ailments that include prostate cancer, doesn’t make it out of the house much, but he knows Fennell keeps his car clean. “Yeah,” he said. “I seen my water bill get high.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFennell left the doctor’s office still thinking about the intake form and his mortality. The doctor told him his blood pressure had gone up a bit since his last visit—a change Fennell attributes to a bag of potato chips. “I said, ‘Doc, here’s some advice: Don’t tell an old man his blood pressure is up after giving him a paper about “do not resuscitate.” ’”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOther than the high blood pressure, Fennell is in good health for a man his age, particularly one who spent most of his life in prison. Unlike many other former prisoners, he has a room (or a big-enough basement corner to pass for one), an income (albeit small and fixed), and food on the table (mostly thanks to his sister-in-law, though he chips in for groceries). If anyone asks him, he says he counts himself a blessed man. His struggles are below the surface.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter a one-stop subway ride home from the doctor’s office, he strolled the main drag near his house, “seeing the sights.” The street was quiet that morning—many of the metal grates were shuttered over storefronts, some until business hours, many indefinitely. He has traversed these blocks countless times, but still worries he looks like a threatening, foreign presence. He rattled off a short list of establishments he frequents: the donut shop, the bank, a dry cleaner. The people behind those counters know him. “I don’t want to stop in a lot of these places until they get familiar with my face,” he said. “I don’t want them thinking I’m casing the place.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese days, resigned to Bernadette’s refusal to take his Social Security spousal benefits, Fennell puts $94 of each month’s payment toward a $50,000 life-insurance policy, listing Bernadette as the beneficiary. They remain married, and he still wants to be a provider and partner. He still asks her on dates; she still declines. He recognizes she may never come around to having a husband at home.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"u-block-center\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" height=\"1008\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/09/IMG_8165/7f4a7799a.jpg\" width=\"672\"\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"caption\"\u003e“Red Dog” at the Covingtons’ (Emily Jan / The Atlantic)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eRecently, sitting on Ed’s porch, he admitted that he has begun to contemplate dating. But after half a century in an all-male institution, he struggles to make sense of modern women. The other day, after a kindly teller helped him at the bank, he told her, “You’re very helpful. I bet your husband really appreciates you, and you all got a good partnership.” She said, “You mean my wife.” Fennell walked out of the bank stunned. “I don’t know who’s available and who ain’t, who’s sending out signals and who ain’t. I don’t know how to read them no more,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOther women are so direct, it makes Fennell’s head spin. As a neighbor passed by, he mentioned that she’d once told him that if she weren’t married, she’d give him a shot. Fennell keeps it respectful—mows their lawns, washes their cars, and waits for something to happen organically. If prison taught him one thing, he said, it’s patience.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHis volunteer work makes him feel connected to the neighborhood, and to law-abiding society at large. But he’s come to terms with the fact that no amount of hard work will fully restore his relationship with his children. “I don’t know the kids’ likes and dislikes,” he said of his grands and great-grands. “All I know is I’m not supposed to cuss or smoke around them. They’re like strangers. I don’t know how to act around them, so I just stay quiet.” As for Felicea, his daddy’s girl, he wants to “establish the understanding that we let get away.” Felicea wants this, too, but feelings about the past and miscommunications about the present have created an impasse between them. These days they mostly communicate by text.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAround noon one Saturday, he was sitting on his porch when two kids strolled down the sidewalk. The girl, about 12, with neatly braided hair, smiled and waved. Fennell greeted them with a friendly “Hi there!” When they passed, he said, “They know I’m not an evil man. I must have a good facade … She was waving down the block! You see that? It makes me feel part of something. It makes me feel good.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/UqYnaFYyFnM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/UqYnaFYyFnM/","published":"2019-09-15T11:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-596845"},{"title":"The U.S. Is About to Do Something Big on Hong Kong","content":"\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eHong Kong’s pro-democracy protest movement, the David to China’s Goliath, is calling out to the land of the free for help—and help may be on the way.

But Hollywood has long since abandoned that role. Indeed, not since the end of World War II have the studios cooperated with Washington in furthering the nation’s ideals. Instead, the relationship today is purely commercial—on both sides. For example, Hollywood frequently enlists Washington’s help in fighting piracy and gaining access to foreign markets. But even while providing that help, Washington refrains from asking Hollywood to temper its more negative portrayals of American life, politics, and global intentions. (The exception is the Department of Defense, which \u003ca href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/phil-strub-controls-hollywoods-military-access-2014-3\"\u003einsists on approving the script\u003c/a\u003e of every film produced with its assistance.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThings are different in China. In that country, which is fast becoming the world’s largest and most important movie market, the ruling Communist Party exercises no such restraint. On the contrary, Beijing has a very clear idea of how a film industry should operate—namely, as an essential part of the effort to bring public opinion in alignment with the party’s ideological worldview. To that end, Beijing has been using Hollywood’s insatiable need for investment, and its vaulting ambition to reach a potential audience of 1.4 billion people, to draw it into China’s orbit.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"dropcap\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThis summer, some industry-watchers objected when the trailer for the forthcoming \u003cem\u003eTop Gun: Maverick\u003c/em\u003e—a sequel financed in part by the Chinese firm Tencent—omitted the Japanese and Taiwanese flag from Tom Cruise’s jacket.

In 1915, before the fledgling studios had even moved to Los Angeles, the U.S. Supreme Court\u003ca href=\"https://www.loc.gov/item/usrep236230/\"\u003e defined\u003c/a\u003e the new medium of film to be “a business, pure and simple.\" That decision exposed movies to government censorship, prompting the industry’s newly formed trade association, then called the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America, to create the\u003ca href=\"http://productioncode.dhwritings.com/multipleframes_productioncode.php\"\u003e Production Code\u003c/a\u003e that shaped the content of movies from the 1930s until the current age-based system replaced it in the ’60s. Only in 1952 did the high court afford film the protection of the First Amendment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eToday, Hollywood is the freest film industry on earth, but only enjoys that freedom fully in the United States. In most other countries, from the United Kingdom to Saudi Arabia, a government body euphemistically called a “film classification board” must approve every film, foreign and domestic, before it can be shown in theaters. Thus, Hollywood has been negotiating with foreign censors for as long as it has been exporting films—about 100 years.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eYet for all that time, the compromises made by Hollywood to get films into foreign markets have not been seen as problematic, even by its critics. Historically, the more profitable markets—the ones Hollywood cared about—were in democratic countries, where the film classification boards operated under the rule of law. The changes they demanded, if any, were typically modest. In authoritarian countries, by contrast, the vetting process tended to be corrupt, opaque, and subject to all sorts of hidden political pressures. But because these markets were generally not lucrative, Hollywood rarely bothered with them. As a Hollywood talent agent once remarked to me, “Who cares about North Korea? They don’t buy our movies.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eChina has broken this mold. Simultaneously the world’s most profitable and censorious market, China has led Hollywood down the path of submission to a state censorship apparatus whose standards are as murky and unpredictable as those of most democratic countries are clear and consistent. In the words of a\u003ca href=\"https://americanfilmmarket.com/working-in-film-in-china/\"\u003e 2016 guide\u003c/a\u003e to film producers aspiring to work in the People’s Republic: “China and its one-party government currently lack … clear guidelines and standards. As such, it’s difficult to know whether or not a proposed project may fall afoul of the censors, whose whimsy seems to be determined in large part by the higher ranks of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)—an organization for which projecting the image of a stable society is considered paramount to preserving its hold on power.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eFundamentally, the two parties to the Hollywood-China relationship have different priorities. To be sure, both are interested in profit. But for China, profit is just one goal. Another, more important concern is to acquire enough Hollywood-style talent and expertise to build a world-class Chinese entertainment industry that can compete successfully with Hollywood at the global box office—and expand Chinese cultural influence around the world.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eAgain, Hollywood has focused far more narrowly on business. And that focus has been reinforced as Hollywood has stubbornly resisted other countries’ efforts to engage in cultural protectionism. It took decades for the U.S. Supreme Court to change the legal status of film from “a business, pure and simple” to cultural expression deserving First Amendment protection. It is therefore ironic that, when faced with foreign governments lobbying the World Trade Organization to curb Hollywood’s dominance of their film markets,\u003ca href=\"https://cdn.vanderbilt.edu/vu-wp0/wp-content/uploads/sites/143/2012/04/03203013/2008-Americas-Image-Abroad.pdf\"\u003e the standard American response\u003c/a\u003e has been to bluster that film is a commodity like any other, and that to define it as cultural expression is to violate the sacred principle of free trade.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"dropcap\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIn early 2017, Beijing’s strategy of working with Hollywood to enhance China’s cultural influence culminated in the release of the biggest Sino-American co-production ever: a $150 million special-effects extravaganza called \u003cem\u003eThe Great Wall\u003c/em\u003e, starring Matt Damon and helmed by Zhang Yimou, China’s foremost director. Produced by NBCUniversal and three Chinese partners at a state-of-the-art studio in Qingdao, \u003cem\u003eThe Great Wall\u003c/em\u003e was the third stage in a process by which Hollywood went from exporting U.S.-made films into China, to co-producing films with China in America, to co-producing films with China in China. At each stage, the American producers received a greater share of the revenue—and submitted to a greater degree of control by the Chinese authorities.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIf \u003cem\u003eThe Great Wall\u003c/em\u003e had turned out to be the massive hit everyone was expecting, this process might have continued. But \u003cem\u003eThe Great Wall\u003c/em\u003e was not a hit. It was a massive flop—in China, America, and everywhere else. Since then, the relationship has been going a bit sour. As China has pulled back from major co-productions with U.S. studios, there has been a migration of individual film professionals, including not just actors but also hundreds of “below-the-line” workers (cinematographers, composers, visual effects supervisors, action coordinators, and the like) into the Chinese film industry—which is to say, into the Chinese propaganda machine.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eBy propaganda, I do not mean lavish epics about sexy female \u003cem\u003ewuxia\u003c/em\u003e warriors, or animated features with cute pandas and white-whiskered sages under blossoming plum trees. I mean bloody, ultra-violent action flicks, in which heroic, righteous Chinese soldiers kick some serious ass, including cowardly, decadent American ass, in exotic foreign places that are clearly in need of Xi Jinping Thought.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe prime example is \u003cem\u003eWolf Warrior 2\u003c/em\u003e (2017), a nonstop tsunami of gun battles, massive explosions, wrenching hand-to-hand combat, and a spectacular tank chase, which hammers away at a single message: China is bringing security, prosperity, and modern health care to Africa, while the United States is bringing only misery. The film broke all box-office records in China and is still, at $5.6 billion, its highest-grossing film ever. And while the state media lauded it for beating Hollywood at its own game, they neglected to mention that the action was choreographed by Hollywood veteran Sam Hargrave.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eHong Kong has seen a similar migration. Indeed, two other hit films in the same action genre, \u003cem\u003eOperation Mekong\u003c/em\u003e (2016) and \u003cem\u003eOperation Red Sea \u003c/em\u003e(2018), were directed by Dante Lam, one of several Hong Kong natives who have become \u003ca href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/why-hong-kongs-top-filmmakers-are-making-china-propaganda-films-1004572\"\u003ecogs in Beijing’s propaganda factory\u003c/a\u003e.

But unfortunately, the deep-blue movie colony is deeply averse to doing anything that agrees, or seems to agree, with the political agenda of Donald Trump. Another obstacle is general anxiety, not only about future prospects in China, but also about a shrinking and divided domestic audience that is still, despite everything, Hollywood’s bedrock.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eGiven the stunning technological transformation of the 21st-century landscape, all this talk of threats to films—and books, for that matter—may sound outdated. As movie-going and reading become increasingly marginalized by social media and online streaming, does it really matter that the Chinese Communist Party is squeezing the life out of Hong Kong publishers and American filmmakers? Of course it does, because the same squeezing is being applied to the digital media that were believed, not so long ago, to be a potent force for free expression.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIn retrospect, it seems clear that Hollywood got something right when it pushed to reclassify its product as an art form worthy of First Amendment protection.

Tigar enjoined the policy across the country, concluding that it probably violated the statute, that the Department of Homeland Security had probably violated required procedures in adopting it, and that the decision to impose it flew squarely in the face of the record evidence and thus was probably “arbitrary and capricious.” This was only interim relief; Tigar set the case for trial. The Ninth Circuit then reviewed his nationwide injunction and modified it, meaning Tigar’s order would apply only to border areas in the Ninth Circuit—California and Nevada.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe appellate court then—as is routine—sent the case back to Tigar’s court for gathering of evidence. After another hearing, Tigar concluded that the immigrant-aid organizations who are plaintiffs had demonstrated they would suffer immediate injury if the policy were not stayed across the entire border. On September 9, he reinstated the nationwide injunction.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe government then did something that until recently was unusual: It immediately asked the Supreme Court to lift the injunction before the Ninth Circuit could hear a new appeal.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Court granted that request last week, allowing the new policy to go into effect everywhere. While the appeal winds its way up, asylum seekers will be barred if they have passed through Mexico. And the Court has given a broad hint about how it will decide the issue when it comes up again. Until recently, such “emergency” action—proceedings in which the Supreme Court reaches down to abort or alter ongoing litigation—was pretty unusual. Now, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in a dissent to the asylum order, “it appears as if the mechanism is a new normal. Historically, the Government has made this kind of request rarely; now it does so reflexively.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo buttress her point, Sotomayor cited a new study by the University of Texas law professor Stephen Vladeck called “The Solicitor General and the Shadow Docket,” which will be published in the \u003cem\u003eHarvard Law Review \u003c/em\u003ethis fall. (A preliminary version is available \u003ca href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3420221\"\u003ehere.\u003c/a\u003e) Vladeck, who is not only an acute Court watcher but a sometime advocate, suggests that the Court’s treatment of the government’s “emergency” motions has changed since Trump became president.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese motions take three forms: Applications for an “emergency stay” of a lower court’s order, bypassing the normal appeals process; petitions for “cert. before judgment,” which bypass the lower courts and move the case directly to the high court’s docket; and petitions for a “writ of mandamus,” which would order a lower court to do something it has refused to do. Vladeck went through the past two decades of order lists; his findings are striking.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eUnder George W. Bush, the government in eight years asked for stays only five times; for “cert. before judgment” once; for mandamus, not at all.\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\t\u003cli\u003eUnder Barack Obama, the government in eight years petitioned for stays three times; “cert. before judgment” three times; and mandamus not at all.\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\t\u003cli\u003eUnder Trump, in less than three years, the government has asked for stays 21 times; “cert. before judgment” nine times; and mandamus three times.\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Trump administration seems to regard “extraordinary relief” from the high court as nothing more than its due. While the Court has not granted relief each time it has been sought, the government has gotten much of what it wants in high-profile cases such as the “travel ban,” the transgender military service ban,  and the asylum rule. And, as Vladeck pointed out, until last week no one on the Court had even suggested that the government was abusing these procedures.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSotomayor’s dissent breaks the silence. But the majority, and in particular Chief Justice John Roberts, have stayed mum, suggesting to Vladeck that the Court has shifted its view of emergency motions. “That silence,” Vladeck told me in an interview, “is certainly resonating in the Solicitor General’s office”—meaning that the government may now feel secure in asking the high court to rein in judges below.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne common response to Vladeck’s statistics is that the Court’s aggressiveness has been spurred by an increase in so-called nationwide injunctions issued by district judges. “That’s way too easy,” Vladeck said. Although there has been an increase in such injunctions (it began in the Obama years), many emergency stays have been issued in cases where no nationwide injunction is at stake, or in more or less routine disputes over “discovery,” the information the government must provide when it is sued. To Vladeck, the real change is that the new conservative majority is willing to in essence decide the cases before they are briefed or argued—to predict that the government will win when the case finally reaches them, and thus should have its way in the interim.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the article, Vladeck points out that one of the factors a court must decide is whether either party will suffer “irreparable injury”—either because an injunction is granted, harming the defendants, or denied, harming the plaintiffs. Thus, in a suit against the government, courts must balance the damage to the government caused by the delay of a possibly lawful policy against the harm to plaintiffs caused by being subjected to a possibly unlawful action. Under Trump, the government seems to be suffering all the harm.  Vladeck argued that the Court should explain this shift. “If what’s going on in these cases is that the majority is no longer interested in considering the harm that these policies are—or could be—inflicting while they are in force, it would behoove them to say so,” he told me.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe government’s use of these procedures smacks of entitlement, of a sense that Republicans went to great trouble to tilt the Court in their favor and should now reap their reward. Similarly, some conservatives have muttered that lower courts are wandering out of their lanes, with one Trump defender attacking anti-administration rulings as “\u003ca href=\"https://www.lawfareblog.com/judicial-resistance\"\u003ethe judicial resistance.\u003c/a\u003e” Indeed, in a surly dissent in the census case last June, Justice Clarence Thomas branded District Judge Jesse Furman, who had ruled against the government at trial, “a judge predisposed to distrust” the administration. Thomas also claimed Furman had “create[d] an eye-catching conspiracy web” out of unrelated facts. As judicial conduct used to be measured, it was a shocking breach of protocol. Yet Thomas’s opinion was joined by Trump’s two appointees, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhich brings us back to my initial question. What is the Supreme Court today, in 2019? I fear it has taken on the role of enforcing Trump’s will against fellow judges.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/WB9PfAEuf-g\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/WB9PfAEuf-g/","published":"2019-09-15T10:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-598081"},{"title":"The Military Origins of Layering","content":"\u003cp\u003eI used to think of layering as a timeless concept. The idea of wearing many light articles of clothing rather than a few heavy ones was everywhere: my brother’s \u003cem\u003eBoys’ Life\u003c/em\u003e magazines, advertisements from my local outdoors store, my summer camp’s suggested packing list. But, like any way of dressing, layering had to be invented.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn his\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Let-People-Surfing-Education-Businessman/dp/0143037838\"\u003e 2005 memoir\u003c/a\u003e, Yvon Chouinard, the founder of Patagonia, claimed that his outdoor-clothing company, founded in 1973, was the first to bring the concept to the outdoors community. But the idea goes back further than that. Almost every American’s understanding of layering comes from the mid-century U.S. military.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 1943, the Quartermaster Corps—the branch of the U.S. Army charged with procuring uniforms, among many other essential logistics of war—introduced an experimental new uniform kit, which it named the M-43. The\u003ca href=\"https://history.amedd.army.mil/booksdocs/wwii/PrsnlHlthMsrs/chapter3.htm\"\u003e ensemble\u003c/a\u003e included a woolen undershirt, a long-sleeved, flannel shirt, and a sweater. But the star of the kit was a new field jacket, which was (somewhat confusingly) also called the M-43—a nine-ounce, tightly woven cotton sateen garment, drab olive in color, sporting big pockets on the chest and at the hips.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eToday, Americans need look no further than cotton T-shirts, cargo shorts, and camouflage to see how\u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/07/style/if-you-can-get-killed-doing-it-fashion-wants-it.html\"\u003e military styling\u003c/a\u003e has entered everyday life. But the M-43 jacket was not just a style. It also taught an idea to millions of Americans. Just as the military jeep brought four-wheel drive to the masses, so the M-43 made layering a civilian staple.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/06/the-military-origins-of-the-cardigan/488252/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: The military origins of the cardigan\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe designers intended the jacket to be used as the outer shell in different climates around the world—global outerwear for global war. In extreme cold, a soldier would pair the M-43 with multiple thin layers underneath. In warmer climates, he (the jacket was designed for men’s bodies) could keep the outer shell but peel off the other layers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe military did not invent layering. In the 19th century, home economists published research on managing body temperature, which in turn depended on understandings of dress that dated to centuries earlier. In just one example of nascent clothing science,\u003ca href=\"https://archive.org/stream/householdtextile00gibbrich/householdtextile00gibbrich_djvu.txt\"\u003e Charlotte Gibbs argued\u003c/a\u003e in 1912 that “several layers of lightweight material are better than one layer of thick material.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEven though it didn’t create the concept, the Quartermaster Corps sought to build an R\u0026amp;D program to transform clothing into a technology. A former\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Creative-Capital-Georges-Doriot-Venture/dp/1422101223\"\u003e Harvard Business School professor, Georges Doriot\u003c/a\u003e,\u003ca href=\"http://old.qmfound.com/BG_Georges_Doriot.htm\"\u003e took charge\u003c/a\u003e of the\u003ca href=\"https://philpapers.org/rec/JOHTSF-5\"\u003e Harvard Fatigue Lab\u003c/a\u003e research units that were modeled after the male-dominated field of industrial hygiene—the study of the body at work. Doriot\u003ca href=\"http://muse.jhu.edu/article/726931/summary\"\u003e considered\u003c/a\u003e the layers of the M-43 uniform to be as important as weapons and battle tactics to America’s military success. “The greatest enemy, besides what we normally call the enemy, is nature,”\u003ca href=\"http://lcweb2.loc.gov/service/mss/eadxmlmss/eadpdfmss/2001/ms001013.pdf\"\u003e he explained\u003c/a\u003e during a 1946 congressional hearing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr class=\"c-section-divider\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe military tested the new clothing assembly that would confront this natural enemy in a series of specialized research facilities, including the Cold Chamber, a 16-by-32-foot refrigerated room with a two-person treadmill and a snow machine.\u003ca href=\"https://www.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/advan.00041.2010\"\u003e Military scientists\u003c/a\u003e adjusted temperatures, wind velocity, and treadmill speed to assess their effects on volunteer test subjects. One day, soldiers might be dressed in furs and mukluks as the scientists looked on through a large glass window. The next, the test subjects might be clad only in underwear in the cold. The soldiers’ skin temperatures, measured via sensors attached to various parts of their bodies, helped scientists assess the effectiveness of the outfits.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA Desert Chamber and a Jungle Chamber used similar techniques to measure the performance of clothing and bodies in extreme heat and humidity. Doriot’s team also tested new ideas about uniforms with a human-size metal mannequin that it called the “\u003ca href=\"https://www.usariem.army.mil/index.cfm/about/divisions/bbmd/thermal_manikin\"\u003eCopper Man\u003c/a\u003e.” Like the human test subjects on the Cold Chamber treadmill, the mannequin might be dressed in any number of layers. He had heating elements inside so that his “skin” would mimic that of a human. Since he couldn’t speak for himself, thermocouples relayed data about changes in his “skin” temperature as his outfits changed. All of this research helped Doriot’s team understand how layers worked to trap air and prevent the loss of body heat, and these insights informed the design of the M-43.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/04/big-in-moscow/471498/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: Big in Moscow: Combat chic\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMilitary research reports—available in\u003ca href=\"http://lcweb2.loc.gov/service/mss/eadxmlmss/eadpdfmss/2001/ms001013.pdf\"\u003e Doriot’s papers\u003c/a\u003e at the Library of Congress—confirmed that the jacket and its accompanying layers kept soldiers warm in weather as cold as 0 degrees Fahrenheit.

For the M-43 layering system to work, soldiers had to know how to use it.

During one 90-minute indoctrination class, soldiers listened to a lecture on how to stay alive in the cold and watched a demonstration of how to wear and adjust each item in the M-43 uniform assembly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn interviews conducted by the Quartermaster Corps, soldiers during the war said they liked the M-43, but not always for the reasons the scientists had expected they would. The soldiers cared as much about the look of the jacket as they did about its practical details, such as the length and pocket space. \u003ca href=\"http://lcweb2.loc.gov/service/mss/eadxmlmss/eadpdfmss/2001/ms001013.pdf\"\u003eOne soldier said\u003c/a\u003e, “This uniform makes us feel like soldiers. The old one didn’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr class=\"c-section-divider\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eLayering was familiar to outdoors enthusiasts long before Yvon Chouinard and Patagonia came along in the 1970s. In fact, earlier outdoor-industry professionals played an important role in proliferating the layering principle. L. L. Bean, Eddie Bauer, and Harold Hirsch (of Hirsch-Weis and its skiwear brand, White Stag) were among the many civilians who worked as\u003ca href=\"https://www.immigrantentrepreneurship.org/entry.php?rec=202\"\u003e wartime consultants on equipment\u003c/a\u003e and clothing design. After the war, they brought design innovations and clothing-science concepts from military research to civilian product lines at their eponymous companies. White Stag’s advertising campaigns, for example, proudly pointed to the military origins of its new civilian styles. The 1943 4-Season “Off-Duty” Jacket, featuring the big pockets and loose fit of the M-43—a “leisure jacket gone military!”—not only capitalized on the cachet of association with a victorious army, but also continued to spread the Army’s lessons on the science of dress to everyday American life.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHirsch reflected on the original olive jacket as a versatile and technically sophisticated innovation during an\u003ca href=\"http://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:/80444/xv10092\"\u003e interview\u003c/a\u003e in the late ’80s, near the end of his life: “The soldier could be more active, more mobile, with light weight clothing” such as the M-43, he said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/09/from-powdered-wigs-to-camouflage-the-ever-changing-style-of-the-us-army/262024/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: From powdered wigs to camouflage: the ever-changing style of the U.S. Army\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWalk into a research facility at an outdoor-clothing manufacturer today, and you will find modern versions of the Cold Chamber and the Copper Man.

Gore-Tex, a waterproof and breathable synthetic laminate that hit the consumer market in 1976, offered what some considered a better alternative to cotton. But new fabrics and fibers only update the materials; the layering principle popularized by military science remains.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe military shaped Americans’ sense of style in other ways, too. After demobilization, the historian Paul Fussell explains, veterans who had gotten used to “\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.de/Uniforms-Why-Are-What-Wear/dp/0618067469\"\u003eloose, highly informal\u003c/a\u003e” uniforms were primed to keep shifting men’s fashion toward\u003ca href=\"https://time.com/3984690/american-casual-dressing/\"\u003e casual wear\u003c/a\u003e. Out were the “trim fit and exaggerated shoulders” of the prewar period. Looking prepared to get one’s hands dirty, as a soldier might in an M-43 jacket, became more important than a tailored appearance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut the field jacket wasn’t a static symbol. In the 1960s and ’70s, for instance, antiwar protesters adopted a \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/08/magazine/how-the-army-jacket-became-a-staple-of-civilian-garb.html\"\u003eredesigned field jacket\u003c/a\u003e. On their bodies, the jacket questioned how masculinity and ideology might have led to the catastrophe unfolding in Vietnam. At the same time, outdoor recreationists were flocking to military-surplus stores to buy field jackets as a relatively affordable piece of their excursion ensembles.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTheir faith in the layering system was not inevitable. In World War II, every American general and combat soldier thought he was an expert on how to dress. If you’ve been hunting, or have a favorite type of shoe, “you think you know all about it,” Doriot explained to Congress in 1946. His research laboratories and education programs converted die-hard wool fans on the military front into layering’s early adopters. Without him, civilians might never have come to believe that layering was a natural ally in the war against the cold.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/V3sVsQy5_kY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/V3sVsQy5_kY/","published":"2019-09-15T12:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-597577"}]},{"url":"https://feeds.feedburner.com/time/topstories?format=xml","items":[{"title":"Chanting Anti-Beijing Slogans, Protesters Defy a Police Ban to March Through Downtown Hong Kong","content":"\u003caside class=\"right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad\" id=\"right-rail__ad-5677823\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module\" data-src=\"https://time.com/5677823/hong-kong-protests-police-ban-march-democracy/\" data-widget-id=\"SB_2\" data-ob-template=\"timemag\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProtesters in Hong Kong once again defied a police ban Sunday to march through the enclave\u0026#8217;s downtown districts in their push for greater political freedom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShopping malls, department stores and office buildings in the tourist and retail district of Causeway Bay pulled their shutters down around lunchtime as protesters began to congregate.

William Blount, one of the first two elected from Tennessee in 1796) every person impeached so far has been an executive or judicial branch official. The Senate ultimately decided that Blount was not a “civil officer” and acquitted him on that basis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Q3H4OM\"\u003eBy contrast, Bazan writes, “the precedents show that federal judges have been considered to fall within the sweep of the ‘Civil Officer’ language.” The House has, in the course of federal history, impeached 13 judges, and the Senate has convicted and removed eight. Of those convicted, seven were district judges.

They infuse a dish with rooibos tea or serve an ostrich steak. Yes, these ingredients were grown on South African soil, but it’s not part of our daily diet.

It means enhancing the natural taste through refined cooking techniques and allowing the flavors to intensify.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis idea is practiced at the Artivist where \u003cem\u003eskop\u003c/em\u003e (sheep’s head) is served in a simple but elegant manner.

Nigeria still continues to see a massive outflow of people with the \u003ca href=\"https://qz.com/africa/1271591/nigerias-stressed-out-middle-class-is-trying-to-leave-in-droves-and-the-destination-is-canada/\"\u003erising migration of even comfortable middle class Nigerians\u003c/a\u003e, as the country fails to live up to their expectations. In the global context of rising anti-immigrant sentiment in the West, backed by \u003ca href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/07/23/744076619/boris-johnson-britains-next-prime-minister-shares-similarities-with-trump\"\u003eright wing, populist leaders in power\u003c/a\u003e, it can be expected that a challenging undocumented life in the West awaits some of those who leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eAmericanah\u003c/em\u003e is the latest in a growing trend of Africa-focused film and TV shows geared for a global audience.  Recent high-profile deals show they are not only popular with all types of fans, but also commercially successful. Top of this list is \u003cem\u003eBlack Panther, \u003c/em\u003ewhich passed the \u003ca href=\"https://qz.com/1243319/this-is-where-black-panther-fits-in-the-global-market-of-high-gross-films/\"\u003e$1 billion mark\u003c/a\u003e within its first month of release.

Also, Nigerian-American sci-fi writer, Nnedi Okarafor is working on a HBO series on her book, \u003ca href=\"https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/a27481116/nnedi-okorafor-black-female-superheroes/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eWho Fears Death\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, that will be co-produced with Game of Throne’s creator, George R.R.

For too long Hollywood\u0026#8217;s stories about Africa were dominated by tales of war, conflict and white savior-style morality tales and lessons from the West.    It’s the marriage of two worlds and hopefully one where African stories get to be on the big screen and gain popularity on a global scale with African writers and filmmakers at the helm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"  data-dnt=\"true\"\u003e\n\u003cp lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003eDream team, dream project! \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/DanaiGurira?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"\u003e@DanaiGurira\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Americanah?src=hash\u0026amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"\u003e#Americanah\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://t.co/JmMhKxrcGh\"\u003ehttps://t.co/JmMhKxrcGh\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026mdash; Lupita Nyong\u0026#39;o (@Lupita_Nyongo) \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/Lupita_Nyongo/status/1172637795589877760?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"\u003eSeptember 13, 2019\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026#8217;s also a groundswell for movies made by local producers, led mostly by Nigeria\u0026#8217;s Nollywood movie makers and South Africa\u0026#8217;s distribution platforms including Multichoice and Showmax. Some of those movies are making it on to Netflix and Amazon Prime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis movement is not without its own challenges—a continent of 54 different countries, each with their own varied cultures and subcultures cannot and should not be easily condensed into popular media.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThings have come a long way from the generic Africa accent, cliché African stories and generalizations, but there is always more that can be done to assuage doubts and concerns in a more connected social media world. For example, news of the \u003cem\u003eAmericanah\u003c/em\u003e TV show has been met with  \u003ca href=\"https://face2faceafrica.com/article/nigerians-divided-as-lupita-plays-igbo-character-in-tv-adaptation-of-chimamandas-americanah\"\u003eskepticism from some Nigerians\u003c/a\u003e who would rather see a Nigerian woman playing the lead role. It wasn\u0026#8217;t too long ago when having anyone African in the lead roles in a Hollywood project like this would have been remarkable in itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith more films and series telling African stories, with Africans in front and behind the scenes, there\u0026#8217;s hope for more authenticity in representation. A decade back, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, spoke elegantly of the \u003ca href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/chimamanda_adichie_the_danger_of_a_single_story?language=en\"\u003eDanger of a Single Story\u003c/a\u003e. Perhaps by seeing more African stories on the big screen—across genres (sci-fi, romance, fantasy, biopics, drama etc.)  it’ll be obvious there is no single African story, but instead a multiplicity of stories that speak to the universal human condition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fact this story written by Nigeria’s leading contemporary writer is now being turned into a HBO series at the helm of Gurira and Nyong’o gives us hope the \u003cem\u003eAmericanah \u003c/em\u003efans will watch will be an authentic representation of Chimamanda’s bestseller.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cb\u003eSign up to the \u003ca href=\"https://qz.com/emails/africa-weekly-brief/\"\u003eQuartz Africa Weekly Brief here\u003c/a\u003e for news and analysis on African business, tech and innovation in your inbox\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://qz.com/africa/1709436/lupita-danai-gurira-take-on-chimamandas-americanah-for-hbo/","published":"2019-09-15T18:18:46Z","guid":"https://qz.com/1709436/auto-draft/"}]},{"url":"https://www.vice.com/en_us/rss","items":[{"title":"'Leaving Neverland' Director Says Dave Chappelle's MJ Jokes Are 'Revolting'","content":"\u003cp\u003eOn Saturday, HBO's harrowing Michael Jackson documentary, \u003ci\u003eLeaving Neverland\u003c/i\u003e, was awarded a Creative Arts Emmy for Best Documentary or Non-Fiction Special.

The Apple TV+ product and Apple Arcade gaming subscriptions will both be launching this fall for $4.99.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe prices were aggressive. Given the costs of Apple News+ and Apple Music, most people might have expected the services to strike $9.99. While TV+ is striking a low price to take on entrenched streaming competitors, the pricing of Apple Arcade is particularly interesting because Apple is trying to boldly shift how games are priced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSubscribers get access to 100+ games on Arcade, with new games added monthly. The games are exclusives and they are ad-free and micro-transaction free. In a lot of ways, this subscription is seeking to undo many of the mobile gaming monetization trends it helped create, but it seems unlikely they can put Pandora back in the box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGetting gamers on a discovery platform like this could be great for indie devs looking for eyeballs, but that\u0026#8217;s only if the economics work out, something that depends on Apple throwing an awful lot of money at the problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Apple News+ divvied up $9.99 among Apple and hundreds of publishers, it was an easier sell because publishers saw it as an entirely new class of customers for digital products that they were already creating and monetizing elsewhere.

One might have a bird head on it, while another might have an alternating series of red-and-white diagonal lines. As Wilmot, it’s up to you to run the warehouse by organizing it however you see fit and retrieving items from it when requested. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"CXQicL\"\u003eThis naturally splits the game into two separate stages, which manage to test your puzzle-solving abilities in different ways. The organization stage tests how good you are at sorting everything in the warehouse while also planning ahead. During the retrieval stage, you’ll need to remember where you put things, and you’ll also learn if you made your warehouse navigable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"D96XHe\"\u003eIn each retrieval stage, you’ll have four people at a service window asking for various things stored in the warehouse. One might ask for two blocks that look like the head of a fountain pen and three camping tents, while another wants a cartoon duck head. The faster you gather them and fulfill the requests, the more stars you get. These stars can then be used later to upgrade your warehouse or give Wilmot new abilities. Eventually, it can carry more boxes or dash short distances. But when you “pick up” a block, it just attaches to Wilmot or to a block that’s attached to Wilmot. So as you start collecting more things from the warehouse, Wilmot starts to look like they are attached to a tetromino from a knock-off \u003cem\u003eTetris\u003c/em\u003e game. If you have planned properly, this will make it difficult to navigate through the warehouse.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NnlOgVaUetNnz0nP2yqgHXSoHCc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19192721/Screenshot_rubbish.png\"\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"WLdvkH\"\u003eThis is why you’ll be spending most of your time organizing the warehouse. At the start of each day, you have an unlimited amount of time to arrange the boxes however you want. Early on, this is pretty easy, as there are maybe 20 or 30 varieties of things you need to keep track of. But as you complete each set of fulfillments, up to four new types of items will get added to your warehouse’s stock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"CtEeJM\"\u003eEventually, you’ll have to stop remembering where each individual type is and instead start grouping alike things together and remembering where that group is. So you might not remember where the fountain pens are exactly, but you’ll remember that you grouped all the stationary-like boxes along the bottom left of the warehouse. That is, until you start running out of room to fit everything you have in effectively, which is when you are going to be forced to rework your whole organization scheme again. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"y4EtAS\"\u003eThe brilliance of the \u003cem\u003eWilmot’s Warehouse\u003c/em\u003e is that you will never have a perfect solution. It’s always shifting. It is pretty easy to grok the game after a few rounds of retrieval and organization to a point that you can feel like you’ve solved it or are at least close to solving it. But as more items and new varieties begin to roll in, you start finding inefficiencies in your organization scheme — whether that’s because of where or how you grouped them makes it hard to navigate or because you can’t easily remember where something is. Making matters worse, these are all problems you created yourself.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qFsuLgpz2mtrmne5ooYWUD4MCAw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19192724/Screenshot_Delivery01.png\"\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"h4qPvN\"\u003eBut even when you have a good system, you’ll still spend more time in the back half of the game making sure things are organized well. It is surprisingly exhilarating to see all of your preparation pay off when you manage to breeze through a day of retrievals without any problems, knowing exactly where things are and pulling them from the stacks in just the right configuration to easily navigate it through the warehouse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"76Cehq\"\u003eThe game ends when you get to 200 varieties of items, at which point Wilmot is fired and replaced by a fully automated robotic system. It feels a bit abrupt, but you can always start up a new game to keep going or even jump to an expert mode that lets you change up some of the rules for added difficulty.

Tagore, an Indian author and cultural reformer who lived during the period of British colonialism, was among the last of a generation able to examine the industrialized world from the outside. He issued one of the earliest and most eloquent warnings about the precarity of a world sustained, like ours today, on the twin pillars of industrial consumption and industrial warfare. On a sea voyage to Japan in 1916, Tagore witnessed an unfathomable event that seems almost mundane to us today: an oil spill. To him, it was a jarring image of an earth destroyed by humanity’s unbridled pursuit of power, now supercharged by the tools of modern science.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Before this political civilization came to its power and opened its hungry jaws wide enough to gulp down great continents of the earth,” Tagore wrote in “\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Nationalism-Modern-Classics-Rabindranath-Tagore/dp/0143064673\"\u003eOn Nationalism\u003c/a\u003e,” his 1917 book of essays, “we had wars, pillages, changes of monarchy and consequent miseries. But never such a sight of fearful and hopeless voracity, such wholesale feeding of nation upon nation, such huge machines for turning great portions of the earth into mincemeat, never such terrible jealousies with all their ugly teeth and claws ready for tearing open each other\u0026#8217;s vitals.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe climate emergency we are tipping into today — the tearing open of our mutual vitals — is a product of our collective failure to adhere to limits. An economic system that demanded endless growth and endless consumption was always too much to ask from a planet whose resources are finite. Yet, as Tagore recognized, the same avarice and contempt that led us to war against the earth would also lead to catastrophic, endless wars among peoples. At the time of his writing, World War I was underway. Tagore saw that conflict as the first of the modern wars that showed us the great power we had gained to \u003ca href=\"https://www.toxicremnantsofwar.info/assessing-the-toxic-legacy-of-first-world-war-battlefields/\"\u003edestroy the natural world\u003c/a\u003e along with our fellow humans.

With a sprawling network of bases and logistics networks, the U.S. military is the single biggest emitter of carbon dioxide in the world aside from whole nation-states themselves. “Indeed, the DOD is the world’s largest institutional user of petroleum and correspondingly, the single largest producer of greenhouse gases in the world,” the report notes. If the Pentagon were a country, it would be the world\u0026#8217;s 55th biggest emitter of carbon dioxide. And its main purpose — warfare — is easily its most carbon-intensive activity. Since the present era of American conflicts began with the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, the U.S. military is estimated to have emitted a staggering 1.2 billion tons of carbon into the atmosphere. For comparison, the entire annual carbon emissions of the United Kingdom is roughly 360 million tons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat massive additional burden on the planet might be justifiable were it all being done in the name of vital national security interests, but the biggest components of the U.S. military’s carbon dioxide footprint have been in wars and occupations that were almost entirely unnecessary.

For decades, the heavy U.S. military footprint in the Middle East has been justified by the need to preserve access to the region’s oil reserves. The industrial extraction of those same reserves has been one of the major drivers of global carbon dioxide emissions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn other words, we have been killing, dying, and polluting to ensure our access to the same toxic resource most responsible for our climate disruption.

Even today, as genuine disaster stares us in the face, neither subject is the primary focus of our media or political discourse. Part of this seems to be based on who has suffered so far. Just as the terrible burdens of war have fallen mostly on foreign countries — as well as a small, volunteer military from the United States — the first stages of the climate crisis have mainly impacted distant places with brown-skinned populations like Brazil, Bangladesh, the Maldives, and the Bahamas. As long as the crisis stays away from the mainland United States, even people who might be saddened by such news seem unwilling to treat it as an emergency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSooner or later, the emergency will come to our shores. This March, the level of atmospheric carbon dioxide reached a milestone 415 parts per million. To give a sense of what that means, the last time the atmosphere had that much carbon was 800,000 years ago. At that time, the South Pole was a temperate zone with forests growing and average global temperature was 3 to 4 degrees Celsius warmer than today. Sea levels were 60 feet higher than present levels. Without a drastic push for net-negative emissions — stopping carbon dioxide emissions and \u003ca href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-10-ways-negative-emissions-could-slow-climate-change\"\u003ereducing the amount of carbon\u003c/a\u003e already in the atmosphere — we are on the way to creating a planet like that.

It’s worth remembering that it was also an era that gave us bloodshed on a historically unprecedented scale. The power of modern science was finally wedded to the primordial dark side of human nature. The result was the most savagely violent period in human history. The death tolls can scarcely be comprehended today, but World War II alone — with its industrial demonology of tanks, bomber planes, poison gas, and atomic weapons — killed over 70 million people. The war inflicted types of environmental harm never seen before. The nuclear blasts at Hiroshima and Nagasaki gave us our first realistic glimpses of how civilization itself could end. We eventually staggered out of that catastrophe. We may now be walking into a far greater one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe melting of the Arctic is not just creating an ecological emergency, but, in the eyes of American, Russian, and Chinese \u003ca href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/29/russia-china-climate-change-1691698\"\u003emilitary commanders\u003c/a\u003e, it is also creating a potential new battleground.

Many decades earlier, he had already foreseen where unlimited greed, military expansion, and environmental contempt might lead the planet — unless we found a way to steer ourselves off the course. More than a century later, his words sound nearly prophetic. There are finally stirrings of a real movement against the \u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/08/30/quincy-institute-opposes-americas-endless-wars-why-should-that-be-scandal/\"\u003eendless war\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/29/climate/epa-methane-greenhouse-gas.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share\"\u003eenvironmental nihilism\u003c/a\u003e that have brought us to this precipice.

around five years that the Saudi-led coalition has kept the flames of war alive in the region by repeatedly launching aggression against Yemen and committing different types of war crimes, and the

tranquillity in the region and put an end to the useless crisis in Yemen is to halt attacks and aggression by the Saudi-led coalition, stop Western countries’ political and arms support for the aggressors, and make efforts to work out political solutions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYemeni drones hit two oil facilities of Saudi Arabia\u0026#8217;s state oil giant Aramco in the

Girls Embellish Zahedan by Painting Masterpieces on Walls","content":"\u003cp\u003eZahra, Leili, Faezeh and Paniz are four young Zahedani girls who paint on the walls of their city. The four street artists, aged between 16 and 17, are looking at street as a school and have learned a lot from them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Street Muralist” is the name of this group of four. Despite their relatively young age, they are the only women in the region who have independently engaged in street art so far. They all study graphic arts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following is excerpt of an interview conducted by \u003cem\u003eShahrvand\u003c/em\u003e newspaper with these four girls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWork Begins at School\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Leili and I decided to do the job in collaboration with some of our colleagues at school, and luckily the team was formed,” says Zahra.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Usually in this field of study, the school assigns a practical task. For example, students have to paint the school wall. After that, our teacher selected a number of us for the next projects. Then we decided to become an independent group ourselves. As we saw there was no effort to beautify the walls of Zahedan, we thought we should give it a chance. We\u0026#8217;ve been working for 5 months now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Leili, it started with the four teenagers and then another one joined the group, but she couldn’t continue because of family opposition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;It was unusual for a few girls to go on streets to paint. At the beginning someone was accompanying us, but as some people were bothering the group, every time a family member accompanied us. Of course, the situation is better now and we are going out on our own, but in general many families have problems with their girls painting the walls of the streets,” continues Zahra.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoting that it not only didn’t keep them away from school, but also helped them grow, Leili said the way people deal with such issues teaches them a lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“One discovers things within herself. The street is exposed to the anger and happiness of the people. We learned how to control our emotions against these reactions. We learned many things from the streets that it was never possible at school.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;Our job is not graffiti. Graffiti is a kind of protest art and has a different purpose,\u0026#8221; says Leili about choosing the band\u0026#8217;s name and type of work. “The Street Muralist” means street wall painting which is exactly what we do. That\u0026#8217;s why we chose this name.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWorld’s Famous Works on Zahedan Walls \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbout the choice of works drawn on the walls, Leili said that they mostly paint internationally well-known artworks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We use the world\u0026#8217;s most famous works. In fact, our goal is to introduce these works to ordinary people. We want to eventually turn the city into an exhibition of famous works.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of the walls painted by the group were demolished by street prowlers and those who opposed the girls’ work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Every job has its own difficulties,\u0026#8221; Zahra explained, “We\u0026#8217;ve expected these kinds of problems since the beginning.
