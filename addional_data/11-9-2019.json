His role as corporate director of rooms largely involves growing the company brand, but the most rewarding part is interacting with lodge team members. With this support and guidance, employees are prepared to provide a memorable, family-focused experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGuests notice this commitment to exceptional service, as well as the many activities and attractions, from the moment they arrive. Children can jump into any of the activities in the lobby, sport the wolf ears they scored at check-in, or simply hang out with the Great Wolf Lodge characters—while parents consider where they’ll dine that evening or what spa services they intend to splurge on. At some locations, kids can see right into the water park from the lobby, pumping them up for the adventure that awaits. Large fireplaces in every lodge create a cozy atmosphere, as does the sight of kids and adults lounging in pajamas during evening story time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe experience continues when guests enter the inviting room Dean’s team has carefully prepared for them. The comfortable beds provide not only well-deserved sleep, but the opportunity to come together as a family. That might mean snuggling under the blankets to watch a movie, breaking into a pillow fight—or dozing off to dream of the next day’s adventures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDean’s background in the industry, his focus on family and his commitment to world-class service have helped foster brand loyalty. Guests leave feeling like they’re part of the pack. They can’t help but rave about their stay, and they’re eager to start planning their next trip to one of the many Great Wolf Lodge locations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA bed that feels like home\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\nBecause the bed has to provide restful sleep and stand up to restless children, Dean settled for nothing less than the elusive combination of comfort and durability. Sealy Posturepedic® mattresses, tested for durability and preferred by consumers for comfort and quality, quickly became his choice. Plush pillows and crisp bedding complete the picture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eParent perks\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\nWhile family time is important, adult time can’t be discounted.

And at the end of a fun-filled day, they can unwind together on their comfortable beds to relive their adventures and make plans for the next one, which might include mapping out which slides to hit at the water park or which restaurant they want to try for dinner. In these moments, the bed becomes the center of the experience, serving as a place families can laugh together and make memories that will last for years to come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWant to read other Tempur Sealy success stories like Kurt’s? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eVisit: \u003ca href=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=5165291498\u0026amp;iu=/25855721/HB-Website-Tracking-Link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ehttps://www.tempursealyhospitality.com/HB3\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe post \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.hotelbusiness.com/fun-first-rest-next/\"\u003eFun First, Rest Next\u003c/a\u003e appeared first on \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.hotelbusiness.com\"\u003eHotel Business\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://www.hotelbusiness.com/fun-first-rest-next/","published":"2019-09-11T05:00:42Z","guid":"https://www.hotelbusiness.com/?p=187746"}]},{"url":"https://rss.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Business.xml","items":[{"title":"California Passes Landmark Bill to Remake Gig Economy","content":"","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/11/technology/california-passes-landmark-bill-to-remake-gig-economy.html?emc=rss\u0026partner=rss","published":"2019-09-11T05:35:38Z","guid":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/11/technology/california-passes-landmark-bill-to-remake-gig-economy.html"},{"title":"Apple’s iPhone 11 Has a New Feature: A Lower Price","content":"","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/10/technology/iphone-11.html?emc=rss\u0026partner=rss","published":"2019-09-11T04:23:50Z","guid":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/10/technology/iphone-11.html"},{"title":"China Lifts Some U.S. Tariffs in Modest Olive Branch to Trump","content":"","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/11/business/china-tariffs-trump.html?emc=rss\u0026partner=rss","published":"2019-09-11T07:01:26Z","guid":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/11/business/china-tariffs-trump.html"},{"title":"E.U.’s New Digital Czar: ‘Most Powerful Regulator of Big Tech on the Planet’","content":"","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/10/world/europe/margrethe-vestager-european-union-tech-regulation.html?emc=rss\u0026partner=rss","published":"2019-09-11T08:14:17Z","guid":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/10/world/europe/margrethe-vestager-european-union-tech-regulation.html"},{"title":"China’s Pork Prices Soar, Adding to Beijing’s Troubles","content":"","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/10/business/china-pork-prices.html?emc=rss\u0026partner=rss","published":"2019-09-11T04:20:04Z","guid":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/10/business/china-pork-prices.html"},{"title":"California Rent Control Bill Advances, Fueled by Housing Crisis","content":"","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/10/business/economy/california-rent-control.html?emc=rss\u0026partner=rss","published":"2019-09-11T01:19:32Z","guid":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/10/business/economy/california-rent-control.html"},{"title":"Share of Americans With Health Insurance Declined in 2018","content":"","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/10/business/economy/health-insurance-poverty-rate-census.html?emc=rss\u0026partner=rss","published":"2019-09-11T04:17:49Z","guid":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/10/business/economy/health-insurance-poverty-rate-census.html"},{"title":"A Dying Town, a Crumbling Hotel and the Water That Could Restore Both","content":"","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/10/business/a-dying-town-a-crumbling-hotel-and-the-water-that-could-restore-both.html?emc=rss\u0026partner=rss","published":"2019-09-11T04:22:14Z","guid":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/10/business/a-dying-town-a-crumbling-hotel-and-the-water-that-could-restore-both.html"},{"title":"California Lawmakers Vote to Undo N.C.A.A.

Specifically, it goes all the way down to the basement. Below its iconic towers and Commons Chamber lies poor ventilation, outdated plumbing, and a labyrinth of pipes and cabling entangled by decades of shoddy, ad hoc repairs. The state of the UNESCO World Heritage Site is so dire that a parliamentary assessment in 2016 \u003ca href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt201617/jtselect/jtpow/41/4104.htm\"\u003edescribed\u003c/a\u003e it as a “tale of decay, disrepair, and dilapidation.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eParliament, which has resided in the palace since the 16th century, last year approved a \u003ca href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-42891608\"\u003emultibillion-pound\u003c/a\u003e Restoration and Renewal Program for the building that is scheduled to begin in the mid-2020s.

Could complaints about the inherently adversarial nature of British politics, made real by the physical constraints of the parliamentary chamber, be addressed by radically refashioning the building? Are questions of accessibility, representation, and governance bound up not just with election systems and parliamentary procedure but with the physical structure in which they are debated? At its core, the renovation raises fundamental questions about what British democracy, and one of the main buildings within which it is housed, should look like in the 21st century, and whether Britain’s lawmakers will take this rare opportunity to reimagine it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr class=\"c-section-divider\"\u003e\u003cp class=\"dropcap\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe City of Westminster, the district where the eponymous palace lies, is at the heart of British political life, both symbolically and geographically. The palace is located less than half a mile down the road from the prime minister’s residence on Downing Street and a stone’s throw away from most government departments, and there are few places in British politics where its towers don’t loom. These days, the building is almost always surrounded by protesters wielding Brexit placards and European flags. The big demonstrations, however, are saved for Parliament Square—a large green space opposite the palace that is adorned with statues commemorating the likes of Winston Churchill and Nelson Mandela. Today, much of the building, including the Elizabeth Tower and its famed bell, Big Ben, is encased in scaffolding for conservation work.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eBut to truly understand how the seat of British democracy got into this state of physical disrepair, you need to go inside and see its basement. The underbelly of the palace is a maze of narrow passageways lined with \u003ca href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt201617/jtselect/jtpow/41/4105.htm\"\u003ehundreds of miles\u003c/a\u003e of multicolored cables and piping.

As we made our way down one of the basement’s long passages, Stewart pointed out some of the issues the renewal project would address: asbestos-ridden shafts and pipes situated dangerously close to high-voltage electricity wires, and fire-prone ventilation systems. There is a \u003ca href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/14/secret-report-palace-westminster-grave-risk-fire-saftey\"\u003e24-hour crew\u003c/a\u003e that patrols the building for flames.

Before the renovation can begin, though, lawmakers still need to approve a detailed design plan and budget for the project, which is estimated to cost between £3.5 and £3.9 billion ($4.3 and $4.8 billion). That plan is expected to go before lawmakers for final approval in 2021. It’s a price tag that could increase by as much as £100 million ($123 million) each year the work is delayed, though the final cost won’t be known until it actually begins. Healey said things are “deteriorating more quickly than we can maintain it.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThat prognosis was made nearly a year ago—well before a \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2019/04/notre-dame-fire-wound-heart-paris/587206/?utm_source=feed\"\u003edevastating fire\u003c/a\u003e engulfed Paris’s Notre-Dame cathedral last April, destroying the more-than-\u003ca href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/archaeology-and-history/magazine/2017/05-06/notre-dame-de-paris/\"\u003e800-year-old structure’s\u003c/a\u003e roof and towering 300-foot spire.

The contemporary Palace of Westminster looks a lot like it did when it was first erected centuries ago. There is no electronic voting. Broadcast cameras were put in the chambers in the 1980s, but the acoustics are poor. There are 650 members of Parliament, but only enough capacity to seat 450 of them (Shenton, the archivist, said this was deliberately done “in order to maintain a sense of intimacy” in the Commons). Even when Parliament’s demographics changed—the country first granted suffrage to women in 1918 and \u003ca href=\"https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN01250\"\u003emore than 200\u003c/a\u003e are now members of the House of Commons—its amenities, such as women’s restrooms, didn’t. There is limited disabled access. A preview of what the temporary House of Commons could look like was released \u003ca href=\"https://northernestate.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/NEP.VisionDocument.Final_.StdSpreads.pdf\"\u003eearlier this year\u003c/a\u003e, revealing a like-for-like design that keeps the chamber’s familiar adversarial seating and traditional green benches. But the temporary chamber does include one new feature: increased accessibility for MPs and visitors, allowing for a wheelchair to go all the way up to the dispatch box, where the prime minister and leader of the opposition deliver speeches.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e“This [renovation] isn’t once in a generation—it’s once in a century,” Bryant said. “There’s a strong appetite for making sure that if we’re doing all that work, we should also be looking at key aspects, like how does the public gain access to the building in a safe way with proper disabled access … How can you future-proof it?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eOthers argue, however, that these steps do not go far enough and that the renovation poses the best opportunity for lawmakers to test ambitious proposals. When the Palace of Westminster is fully evacuated, the two houses of Parliament are expected to move temporarily into separate buildings, both a short walk away—the Commons into Richmond House on Whitehall, the main thoroughfare running between Trafalgar Square and Parliament Square; the House of Lords to the Queen Elizabeth II Center near Westminster Abbey. That symbolic move, albeit only to places nearby, could allow Britain’s body politic to create some distance between its traditional approach and a new style.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e“In many ways, that temporary chamber, built outside the palace, is the critical laboratory for testing new structures, processes, and frameworks,” Matthew Flinders, a House of Commons fellow and a professor of politics at the University of Sheffield, told me.

Why is Parliament in Westminster, shouldn’t it move away from London?’ … all of these sorts of things occurred in the 19th century and they’re all coming up again,” she said, noting that much of the opposition stems from a cross-generational desire for government not to be seen to be investing too much in itself, “when in fact they’re not.

McCready, a Marine and solar-energy entrepreneur, ran as a moderate problem-solver with a local focus, emphasizing reducing out-of-pocket health-care costs and improving public schools. This was a message that worked for many Democrats in similar districts in 2018, but McCready had the misfortune of running in a new political moment. Bishop, the guiding force behind North Carolina’s controversial 2016 “bathroom bill,” sought to nationalize the race by tying himself to Trump. Bishop wagered that anger against the president wouldn’t be as potent a force as 10 months ago, and that he could hurt McCready by tying him to leftist Democrats in the House and in the presidential race.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSpending in the race was high—around $20 million dollars, with national parties and organizations shelling out on behalf of both candidates. President Trump held a rally Monday night in Fayetteville to boost Bishop, and tweeted repeatedly about the race. Both parties expected a close race, with turnout likely to be low for a special election at an unusual time. McCready placed his hope in a massive field operation, with 24 full-time organizers on his staff.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOnce again, McCready was able to win over the inner suburbs around Charlotte, but Bishop improved on Harris’s performance in the district’s six eastern, more rural counties by enough to edge the Democratic vote.

Democrats nationally, and especially in North Carolina, have gravitated to straitlaced, moderate candidates like McCready, hoping they can win over independents and voters who have traditionally leaned Republican but are appalled by Trump.

He even improved his margin slightly in Union County, a Republican stronghold of outer Charlotte suburbs. But in the more rural counties to the East, he struggled. Bishop flipped Richmond and Cumberland counties, and nearly won Robeson County, a traditional Democratic base.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://workingamerica.org/news/post/2019northcarolinacongressionaldistrict9\"\u003eA report from Working America\u003c/a\u003e, a labor group that’s part of the AFL-CIO, offers some hints into what might have gone wrong for McCready in those areas, where the Democratic vote is heavily African American. Working America began surveying working-class voters in predominantly black neighborhoods in three counties in the eastern part of the district in July. The report found voters were most concerned about jobs and the economy, but a plurality said it didn’t make a difference which party was in power. They also expressed either indifference to or lack of awareness about McCready and his campaign. That showed in the results, as Democratic turnout in those areas sank. Democratic candidates and operatives take the drop-off in places like Robeson County at their party’s peril in 2020.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGiven his campaigning for Bishop, Trump can be expected to exult in the result. Congressional Republicans, by contrast, had carefully controlled expectations ahead of the election. “You know, the Bishop district is a very tough swing district,” Minority Whip Steve Scalise \u003ca href=\"https://www.rollcall.com/news/campaigns/gop-leadership-lowers-expectations-north-carolina-special-election\"\u003etold reporters on Tuesday\u003c/a\u003e. A win is a win, and there’s no such thing as a moral victory for Democrats here. Still, it’s bad news for Republicans that the result was so close. No Democrat has held the 9th district seat since 1963, and Trump won the district by 12 points in 2016. If even the 9th is a swing district, Republicans can expect a nightmarish congressional election cycle in 2020.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/s5YzLJmNw0U\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/s5YzLJmNw0U/","published":"2019-09-11T03:14:50Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-597835"}]},{"url":"https://feeds.feedburner.com/time/topstories?format=xml","items":[{"title":"China Keeps Penalties on U.S. Pork and Soy While Exempting 16 Products From Additional Tariffs","content":"\u003caside class=\"right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad\" id=\"right-rail__ad-5673888\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module video-2\" data-src=\"https://time.com/5673888/china-tariffs-exemptions-trade-war/\" data-widget-id=\"SB_4\" data-ob-template=\"timemag\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(BEIJING) \u0026mdash; China announced Wednesday it will exempt American industrial grease and some other imports from tariff hikes in a trade war with Washington but kept in place higher duties on soybeans and other major U.S. exports ahead of negotiations next month.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe move adds to suggestions both governments might be settling in for extended conflict by fine-tuning import controls and trying to find alternative export markets and suppliers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSixteen products including lubricants, fish meal for animal feed and some other chemicals will be exempt from penalties of up to 25% imposed in response to President Donald Trump\u0026#8217;s tariff hikes on Chinese imports, the Ministry of Finance said.

But his narrow victory did not erase questions about whether President Donald Trump and his party\u0026#8217;s congressional candidates face troubling headwinds approaching 2020.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBishop, 55, a state senator best known for a North Carolina law dictating which public bathrooms transgender people can use, defeated centrist Democrat Dan McCready. Bishop was the beneficiary of an election-eve rally in the district headlined by Trump, who told the crowd a victory would be \u0026#8220;the first steps to firing Speaker Nancy Pelosi and winning back the House in 2020.\u0026#8221;\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcCready, 36, a former Marine turned financier of solar energy projects, was banking on the district\u0026#8217;s suburban moderates to carry him over the top. He was already a familiar name in the district: He narrowly trailed in an election for the seat last November that was later invalidated after evidence surfaced of vote tampering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTuesday\u0026#8217;s election had been seen as too close to call, in itself an ominous sign for Republicans. Trump won the district by 11 percentage points in 2016, and a loss would have been a worrisome preface to the party\u0026#8217;s campaigns next year. Republicans have held the seat since 1963.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpecial elections generally attract such low turnout that their results aren\u0026#8217;t predictive of future general elections. Even so, a McCready victory, or even a narrow defeat, would have signaled that the Democrats\u0026#8217; 2018 string of victories in suburban districts in red states including Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas could persist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is almost no pathway to Republicans regaining House control next year unless they avoid losing more suburban districts and win back some they lost last year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe district stretches from Charlotte, one of the nation\u0026#8217;s financial nerve centers, through its flourishing eastern suburbs and into less prosperous rural counties along the South Carolina line. More than half its voters were expected to come from the suburbs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince Trump became president, voters in such communities \u0026mdash; particularly women and college-educated voters \u0026mdash; have abandoned Trump in droves over his conservative social policies and vitriolic rhetoric on immigration and race.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlong with a GOP victory in a second vacant House district in North Carolina, Republicans pared the Democratic majority in the House to 235-199, plus one independent. That means to win control of the chamber in 2020, Republicans will need to gain 19 seats, which a slew of GOP retirements, anti-Trump sentiment among moderate voters and demographic changes suggest will be difficult.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuburban defections would also jeopardize the reelection prospects of Trump, who\u0026#8217;s already facing slipping poll numbers. Limiting the erosion of those voters will be crucial for him to retain swing states like North Carolina, which he won by less than 4 percentage points in 2016.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;I am a registered Republican, but I am fed up with the agenda of the Republican Party,\u0026#8221; said Bob Southern, 75, of Mint Hill, a Charlotte suburb. \u0026#8220;I am so disappointed in this president, and he frightens me very much.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSouthern said he voted for McCready.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBishop was counting on the district\u0026#8217;s Republican-leaning tendencies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;Bishop, his policies follow my convictions \u0026mdash; after hearing Bishop, knowing that he\u0026#8217;s for the Second Amendment and he\u0026#8217;s against illegal immigration,\u0026#8221; said Susie Sisk, 73, another retiree from Mint Hill. The registered Democrat said she voted for Bishop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA McCready win would also have let Democrats brag that they controlled a congressional district that covers a piece of Charlotte, where next summer\u0026#8217;s Republican National Convention will be held to renominate Trump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnderscoring the GOP\u0026#8217;s all-out effort to avoid a demoralizing defeat, Vice President Mike Pence also campaigned in the district on Monday. And while McCready outspent Bishop by nearly $3 million, top outside GOP groups poured in $6.4 million, outpacing Democrats\u0026#8217; $2.9 million and nearly evening out the expenditures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn another special election, Republican Greg Murphy, a doctor and state legislator, as expected defeated Democrat Allen Thomas to keep a House district along North Carolina\u0026#8217;s Atlantic coast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat seat has been vacant since February, when 13-term GOP Rep.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcCready used his creation of a company that\u0026#8217;s financed solar energy projects to cast himself as a job creator and environmental champion. He also focused on containing health care costs and ran a spot featuring his trademark promise to prioritize \u0026#8220;country over party.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe district received a black eye this year when state officials voided its 2018 election, which McCready lost by 900 votes to then-GOP candidate Mark Harris. That decision followed allegations of ballot tampering by a Republican political consultant, and Harris opted to not run again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother jolt of notoriety occurred in July when Trump staged a rally for Bishop in nearby Greenville.

alt=\"Uber drivers protest their work conditions ahead of Uber’s IPO.\" /\u003e\u003cp\u003eLate on Tuesday local time (Sept. 10), the California Senate passed \u003ca href=\"https://legiscan.com/CA/text/AB5/id/2050952\"\u003eAssembly Bill 5\u003c/a\u003e in a vote that will dramatically alter the course of the so-called gig economy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bill will \u003ca href=\"https://qz.com/1703897/californias-ab5-will-rewrite-the-rules-of-the-gig-economy/\"\u003elikely reclassify\u003c/a\u003e hundreds of thousands of independent contractors as employees, arguably the most significant piece of legislation ever for companies like Uber and Lyft. It passed the Senate by a vote of \u003ca href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Senate-passes-AB5-gig-work-bill-turning-14430204.php\"\u003e29-11\u003c/a\u003e along party lines and must now pass a final vote by the State Assembly to approve amendments. Assuming it survives (a near certainty), AB5 will require the signature of California governor Gavin Newsom, who \u003ca href=\"https://www.sacbee.com/opinion/article234624897.html\"\u003epublicly backed it\u003c/a\u003e on Labor Day (Sept. 2). If approved, the legislation would take effect Jan. 1, 2020.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The State Senate made it clear: your business cannot game the system by misclassifying its workers,” assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez, the Democrat who authored the bill, said in a statement. “As lawmakers, we will not in good conscience allow free-riding businesses to continue to pass their own business costs onto taxpayers and workers. It’s our job to look out for working men and women, not Wall Street and their get-rich-quick IPOs.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gig economy has always depended on a simple gamble and arbitrage: Hire workers as contractors to do jobs through a platform, thereby eliminating the costs associated with traditional employment. With the passage of AB5, companies like Uber and Lyft that are already hemorrhaging money will likely be required to pay millions more in payroll taxes, workers\u0026#8217; compensation, and training costs for employees, not to mention higher wages once workers are protected by minimum wage laws ($12 an hour in California and $15 an hour in some cities, including San Francisco).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnalysts estimate AB5 will cost Uber and Lyft a combined \u003ca href=\"https://qz.com/1643263/the-cost-to-uber-and-lyft-if-drivers-were-employees/\"\u003e$800 million per year\u003c/a\u003e. Both companies are trading well below their IPO share prices, and are under pressure from investors to get their spending under control. Uber reported a \u003ca href=\"https://qz.com/1684649/uber-stock-plunges-after-5-billion-loss-revenue-miss-in-second-quarter/\"\u003e$5.2 billion loss\u003c/a\u003e for the second quarter and has launched an internal cost-cutting campaign encouraging employees to \u003ca href=\"https://news.crunchbase.com/news/deflated-uber-may-swap-anniversary-balloons-for-stickers-to-save-200k-per-year/\"\u003e#FindTheMoney\u003c/a\u003e.

Last week, for instance, independent truckers \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/ZavalaA/status/1169682066360791040?s=20\"\u003eprotested the bill\u003c/a\u003e outside the California State Capitol. Analysts have also warned about added costs to franchise restaurants that they believe could face more lawsuits under the new legislation. In May, AB5 was amended to \u003ca href=\"https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2019/05/29/california-dynamex-independent-contractors-ab-5.html\"\u003eexempt certain professions\u003c/a\u003e, including doctors, insurance agents, securities brokers, accountants, barbers, and hairstylists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUber and its peers in the gig economy fought hard to prevent AB5 from being passed. Uber and Lyft paid drivers \u003ca href=\"https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-ab5-uber-lyft-rally-sacramento-pay-20190715-story.html\"\u003eto protest AB5\u003c/a\u003e, and encouraged them to \u003ca href=\"https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2019/06/16/uber-lyft-try-to-stop-proposed-law-that-defines-drivers-as-employees/\"\u003econtact their legislators\u003c/a\u003e to oppose the bill. Late last month, the ride-hail companies and food-delivery firm DoorDash \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/29/technology/uber-lyft-ballot-initiative.html\"\u003ecommitted $90 million\u003c/a\u003e to a 2020 ballot initiative designed to exempt themselves from the legislation and preserve the independent-contractor status of their workers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe longer-term threat from AB5 is that California inspires other states to pass similar legislation, until the gig model is unwound on a national scale. Analysts at Morgan Stanley estimate global ride-hail bookings could fall by 5% to 9% if something like AB5 were adopted across the US. Analysts at investment firm Cowen last week described California as a \u0026#8220;policy Petri dish\u0026#8221; for other blue states and said they expected states like New York, New Jersey, Washington, Oregon, and Illinois to follow its lead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn other words: AB5 passing is a nightmare scenario for the gig economy not just because of its immediate consequences, but because it proves that such legislation is possible and politically viable. Even if a company-sponsored ballot initiative to keep drivers classified as contractors prevails in 2020—and that’s a big if—California will still have given other states a roadmap to reining in the gig economy, which is something no amount of lobbying can undo.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://qz.com/1706754/california-senate-passes-ab5-to-turn-independent-contractors-into-employees/","published":"2019-09-11T08:27:10Z","guid":"https://qz.com/1706754/auto-draft/"},{"title":"What Jack Ma said during his farewell speech to Alibaba","content":"\u003cimg width=\"1024\" height=\"577\" src=\"https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/RTS2Q0GK-e1568187092880.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;w=1024\" class=\"attachment-medium_10 size-medium_10 wp-post-image\" alt=\"Jack Ma performs onstage during Alibaba\u0026#039;s 20th anniversary party as the co-founder of the Chinese e-commerce giant steps down from his role as the company\u0026#039;s chairman, at a stadium in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, China September 10, 2019.\" /\u003e\u003cp\u003eA stadium packed with over 60,000 employees waving internet-connected flashing wristbands.

I really didn\u0026#8217;t expect the day [of stepping down] that I\u0026#8217;ve been waiting for over 10 years would come so soon, and so nicely. This is thanks to everyone that has helped the company grow, all of Alibaba\u0026#8217;s employees and friends, the great era, the country, and this incredible city! I found people at Alibaba are becoming so good in terms of holding events—it might be difficult to find another company that can do big events so professionally like us. Lots of people thought Alibaba was a company focused on holding performances, but this is in line with our company values: we work hard, and play hard.This kind of celebration has been held for 18 years, I hope we will bring the world more excitment when Alibaba celebrates its 30th birthday\u0026#8230;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8230;..15 years ago, we set the target for Alibaba to be able to last for 102 years, stretching three centuries. I have since been thinking: how could we achieve this? Lots of people treat company targets just as empty slogans, however we at Alibaba know we need to have faith in this goal to make it become reality. We went to lots of other companies to investigate how to keep a firm alive, and found there were two basic ways: one is to pass on the business to the founders\u0026#8217; next generation, or to find professional managers. But we chose the third path, which is to nurture our own team, and make sure the succession process is smooth with the help of system and culture. That is why, I have been preparing for 10 years for today\u0026#8230;.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8230;.The decision [to step down] is not something I came up with a sudden impulse, nor was because I was under any kind of pressure. There have been rumours online saying I was afraid of something. People at Alibaba are never afraid of anything. We only have respect for the future, but not fear\u0026#8230;.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8230;.Today does not mark my retirement, but rather the beginning of the succession scheme at Alibaba. Today is not about a personal choice, but the success of the company\u0026#8217;s system. The world today is experiencing lots of fundamental changes that have been affecting everyone. Challenges arise from globalization, anxieties caused by new technologies and trade tensions between China and the US, as well as the worsening natural environment, these are all delivering one signal: which is that a new era is coming soon. All the pains and confusion we have today, I reckon they are just temporary problems we have\u0026#8230;.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8230;.In the future, there are three major goals technology should address: sustainable growth, inclusiveness and benefit others. If technologies could not achieve these goals, then the world will just become more chaotic. All the pain, however, can only be resolved by changing oneself, not through changing others. Lots of people say I always look at things from a very broad perspective, from the perspective of the whole humanity, but I didn\u0026#8217;t do that intentionally\u0026#8230;.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8230;.Our generation is the luckiest generation ever. Our generation has the longest period of peaceful time, as well as experienced things like the Cultural Revolution and some magnificent reforms. We witnessed the achievements from the industrial time, but we also face the challenge of entering the data-driven era. We have been experiencing two eras, how could we not find it painful?

By 11 am, they\u0026#8217;re ready to head home.

At the very least, they have a safe place to stay while their mothers are out in the field. At their best, childcare centers provide a stimulating environment and caregivers who are trained to foster development. The provision of childcare also helps mothers and the family as a whole. Mothers can work more and earn more, and they are less likely to take older children (usually girls) out of school to care for siblings. The World Bank recently estimated that the cost to the world economy of not educating girls through secondary school was \u003ca href=\"https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/29956\"\u003e$15 to $30 trillion\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eIn an ideal world, the global crisis in childcare would be solved for the sake of kids and their families.

Kids under six don’t need to be sitting in college-seminar-like atmospheres completing phonetic assessments designed for first graders. Those exercises might please the admissions board of a fancy elementary school, but it won’t necessarily do much to build a child’s brain architecture and emotional intelligence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAcademyati thinks it can do better. A typical day starts between 7:30 and 8am and lasts five hours. Kids first choose a personalized “quest” to take part in. They might want to hear about what lives in trees, or learn how to make paper for example. Every one of these quests is then connected back to real-life challenges that are relevant to their lives, including those contained in \u003ca href=\"https://www.qf-arc.org/en-us/ARC-18/Grand-Challenges\"\u003eQatar’s Grand Challenges\u003c/a\u003e and the \u003ca href=\"https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/\"\u003eUN Sustainable Development Goals\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce students complete their quest, they get a free hour to play, eat, do yoga, and learn music or martial arts. The kids finish their day in one of six “discovery rooms,” which teachers set up according to certain themes and stay in to guide children’s experiences. In the “living things room,” children can observe how insects live. They can take care of plants and some domestic animals—the school even has a chicken coop. “The day has a simple structure where independence and choice are the main drivers, and creativity and curiosity are always the focus,” says Alhajri.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe school, which teaches in both Arabic and English, follows its own personalized education model, combining elements of other noted early learning philosophies, including \u003ca href=\"https://amshq.org/About-Montessori\"\u003eMontessori\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca href=\"https://www.reggiochildren.it/identita/reggio-emilia-approach/?lang=en\"\u003eReggio Emilia\u003c/a\u003e. Children between three and six are mixed together according to interests, regardless of age. Every child gets their own curriculum and learning plan, which they can follow at their own pace, based on their needs and abilities. At least twice a month, teachers meet with parents and with the child to update the learning plan and check in on progress. There is one teacher, or \u0026#8220;collaborator,\u0026#8221; as the school likes to call them, for every seven toddlers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThroughout the day teachers, all of whom have relevant bachelor’s degrees, help kids connect what they’re learning with their broader interests and their lives through what the school calls “nudges.” They might take the form of a question, like “Based on what you learned, what action would you like to take?” A 4-year-old curious about the ocean could learn about the challenges of marine conservation, for example, and then be prompted to take part in a beach cleanup. Students might learn about recycling by collecting items meant for the trash and repurposing them into art, or by discussing where food comes from during meal times and learning how to limit waste.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHands-on education allows Academyati to connect kids with “what’s happening in the world around them,” says Alhajri, through \u003ca href=\"https://www.aee.org/what-is-ee\"\u003eexperiential learning\u003c/a\u003e. \u0026#8220;When connecting with real life scenarios we are able to plant the seed and they come back with more questions and solutions,\u0026#8221; she wrote in an email.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow to teach little kids empathy \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlmost everyone is born with the capacity to develop empathy.

If Academyati succeeds in instilling empathy and other social-emotional skills in its students, it’ll prove what we already know—that small-scale, high-quality interventions during children’s formative years can improve their outcomes later in life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, as the school launches, the questions it hopes to tackle are relevant far beyond the borders of Qatar.

U.S. airlines don\u0026#8217;t expect to use the plane until at least December, and the wait could be longer in other countries because of signs that international regulators will take a slower approach than FAA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA group of 11 family members asked Chao to direct the FAA to conduct a completely new review of the Max instead of mainly examining changes Boeing made to flight-control software called MCAS, which was implicated in both crashes. FAA is part of her department.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChao did not commit to full re-certification but said the FAA will wait for recommendations from a technical review board before it lets the plane fly, according to a department spokesman. The department is also being advised by a review panel that includes international regulators and by the special committee that Chao appointed, but the FAA won\u0026#8217;t wait for those reports before deciding whether to approve the Max for flight, the spokesman said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael Stumo, whose daughter Samya died in the Ethiopian crash, said those panels and foreign regulators \u0026#8220;can go far beyond just reviewing MCAS.

Dr. Aultman, thanks for joining us.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKathi Aultman:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp; Thank you for inviting me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTrinko:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003cstrong\u003eOK, so, you just testified in a hearing, the “End Infanticide: Examining the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act” hearing. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat was that hearing about, and why did you decide to speak there?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAultman:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eWell, the hearing is about the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which would protect babies that are born after abortions and require that they be given the same care as any other baby of the same gestational age. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt also requires that medical personnel report if there are violations of the act, which in a way protects people, protects nurses and techs, from being forced to watch babies that are born alive just die and not be able to do anything for them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe reason that I wanted to come was because I feel this is so critical. People have said that this law is unnecessary because in 2002, they passed a similar law, but all it did was say that once a baby is born, it should be afforded the full benefits of the law—that in fact, they’re a human being, and they deserve to be protected. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt did not do anything to prevent a doctor from just allowing a baby to die from exposure or to passively die, and it didn’t require medical personnel to do anything special for that baby. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt just basically said, “Yes, it’s a human being, and if you overtly kill it, it’s murder.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTrinko:\u0026nbsp;You’re an OB-GYN, so obviously, you understand what you’re talking about when it comes to medicine. One of the contentions we’re hearing a lot from the left is babies don’t survive abortions. Is that true?\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAultman:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;That’s not true. And now that a few states have been required to report abortions, the numbers are coming in, and they are surviving, and we’ve got living, breathing examples of this in Melissa Odin and a large number of other people who’ve actually survived abortions. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the hearing today, one of the representatives related an experience when he was a resident and was called down to the emergency room to attend a woman who was bleeding to death after an abortion. And in the other room was this baby that looked completely healthy, except its one arm was limp. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWell, apparently, the doctor was intending to do a dismemberment abortion and grabbed ahold of the arm, and the whole baby came out. And so that’s how that particular baby survived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut if the cervix is over-dilated, even in dismemberment abortions, you can have live babies. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a baby in Florida where the woman had the laminaria inserted to dilate her cervix, and then she was given some Cytotec to cause contractions. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWell, she delivered before the doctor got there, and basically, this happened in the waiting room. They tossed the baby on the floor, cut its cord, and threw it in a “bio” bag, and she later filed suit because the baby had not been cared for, and it was sort of horrendous reading through the suit to look at all the violations in that clinic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTrinko:\u0026nbsp;I would think that at least some of these babies who survive abortion would be considered born premature. What do we know from modern medicine about the survival rate of premature babies?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAultman:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eWell, they did an interesting study where they looked at the differences between hospitals and whether the babies were actively cared for or whether they were just left with no care. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd in the cases where the babies were actively cared for, they actually had good results. And the neonatologist who testified today testified that the youngest baby she’s had survive was 22 weeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTrinko:\u0026nbsp;Wow.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAultman: \u003c/strong\u003eBut medicine has come so far that these babies are surviving \u0026#8230;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou want to have babies that survive and can function, but that can happen if the babies are treated appropriately, and that’s what’s so important about this bill, \u0026nbsp;is that we give these babies a chance. They’ve survived abortion. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are those that say, “Well, this is a very private decision that should be made by the doctor and his patient.” Well, these are the people that just tried to kill this baby. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhy are we going to let them make the decision?

I’d had an abortion, and I think that probably colored my thinking, but I felt that it was a matter of women’s rights, and it had nothing to do with the baby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so, I was trained in first-trimester [dilation \u0026amp; curettage] suction abortions, but I was so gung ho, I went and did a preceptorship with one of our attendings, and learned how to do dismemberment abortions or [dilation \u0026amp; evacuation], which are later-term abortions. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I felt that I was a woman’s advocate, and I was helping women, so I felt I was doing everything right. I felt that I was doing everything right, and I love taking care of women. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI moonlighted doing abortions at a clinic and continued to do that even when I was pregnant, and I saw no incongruity with that. My baby was wanted. Theirs was not, and that was the difference.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAfter my delivery, however, when I came back to work in the clinic, something had changed in my mind, because I felt a little different all of a sudden, and I was confronted with three patients that basically changed my mind. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe first one, I had personally done three abortions on before, and I hadn’t been doing them that long, and I was not the only abortionist at that clinic. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI went to the clinic staff and said, “Hey, I don’t want to do this. She’s using it as birth control. This is ridiculous.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThey said, “Well, it isn’t your call. It’s her right. You need to do the procedure,” so I did the procedure, and afterwards tried to get her to use birth control, and she refused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe second patient came in with a girlfriend, and sometimes they would ask to see the tissue, and this girlfriend said, “Do you want to see the tissue?” And she said, “No, I just want to kill it.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I thought, “What did this baby ever do to you?” Now, that’s the clue. I don’t think I ever thought of them as babies before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe third patient came in, and she had three other children, and she and her husband felt that they could not afford another baby. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWell, she cried the entire time she was there, and after that, I couldn’t do abortions anymore. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe fact that they were unwanted was no longer enough justification for me to kill them. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe sad thing is that I still referred for abortion. I still believed abortion was a woman’s right.

You can’t kill your child and not have it affect you. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe don’t have good data on it because most women who have had abortions don’t talk about it. And oftentimes, it’s not until later that they regret what they’ve done, or they may not understand that their substance abuse, their depression, their failed marriages can be related back to the trauma from their abortion. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe really don’t know how much it affects women, because most women don’t report.

If God can forgive me, He can certainly forgive them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI think the biggest problem is, it’s such a secret, so that women are out there, but nobody knows who they are or that they’re suffering. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are groups out there for counseling.

We also remember the acts of heroism of America’s first responders, our armed forces, and average Americans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere were other individuals, often overlooked, who were instrumental on that day and who were critical to helping America recover in the aftermath. They were this country’s federal civilian workforce.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs the director of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management during 9/11, I had the privilege of witnessing America’s federal workforce commit a million acts of quiet defiance against terrorism when those men and women bravely returned to work the day after the attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAcross the country, America’s civil servants realized that one of the most important things they could do was help keep America running, which is exactly what the al Qaeda terrorist network had wanted to stop. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThey came to work despite not knowing if they would be the next targets — if the bridges they were crossing would be attacked, if their offices would be bombed, or if the monuments and symbols of American democracy they worked in and around would be the next to fall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI witnessed the depth of pride America’s federal workers had for their country and their willingness to provide some sense of stability for their fellow Americans in the face of adversity. I witnessed the best in people on one of America’s worst days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs President Donald Trump looks at reorganizing and reforming the federal civil service system for a new era, committed American patriots like these who continue to serve their country deserve a best-in-class personnel system, one that:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e• Rewards better performance with better pay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e• Allows agencies to more easily fire poor performers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e• Is more flexible in its incentives to effectively recruit highly talented people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e• Reforms a cumbersome hiring process that frustrates prospects and makes it difficult to quickly fill needed positions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eChanges like these draw the caliber of employees the American people deserve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile many on the left claim that the president is waging a restructuring campaign to denigrate our civil servants, nothing could be further from the truth. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe vast majority of workers—those people I saw return to their posts after 9/11—are highly competent and dedicated to the mission. Policies that make it impossible to deal with bad apples or impossible to pay workers on the basis of talent rather than tenure are no favor to good civil servants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time that changes are being looked at, no matter where various functions of OPM become housed, it’s imperative that certain principles remain intact to protect good workers and the American people they serve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFirst and foremost is the longstanding merit system for recruiting and hiring, where the selection and advancement of employees is determined on the basis of ability, knowledge, and skills, not who you know or who you supported for president.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile not compromising on the merit system, government must also ensure that preferences for hiring veterans continue. Not only does our nation owe those who risk their lives a great debt of gratitude, the American people benefit when veterans join the civilian workforce. Their unique life experiences, incredible work ethic, teamwork, and deep civic-mindedness make them assets at any workplace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAdditionally, protections for whistleblowers who identify illegal, unethical, or grossly wasteful behavior must remain in place, as well as protections preventing federal workers from being coerced for political purposes. Likewise, rules prohibiting civil servants from using their official authority to try to influence elections are equally important.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe civil service includes everyone from accountants, clerks, and maintenance workers to park rangers, engineers, law enforcement personnel, and intelligence officers. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eGovernment workers are responsible for foreign policy, national defense, environmental protection, and space development. They operate the atomic energy program, develop flood-control measures, and conduct research in physics, electronics, geology, and other fields that have far-reaching effects on the health, prosperity, and security of our nation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMany of the processes and structures of the civil service system are antiquated. They were devised for a time when the civil service was largely clerical, and they are inadequate for today’s specialized workforce. Our system must be one that will attract and motivate the best and brightest to heed the call to public service.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAn overhaul of the federal government’s basic human resources functions is long overdue. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile most people would agree that the administrative state has grown too large and too powerful and must be reduced, the employees who remain— talented, patriotic, apolitical and hardworking—are critical to the functioning and flourishing of our democracy and this great American experiment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/sep/9/honoring-the-fellow-americans-we-lost-9-11/\"\u003eFirst published in The Washington Times.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe post \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.dailysignal.com/2019/09/10/i-saw-our-federal-workforce-act-to-defy-the-terrorists-after-9-11/\"\u003eI Saw Our Federal Workforce Defy the Terrorists After 9/11\u003c/a\u003e appeared first on \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.dailysignal.com/\"\u003eThe Daily Signal\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://www.dailysignal.com/2019/09/10/i-saw-our-federal-workforce-act-to-defy-the-terrorists-after-9-11/?utm_source=rss\u0026utm_medium=rss\u0026utm_campaign=i-saw-our-federal-workforce-act-to-defy-the-terrorists-after-9-11","published":"2019-09-11T00:13:04Z","guid":"https://www.dailysignal.com/?p=561511"}]},{"url":"https://thinkprogress.org/feed","items":[]},{"url":"https://www.msnbc.com/feeds/latest","items":[{"title":"Does a tight win for NC Republican Dan Bishop spell 2020 trouble for Trump?","content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/11th-hour/watch/does-a-tight-win-for-nc-republican-dan-bishop-spell-2020-trouble-for-trump-68638789520\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--370x246/public/videos/n_bwms_nc_190910_1920x1080.jpg?itok=MOyCgFJa\" border=\"0\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTrump carried North Carolina\u0026#039;s ninth district by 12 points in 2016.

No dia seguinte, 2 de fevereiro, o MPF pediu a Moro que a filha de Raul Schmidt fosse proibida de deixar o Brasil. Não queria apenas a apreensão do passaporte, mas também outras medidas: busca e apreensão na casa de Nathalie, bloqueios em contas bancárias dela e da empresa dela, quebras de sigilo fiscal e do sigilo das mensagens de um número dela no WhatsApp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eO MPF justificou as medidas com evidências de que Nathalie era beneficiária de contas bancárias no exterior abastecidas com dinheiro pago a Raul Schmidt por multinacionais investigadas na Lava Jato. Parte desses valores, segundo o Ministério Público, foi usada na compra de um apartamento em Paris registrado no nome de uma empresa pertencente a Nathalie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNa petição ao então juiz federal, os procuradores informaram que a filha de Schmidt havia pedido recentemente a renovação de seu passaporte brasileiro.

Ou seja, enquanto argumentava no processo que Nathalie não poderia sair do país para não prejudicar a investigação sobre os crimes que teria cometido, no Telegram os procuradores admitiam que a finalidade das medidas era pressionar Schmidt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUm dia depois, em 3 de fevereiro, Raul foi \u003ca href=\"http://www.pf.gov.br/agencia/noticias/2018/02/pf-prende-alvo-da-25a-fase-da-operacao-lava-jato\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eencontrado e preso\u003c/a\u003e em Sardoal, a cerca de uma hora de carro de Lisboa.

No despacho em que tratou do assunto, o magistrado não viu “causa suficiente” para a ação mais drástica pedida pelo MPF contra Nathalie — proibi-la de deixar o país.

E emendou: “O nome dela, ademais, só apareceu agora nas investigações, aparentando ser talvez prematuro de pronto impor-lhe medida de restrição de locomoção pessoal”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTendo negado a cassação do passaporte de Nathalie, Moro perguntou ao MPF se as demais medidas contra ela (bloqueios de contas e quebras de sigilo fiscal e de comunicações no WhatsApp) ainda eram necessárias, considerando que Raul já havia sido preso em Portugal dois dias antes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIsso significa que o juiz, assim como o MPF, justificou a operação contra Nathalie pelo fato de Raul estar foragido. Uma vez que ele foi encontrado, a força-tarefa da Lava Jato não viu mais motivos para impor as restrições a ela.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaul, no entanto, acabaria não sendo extraditado: ele  foi solto 12 dias após a prisão, para responder em liberdade ao julgamento do recurso.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eO processo contra Nathalie ficou adormecido até que o MPF o utilizasse, mais de três meses depois, com o mesmo objetivo de capturar o pai. No dia 18 de maio de 2018, a justiça portuguesa determinou o cumprimento imediato da ordem de extradição. Quatro dias depois os procuradores pediram a Moro, com urgência, o cumprimento das medidas contra Nathalie, afirmando que Raul “se evadiu” ao ser procurado pelas autoridades.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDesta vez, Moro acatou o desejo dos procuradores, sem qualquer incremento nas provas contra ela. O MPF não fez nenhum adendo ao processo, apenas reapresentou o pedido que fizera em fevereiro.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathalie teve o passaporte retido e foi alvo de busca e apreensão em casa, no Rio de Janeiro, em 24 de maio. Nessa busca, segundo a defesa dela alegou quatro dias depois em pedido de habeas corpus ao Tribunal Regional Federal da 4ª Região, “três agentes da Polícia Federal portando metralhadora ingressaram na residência da paciente de forma truculenta, exigindo, aos berros, que ela revelasse o atual paradeiro do seu genitor, sob ameaça de \u0026#8216;evitar dor de cabeça para seu filho\u0026#8217;”, referindo-se à criança dela, um menino então com sete anos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo entanto, o principal objetivo das medidas, que era aumentar as chances de prisão de Raul Schmidt em Portugal, esvaziou-se logo em seguida. No mesmo dia em que Nathalie foi visitada pela PF no Rio, um desembargador do Tribunal de Relação de Lisboa (primeira instância a que Schmidt recorria) determinou o cancelamento da extradição do empresário, que voltou a responder em liberdade. Assim, a segunda tentativa de usar a perseguição à filha para pressiona-lo fracassou.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA extradição de Raul foi \u003ca href=\"https://www.conjur.com.br/2019-jan-15/corte-portuguesa-arquiva-definitivamente-extradicao-raul-schmidt\" target=\"_blank\"\u003earquivada\u003c/a\u003e pela justiça portuguesa em janeiro de 2019, e o Ministério Público do país \u003ca href=\"https://www.conjur.com.br/2019-fev-16/mp-portugues-recorre-arquivamento-extradicao-raul-schmidt\" target=\"_blank\"\u003erecorre\u003c/a\u003e da sentença desde então.

hijacking with on-board violence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe transponders of all four aircraft were also turned off or changed, meaning the planes could not be identified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hijacking also took place on a day when routine military training exercises happened to be taking place at US air defence command.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eData suggests there was confusion and a lack of communication between the civilian air traffic control (FAA) and the military at the

manoeuvre and crash it into the headquarters of the world\u0026#8217;s most powerful military, 78 minutes after the first report of a possible hijack, without leaving any traces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBased on this question, they claim that instead of a Boeing 757, the Pentagon was in fact struck by a small missile or unmanned drone, or even a significantly smaller aircraft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen it was confirmed that flight AA77 did hit the Pentagon, the theorists shifted their focus to how the plane managed the difficult manoeuvre, with hardliners claiming the plan was actually being controlled by the Pentagon itself rather than Al Qaeda terrorists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile some early video footage did not show much wreckage at the Pentagon, there is a good deal of video and still photography from the aftermath which shows plane wreckage and evidence of the flight path, such as broken lamp posts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe remains of crew and passengers on the plane were also found and positively identified by DNA, and multiple witnesses also saw the plane strike the

that was not the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr Rittgers said the state failed to mention a detective in the case wrote in a report that Ms Richardson touched the baby with a lighter and flames

“obsessed” with external appearances and wanted to prevent a potential interruption of their lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to prosecutors, Ms Richardson had an “extreme” reaction after being told she was pregnant and did not return for follow-up prenatal visits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCounty prosecutor David Fornshell previously said the student and her family had been worried about the community’s reaction to her out-of-wedlock pregnancy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said: “Skylar and her family, particularly her mother, were pretty obsessed with external appearances and how things appeared to the outside world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have a situation where, you know, she’s a cute high school, recent high school graduate \u0026#8211; she was a cheerleader
