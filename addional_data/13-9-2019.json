Elizabeth Warren has mounted a steady climb up the polls without ever having the opportunity to directly confront front-runner Joe Biden, thanks to the large field previously split over multiple nights.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThursday night at Texas Southern University in\nHouston there were few direct verbal skirmishes between the two candidates\nattempting to separate themselves from the pack, but contrasting styles and\npolicy points were revealed during the three-hour event. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePitting Warren and Biden head-to-head reflects a larger question for Democratic voters in 2020: Is defeating President Donald Trump top of mind, or a more widespread shift in the party platform and direction of the country? \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBiden’s pitch has centered on expanding on the work of President Barack Obama while Warren, similar to Sen. Bernie Sanders, is championing a slate of programs that would fundamentally shift numerous institutions, from abolishing the Electoral College to ending private prisons and buttressing Social Security.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWarren has been the most upwardly mobile candidate in the polls in the past three months making consistent, incremental gains. While others enjoyed some short-lived spikes in favor, Warren has steadily grown her share from 9% to 19%, according to Real Clear Politics polling averages for the Democratic nomination. Sanders meanwhile has remained roughly stagnant at 17% and Biden has seen a 3 percentage point dip to 30%. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWith her campaign momentum building, Warren did not go out of her way to challenge Biden or Sanders Thursday. Warren stayed on message, choosing to highlight her own specific plans rather than dig into opponents’ ideas. Biden at times came off as less polished in his answers, veering from topic to topic within a single issue, but also focused on nuances within his own positions.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOne key difference between Biden and both Warren\nand Sanders is the former vice president stops short of calling for the end of\nprivate health insurance while the latter two fully endorse Medicare for All.\nBiden said his plan maintains choice but offers Medicare coverage to those who\nwant it, while pushing Sanders and Warren on the costs and accompanying tax\nincreases of Medicare for All. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“Nobody has said how much it will cost,” Biden\nsaid. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWarren countered that abolishing private\ninsurance would eliminate profit and drive down costs for everyone, allowing\nfamilies to spend less on care in the end. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve never actually met anyone who likes their\nhealth insurance company … what they want is access to health care,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe other area of disagreement between the top\npolling candidates was the filibuster. While Warren adamantly made the case to\nabolish the procedure in Congress, Sanders and Biden reject the move. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eRaising the example of firearm regulation, Warren\nsaid Congress is “beholden to the gun industry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“Unless we’re willing to address that head on and\nroll back the filibuster, we’re not going to get anything done on guns,” she\nsaid. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWarren’s strengthening position in polls did not\nappear to elicit extra attention from the other candidates trailing behind in\nthe single digits. The most notable confrontations came when Julian Castro\ncalled out Biden on more than one occasion, including accusing him of only embracing\nPresident Barack Obama’s record when it’s convenient.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“Everytime something good about Barack Obama comes up, he says: ‘Oh, I was there … me too!’” Castro said. “And then anytime somebody questions part of the administration we were both a part of he says: ‘Well that was the president.’ I mean, he wants to take credit for Obama’s work but not have to answer any questions.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eLike many of the candidates on stage, Warren and\nBiden agreed on numerous issues surrounding education, climate change, gun\ncontrol, and ending U.S. troop deployments in Afghanistan.\u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBiden has consistently promoted the idea that he is the best positioned candidate to defeat Trump. Eroding that argument, a recent \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/fortune500/cbs-203/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCBS\u003c/a\u003e News/YouGov poll showed Warren also gaining in her perceived ability to win against the incumbent. In June, 39% of respondents who said they would consider voting for Warren thought she would probably defeat Trump. In September’s poll, that number rose to 55%.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn terms of early-primary states, Warren slightly\nnudges out Biden in New Hampshire with 27% support versus 26%, with Sanders\nclose behind at 25%. Biden leads polls in Iowa with 29%, compared to Sanders at\n25% and Warren at 17%.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the third Democratic debate never delivered major fireworks between the front runners, the pattern so far has shown that steady, incremental gains can be more lasting. After Sen. Kamala Harris’ strong performance in the first debate, where she challenged Biden on school desegregation, she doubled her polling numbers before falling back to 7% prior to Thursday night. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMore must-read stories from \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—\u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/09/12/fact-check-third-democratic-debate/\"\u003eFact checking the third Democratic debate\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—\u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/09/12/live-updates-third-democratic-debate/\"\u003eHighlights\u003c/a\u003e from the third Democratic debate\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—Houston hopes\u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/09/10/next-democratic-debate-location-houston-tsu-hbcu/\"\u003e Thursday’s Democratic debate\u003c/a\u003e at historically black university drives conversation\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—\u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/09/12/joe-biden-polls-kamala-harris/\"\u003eBlack women voters\u003c/a\u003e are key to the 2020 presidential race.

He said the tax cut would be “very, very inspirational” without providing details.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTrump spoke a day after deciding against cutting the tax on capital gains by indexing gains to inflation. That decision was announced late Wednesday after a meeting earlier between the president and his economic advisers, who discussed whether to move ahead with the tax break.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe administration has also put off the idea of a possible cut in payroll taxes, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNBC earlier Thursday. Mnuchin said that Trump was focused instead on a second round of proposed tax cuts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut a Trump-backed tax cut would face an a near-impossible battle in Congress in advance of the 2020 elections. Constitutionally, tax legislation must originate in the House, which Democrats currently control. They are unlikely to back any legislation that could give Trump a victory during the presidential election campaign.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eKey Democrats in Congress, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, have said they could consider cuts to levies on the middle class, but those cuts would have to be offset with higher taxes on the wealthy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat trade-off \u0026#8212; if Trump and Democrats could compromise \u0026#8212; could cause no-new-tax Republicans to balk, making agreement nearly impossible in a divided government.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTrump last month floated the idea of indexing capital gains to inflation or cutting payroll taxes as a way to jolt the U.S. economy, which has shown warning signs of a slowdown. But he later said that cutting capital gains taxes would be seen as “somewhat elitist” because it would benefit the wealthy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMost of the benefits of indexing would go to high-income households, with the top 1% receiving 86% of the benefit, according to estimates in 2018 by the Penn Wharton Budget Model. The policy could reduce tax revenue by $102 billion over a decade, the model found.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis isn’t the first time the White House has floated a tax cut when facing political headwinds. Last fall, ahead of the midterms where Republicans ultimately lost their majority in the House, Trump suggested he would cut taxes for middle-earners by 10%.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe tax cut announcement came as a surprise to administration officials and Trump’s allies in Congress. That plan was never released.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAgain in August, Trump said “a lot of people” would like a cut in payroll taxes, but then said that a reduction isn’t needed. A day later, he said he was still open to a payroll tax break and cutting taxes for investors by indexing capital gains taxes to inflation, a move some of his advisers think he could do without Congress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd late in 2017, as the Republican tax overhaul was taking shape and criticism arose that it would favor the wealthy and corporations, Trump promised relief for the middle class.

After that date, Americans will be able to demand that companies disclose what personal data they have collected about them, and also ask companies to delete that data. The law will severely impact tech giants like \u003ca href=\"/fortune500/alphabet/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGoogle\u003c/a\u003e and Facebook, as well as retailers like \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/fortune500/macys-103/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMacy\u0026#8217;s\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/fortune500/walmart-1/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWalmart\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe passing of the Sept. 13 deadline also means the end of an era in which the U.S. defied a shift in global privacy norms, and allowed American companies to commodify consumer data. This has contributed to a series of data catastrophes—from the massive \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2017/09/16/equifax-whodunnit-how-they-did-it-and-why-the-ceo-wont-go-to-jail/\"\u003eEquifax breach\u003c/a\u003e to Facebook\u0026#8217;s Cambridge Analytica scandal—and left many Americans feeling powerless to protect themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn interviews with \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e, those familiar with the law—including attorneys, activists and industry executives—all predicted the new rules will have significant effects on U.S. business and on privacy norms. There remains, however, considerable confusion over how the law will be enforced, and how much of a burden it will be to U.S. companies.

It also lets consumers force companies to delete that data or to forbid them from sharing it with third parties. Meanwhile, companies will have to do more to tell consumers upfront about what data they collect.

But there was little consumers could do ahead of time. Now, it\u0026#8217;s a whole new ball game, as Americans will enjoy protections similar to \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2018/05/24/the-gdpr-is-in-effect-should-u-s-companies-be-afraid/\"\u003ewhat Europeans get through the privacy law known as GDPR\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn practice, this means consumers will be able to ask anyone from Google to \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/fortune500/starbucks-146/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eStarbucks\u003c/a\u003e to disclose what data they are collecting, simply by using a website or phone number. Those companies will also have to put a “Do Not Sell My Personal Information\u0026#8221; button on their websites, and delete the data if a consumer asks them to do so. Finally, business won\u0026#8217;t be able to refuse services or charge higher prices if a consumer exercises these rights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eWhy am I just hearing about the CCPA now?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eEven though the data privacy law was signed more than a year ago, many people expected the business lobby—especially Big Tech—to kill or neutralize it before the CCPA goes into effect in January 2020. These people predicted Silicon Valley would persuade Congress to write a federal law that overrode the the CCPA, or at least convince Sacramento legislatures to exempt the tech industry. That hasn\u0026#8217;t happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs Bloomberg reports, the tech industry made \u003ca href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-04/google-industry-try-to-water-down-first-u-s-data-privacy-law\"\u003ea last ditch push to water down the bill\u003c/a\u003e this month, but the effort came up short.

The bottom line: the CCPA is almost certain to go into effect in January.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eDoesn\u0026#8217;t the CCPA only apply to California?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e Technically, yes. It\u0026#8217;s a state law that applies to companies that do business in California. But since the data privacy law covers out-of-state merchants who sell to Californians—or even display a website in the state—the reality is that companies will comply will the CCPA, rather than step away from the world\u0026#8217;s \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2018/05/05/california-fifth-biggest-economy-passes-united-kingdom/\"\u003efifth largest economy\u003c/a\u003e. And rather than create separate systems, lawyers are in consensus that companies will just apply the CCPA nationwide—especially in light of larger societal trends in favor of privacy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;In effect, it\u0026#8217;s a national law,\u0026#8221; says \u003ca href=\"https://www.proskauer.com/professionals/jeffrey-neuburger\"\u003eJeffrey Neuberger\u003c/a\u003e, a privacy expert at the law firm Proskauer. \u0026#8220;Are companies going to out and use a different standard for customers in California and New York?

More specifically, there are the three types of businesses that are covered: companies with more than $25 million in gross revenue, businesses with data on more than 50,000 consumers, and firms that make more than 50% of their revenue selling consumer data (ie data brokers). \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eSo what sort of data can consumers request and delete?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThese days, companies have so much more than just your name, address, and email. Thanks to apps and websites that track what we buy and where we go, many have assembled detailed profiles that describe exactly who consumers are. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe CCPA has a non-exhaustive list of \u0026#8220;personal data\u0026#8221; that a company must disclose—and delete upon request. The list\u003ca href=\"https://www.pillsburylaw.com/en/news-and-insights/ccpa-data-inventory.html\"\u003e includes\u003c/a\u003e: \u003cem\u003ebiometrics, internet browsing information, products purchased or considered for purchase, geolocation data, academic and employment information and inferences drawn to create a profile about the individual to reflect preferences.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat does CCPA compliance mean for businesses? \u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eA big headache mostly. While companies have faced similar obligations to comply with Europe\u0026#8217;s GDPR law, CCPA compliance will mean updating their U.S. privacy policies and a whole lot of other work—including trying to figure out what data they have on customers in the first place.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;It\u0026#8217;s going to be expensive, distracting, and time-consuming,\u0026#8221; says Neuberger. \u0026#8220;It will require a re-engineering on how people process data.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the case of companies like Facebook and Google, which rely on parsing personal data to sell targeted advertising, CCPA compliance could pose a serious threat to their business model, if millions of people demand to see and delete the data they hold. The disclosures could also call attention to the breadth of information tech firms collect, and add more grist to the current political backlash against Silicon Valley. While the tech giants haven\u0026#8217;t commented on the CCPA directly, they have expressed their displeasure through a trade group. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;The politics around the CCPA unfortunately overwhelmed sensible policy discussions and prevented this historic law from being the best privacy law it could be,\u0026#8221; Internet Association Director Kevin McKinley tells \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSmaller companies have compliance concerns of their own. For example, the owner of a minor baseball team in Sacramento with email addresses for 100,000 customers told the \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/businesses-across-the-board-scramble-to-comply-with-california-data-privacy-law-11567947602\"\u003eWall Street Journal\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/businesses-across-the-board-scramble-to-comply-with-california-data-privacy-law-11567947602\"\u003e \u003c/a\u003ehe is worried about being falsely accused of storing information he doesn\u0026#8217;t have. Some firms have said they are worried about how to compile disparate customer data in one place, and others fret over crooks using the CCPA disclosure rules to fraudulently obtain personal info about other people. Finally, the CCPA compliance could make it harder for new companies to build businesses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;If you restrict data flows, it will protect privacy but it will have costs on what startups can enter the market,\u0026#8221; says Alysa Hutnik, a lawyer who has \u003ca href=\"https://www.adlawaccess.com/2019/09/articles/ccpa-update-with-legislative-session-to-end-friday-ccpa-amendments-slated-for-final-vote/\"\u003ewritten extensively\u003c/a\u003e about the CCPA for the firm Kelley Drye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat happens if a company doesn\u0026#8217;t comply with the CCPA?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026#8217;s the million dollar question. While data privacy advocates praise the law\u0026#8217;s aims, many wonder how it will be enforced. The CCPA calls for penalties of up to $7,500 for intentional violations but relies on the California\u0026#8217;s Attorney General to enforce this. Meanwhile, individual consumers can sue for $100 to $750 in the event a company is careless and gets hacked. The CCPA also contains, however, a controversial \u003ca href=\"https://www.skadden.com/insights/publications/2019/04/quarterly-insights/exploring-the-new-california-consumer-privacy-act\"\u003e\u0026#8220;cure\u0026#8221; provision\u003c/a\u003e that lets a company off the hook, if they take steps to fix the data violation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eCritics say that, in practice, the California AG doesn\u0026#8217;t have the resources to police such a wide-ranging law, and that companies will rely on the \u0026#8220;cure\u0026#8221; provision if they\u0026#8217;re caught out of compliance. Meanwhile, class action lawyers—who typically take the lead in privacy cases—may be reluctant to bring CCPA cases, in part because of the \u0026#8220;cure\u0026#8221; rule.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;Our view is that this is a disaster of a law, because it scares the bejesus out of businesses and costs them a ton of money in compliance,\u0026#8221; says \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/02/23/big-tech-vs-big-privacy-lawsuits/\"\u003eJay Edelson\u003c/a\u003e, who runs one of the country\u0026#8217;s most prominent privacy class action firms. \u0026#8220;But to us it’s totally toothless.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHutnik of Kelley Drye, however, predicts plaintiffs\u0026#8217; lawyers will find creative ways to bring class action lawsuits all the same. She says this could include cases based on false advertising or unfair trade practices. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhat everyone does agree on for now is that the enforcement part of the law is confusing, and that it will fall to judges to provide guidance on how it should work in practice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eWill the CCPA actually make a difference for American\u0026#8217;s data privacy?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eYes. Despite concerns by Edelson and others that the CCPA will be too hard to enforce, thousands of companies are already making changes to their data policies. And come January, consumers will for the first time be able to see just what companies are collecting—and ask them to delete it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe CCPA is also likely to spur Congress into enacting a federal version of the data privacy law. In the past, privacy advocates feared the tech industry would use a federal law to water down the California version. But today the political mood has changed, says Hutnik, who adds that lawmakers from California—including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi—will block anything that weakens the CCPA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMore broadly, the new law is going to change how companies view data in the first place. In the past, firms adopted a \u0026#8220;data is gold\u0026#8221; mentality and made an effort to collect as much personal information as possible, but that is now changing, says Hayley Tsukayama, an activist with the \u003ca href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/04/californias-attorney-general-wants-empower-people-protect-their-privacy-sacramento\"\u003eElectronic Frontier Foundation\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;My hope is the law will make companies think more carefully about what they collect, and how they retain it,\u0026#8221; she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eMore must-read stories from \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—From iPhone 11 to \u003ca href=\"/fortune500/apple-3/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eApple\u003c/a\u003e Arcade, \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/09/10/apple-iphone-11-event-recap/\"\u003eeverything that was announced at the Apple event\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e—\u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/09/06/google-bans-ads-unproven-medical-treatments/\"\u003eGoogle bans ads for unproven medical treatments.\u003c/a\u003e Critics ask: What took so long?\u003cbr\u003e—\u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/09/09/apple-admits-breaking-china-labor-laws-foxconn-iphone-factory/\"\u003eApple admits breaking Chinese labor laws\u003c/a\u003e in the world\u0026#8217;s largest iPhone factory\u003cbr\u003e—Jingles all the way: \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/09/07/sonic-branding-logo-audio-sound-mastercard/\"\u003eSonic branding is helping voice computing companies\u003c/a\u003e get heard\u003cbr\u003e—In breakthrough, company uses \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/09/09/quantum-physics-protect-data-telecom-networks/\"\u003equantum physics to protect data over telecom networks\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003eCatch up with\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e \u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://cloud.newsletters.fortune.com/fortune/nloptin?nl=DATA_SHEET\u0026amp;source=LinkStack\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eData Sheet\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e, Fortune\u0026#8217;s daily digest on the business of tech.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://fortune.com/2019/09/13/what-is-ccpa-compliance-california-data-privacy-law/","published":"2019-09-13T10:30:42Z","guid":"https://fortune.com/?p=2695324"},{"title":"Fitbit Versa 2 Review: With Alexa and an Always-on Display, Fitness Tracking Gets Smarter","content":"\n\u003cp\u003eFitbit, the first popular wearable, was once the undisputed king of fitness trackers.

This doesn\u0026#8217;t work 100% of the time, leaving you sometimes staring at a blank watch face. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFitbit\u0026#8217;s always-on feature on the Versa 2 eliminates that complaint. The always on screen offers a pared down digital or analog time display with icons showing a few other key bits of info, like battery life and the date. When it\u0026#8217;s inactive, the display is black and white to save battery life (relatively speaking), but it\u0026#8217;s easy to read at any angle. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can also set the always-on display to appear during workouts, showing a black and white version of your stats, like speed and distance while biking. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, the always-on screen disables the touch ability of the screen. You can’t swipe to pull down other controls or trigger apps on the always-on screen like you can with the normal display. To reactivate the regular, full-color, interactive display, you have to first press the side button, which gets annoying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd while Fitbit focused on making the always-on feature energy efficient, there is a cost in battery life. Fitbit says that with typical usage (not using the always-on mode) Versa 2 normally offers an impressive five days battery life before needing to be recharged. In my testing, I found that I could easily get more than three days, even when recording long, daily cycling sessions and frequently using the watch to try all the new features. But turning on the always-on mode all the time drops the smartwatch\u0026#8217;s battery life to just two or more days, according to Fitbit. I found myself needing to recharge it by the end of my second day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eAlexa, what can you do on a Fitbit?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOne area where Fitbit’s smartwatches have previously trailed far behind rivals like Apple, Samsung, and LG is with voice-controlled digital assistant features. The Versa 2 is Fitbit’s first with a built-in microphone, so it can finally catch up. The watch includes Amazon’s Alexa voice-enabled assistant technology, and it’s terrific. Hold down the Versa’s single button and Alexa pops up, ready to do all the sorts of things it does on smart speakers and other devices. Ask it for the weather, sports scores, or a currency conversion, and the Versa 2 displays Alexa’s answers on its screen. But Alexa doesn\u0026#8217;t talk back, though—unlike rivals, the Versa 2 still doesn’t have a speaker. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can also use the Alexa feature to control smart home devices that are compatible with Amazon’s ecosystem, set alarms and timers, and perform many more functions. It’s a huge, huge improvement over previous Fitbit devices, particularly since Alexa\u0026#8217;s functionality fills in gaps left by the company’s smaller offering of third party apps relative to Apple and \u003ca href=\"/fortune500/alphabet/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGoogle\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition, Versa 2 owners can reply to texts and other kinds of messages right on the watch by dictating a response that’s translated to text (very accurately in my experience) with the underlying Alexa app. That trick only works for users with Android phones—not iPhones—because of restrictions imposed by Apple on third-party developers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI do have one minor gripe with Fitbit’s Alexa implementation, which flows from the decision to pare down the device to just a single button from three buttons on the original Versa smartwatch. With the Versa 2, you can assign a long press on its button either to trigger Alexa or to bring up Fitbit’s wireless payment service. But the feature that doesn’t get the long-button press treatment can only be triggered by a swipe-and-tap gesture that’s much less convenient. (And it doesn’t work with the always-on mode.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eA winning fitness ecosystem\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs the pioneer in fitness tracking, Fitbit has had the most time to hone its health and fitness features—and with the Versa 2, it shows. For example, the smartwatch offers a smart sleep-tracking feature that automatically calculates how long you’ve slept and offers several measures of the quality of that rest. While you exercise, the Versa 2\u0026#8217;s “PurePulse” heart rate sensor calculates how much time you’re spending in different heart rate zones in realtime, a boon to those who stay in shape using a cardio training program. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt also has the female cycle tracking app that Fitbit has included since the original Versa, a feature Apple will \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/09/10/apple-watch-series-5-menstrual-cycle-app/\"\u003eadd to its phones and watches this fall\u003c/a\u003e. And it’s also great at automatically detecting workouts. When I jumped in my getting end-of-summer chilly pool, the Versa 2 asked if I wanted to record a swim. But like the original Versa smartwatch, this new Fitbit lacks GPS sensors, so it’s not so great for running or cycling without carrying your phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eWho should buy the Versa 2?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFitbit’s original Versa was a hit with its slim design that appealed to men and women, and a $200 price that undercut much of the competition. But times have changed. Not only is Apple \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/09/10/new-apple-watch-series-5/\"\u003enow selling its Series 3 watch for $200\u003c/a\u003e, but Garmin has also \u003ca href=\"https://www.gsmarena.com/garmin_introduces_5_new_forerunner_smartwatches_starting_at_199-news-36836.php\"\u003eintroduced a low-end watch\u003c/a\u003e, the Forerunner 45, at the same price. And both rivals have built-in GPS, which the Versa 2 lacks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo if it’s not the automatic pick for budget smartwatch buyers any more, who should consider the Versa 2? For people already entrenched in Fitbit\u0026#8217;s data ecosystem, the Versa 2 is the best device for counting steps, rating their sleep, and competing with friends who also use the company\u0026#8217;s other trackers and watches. Its sleep tracking app and five-day battery life are unmatched by most other devices, including the Apple Watch (though Apple’s new Series 5 has what looks like a much better always-on display). And it\u0026#8217;s a lot more capable—and fun—than any of Fitbit\u0026#8217;s more basic trackers, even the $150 Charge 3. Pre-orders \u003ca href=\"https://www.fitbit.com/shop/versa\"\u003eare open now on Fitbit\u0026#8217;s web site\u003c/a\u003e, with deliveries scheduled to begin on Sept. 15.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut for everyone else, buying a Versa 2 is a much harder call. If fashion is a prime concern, the better looking and more expensive round screen offerings from the likes of Fossil and Tag Heuer that run Google’s watch software are appealing. If apps and features beyond fitness are more important, Apple’s wider offering of wrist-based apps wins out. (Fitbit still has just two airline watch apps and a single major news provider with its own app, for example.) And Garmin has recently been pouring it on, with four new watches introduced just last week, joining a half dozen released in the spring. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePut simply, for smartwatch buyers there’s never been more choices, and the Versa 2, while a solid option, has more competition than ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eMore must-read stories from \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—Netflix killer?

Lehto answers in the affirmative, namechecking Joss Whedon’s Firefly as an inspiration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wanted them to behave like normal humans, with a variety of different backgrounds and opposing views\u0026#8230; we want that more complex nature to show when it comes to their banter and their interactions.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe world and its backstory is intriguing, the gameplay mechanics a curious hybrid of styles that cause you to think about more than your targeting reticule. Together, they make for a strategic shooter that promises to be more than a novelty mash-up. I look forward to returning to this robotic frontier in the near future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/PSBlog/~4/rFHBrhHxUto\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"

And from the time I got involved, I started dealing with that. Red lining, banks, making sure we are in a position where—look, you talk about education. I propose that what we take is those very poor schools, the Title I schools, triple the amount of money we spend from $15 to $45 billion a year. Give every single teacher a raise to the equal raise of getting out of the $60,000 level. Number two, make sure that we bring in to help the teachers deal with the problems that come from home. The problems that come from home. We need, we have one school psychologist for every 1,500 kids in America today. It’s crazy. The teachers are—I’m married to a teacher, my deceased wife is a teacher. They have every problem coming to them. We have to make sure that every single child does, in fact, have 3-, 4-, and 5-year-olds go to school—school, not day care, school. We bring social workers into homes with parents to help them deal with how to raise their children. It’s not that they don’t want to help, they don’t know quite what to do. Play the radio, make sure the television— excuse me, make sure you have the record player on at night, the phone—make sure that kids hear words, a kid coming from a very poor school—a very poor background will hear 4 million words fewer spoken by the time they get there.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThat’s a word salad even Sarah Palin would have hesitated to serve. Each individual component made some sense in isolation, even the line about playing the radio or TV: Experts say it’s useful for children to hear spoken language to help them develop their own. But the way Biden phrased it, complete with an archaic mention of record players, just reinforced the overall incoherence and randomness of his response.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThat’s an especially serious problem because there’s another question that Biden knew was coming Thursday, though it was mostly posed through passive-aggressive comments: Is he simply too old and off his game to be the Democratic presidential nominee? Rambling rants about turntables certainly don’t help put such concerns to rest.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eBut Biden didn’t stop there.

It was a disastrous answer. Nor was that the only time on Thursday when Biden seemed to be spinning his wheels as he searched for an answer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eBiden faced other tough jabs from his opponents throughout the night. Most pointedly, Julián Castro accused Biden of forgetting a statement about health care. “Are you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?” Castro said, not very subtly broaching the age question. “Are you forgetting already what you said just two minutes ago? I can’t believe that you said two minutes ago that they had to buy in and now you’re saying they don’t have to buy in.

It’s anyone’s guess, but the evidence so far suggests it might not. There’s an active conversation about whether Biden simply isn’t up to the job, especially in the press, but so far his polling has remained remarkably durable. While there’s heavy churn among his rivals, with the field starting to sort out into some clear tiers, Biden has consistently led by a wide margin. Yet he also cannot put the questions to rest, and with every episode like his record scratch giving more ammunition to doubters, the risk is that the accumulation of missteps starts to drag his numbers down.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIf there is one silver lining for Biden, it’s that the misstep came near the end of the debate. Just a few minutes later, he was the first candidate to answer a question about overcoming adversity, and he talked about the death of his wife and daughter in a car crash just after he was elected senator, and the death of his son Beau Biden from brain cancer in 2015. These are tales that Biden has told before, and he tells them well and movingly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“We’ve all went through that, in some form or another,” Biden said. “For me, the way I’ve dealt with it is finding purpose. And my purpose is to do what I’ve always tried to do and stay engaged in public policy, but there’s a lot of people that have gone through a lot worse than I have get up every single morning, put their feet one foot in front of the other, the real heroes out there.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat answer goes a long way to showing why the former vice president remains so popular with so many Democratic voters.

In a question about O’Rourke’s proposed gun-buyback program, the moderator spoke directly to conservatives’ central fear: that gun-reform proposals are really just an excuse for the government to get rid of Americans’ guns.

So far in this Democratic primary race, as in his failed bid to become a U.S. senator in 2018, O’Rourke has not been a consensus-focused candidate; he has tried to appeal to the left.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eO’Rourke’s experience in El Paso may have permanently shifted his presidential bid, and perhaps his political career.

To reduce transportation costs, industrialists had built factories in cities with easy access to ports. These factories attracted workers by the thousands, who piled into nearby tenements. Their work was backbreaking—and so were \u003ca href=\"http://oer2go.org/mods/en-boundless/www.boundless.com/u-s-history/textbooks/boundless-u-s-history-textbook/the-gilded-age-1870-1900-20/the-rise-of-the-city-145/tenements-and-overcrowding-767-9587/index.html\"\u003etheir often-collapsing apartment buildings\u003c/a\u003e. When urban workers revolted against their exploitative and dangerous working conditions, they formed the beginning of an international labor movement that would eventually make cities the epicenter of leftist politics.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWhile workers’ parties won seats in parliamentary European countries with proportional representation, they struggled to gain power in the U.S. Why didn’t socialism take off in America? It’s the question that launched a thousand political-economy papers. One answer is that the U.S. political system is dominated by two parties competing in winner-take-all districts, making it almost impossible for third parties to break through at the national level. To gain power, the U.S. labor movement had to find a home in one of those parties.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThis set up the first major inflection point. America’s socialists found welcoming accommodations in the political machines that sprouted up in the largest manufacturing hubs, such as Chicago, Boston, and New York. Not all of the “bosses” at the helm of these machines were Democrats; Philadelphia and Chicago were intermittently controlled by Republicans. But the nation’s most famous machine, New York’s Tammany Hall, was solidly Democratic. As that city’s urban manufacturing workforce exploded in the early 20th century, Tammany Hall bosses had little choice but to forge an alliance with the workers’ parties.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThat led to a second inflection point, in the person of Al Smith. Manhattan-born, Irish Catholic, and a four-term governor of New York, Smith identified with immigrants and urban workers. When he won the 1928 Democratic presidential nomination, he arguably became the first urban national candidate, and won the support of blue-collar Catholic voters in cities across the country. Although he lost the election to Herbert Hoover, Smith’s candidacy marked a watershed in American history, as Rodden writes:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\r\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWhat started as an idiosyncratic local connection between urbanization and Democratic voting in New York quickly spread to the rest of the industrialized states in 1928 … [Smith’s platform] was not quite the agenda of the Socialists, but it was the beginning of the Democrats’ transformation into a party of the urban working class.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/07/where-have-all-the-children-gone/594133/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eDerek Thompson: The future of the city is childless\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eSmith’s successor as New York governor, Franklin D. Roosevelt, had better political fortunes: He won a landslide presidential victory in 1932 after the economy crashed, and his New Deal incorporated several elements of the socialist agenda, including Social Security and unemployment insurance. But FDR’s victory did little to solidify Democrats’ standing in the city. Passing the New Deal required the cooperation of politicians representing the distressed rural South. An alliance between the interests of the white manufacturing working class and southern segregationists lasted for decades.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eMiles away from New Deal negotiations in Washington, however, millions of black Americans were forcing the third inflection point as they moved from the rural South to cities, especially in the North and Midwest. During the Great Migration, from 1900 to 1960, the black percentage of the populations in South Carolina and Florida declined by more than 20 percent. In that same time period, the African American share of Detroit, Cleveland, and Chicago rose from less than 2 percent in each city to more than 20 percent of the population.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eBlack voters pushed urban Democrats in these northern cities to protect their labor and voting interests.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eBy the early 1960s, the Democratic Party was an unstable coalition, balancing the support of black urban workers with that of southern segregationists from whom they had fled. With the Civil Rights Act, signed by Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964, Democrats effectively renounced their southern flank. Out of 20 southern Democratic senators, just one—Ralph Yarborough, of Texas—voted in favor of the bill. In 1968, Democrats won less than 10 percent of the once-dependable white southern vote while sweeping the urban manufacturing cores of the Northeast and the Midwest, from Worcester to Wichita.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eOnly in the past 20 years have dense counties in the South become reliably Democratic, Rodden writes. Since the 1990s, southern cities have become more similar to their northern kin, boasting a similar mix of large companies and \u003ca href=\"https://www.citylab.com/life/2019/08/education-talent-city-ranking-college-degree-us/596509/\"\u003eexplosive growth\u003c/a\u003e in college-educated adults. What’s more, the Great Migration has started to reverse itself. In the past few decades, with the deindustrialization of northern manufacturing towns, millions of black families have returned to metros in Texas, Georgia, and North Carolina, bringing their politics with them. Black families on the move have twice pushed Democrats toward becoming a party of the city—first in the North, and then in the South.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/03/red-state-blue-city/513857/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: Red state, blue city\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"dropcap\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThere is no obvious reason why a 19th-century movement led by Irish Catholic noneducated factory workers should become a 21st-century party for college grads, nonwhite voters, and software developers that defends gay rights, women’s rights, and legalized abortion. But it makes sense if you understand the Democratic Party through the lens of the modern city. Starting in the 1970s through today, Democrats and Republicans have been compelled to take sides on issues that hadn’t previously been politicized. And they have routinely sorted themselves along urban-rural lines, creating a pattern where there was once merely a tendency.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eTake the issue of abortion, for example. Party identification didn’t used to work as a proxy for one’s opinion on reproductive rights.

So too, they sided against prayer in school and laws protecting “traditional” male-female marriage. Meanwhile, Republicans in the past 40 years have used socially conservative stances to strengthen their position with their more religious rural base.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eCity demographics, if not quite city values, also explain how Democrats went from the party of hardware to the party of software. As low-skill factory work has moved out of the urban core, blue-collar urban workers have been replaced in city centers with immigrants and college graduates working in finance, tech, marketing, and media. This has made Democrats “advocates for the nascent globalized knowledge-economy sector,” Rodden writes. As recently as 1996, there was no relationship between a county’s likelihood to produce patents and its Democratic voting share. Today, Democrats win overwhelmingly in counties with the largest number of patents per 1,000 people, such as San Jose and Seattle.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" height=\"335\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/09/unnamed/fbb37b977.png\" width=\"512\"\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"caption\"\u003eSource: \u003cem\u003eWhy Cities Lose,\u003c/em\u003e Jonathan Rodden\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith America’s biggest metros drawing millions of young educated workers, the urban-rural divide has also become a diploma divide.

In his 2008 book, \u003cem\u003eThe Big Sort\u003c/em\u003e, Bill Bishop argued that Americans were self-segregating by neighborhood, creating balkanized urban areas of kale-munching libs who find Cracker Barrel America culturally incomprehensible. Evidence for Bishop’s thesis is uneven, but there might something to the idea that blue cities get bluer due to sorting effects. As the writer and researcher Will Wilkinson argues, cities are magnets for individuals who score highly on “openness”—the Big Five personality trait that comprises curiosity, love of diversity, and open-mindedness. He points to \u003ca href=\"https://www.niskanencenter.org/wp-content/uploads/old_uploads/2019/06/Wilkinson-Density-Divide-Final.pdf\"\u003eresearch\u003c/a\u003e showing remarkable concentration of self-described “open” personalities in urban centers around the world, such as London.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIt’s also conceivable that living in a city might naturally promote ideologies that correspond with the modern Democratic Party. The modern city brings its residents into constant interaction with the fact of, and necessity for, state intervention. Urban residents trade cars for public transit, live in neighborhoods with local trash codes, and deal with planning commissions about shadows, ocean views, and parking rights. City residents are natural “externality pessimists,” to use Steve Randy Waldman’s \u003ca href=\"https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/7230.html\"\u003eclever phrase\u003c/a\u003e, who are exquisitely sensitive to the consequences of individual behavior in a dense place where one man’s action is another man’s nuisance.

In the past few years, young adults have been leaving the richest, densest metropolitan areas and moving south and west—to the suburbs of Austin, and Raleigh, and Vegas, and Phoenix. They’re not looking to start a political movement. They’re just looking for affordable houses, good schools, and good jobs.

As insurance against private school, he was planning to grab a spot at this public school by gaming the special-needs system—which, he added, wasn’t hard to do.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWanting to distance myself from this scheme, I waved my hand at the roomful of parents desperate to cough up $30,000 for preschool and said, “It’s all a scam.” I meant the whole business of basing admissions on interviews with 2-year-olds. The hedge-fund manager pointed out that if he reported my words to the admissions officer, he’d have one less competitor to worry about.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen the rejection letter arrived, I took it hard as a comment on our son, until my wife informed me that the woman with the frozen smile had actually been interviewing \u003ci\u003eus\u003c/i\u003e. We were the ones who’d been rejected. We consoled ourselves that the school wasn’t right for our family, or we for it. It was a school for amoral finance people.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt a second private school, my wife watched intently with other parents behind a one-way mirror as our son engaged in group play with other toddlers, their lives secured or ruined by every share or shove. He was put on the wait list.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe system that dominates our waking hours, commands our unthinking devotion, and drives us, like orthodox followers of an exacting faith, to extraordinary, even absurd feats of exertion is not democracy, which often seems remote and fragile. It’s meritocracy—the system that claims to reward talent and effort with a top-notch education and a well-paid profession, its code of rigorous practice and generous blessings passed down from generation to generation. The pressure of meritocracy made us apply to private schools when our son was 2—not because we wanted him to attend private preschool, but because, in New York City, where we live, getting him into a good public kindergarten later on would be even harder, and if we failed, by that point most of the private-school slots would be filled. As friends who’d started months earlier warned us, we were already behind the curve by the time he drew his picture of the moon. We were maximizing options—hedging, like the finance guy, like many families we knew—already tracing the long line that would lead to the horizon of our son’s future.\u003c/p\u003e\u003caside class=\"callout-placeholder\" data-source=\"magazine-issue\"\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe \u003ca href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2019/09/whats-the-difference-between-anxiety-and-ambition.html\"\u003emood of meritocracy\u003c/a\u003e is anxiety—the low-grade panic when you show up a few minutes late and all the seats are taken. New York City, with its dense population, stratified social ladder, and general pushiness, holds a fun-house mirror up to meritocracy. Only New York would force me to wake up early one Saturday morning in February, put on my parka and wool hat, and walk half a mile in the predawn darkness to register our son, then just 17 months old, for nursery school. I arrived to find myself, at best, the 30th person in a line that led from the locked front door of the school up the sidewalk. Registration was still two hours off, and places would be awarded on a first-come, first-served basis. At the front of the line, parents were lying in sleeping bags. They had spent the night outside.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI stood waiting in the cold with a strange mix of feelings. I hated the hypercompetitive parents who made everyone’s life more tense. I feared that I’d cheated our son of a slot by not rising until the selfish hour of 5:30. And I worried that we were all bound together in a mad, heroic project that we could neither escape nor understand, driven by supreme devotion to our own child’s future. All for a nursery school called Huggs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNew York’s distortions let you see the workings of meritocracy in vivid extremes. But the system itself—structured on the belief that, unlike in a collectivized society, individual achievement should be the basis for rewards, and that, unlike in an inherited aristocracy, those rewards must be earned again by each new generation—is all-American. True meritocracy came closest to realization with the rise of standardized tests in the 1950s, the civil-rights movement, and the opening of Ivy League universities to the best and brightest, including women and minorities. A great broadening of opportunity followed. But in recent decades, the system has hardened into a new class structure in which professionals pass on their money, connections, ambitions, and work ethic to their children, while less educated families fall further behind, with little chance of seeing their children move up.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/06/the-birth-of-a-new-american-aristocracy/559130/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eFrom June 2018: The 9.9 percent is the new American aristocracy\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen parents on the fortunate ledge of this chasm gaze down, vertigo stuns them.

They’ll stay married, cook organic family meals, read aloud at bedtime every night, take out a crushing mortgage on a house in a highly rated school district, pay for music teachers and test-prep tutors, and donate repeatedly to overendowed alumni funds. The battle to get their children a place near the front of the line begins before conception and continues well into their kids’ adult lives. At the root of all this is inequality—and inequality produces a host of morbid symptoms, including a frantic scramble for status among members of a professional class whose most prized acquisition is not a Mercedes plug-in hybrid SUV or a family safari to Maasai Mara but an acceptance letter from a university with a top‑10 \u003ci\u003eU.S. News \u0026amp; World Report \u003c/i\u003eranking.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn his new book, \u003ci\u003eThe Meritocracy Trap\u003c/i\u003e, the Yale Law professor \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/09/meritocracys-miserable-winners/594760/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eDaniel Markovits argues that this system turns elite families into business enterprises\u003c/a\u003e, and children into overworked, inauthentic success machines, while producing an economy that favors the super-educated and blights the prospects of the middle class, which sinks toward the languishing poor.

I suppressed disapproval of the partisan display (what if the face hanging from the teachers’ necks were Sarah Palin’s?) and reassured myself that the school had artistic and progressive values. It recruited the children of writers and other “creatives.” And our son’s monitored group play was successful. He was accepted.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe school had delicious attributes. Two teachers in each class of 15 children; parents who were concert pianists or playwrights, not just investment bankers; the prospect later on of classes in Latin, poetry writing, puppetry, math theory, taught by passionate scholars. Once in, unless a kid seriously messed up, he faced little chance of ever having to leave, until, 15 years on, the school matched its graduates with top universities where it had close relations with admissions offices. Students wouldn’t have to endure the repeated trauma of applying to middle and high schools that New York forces on public-school children.

No institution has more power to form human beings according to this idea than the public school. That was the original purpose of the “common schools” established by Horace Mann in the mid-19th century: to instill in children the knowledge and morality necessary for the success of republican government, while “embracing children of all religious, social, and ethnic backgrounds.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe claim of democracy doesn’t negate meritocracy, but they’re in tension.

Whatever torments they inflicted on our younger selves, we believed in them. We wanted our kids to learn in classrooms that resembled the city where we lived. We didn’t want them to grow up entirely inside our bubble—mostly white, highly and expensively educated—where 4-year-olds who hear 21,000 words a day acquire the unearned confidence of insular advantage and feel, even unconsciously, that they’re better than other people’s kids.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePublic schools are a public good. \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/07/richard-carranza-segregation-new-york-city-schools/564299/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eOur city’s are among the most racially and economically segregated in America\u003c/a\u003e.

Friends had pulled their kids out after second or third grade, so when we took the tour we insisted, against the wishes of the school guide, on going upstairs from the kindergarten classrooms and seeing the upper grades, too. Students were wandering around the rooms without focus, the air was heavy with listlessness, there seemed to be little learning going on. Each year the school was becoming a few percentage points less poor and less black as the neighborhood gentrified, but most of the white kids were attending a “gifted and talented” school within the school, where more was expected and more was given. The school was integrating and segregating at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne day I was at a local playground with our son when I fell into conversation with an elderly black woman who had lived in the neighborhood a long time and understood all about our school dilemma, which was becoming the only subject that interested me. She scoffed at our “zoned” school—it had been badly run for so long that it would need years to become passable. I mentioned a second school, half a dozen blocks away, that was probably available if we applied. Her expression turned to alarm. “Don’t send him there,” she said. “That’s a \u003ci\u003efailure\u003c/i\u003e school. That school will always be a \u003ci\u003efailure\u003c/i\u003e school.” It was as if an eternal curse had been laid on it, beyond anyone’s agency or remedy. The school was mostly poor and black. We assumed it would fail our children, because we knew it was failing other children.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat year, when my son turned 5, attending daytime tours and evening open houses became a second job. We applied to eight or nine public schools. We applied to far-flung schools that we’d heard took a few kids from out of district, only to find that there was a baby boom on and the seats had already been claimed by zoned families. At one new school that had a promising reputation, the orientation talk was clotted with education jargon and the toilets in the boys’ bathroom with shit, but we would have taken a slot if one had been offered.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAmong the schools where we went begging was one a couple of miles from our house that admitted children from several districts. This school was economically and racially mixed by design, with demographics that came close to matching the city’s population: 38 percent white, 29 percent black, 24 percent Latino, 7 percent Asian. That fact alone made the school a rarity in New York. Two-thirds of the students performed at or above grade level on standardized tests, which made the school one of the higher-achieving in the city (though we later learned that there were large gaps, as much as 50 percent, between the results for the wealthier, white students and the poorer, Latino and black students). And the school appeared to be a happy place. Its pedagogical model was progressive—“child centered”—based on learning through experience. Classes seemed loose, but real work was going on. Hallways were covered with well-written compositions. Part of the playground was devoted to a vegetable garden. This combination of diversity, achievement, and well-being was nearly unheard-of in New York public schools. This school squared the hardest circle. It was a liberal white family’s dream. The admission rate was less than 10 percent. We got wait-listed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe summer before our son was to enter kindergarten, an administrator to whom I’d written a letter making the case that our family and the school were a perfect match called with the news that our son had gotten in off the wait list. She gave me five minutes to come up with an answer. I didn’t need four and a half of them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI can see now that a strain of selfishness and vanity in me contaminated the decision. I lived in a cosseted New York of successful professionals. I had no authentic connection—not at work, in friendships, among neighbors—to the shared world of the city’s very different groups that our son was about to enter. I was ready to offer him as an emissary to that world, a token of my public-spiritedness. The same narcissistic pride that a parent takes in a child’s excellent report card, I now felt about sending him in a yellow school bus to an institution whose name began with \u003ci\u003eP.S.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA few parents at the private school reacted as if we’d given away a winning lottery ticket, or even harmed our son—such was the brittle nature of meritocracy. And to be honest, in the coming years, when we heard that sixth graders at the private school were writing papers on \u003ci\u003eThe Odyssey\u003c/i\u003e, or when we watched our son and his friends sweat through competitive public-middle-school admissions, we wondered whether we’d committed an unforgivable sin and went back over all our reasons for changing schools until we felt better.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBefore long our son took to saying, “I’m a public-school person.” When I asked him once what that meant, he said, “It means I’m not snooty.” He never looked back.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Illustration of a hand holding a pencil\" height=\"724\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/08/PackerOption2_1/59a5c7d93.jpg\" width=\"630\"\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"credit\"\u003ePaul Spella\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch3\u003e3.\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=\"smallcaps\"\u003eThe public school \u003c/span\u003ewas housed in the lower floors of an old brick building, five stories high and a block long, next to an expressway. A middle and high school occupied the upper floors. The building had the usual grim features of any public institution in New York—steel mesh over the lower windows, a police officer at the check-in desk, scuffed yellow walls, fluorescent lights with toxic PCBs, caged stairwells, ancient boilers and no air conditioners—as if to dampen the expectations of anyone who turned to government for a basic service. The bamboo flooring and state-of-the-art science labs of private schools pandered to the desire for a special refuge from the city. Our son’s new school felt utterly porous to it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI had barely encountered an American public school since leaving high school. That was in the late 1970s, in the Bay Area, the same year that the tax revolt began its long evisceration of California’s stellar education system. Back then, nothing was asked of parents except that they pay their taxes and send their children to school, and everyone I knew went to the local public schools. Now the local public schools—at least the one our son was about to attend—couldn’t function without parents. Donations at our school paid the salaries of the science teacher, the Spanish teacher, the substitute teachers. They even paid for furniture. Because many of the families were poor, our PTA had a hard time meeting its annual fundraising goal of $100,000, and some years the principal had to send out a message warning parents that science or art was about to be cut. Not many blocks away, elementary schools zoned for wealthy neighborhoods routinely raised $1 million—these schools were called “private publics.” Schools in poorer neighborhoods struggled to bring in $30,000. This enormous gap was just one way inequality pursued us into the public-school system.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe threw ourselves into the adventure of the new school. We sent in class snacks when it was our week, I chaperoned a field trip to study pigeons in a local park, and my wife cooked chili for an autumn fundraiser. The school’s sense of mission extended to a much larger community, and so there was an appeal for money when a fire drove a family from a different school out of its house, and a food drive after Hurricane Sandy ravaged the New York area, and a shoe drive for Syrian refugees in Jordan. We were ready to do just about anything to get involved. When my wife came in one day to help out in class, she was enlisted as a recess monitor and asked to change the underwear of a boy she didn’t know from another class who’d soiled himself. (Volunteerism had a limit, and that was it.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe private school we’d left behind had let parents know they weren’t needed, except as thrilled audiences at performances. But our son’s kindergarten teacher—an eccentric man near retirement age, whose uniform was dreadlocks (he was white), a leather apron, shorts, and sandals with socks—sent out frequent and frankly needy SOS emails. When his class of 28 students was studying the New York shoreline, he enlisted me to help build a replica of an antique cargo ship like the one docked off Lower Manhattan—could I pick up a sheet of plywood, four by eight by 5/8 of an inch, cut in half, along with four appropriate hinges and two dozen plumbing pieces, if they weren’t too expensive? He would reimburse me.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat first winter, the city’s school-bus drivers called a strike that lasted many weeks. I took turns with a few other parents ferrying a group of kids to and from school. Everyone who needed a ride would gather at the bus stop at 7:30 each morning and we’d figure out which parent could drive that day. Navigating the strike required a flexible schedule and a car, and it put immense pressure on families. A girl in our son’s class who lived in a housing project a mile from the school suddenly stopped attending. Administrators seemed to devote as much effort to rallying families behind the bus drivers’ union as to making sure every child could get to school. That was an early sign of what would come later, of all that would eventually alienate me, and I might have been troubled by it if I hadn’t been so taken with my new role as a public-school father teaming up with other parents to get us through a crisis.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e4.\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=\"smallcaps\"\u003eParents have one layer\u003c/span\u003e of skin too few. They’ve lost an epidermis that could soften bruises and dull panic. In a divided city, in a stratified society, that missing skin—the intensity of every little worry and breakthrough—is the shortest and maybe the only way to intimacy between people who would otherwise never cross paths. Children become a great leveler. Parents have in common the one subject that never ceases to absorb them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn kindergarten our son became friends with a boy in class I’ll call Marcus. He had mirthful eyes, a faint smile, and an air of imperturbable calm—he was at ease with everyone, never visibly agitated or angry. His parents were working-class immigrants from the Caribbean. His father drove a sanitation truck, and his mother was a nanny whose boss had been the one to suggest entering Marcus in the school’s lottery—parents with connections and resources knew about the school, while those without rarely did. Marcus’s mother was a quietly demanding advocate for her son, and Marcus was exactly the kind of kid for whom a good elementary school could mean the chance of a lifetime. His family and ours were separated by race, class, and the dozen city blocks that spell the difference between a neighborhood with tree-lined streets, regular garbage collection, and upscale cupcake shops, and a neighborhood with aboveground power lines and occasional shootings. If not for the school, we would never have known Marcus’s family.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe boys’ friendship would endure throughout elementary school and beyond. Once, when they were still in kindergarten, my wife was walking with them in a neighborhood of townhouses near the school, and Marcus suddenly exclaimed, “Can you imagine having a backyard?” We had a backyard. Our son kept quiet, whether out of embarrassment or an early intuition that human connections require certain omissions. Marcus’s father would drop him off at our house on weekends—often with the gift of a bottle of excellent rum from his home island—or I would pick Marcus up at their apartment building and drive the boys to a batting cage or the Bronx Zoo. They almost always played at our house, seldom at Marcus’s, which was much smaller. This arrangement was established from the start without ever being discussed. If someone had mentioned it, we would have had to confront the glaring inequality in the boys’ lives. I felt that the friendship flourished in a kind of benign avoidance of this crucial fact.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt school our son fell in with a group of boys who had no interest in joining the lunchtime soccer games. Their freewheeling playground scrums often led to good-natured insults, wrestling matches, outraged feelings, an occasional punch, then reconciliation, until the next day. And they were the image of diversity. Over the years, in addition to our son and Marcus, there was another black boy, another white boy, a Latino boy, a mixed-race boy, a boy whose Latino mother was a teacher’s aide at the school, and an African boy with white lesbian parents. A teacher at the private school had once called our son “anti-authoritarian,” and it was true: He pursued friends who were mildly rebellious, irritants to the teachers and lunch monitors they didn’t like, and he avoided kids who always had their hand up and displayed obvious signs of parental ambition. The anxious meritocrat in me hadn’t completely faded away, and I once tried to get our son to befriend a 9-year-old who was reading \u003ci\u003eAnimal Farm\u003c/i\u003e, but he brushed me off. He would do this his own way.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe school’s pedagogy emphasized learning through doing. Reading instruction didn’t start until the end of first grade; in math, kids were taught various strategies for multiplication and division, but the times tables were their parents’ problem. Instead of worksheets and tests, there were field trips to the shoreline and the Noguchi sculpture museum. “Project-based learning” had our son working for weeks on a clay model of a Chinese nobleman’s tomb tower during a unit on ancient China.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEven as we continued to volunteer, my wife and I never stopped wondering if we had cheated our son of a better education. We got antsy with the endless craft projects, the utter indifference to spelling. But our son learned well only when a subject interested him. “I want to learn facts, not skills,” he told his first-grade teacher. The school’s approach—the year-long second-grade unit on the geology and bridges of New York—caught his imagination, while the mix of races and classes gave him something even more precious: an unselfconscious belief that no one was better than anyone else, that he was everyone’s equal and everyone was his. In this way the school succeeded in its highest purpose.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd then things began to change.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e5.\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=\"smallcaps\"\u003eAround 2014, \u003c/span\u003ea\u003cspan class=\"smallcaps\"\u003e \u003c/span\u003enew mood germinated in America—at first in a few places, among limited numbers of people, but growing with amazing rapidity and force, as new things tend to do today. It rose up toward the end of the Obama years, in part out of disillusionment with the early promise of his presidency—out of expectations raised and frustrated, especially among people under 30, which is how most revolutionary surges begin. This new mood was progressive but not hopeful. A few short years after the teachers at the private preschool had crafted Obama pendants with their 4-year-olds, hope was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt the heart of the new progressivism was indignation, sometimes rage, about ongoing injustice against groups of Americans who had always been relegated to the outskirts of power and dignity. An incident—a police shooting of an unarmed black man; news reports of predatory sexual behavior by a Hollywood mogul; a pro quarterback who took to kneeling during the national anthem—would light a fire that would spread overnight and keep on burning because it was fed by anger at injustices deeper and older than the inflaming incident. Over time the new mood took on the substance and hard edges of a radically egalitarian ideology.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt points where the ideology touched policy, it demanded, and in some cases achieved, important reforms: body cameras on cops, reduced prison sentences for nonviolent offenders, changes in the workplace. But its biggest influence came in realms more inchoate than policy: the private spaces where we think and imagine and talk and write, and the public spaces where institutions shape the contours of our culture and guard its perimeter.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWho was driving the new progressivism? Young people, influencers on social media, leaders of cultural organizations, artists, journalists, educators, and, more and more, elected Democrats. You could almost believe they spoke for a majority—but you would be wrong. An \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/10/large-majorities-dislike-political-correctness/572581/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eextensive survey of American political opinion\u003c/a\u003e published last year by a nonprofit called More in Common found that a large majority of every group, including black Americans, thought “political correctness” was a problem. The only exception was a group identified as “progressive activists”—just 8 percent of the population, and likely to be white, well educated, and wealthy. Other polls found that white progressives were readier to embrace diversity and immigration, and to blame racism for the problems of minority groups, than black Americans were. The new progressivism was a limited, mainly elite phenomenon.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePolitics becomes most real not in the media but in your nervous system, where everything matters more and it’s harder to repress your true feelings because of guilt or social pressure. It was as a father, at our son’s school, that I first understood the meaning of the new progressivism, and what I disliked about it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEvery spring, starting in third grade, public-school students in New York State take two standardized tests geared to the national Common Core curriculum—one in math, one in English. In the winter of 2015–16, our son’s third-grade year, we began to receive a barrage of emails and flyers from the school about the upcoming tests. They all carried the message that the tests were not mandatory. “Inform Yourself!” an email urged us. “Whether or not your child will take the tests is YOUR decision.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDuring the George W. Bush and Obama presidencies, statewide tests were used to improve low-performing schools by measuring students’ abilities, with rewards (“race to the top”) and penalties (“accountability”) doled out accordingly. These standardized tests could determine the fate of teachers and schools. Some schools began devoting months of class time to preparing students for the tests.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe excesses of “high-stakes testing” inevitably produced a backlash. In 2013, four families at our school, with the support of the administration, kept their kids from taking the tests. These parents had decided that the tests were so stressful for students and teachers alike, consumed so much of the school year with mindless preparation, and were so irrelevant to the purpose of education that they were actually harmful. But even after the city eased the consequences of the tests, the opt-out movement grew astronomically. In the spring of 2014, 250 children were kept from taking the tests.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe critique widened, too: Educators argued that the tests were structurally biased, even racist, because nonwhite students had the lowest scores. “I believe in assessment—I took tests my whole life and I’ve used assessments as an educator,” one black parent at our school, who graduated from a prestigious New York public high school, told me. “But now I see it all differently. Standardized tests are the gatekeepers to keep people out, and I know exactly who’s at the bottom. It is torturous for black, Latino, and low-income children, because they will never catch up, due to institutionalized racism.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur school became the citywide leader of the new movement; the principal was interviewed by the New York media. Opting out became a form of civil disobedience against a prime tool of meritocracy. It started as a spontaneous, grassroots protest against a wrongheaded state of affairs. Then, with breathtaking speed, it transcended the realm of politics and became a form of moral absolutism, with little tolerance for dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe took the school at face value when it said that this decision was ours to make. My wife attended a meeting for parents, billed as an “education session.” But when she asked a question that showed we hadn’t made up our minds about the tests, another parent quickly tried to set her straight. The question was out of place—\u003ci\u003eno one\u003c/i\u003e should want her child to take the tests. The purpose of the meeting wasn’t to provide neutral information. Opting out required an action—parents had to sign and return a letter—and the administration needed to educate new parents about the party line using other parents who had already accepted it, because school employees were forbidden to propagandize.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe weren’t sure what to do. Instead of giving grades, teachers at our school wrote long, detailed, often deeply knowledgeable reports on each student. But we wanted to know how well our son was learning against an external standard. If he took the tests, he would miss a couple of days of class, but he would also learn to perform a basic task that would be part of his education for years to come.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSomething else about the opt-out movement troubled me. Its advocates claimed that the tests penalized poor and minority kids. I began to think that the real penalty might come from not taking them. Opting out had become so pervasive at our school that the Department of Education no longer had enough data to publish the kind of information that prospective applicants had once used to assess the school. In the category of “Student Achievement” the department now gave our school “No Rating.” No outsider could judge how well the school was educating children, including poor, black, and Latino children. The school’s approach left gaps in areas like the times tables, long division, grammar, and spelling. Families with means filled these gaps, as did some families whose means were limited—Marcus’s parents enrolled him in after-school math tutoring. But when a girl at our bus stop fell behind because she didn’t attend school for weeks after the death of her grandmother, who had been the heart of the family, there was no objective measure to act as a flashing red light. In the name of equality, disadvantaged kids were likelier to falter and disappear behind a mist of togetherness and self-deception. Banishing tests seemed like a way to let everyone off the hook. This was the price of dismissing meritocracy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI took a sounding of parents at our bus stop. Only a few were open to the tests, and they didn’t say this loudly. One parent was trying to find a way to have her daughter take the tests off school grounds. Everyone sensed that failing to opt out would be unpopular with the principal, the staff, and the parent leaders—the school’s power structure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA careful silence fell over the whole subject. One day, while volunteering in our son’s classroom, I asked another parent whether her son would take the tests. She flashed a nervous smile and hushed me—it wasn’t something to discuss at school. One teacher disapproved of testing so intensely that, when my wife and I asked what our son would miss during test days, she answered indignantly, “Curriculum!” Students whose parents declined to opt out would get no preparation at all. It struck me that this would punish kids whom the movement was supposed to protect.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf orthodoxy reduced dissenters to whispering—if the entire weight of public opinion at the school was against the tests—then, I thought, our son should take them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe week of the tests, one of the administrators approached me in the school hallway. “Have you decided?” I told her that our son would take the tests.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eShe was the person to whom I’d once written a letter about the ideal match between our values and the school’s, the letter that may have helped get our son off the wait list. Back then I hadn’t heard of the opt-out movement—it didn’t exist. Less than four years later, it was the only truth. I wondered if she felt that I’d betrayed her.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLater that afternoon we spent an hour on the phone. She described all the harm that could come to our son if he took the tests—the immense stress, the potential for demoralization. I replied with our reason for going ahead—we wanted him to learn this necessary skill. The conversation didn’t feel completely honest on either side: She also wanted to confirm the school’s position in the vanguard of the opt-out movement by reaching 100 percent compliance, and I wanted to refuse to go along. The tests had become secondary. This was a political argument.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur son was among the 15 or so students who took the tests. A 95 percent opt-out rate was a resounding success. It rivaled election results in Turkmenistan. As for our son, he finished the tests feeling neither triumphant nor defeated. The issue that had roiled the grown-ups in his life seemed to have had no effect on him at all. He returned to class and continued working on his report about the mountain gorillas of Central Africa.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Illustration of the American flag with gold stars scattered on top\" height=\"929\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/08/PackerOption3_1/60b0dda90.jpg\" width=\"672\"\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"credit\"\u003ePaul Spella\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch3\u003e6.\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=\"smallcaps\"\u003eThe battleground \u003c/span\u003eof\u003cspan class=\"smallcaps\"\u003e \u003c/span\u003ethe new progressivism is identity. That’s the historical source of exclusion and injustice that demands redress. In the past five years, identity has set off a burst of exploration and recrimination and creation in every domain, from television to cooking. “Identity is the topic at the absolute center of our conversations about music,” \u003ci\u003eThe New York Times Magazine \u003c/i\u003edeclared in 2017, in the introduction to a special issue consisting of 25 essays on popular songs. “For better or worse, it’s all identity now.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe school’s progressive pedagogy had fostered a wonderfully intimate sense of each child as a complex individual. But progressive politics meant thinking in groups. When our son was in third or fourth grade, students began to form groups that met to discuss issues based on identity—race, sexuality, disability. I understood the solidarity that could come from these meetings, but I also worried that they might entrench differences that the school, by its very nature, did so much to reduce. Other, less diverse schools in New York, including elite private ones, had taken to dividing their students by race into consciousness-raising “affinity groups.” I knew several mixed-race families that transferred their kids out of one such school because they were put off by the relentless focus on race. Our son and his friends, whose classroom study included slavery and civil rights, hardly ever discussed the subject of race with one another. The school already lived what it taught.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe bathroom crisis hit our school the same year our son took the standardized tests. A girl in second grade had switched to using male pronouns, adopted the initial Q as a first name, and begun dressing in boys’ clothes. Q also used the boys’ bathroom, which led to problems with other boys. Q’s mother spoke to the principal, who, with her staff, looked for an answer. They could have met the very real needs of students like Q by creating a single-stall bathroom—the one in the second-floor clinic would have served the purpose. Instead, the school decided to get rid of boys’ and girls’ bathrooms altogether. If, as the city’s Department of Education now instructed, schools had to allow students to use the bathroom of their self-identified gender, then getting rid of the labels would clear away all the confusion around the bathroom question. A practical problem was solved in conformity with a new idea about identity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWithin two years, almost every bathroom in the school, from kindergarten through fifth grade, had become gender-neutral. Where signs had once said \u003cspan class=\"smallcaps\"\u003eboys\u003c/span\u003e and \u003cspan class=\"smallcaps\"\u003egirls\u003c/span\u003e, they now said \u003cspan class=\"smallcaps\"\u003estudents\u003c/span\u003e. Kids would be conditioned to the new norm at such a young age that they would become the first cohort in history for whom gender had nothing to do with whether they sat or stood to pee. All that biology entailed—curiosity, fear, shame, aggression, pubescence, the thing between the legs—was erased or wished away.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe school didn’t inform parents of this sudden end to an age-old custom, as if there were nothing to discuss. Parents only heard about it when children started arriving home desperate to get to the bathroom after holding it in all day. Girls told their parents mortifying stories of having a boy kick open their stall door. Boys described being afraid to use the urinals. Our son reported that his classmates, without any collective decision, had simply gone back to the old system, regardless of the new signage: Boys were using the former boys’ rooms, girls the former girls’ rooms. This return to the familiar was what politicians call a “commonsense solution.” It was also kind of heartbreaking. As children, they didn’t think to challenge the new adult rules, the new adult ideas of justice. Instead, they found a way around this difficulty that the grown-ups had introduced into their lives. It was a quiet plea to be left alone.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen parents found out about the elimination of boys’ and girls’ bathrooms, they showed up en masse at a PTA meeting. The parents in one camp declared that the school had betrayed their trust, and a woman threatened to pull her daughter out of the school. The parents in the other camp argued that gender labels—and not just on the bathroom doors—led to bullying and that the real problem was the patriarchy. One called for the elimination of urinals. It was a minor drama of a major cultural upheaval. The principal, who seemed to care more about the testing opt-out movement than the bathroom issue, explained her financial constraints and urged the formation of a parent-teacher committee to resolve the matter. After six months of stalemate, the Department of Education intervened: One bathroom would be gender-neutral.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=\"smallcaps\"\u003eIn politics, identity \u003c/span\u003eis an appeal to authority—the moral authority of the oppressed: \u003ci\u003eI am what I am, which explains my view and makes it the truth\u003c/i\u003e. The politics of identity starts out with the universal principles of equality, dignity, and freedom, but in practice it becomes an end in itself—often a dead end, a trap from which there’s no easy escape and maybe no desire for escape. Instead of equality, it sets up a new hierarchy that inverts the old, discredited one—a new moral caste system that ranks people by the oppression of their group identity. It makes race, which is a dubious and sinister social construct, an essence that defines individuals regardless of agency or circumstance—as when Representative Ayanna Pressley said, “We don’t need any more brown faces that don’t want to be a brown voice; we don’t need black faces that don’t want to be a black voice.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt times the new progressivism, for all its up-to-the-minuteness, carries a whiff of the 17th century, with heresy hunts and denunciations of sin and displays of self-mortification. The atmosphere of mental constriction in progressive milieus, the self-censorship and fear of public shaming, the intolerance of dissent—these are qualities of an illiberal politics.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI asked myself if I was moving to the wrong side of a great moral cause because its tone was too loud, because it shook loose what I didn’t want to give up. It took me a long time to see that the new progressivism didn’t just carry my own politics further than I liked. It was actually hostile to principles without which I don’t believe democracy can survive. Liberals are always slow to realize that there can be friendly, idealistic people who have little use for liberal values.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e7.\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=\"smallcaps\"\u003eIN 2016 \u003c/span\u003etwo\u003cspan class=\"smallcaps\"\u003e \u003c/span\u003eobsessions claimed our family—\u003ci\u003eHamilton\u003c/i\u003e and the presidential campaign. We listened and sang along to the \u003ci\u003eHamilton\u003c/i\u003e soundtrack every time we got in the car, until the kids had memorized most of its brilliant, crowded, irresistible libretto. Our son mastered Lafayette’s highest-velocity rap, and in our living room he and his sister acted out the climactic duel between Hamilton and Burr. The musical didn’t just teach them this latest version of the revolution and the early republic. It filled their world with the imagined past, and while the music was playing, history became more real than the present. Our daughter, who was about to start kindergarten at our son’s school, wholly identified with the character of Hamilton—she fought his battles, made his arguments, and denounced his enemies. Every time he died she wept.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/09/lin-manuel-miranda-hamilton/408019/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: How Lin-Manuel Miranda’s ‘Hamilton’ shapes history\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eHamilton\u003c/i\u003e and the campaign had a curious relation in our lives. The first acted as a disinfectant to the second, cleansing its most noxious effects, belying its most ominous portents. Donald Trump could sneer at Mexicans and rail against Muslims and kick dirt on everything decent and good, but the American promise still breathed whenever the Puerto Rican Hamilton and the black Jefferson got into a rap battle over the national bank. When our daughter saw pictures of the actual Founding Fathers, she was shocked and a little disappointed that they were white. The only president our kids had known was black. Their experience gave them no context for Trump’s vicious brand of identity politics, which was inflaming the other kinds. We wanted them to believe that America was better than Trump, and \u003ci\u003eHamilton\u003c/i\u003e kept that belief in the air despite the accumulating gravity of facts. Our son, who started fourth grade that fall, had dark premonitions about the election, but when the \u003ci\u003eAccess Hollywood \u003c/i\u003evideo surfaced in October, he sang Jefferson’s gloating line about Hamilton’s sex scandal: “Never gonna be president now!”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe morning after the election, the kids cried. They cried for people close to us, Muslims and immigrants who might be in danger, and perhaps they also cried for the lost illusion that their parents could make things right. Our son lay on the couch and sobbed inconsolably until we made him go to the bus stop.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe next time we were in the car, we automatically put on \u003ci\u003eHamilton\u003c/i\u003e. When “Dear Theodosia” came on, and Burr and Hamilton sang to their newborn children, “If we lay a strong enough foundation, we’ll pass it on to you, we’ll give the world to you, and you’ll blow us all away,” it was too much for me and my wife. We could no longer feel the romance of the young republic. It was a long time before we listened to \u003ci\u003eHamilton\u003c/i\u003e again.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA few weeks after the election, our daughter asked if Trump could break our family apart. She must have gotten the idea from overhearing a conversation about threats to undocumented immigrants. We told her that we were lucky—we had rights as citizens that he couldn’t take away. I decided to sit down with the kids and read the Bill of Rights together. Not all of it made sense, but they got the basic idea—the president wasn’t King George III, the Constitution was stronger than Trump, certain principles had not been abolished—and they seemed reassured.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSince then it has become harder to retain faith in these truths.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur daughter said that she hated being a child, because she felt helpless to do anything. The day after the inauguration, my wife took her to the Women’s March in Midtown Manhattan. She made a sign that said \u003cspan class=\"smallcaps\"\u003ewe have power too\u003c/span\u003e, and at the march she sang the one protest song she knew, “We Shall Overcome.” For days afterward she marched around the house shouting, “Show me what democracy looks like!”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur son was less given to joining a cause and shaking his fist. Being older, he also understood the difficulty of the issues better, and they depressed him, because he knew that children really could do very little. He’d been painfully aware of climate change throughout elementary school—first grade was devoted to recycling and sustainability, and in third grade, during a unit on Africa, he learned that every wild animal he loved was facing extinction. “What are humans good for besides destroying the planet?” he asked. Our daughter wasn’t immune to the heavy mood—she came home from school one day and expressed a wish not to be white so that she wouldn’t have slavery on her conscience. It did not seem like a moral victory for our children to grow up hating their species and themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe decided to cut down on the political talk around them. It wasn’t that we wanted to hide the truth or give false comfort—they wouldn’t have let us even if we’d tried. We just wanted them to have their childhood without bearing the entire weight of the world, including the new president we had allowed into office. We owed our children a thousand apologies. The future looked awful, and somehow we expected them to fix it. Did they really have to face this while they were still in elementary school?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI can imagine the retort—the rebuke to everything I’ve written here: Your privilege has spared them. There’s no answer to that—which is why it’s a potent weapon—except to say that identity alone should neither uphold nor invalidate an idea, or we’ve lost the Enlightenment to pure tribalism. Adults who draft young children into their cause might think they’re empowering them and shaping them into virtuous people (a friend calls the Instagram photos parents post of their woke kids “selflessies”). In reality the adults are making themselves feel more righteous, indulging another form of narcissistic pride, expiating their guilt, and shifting the load of their own anxious battles onto children who can’t carry the burden, because they lack the intellectual apparatus and political power. Our goal shouldn’t be to tell children what to think. The point is to teach them how to think so they can grow up to find their own answers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI wished that our son’s school would teach him civics. By age 10 he had studied the civilizations of ancient China, Africa, the early Dutch in New Amsterdam, and the Mayans. He learned about the genocide of Native Americans and slavery. But he was never taught about the founding of the republic. He didn’t learn that conflicting values and practical compromises are the lifeblood of self-government. He was given no context for the meaning of freedom of expression, no knowledge of the democratic ideas that Trump was trashing or of the instruments with which citizens could hold those in power accountable. Our son knew about the worst betrayals of democracy, including the one darkening his childhood, but he wasn’t taught the principles that had been betrayed. He got his civics from \u003ci\u003eHamilton\u003c/i\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/10/civics-education-helps-form-young-voters-and-activists/572299/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: Civics education helps create young voters and activists\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe teaching of civics has dwindled since the 1960s—a casualty of political polarization, as the left and the right each accuse the other of using the subject for indoctrination—and with it the public’s basic knowledge about American government. In the past few years, civics has been making a comeback in certain states. As our son entered fifth grade, in the first year of the Trump presidency, no subject would have been more truly empowering.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEvery year, instead of taking tests, students at the school presented a “museum” of their subject of study, a combination of writing and craftwork on a particular topic. Parents came in, wandered through the classrooms, read, admired, and asked questions of students, who stood beside their projects. These days, called “shares,” were my very best experiences at the school. Some of the work was astoundingly good, all of it showed thought and effort, and the coming-together of parents and kids felt like the realization of everything the school aspired to be.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe fifth-grade share, our son’s last, was different. That year’s curriculum included the Holocaust, Reconstruction, and Jim Crow. The focus was on “upstanders”—individuals who had refused to be bystanders to evil and had raised their voices. It was an education in activism, and with no grounding in civics, activism just meant speaking out. At the year-end share, the fifth graders presented dioramas on all the hard issues of the moment—sexual harassment, LGBTQ rights, gun violence. Our son made a plastic-bag factory whose smokestack spouted endangered animals. Compared with previous years, the writing was minimal and the students, when questioned, had little to say. They hadn’t been encouraged to research their topics, make intellectual discoveries, answer potential counterarguments. The dioramas consisted of cardboard, clay, and slogans.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Illustration of a school desk with gold stars overlaid on top\" height=\"886\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/08/PackerOption3NEWW/49f0740ee.jpg\" width=\"672\"\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"credit\"\u003ePaul Spella\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch3\u003e8.\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=\"smallcaps\"\u003eStudents in New \u003cspan class=\"caps\"\u003eYork City\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e public schools have to apply to middle school. They rank schools in their district, six or eight or a dozen of them, in order of preference, and the middle schools rank the students based on academic work and behavior. Then a Nobel Prize–winning algorithm matches each student with a school, and that’s almost always where the student has to go. The city’s middle schools are notoriously weak; in our district, just three had a reputation for being “good.” An education expert near us made a decent living by offering counseling sessions to panic-stricken families. The whole process seemed designed to raise the anxiety of 10-year-olds to the breaking point.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“If you fail a math test you fail seventh grade,” our daughter said one night at dinner, looking years ahead. “If you fail seventh grade you fail middle school, if you fail middle school you fail high school, if you fail high school you fail college, if you fail college you fail life.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe were back to the perversions of meritocracy. But the country’s politics had changed dramatically during our son’s six years of elementary school. Instead of hope pendants around the necks of teachers, in one middle-school hallway a picture was posted of a card that said, “Uh-oh! Your privilege is showing. You’ve received this card because your privilege just allowed you to make a comment that others cannot agree or relate to. Check your privilege.” The card had boxes to be marked, like a scorecard, next to “White,” “Christian,” “Heterosexual,” “Able-bodied,” “Citizen.” (Our son struck the school off his list.) This language is now not uncommon in the education world. A teacher in Saratoga Springs, New York, found a “privilege-reflection form” online with an elaborate method of scoring, and administered it to high-school students, unaware that the worksheet was evidently created by a right-wing internet troll—it awarded Jews 25 points of privilege and docked Muslims 50.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe middle-school scramble subjected 10- and 11-year-olds to the dictates of meritocracy and democracy at the same time: a furiously competitive contest and a heavy-handed ideology. The two systems don’t coexist so much as drive children simultaneously toward opposite extremes, realms that are equally inhospitable to the delicate, complex organism of a child’s mind. If there’s a relation between the systems, I came to think, it’s this: Wokeness prettifies the success race, making contestants feel better about the heartless world into which they’re pushing their children. Constantly checking your privilege is one way of not having to give it up.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn the day acceptance letters arrived at our school, some students wept. One of them was Marcus, who had been matched with a middle school that he didn’t want to attend. His mother went in to talk to an administrator about an appeal. The administrator asked her why Marcus didn’t instead go to the middle school that shared a building with our school, that followed the same progressive approach as ours, and that was one of the worst-rated in the state. Marcus’s mother left in fury and despair. She had no desire for him to go to the middle school upstairs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur son got into one of the “good” middle schools. Last September he came home from the first day of school and told us that something was wrong. His classmates didn’t look like the kids in his elementary school. We found a pie chart that broke his new school down by race, and it left him stunned. Two-thirds of the students were white or Asian; barely a quarter were black or Latino. Competitive admissions had created a segregated school.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHis will be the last such class. Two years ago, Mayor Bill de Blasio declared a new initiative to integrate New York City’s schools. Our district, where there are enough white families for integration to be meaningful, was chosen as a test case. Last year a committee of teachers, parents, and activists in the district announced a proposal: Remove the meritocratic hurdle that stands in the way of equality. The proposal would get rid of competitive admissions for middle school—grades, tests, attendance, behavior—which largely accounted for the racial makeup at our son’s new school. In the new system, students would still rank their choices, but the algorithm would be adjusted to produce middle schools that reflect the demography of our district, giving disadvantaged students a priority for 52 percent of the seats. In this way, the district’s middle schools would be racially and economically integrated. De Blasio’s initiative was given the slogan “Equity and Excellence for All.” It tried to satisfy democracy and meritocracy in a single phrase.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI went back and forth and back again, and finally decided to support the new plan. My view was gratuitous, since the change came a year too late to affect our son. I would have been sorely tested if chance had put him in the first experimental class. Under the new system, a girl at his former bus stop got matched with her 12th choice, and her parents decided to send her to a charter school. No doubt many other families will leave the public-school system. But I had seen our son flourish by going to an elementary school that looked like the city. I had also seen meritocracy separate out and demoralize children based on their work in fourth grade. “If you fail middle school,” our daughter said, “you fail life.” It was too soon for children’s fates to be decided by an institution that was supposed to serve the public good.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2017/07/internalizing-the-myth-of-meritocracy/535035/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: Poor kids who believe in meritocracy suffer\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI wanted the plan to succeed, but I had serious doubts. It came festooned with all the authoritarian excess of the new progressivism. It called for the creation of a new diversity bureaucracy, and its relentless jargon squashed my hope that the authors knew how to achieve an excellent education for all. Instead of teaching civics that faced the complex truths of American democracy, “the curriculum will highlight the vast historical contributions of non-white groups \u0026amp; seek to dispel the many non-truths/lies related to American \u0026amp; World History.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Excellence” was barely an afterthought in the plan. Of its 64 action items, only one even mentioned what was likely to be the hardest problem: “Provide support for [district] educators in adopting best practices for academically, racially \u0026amp; socioeconomically mixed classrooms.” How to make sure that children of greatly different abilities would succeed, in schools that had long been academically tracked? How to do it without giving up on rigor altogether—without losing the fastest learners?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe had faced this problem with our daughter, who was reading far ahead of her grade in kindergarten and begged her teacher for math problems to solve. When the school declined to accommodate her, and our applications to other public schools were unsuccessful, we transferred her to a new, STEM-focused private school rather than risk years of boredom. We regretted leaving the public-school system, and we were still wary of the competitive excesses of meritocracy, but we weren’t willing to abandon it altogether.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Department of Education didn’t seem to be thinking about meritocracy at all. Its entire focus was on achieving diversity, and on rooting out the racism that stood in the way of that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLate in the summer of 2018, a public meeting was called in our district to discuss the integration plan. It was the height of vacation season, but several hundred parents, including me, showed up. Many had just heard about the new plan, which buried the results of an internal poll showing that a majority of parents wanted to keep the old system. We were presented with a slideshow that included a photo of white adults snarling at black schoolchildren in the South in the 1960s—as if only vicious racism could motivate parents to oppose eliminating an admissions system that met superior work with a more challenging placement. Even if the placement was the fruit of a large historical injustice, parents are compromised; a policy that tells them to set aside their children’s needs until that injustice has been remedied is asking for failure. Just in case the implication of racism wasn’t enough to intimidate dissenters, when the presentation ended, and dozens of hands shot up, one of the speakers, a progressive city-council member, announced that he would take no questions. He waved off the uproar that ensued. It was just like the opt-out “education session” my wife had attended: The deal was done. There was only one truth.\u003c/p\u003e\u003caside class=\"callout-placeholder\" data-source=\"curated\"\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003cp\u003eDe Blasio’s schools chancellor, Richard Carranza, has answered critics of the diversity initiative by calling them out for racism and refusing to let them “silence” him. As part of the initiative, Carranza has mandated anti-bias training for every employee of the school system, at a cost of $23 million. One training slide was titled “White Supremacy Culture.” It included “Perfectionism,” “Individualism,” “Objectivity,” and “Worship of the Written Word” among the white-supremacist values that need to be disrupted. In the name of exposing racial bias, the training created its own kind.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe legacy of racism, together with a false meritocracy in America today that keeps children trapped where they are, is the root cause of the inequalities in the city’s schools. But calling out racism and getting rid of objective standards won’t create real equality or close the achievement gap, and might have the perverse effect of making it worse by driving out families of all races who cling to an idea of education based on real merit. If integration is a necessary condition for equality, it isn’t sufficient. Equality is too important to be left to an ideology that rejects universal values.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e9.\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=\"smallcaps\"\u003eIn middle school \u003c/span\u003eour son immediately made friends with the same kind of kids who had been his friends in elementary school—outsiders—including Latino boys from the district’s poorest neighborhood. One day he told us about the “N-word passes” that were being exchanged among other boys he knew—a system in which a black kid, bartering for some item, would allow a white kid to use the word. We couldn’t believe such a thing existed, but it did. When one white boy kept using his pass all day long, our son grabbed the imaginary piece of paper and ripped it to shreds. He and his friends heard the official language of moral instruction so often that it became a source of irony and teasing: “Hey, dude, you really need to check your privilege.” When his teacher assigned students to write about how they felt about their identity, letting the class know that whiteness was a source of guilt for her, our son told her that he couldn’t do it. The assignment was too personal, and it didn’t leave enough space for him to describe all that made him who he was.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Isn’t school for learning math and science and reading,” he asked us one day, “not for teachers to tell us what to think about society?” He was responding as kids do when adults keep telling them what to think.

Now we’re stewing in anxiety and anger, feverish with bad ideas, too absorbed in our own failures to spare our children.

They laughed. They embraced. They told each other their life stories. Theirs is the first public case of a patient meeting their cord-blood donor. For nearly 30 years, donations from infant umbilical-cord blood have been strictly anonymous for ethical reasons, but mail-in DNA tests have now introduced a way to circumvent the policy—even inadvertently, as in Becker’s case.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e“We just didn’t think technology like this would exist and this scenario would arrive,” says Joanne Kurtzberg, the director of the Carolinas Cord Blood Bank and a pioneer in cord-blood banking. But now it has, and Kurtzberg said it was sure to come up at a cord-blood meeting she happens to be organizing in Miami this weekend.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eBecker and Davey’s connection began 25 years ago, shortly after he was born. His mom agreed to donate his umbilical-cord blood, and for several years his cells lay frozen in a cord-blood bank in New York. Meanwhile, hundreds of miles away in Chicago, a 24-year-old Becker started getting fevers and night sweats and extreme fatigue—symptoms, it turned out, of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, a cancer that affects white blood cells. She went through multiple rounds of chemo. They all failed. “I was literally at the point where I was about to die,” she says. That’s when her doctor suggested a then-novel transplant involving cord blood from a stranger.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eUmbilical cords are rich in hematopoietic stem cells, which ultimately give rise to all different types of blood cells. To do the transplant, doctors would destroy Becker’s own cancerous cells before infusing her with hematopoietic stem cells from a healthy matched donor. Those cells would eventually divide to replace all the blood in her. It was a grueling procedure, and Becker did not fully recover for two years. But she has stayed healthy ever since, and she has always wondered over the years about the anonymous donor who saved her life. Her doctor told her the donor was untraceable. That’s how it’s supposed to work.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"left\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" height=\"870\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/09/Davey_Patrick_at_2_months_and_Dania/8c7615420.jpg\" width=\"672\"\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"caption\"\u003eDania Davey with a two-month-old Patrick (Courtesy of Dania Davey)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eAnd when Becker finally spit into a tube for her AncestryDNA test, she was not trying to find her donor; she did not even know that was possible. She was just interested in her family history. But the test matched her to Patrick’s mom, Dania Davey, who immediately messaged Becker when she saw a new and very close match—so close as to be mother or daughter. Davey, who is adopted, had recently found her birth family through AncestryDNA, and this new match made no sense. She knew her birth mother. She certainly knew Becker was not her daughter. They both thought the test was wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eBut Becker wondered about the transplant. She asked Davey whether she was from New York—because that was the only fact she knew about her cord-blood donor. Davey said yes. When Becker shared her hypothesis with her oncologist at Loyola Medicine, Patrick Stiff, he was initially skeptical. Transplants with hematopoietic stem cells—which can come from cord blood, as in Becker’s case, or from bone marrow—should only alter the blood cells in her body. The rest of her would still be her. Why would DNA in Becker’s saliva match her donor’s? (On the other hand, blood transfusions do not involve killing off the recipient’s blood cells and have only tiny, transient effects on the recipient’s DNA.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/10/dna-test-divorce/571684/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: When a DNA test reveals your daughter is not your biological child\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThen, Stiff told me, he heard from yet another transplant patient, who spit into an AncestryDNA tube and got strange results. The DNA in saliva, it turns out, can come from cells in the cheek lining (which should have the recipient’s DNA) and from white blood cells (which should have the donor’s DNA) that guard against bacteria in the mouth. \u003ca href=\"https://www.ancestry.com/lp/bone-marrow-stem-cell-transplant-dna-test\"\u003eAncestryDNA\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://customercare.23andme.com/hc/en-us/articles/202907990-I-received-a-bone-marrow-transplant-can-I-use-the-23andMe-Personal-Genetic-Service-\"\u003e23andMe\u003c/a\u003e actually advise customers who have had bone-marrow or cord-blood transplants against taking their tests, as the mix of genetic material can cause them to fail. Often enough, though, the tests return the genetic results of the donor. Many bone-marrow recipients have gotten their donors’ DNA results, and Stiff said he knew of at least one other unpublicized case of a cord-blood recipient who found their donor.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eTo confirm what everyone now suspected, Patrick Davey took a DNA test. He did, in fact, match the original records for Becker’s anonymous donor. So for all these years, the two strangers had had this unusual bond: To receive cord blood is to carry forever someone else’s DNA inside you. To donate cord blood is to possibly have someone out there—unbeknownst to you even—walking around with your DNA inside them. “All my friends joked around, ‘Who knows, you’ll be pinned for a murder,’” says Davey, laughing at the idea that Becker would be murderous. (They’ve vowed to keep in touch. “She’s like family now,” he says.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eAs far-fetched as that may sound, something like it has happened before.

The evidence turned out to have come from his brother, who had given the incarcerated man a bone-marrow transplant years earlier.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eAdult bone-marrow and infant cord-blood donations do differ in one important way, though. An infant is rarely aware that the cord blood was donated. Patrick didn’t know until the whole business with the DNA test came up. He wasn’t the one who consented to the donation, after all, as he had just been born. His mom did.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThis is what gave pause to Brianne Kirkpatrick, a genetic counselor who has written about \u003ca href=\"https://www.watersheddna.com/blog-and-news/stemcelltransplantgedmatch\"\u003eDNA tests and bone-marrow transplants\u003c/a\u003e. “It was a great story, a really happy outcome for the woman. Her life was saved,” she says. “It’s more the implications of what that means on a grander societal level.” Consumer DNA tests have been used to uncover family secrets and track down criminals; those investigations can go very wrong if test results are misinterpreted because some people don’t realize their cord blood was donated.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/04/fertility-doctor-donald-cline-secret-children/583249/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: The fertility doctor’s secret\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe cord-blood community is taking seriously the implications of donor and recipient contact too. Kurtzberg says banks had established a policy of strict anonymity in part because of the fear that sick recipients might try to contact donors to get more cells. (Blood from a single umbilical cord may not contain enough cells for an adult. Moreover, siblings of the donor may match the recipient as well.) Nobody wanted a scenario of a dying patient begging a parent to let them take bone marrow from a young child.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThis wall has stayed in place, even as the first infants whose cord blood was donated have become adults. Donna Regan, the director of customer-ready products for \u003ca href=\"https://bethematch.org/\"\u003eBe the Match\u003c/a\u003e—the nonprofit that operates the registry for cord-blood donations—says her organization recently reviewed the policy about letting recipients contact now-adult donors. The group decided against it—because the mothers had been promised anonymity when they consented all those years ago. “We’ve been very rigid in protecting the confidentiality and identity of cord-blood donors,” says Regan, and she doesn’t expect that policy to change. For new cord-blood donors in the future, Kurtzberg says she thinks banks will have to change what they say about anonymity when asking for informed consent. But that overhaul will be slow.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eSperm banks are currently \u003ca href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2019/09/11/consumer-dna-tests-sperm-donor-anonymity/\"\u003edealing with a similar fallout\u003c/a\u003e, as donor-conceived people are finding their sometimes reluctant donors through DNA tests.

Democrats have continued to describe higher education as a mostly positive force in American life, but Republicans’ opinions of college, beginning around 2015, took a sharp turn toward the negative.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis shift didn’t come out of nowhere. Conservative politicians and media figures have in recent years been making a sustained and often vociferous public case against higher education. Instead of college, their argument often goes, young Americans should pursue a career in the skilled trades. And there is one trade that gets held up more than any other as an example of the opportunities awaiting those who shun college: welding.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you trace back the history of this idea, you eventually get to a kind of welding ur-text: an April 2014 op-ed column in \u003cem\u003eThe\u003c/em\u003e \u003cem\u003eWall Street Journal\u003c/em\u003e by Josh Mandel, then the Republican treasurer of Ohio, titled “Welders Make $150,000? Bring Back Shop Class.” Its premise was that in rural Ohio, there was such a shortage of skilled tradespeople that employers were regularly hiring welders at salaries of $150,000 a year and up. Mandel contrasted the bountiful opportunities available to blue-collar workers without college degrees with the dismal prospects he said many college graduates faced: “Too many young people have four-year liberal-arts degrees, are thousands of dollars in debt and find themselves serving coffee at Starbucks or working part-time at the mall.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2019/08/republicans-conservatives-college/596497/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: \u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2019/08/republicans-conservatives-college/596497/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRepublicans changed their mind about higher education really quickly\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMandel’s notion of economic salvation through welding spread quickly, from op-ed pages to cable-news segments to political speeches. In a 2015 Republican presidential debate, Senator Marco Rubio declared, “For the life of me, I don’t know why we have stigmatized vocational education. Welders make more money than philosophers. We need more welders and less philosophers.” President Donald Trump invited a welder from Dayton to be one of the guests of honor at his first State of the Union address, and Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos has visited welding classes across the country, from a suburb of Fort Worth to Far Rockaway, Queens. Paul Ryan extolled the virtues of a welding career at a summit meeting sponsored by the American Enterprise Institute. Even Ivanka Trump pulled on a welding mask for the cameras and tried her hand with a torch.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp align=\"center\"\u003e***\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn November 2016, a few days after Donald Trump’s victory, I traveled to Taylorsville, North Carolina, a small town in the Appalachian foothills. Taylorsville is remote and sparsely populated; to get to a Starbucks or a movie theater—or just a town with more than 5,000 people—it’s at least a half-hour drive. Almost everyone in town is white, and only about one in seven adults has a bachelor’s degree. In the 2016 presidential election, three-quarters of the county voted Republican.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI had come to Taylorsville to try to understand more deeply the relationship between higher education, opportunity, and welding, and I spent a couple of evenings in the home of a young welding student in his mid-twenties named Orry Carriere, drinking coffee and talking. His journey through adolescence and high school had been rocky, he told me. Orry’s father had left before he was born, and the absence of a stable male role model in his life had led him into some wild and self-destructive behavior, especially in his early teens. He made it through high school, but only barely, graduating 388th in a class of 389.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter high school, Orry went to work. He spent a year installing locks for a local company, and then another year doing oil changes at the Taylorsville Snappy Lube. Those jobs paid minimum wage or a little more, and the work wasn’t steady or predictable. At 21, Orry got married, and he and his wife moved into a rented trailer. His stepfather helped him get his next job, drawing wire at a factory. It was hard work, loud and dirty and repetitive, but it paid $13.90 an hour, more than Snappy Lube. After a year and a half, Orry was fired for missing too many days of work, but he soon managed to land a job at another steel-wire factory. Then he got fired from that job as well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt was by that point the spring of 2016, and Orry was 24, separated, and unemployed. He was raising two children with his ex-wife, Katie, and he was living with a new girlfriend named Crystal. Orry had been working hard for five years, and yet he was broke, with nothing saved. At every job he’d had, he told me, he’d been made to feel as though he was disposable, like he didn’t really matter.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCrystal was also unemployed that spring, and she suggested they both think about going back to school. At first, college seemed like the last thing Orry might want to consider. But Crystal showed Orry the website for Catawba Valley Community College in nearby Hickory, and he saw that the school offered an associate’s degree in welding. He had done a little welding in high school and liked it, and that made the notion of college a lot easier to imagine. “It dawned on me that by firing me, they had given me an opportunity,” Orry told me, talking about his former employer. “I could go to college to better myself, and I could find a different job, something that was away from all this.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen I met Orry on that November night in Taylorsville, he was just a couple of months into his first semester at CVCC. To his surprise, he had come to see college as his route to a better life, not just for himself but for his young family. “I want my kids to have stuff I didn’t have growing up,” he told me. “I don’t want them to have to wonder where their next meal is coming from. I want them to have the chances I never had.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp align=\"center\"\u003e*   *   *\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the many odd things about the rhetoric that posits welding as the antithesis of college is that in order to become a welder, you actually have to go to college. You can learn the basics in a high-school shop class, as Orry did, but to do it well, you not only have to master multiple precise manual skills; you also need a pretty deep scientific understanding of the metal you’re working with and the electrical and chemical processes you’re using to manipulate that metal. To earn an associate’s degree, Orry would need to pass 12 separate welding courses, plus basic courses in math and English, as well as more conceptual courses in welding metallurgy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHis first year at CVCC went well, mostly. It wasn’t completely smooth—he failed his required English course, which was offered only online. But in his welding classes, he earned nothing but A’s and B’s. After that first year ended, he ran into some bureaucratic trouble with his financial aid, he told me, and he took both the summer and the fall of 2017 off from school. For a while, I wondered whether he might just be finished with college. But then he started up again as a full-time student in January 2018.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen I visited him that winter, Orry said he was glad to be back in school, but otherwise, life was not going well. He and Crystal were broke. They had been evicted from their house, and their car was stolen. There was a moment that semester, Orry told me, when he wanted to give up on school, leave his family behind, and start over in a new town. But he kept thinking of his children and the example he was setting for them, and he decided to get back to class, even if he had to take the bus many miles to get there.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStill, at the end of that semester, Orry remained 16 credits shy of the 65 he needed to complete his associate’s degree, and those included his required English and math classes, which he wasn’t confident he could pass. Part of him wanted to go right back to school in the fall and finish his degree, but he wasn’t sure how to pull it off. He and Crystal had broken up, and he was back together with his ex-wife, Katie; Orry and Katie and their two kids had moved in with Orry’s mother.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat summer, he found a job in Wilkesboro, working in a factory that manufactured doors. It was a good position, but the work was hot and exhausting and his schedule was brutal: 12-hour night shifts for seven days straight, from 6:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m., followed by seven straight days off. He knew there was no way he could manage school with that schedule. He was earning $16.75 an hour, which was a decent wage, but it was only a couple of dollars an hour more than he had been making before he started college. And he now had $19,000 in student loans that he would soon have to start paying back.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOrry was no longer feeling all that optimistic about the welding profession. Despite the sunny claims of \u003cem\u003eThe\u003c/em\u003e \u003cem\u003eWall Street Journal\u003c/em\u003e and Marco Rubio, the real-life welding jobs that Orry was able to find in western North Carolina were paying experienced welders between $12 and $15 an hour, which was less than he was making at the door factory. Orry knew that better-paying welding jobs existed, but they were far away and short-term and physically arduous, and if he went out and chased one, he’d have to leave his kids behind. Now that he was back together with Katie and they had what felt like a genuine family, he wanted to stay close to home and be a real father. Besides, even those well-paying welding jobs didn’t pay \u003cem\u003ethat\u003c/em\u003e well—maybe $30 or $40 an hour, if he got lucky.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is the other glaring flaw at the heart of the case for welding as the ideal alternative to college. The overwhelming majority of American welders are not earning $150,000 a year. Not even close. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average annual salary for an experienced welder in 2018 was a little more than $41,000 a year—which was only about $16,000 above the poverty line for a family of four.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2019/03/choosing-trade-school-over-college/584275/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: The stigma of choosing trade school over college\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe good thing about welding as a profession is that it has a relatively high salary floor. You’re almost always going to make more than minimum wage, even starting out. But the downside, economically, is that welding has a pretty low salary ceiling. Welders at the 90th percentile of income for the profession, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, earn $63,000 a year before taxes. Those are, statistically, the top earners, and they are usually expert welders with decades of experience. The salaries that make headlines in \u003cem\u003eThe\u003c/em\u003e \u003cem\u003eWall Street Journal\u003c/em\u003e are somewhere between rare and apocryphal.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhich leads to an intriguing question: Given the sobering reality that those unbiased statistics convey, why has the wealthy-welder myth become so widely accepted, at least in certain circles? Why does Marco Rubio believe—or claim to believe—that welders make more than philosophers?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp align=\"center\"\u003e*    *   *\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLet me suggest three possible reasons.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe first and most obvious one is that the people making the political speeches and writing the newspaper columns and taking part in the cable-news segments don’t know any actual welders. When you watch a talk-show conversation about the folly of the four-year college degree, you can be reasonably confident that everyone on camera has a four-year college degree. So that is potential reason No. 1: simple ignorance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe second possible reason is wishful thinking, topped with a dollop of nostalgia. Money aside, welding is an impressive and admirable pursuit. It is a burly, physical job, but there is delicate artistry in it as well, fine craftsmanship with a creative spirit. And an economy in which a manual laborer could reliably earn enough money to support a middle-class family—which is to say, an economy like the United States had not too long ago—would indeed be more equitable, more socially stable, and more family-friendly than the actual economy we have today.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe third possible reason for the ubiquity of the wealthy-welder myth is less benign: If we are able to persuade ourselves that there are plenty of lucrative opportunities available for young people like Orry who didn’t much like high school, it absolves us of our shared responsibility to address the reality of his limited economic prospects. And if you are able to define welding training, in the public mind, as something \u003cem\u003eseparate\u003c/em\u003e from college, rather than what it actually is—a college major like any other—it provides a way to distract public attention from policy shifts that have made it more difficult for young people like Orry to reach the middle class. Over the past decade, as the make-believe story of the rich welder has grown and spread, public spending on the community colleges where actual young people are trying to learn actual welding has shrunk—in some states, quite drastically so.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn North Carolina, the amount the state government spends on each community-college student declined, after adjusting for inflation, from $5,830 per student in 2007 to $4,891 per student in 2016, the year that Orry enrolled at CVCC. That’s a cut of about 16 percent, and it took place during a period when state tax revenues in North Carolina actually went up. The state has the money, in other words, but state legislators are choosing not to spend it on institutions like Catawba Valley Community College.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat happened in North Carolina mirrors what happened in most other states: When the recession hit in 2008, tax revenues dropped sharply, and state governments cut their spending on higher education. Then the recovery arrived, and tax revenues went back up—but most state governments didn’t replace the funding they had cut from the budgets of community colleges and other public colleges.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThose budget cuts in North Carolina had a direct impact on Orry’s experience at CVCC. First, they added to his tuition costs, and thus to his debt: When adjusted for inflation, community-college tuition in North Carolina has increased by 49 percent since 2007.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut more important: The new revenue from North Carolina’s community-college students has not been enough to compensate for the cuts in state spending, which means colleges like CVCC have had to cut budgets and cut corners. That is why the English class that Orry needs to pass in order to get his degree is offered only online: because it’s cheaper that way.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere is no doubt that Orry would benefit from high-quality face-to-face instruction from a caring and conscientious English professor. But he is almost certainly not going to get it. And that is going to make it much harder for him to pass, and thus to graduate. Orry says he is still determined to finish his associate’s degree, but if he doesn’t manage to do so, he won’t be alone. Right now, only 26 percent of students at CVCC are able to complete a two-year degree in three years.\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003csmall\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis article has been adapted from Paul Tough’s book, \u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780544944480\"\u003eThe Years That Matter Most: How College Makes or Breaks Us. \u003c/a\u003e\u003c/small\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/qZdfrI-12Vw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/qZdfrI-12Vw/","published":"2019-09-13T11:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-597733"},{"title":"Daniel Johnston, the Folk Poet of Devil Town","content":"\u003cp\u003eIn 1990, the songwriter Daniel Johnston \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLCvD6plgQ\"\u003ecalled into a radio show\u003c/a\u003e in New Jersey from his parents’ bedroom in West Virginia to perform one of his songs, “Speeding Motorcycle.” Yo La Tengo, which had recorded its own version of the track, was set up to play with him, but live in the studio. “Daniel, first of all, I think I better introduce you to this band,” the DJ said as the musicians were gearing up to play. “Okay, hi, band,” Johnston replied. “Ready?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHis curtness might have seemed rude from anyone less gentle. Johnston, who died Wednesday at the age of 58, was revered by a generation of alt-rockers for his softness. An outsider artist who sang in a faltering voice about his ghosts and demons, Johnston was admired by Kurt Cobain and others for his troubled and often childlike songs, many of which were shaped by his experiences with mental illness. (Johnston was diagnosed with depression and schizophrenia.) His best-known track might be “Devil Town,” the opener off his album \u003cem\u003e1990\u003c/em\u003e, although it only became famous years after its release, thanks to performances by the likes of \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEdVaNSegXw\"\u003eBright Eyes\u003c/a\u003e. “All my friends were vampires / Didn’t know they were vampires,” Johnston sings. “Turns out I was a vampire myself / In the devil town.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBorn in Sacramento, Johnston \u003ca href=\"https://www.austinchronicle.com/daily/music/2019-09-11/austin-songwriting-genius-daniel-johnston-dead-at-58/\"\u003egrew up in West Virginia\u003c/a\u003e in a Christian fundamentalist household, a setting that informed the eschatological imagery in his work. In the early 1980s, he relocated to Austin, where he recorded his punk-folk lullabies on homemade cassette tapes that he—and others on his behalf—distributed via local record stores. He helped make Austin weird: The city boasts a famous \u003ca href=\"https://www.texasobserver.org/the-peoples-frog/\"\u003emural of a mutant bullfrog\u003c/a\u003e drawn by Johnston for the cover of \u003cem\u003eHi, How Are You?\u003c/em\u003e, an unfinished 1983 cassette.

Two of his songs, both of which first appeared on cassette, were included on the soundtrack to Larry Clark’s 1995 film, \u003cem\u003eKids\u003c/em\u003e. Like the movie itself, the selection of Johnston’s music was controversial. Both picks are tributes to Casper the Friendly Ghost, a figure who occupies a dark place in the artist’s personal cosmology: A few years earlier, while flying in a two-seater plane with his father, Johnston had a mental-health episode and, believing himself to be Casper, took the keys from the ignition and threw them out of the plane. As a \u003ca href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/apr/02/metallica\"\u003e2005 documentary recounts\u003c/a\u003e, both Johnstons survived the crash; a photograph taken immediately afterward shows the father and son in front of a church billboard that reads, “God promises a safe landing, but not a calm voyage.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTaken as a whole, Johnston’s career shows how neuroatypical artists usually remain on the margins of the music industry, even when the scene reveres them. When Mary Lou Lord, Beck, and other alt-rockers rerecorded his songs, their versions reached far wider audiences. Despite his brush with broader appeal, Johnston never achieved commercial success. Half his recorded catalog was committed to cassette, and the other albums were published by a string of small labels. Johnston reached his artistic zenith in the 2000s, with a tribute album featuring covers by Vic Chesnutt, Tom Waits, Death Cab for Cutie, and others.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut by the time his drawings made it into the 2006 biennial at the Whitney Museum of American Art, Johnston himself had mostly dropped off the map. Atlantic Records, the only major label to represent him, had let him go in 1996 after his debut album, \u003cem\u003eFun\u003c/em\u003e, proved to be a flop. He intermittently produced other recordings until 2012; while he endured hospitalizations all his life, in more recent years, they became frequent. A producer from Austin, Brian Beattie, has edited a final (\u003ca href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2019/09/the-story-of-cult-music-icon-daniel-johnstons-lost-album.html\"\u003estill unreleased\u003c/a\u003e) album, which includes a seven-minute rendition of Carole King’s “You’ve Got a Friend.” Members of the bands Fugazi, Wilco, and Built to Spill helped Johnston to mount a farewell tour in 2017.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile Johnston’s songs will endure, it’s hard not to think about the work he never finished, including the so-called lost record, \u003ca href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2019/09/the-story-of-cult-music-icon-daniel-johnstons-lost-album.html\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eIf\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.

Generally, substantive conversation about the fundamental reform of education in America took a back seat to health care, foreign policy, and climate. The candidates onstage were given only a brief spell to discuss their plans to revamp the nation’s education system. In the hurried few moments that they did receive, the candidates fell back on their bullet points. The education secretary needs to be an educator, Senator Elizabeth Warren insisted. Teachers need to be paid more, Harris said. We need to invest in colleges, Sanders pressed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe lack of discussion about education policy—higher-education policy, in particular—was glaringly apparent, given how much attention the candidates have paid to student debt and college affordability during the primary cycle. Since 2007, the Democratic Party has \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2019/06/democrats-debt-cancellation-free-college/591043/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eradically shifted on the methods\u003c/a\u003e it is willing to propose to tackle the student-debt crisis. Still, there is genuine disagreement among the candidates who took the stage in Houston about what exactly a new administration should do, as opposed to with primary education, where all the candidates seem to agree that increased federal grants for low-income students seem like a good idea. Some hopefuls, such as Sanders and Warren, view debt cancellation or tuition-free college as the answer; others, such as Buttigieg and Senator Amy Klobuchar, have backed a more metered approach.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInstead, the education-heavy section of the debate centered on K–12, and on teacher pay and charter schools in particular. In the shadow of the \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2019/01/teachers-are-launching-a-rebellion/580975/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eteacher strikes\u003c/a\u003e that have swept across the nation in the past few years, several candidates have proposed raising salaries for teachers. But increasing teacher pay would not radically transform schools in the way that the Green New Deal would combat climate change or free college would revolutionize higher education.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2019/01/teachers-are-launching-a-rebellion/580975/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: America’s teachers are furious\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHarris, Sanders, Warren, and other 2020 Democrats have pointed to school funding—and rethinking the link between property taxes and money for schools—as one way to revamp public schools in America. Throughout the three debates so far, however, the subject has received little attention, and details about how exactly candidates would reform that link are scant.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere is, of course, a finite amount of time in each presidential debate—even if that time is three hours—and sandwiching every pet issue into that time is difficult. But the executive branch’s role in education is felt most by the nation’s colleges and universities, while much of K–12 education is handled by state and local governments. That candidates from one of the two major parties were not given time to debate the merits of their plans to oversee higher education is an oversight in itself.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/fhU5DUA6zyY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/fhU5DUA6zyY/","published":"2019-09-13T14:18:53Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-598000"},{"title":"Befriending the Queen of Chess","content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eEvery week, \u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/projects/friendship-files/?utm_source=feed\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Friendship Files\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e features a conversation between \u003c/em\u003eThe Atlantic\u003cem\u003e’s Julie Beck and two or more friends, exploring the history and significance of their relationship.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis week she talks with two Hungarian master chess players: Judit Polgár, who is \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/02/nyregion/02chess.html\"\u003ewidely considered\u003c/a\u003e the \u003ca href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Judit-Polgar\"\u003ebest female chess player\u003c/a\u003e of \u003ca href=\"https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20180822-what-we-can-learn-from-female-chess-prodigies\"\u003eall time\u003c/a\u003e, and Anna Rudolf, who grew up idolizing Judit as a child.

Of course, it helps if your character is very competitive and you have patience and perseverance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen I was competing quite a lot. Competitions last about 10 days or two weeks. I was homeschooled, so in this way I could train on a daily basis for many hours.

And I competed, and I wanted to get into the Olympic team. But I wanted to have something else as a job, because I didn't think I would get anywhere near the heights of Judit.

The restaurant is about to close; we can barely get food. But even though we’re exhausted and the next day we have to wake up very early, it was still a very good mood.

Worse still, by daring to challenge black athletes to redirect their talents to historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs), I was somehow betraying King, along with the color-blind vision he supposedly laid out in his famous “I Have a Dream” speech. One reader sent me a screenshot of that speech, insisting that I read it and take notes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn that same spirit, I would direct that reader and others to Harry Belafonte’s memoir, \u003cem\u003eMy Song\u003c/em\u003e, in which the entertainer and activist relayed a \u003ca href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-other-side-of-martin-luther-kings-dream_b_5a526e7ee4b0ee59d41c0bdf\"\u003esobering story about King\u003c/a\u003e, a dear friend of his who spoke at Belafonte’s New York apartment a week before his assassination. “What deeply troubles me now,” King told the group, “is that for all the steps we’ve taken toward integration, I’ve come to believe that we are integrating into a burning house.” In his final years, King pretty clearly came to the understanding that no amount of integration would, on its own, make up for a long history of economic injustice. That hasn’t stopped conservatives from invoking “I Have a Dream” against affirmative action—and an idea like mine—or from putting themselves forward as the true defenders of race neutrality.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eOn Fox News this week, the host Laura Ingraham \u003ca href=\"https://beta.washingtonpost.com/sports/2019/09/11/some-thought-benjamin-watson-dunked-laura-ingraham-hes-just-happy-reach-her-viewers/\"\u003edescribed my proposal\u003c/a\u003e as “resegregating the country.” It isn’t; black athletes are free to go anywhere they like, and nonblack students have always been allowed to attend HBCUs, too. Regardless, instead of \u003ca href=\"https://video.foxnews.com/v/6085344689001/#sp=show-clips\"\u003emislabeling my argument\u003c/a\u003e, conservatives should have been applauding it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eFor years, commentators on the right have lectured black people to pull themselves up by their own bootstraps. (Let’s put aside, for the moment, everything that’s wrong with that argument, which presumes that individual achievement can successfully overcome centuries of institutionally racist policies.) I am encouraging black people to use their athletic talents for the good of their own community. College football and basketball have become billion-dollar empires. College coaches and administrators make millions in salary because of the lucrative television and merchandise deals that marquee black talent has helped them secure. These same athletes could help rebuild, revitalize, and strengthen HBCUs, which were black athletes’ only option during segregation, but which have since struggled financially and academically.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eTimes have changed, but the HBCUs play an outsize role in cultivating future black professionals and community leaders. Despite constituting only 3 percent of four-year colleges in the country, HBCUs have, for instance, produced 80 percent of the nation’s black judges and 50 percent of its black doctors. Even President Donald Trump, whom \u003ca href=\"https://thehill.com/hilltv/what-americas-thinking/454574-trump-approval-rating-drops-among-minorities-after-go-back\"\u003every few black Americans\u003c/a\u003e view as an ally, understands that these schools deserve federal support. “This nation owes a profound debt of gratitude to its HBCUs,” \u003ca href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-2019-national-historically-black-colleges-universities-week-conference/\"\u003ehe told more than 40 leaders from such schools\u003c/a\u003e at a conference this week.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eAnd if top college prospects were to attend HBCUs, then the benefits would ripple outward through the black community at large.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eYou might think this message would resonate with conservatives. Self-reliance rather than increased government dependency? Using capitalism and market forces to improve your community’s lot in life? These strategies are part of the conservative Ten Commandments. But the notion that black athletes would use their own talents to build up historically black institutions rather than make money for majority-white ones is, for some reason, unthinkable.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIn fact, the accumulation of black wealth and talent has always been feared—sometimes leading to tragic results for African Americans. Historians believe the the \u003ca href=\"https://beta.washingtonpost.com/news/local/wp/2018/09/28/feature/they-was-killing-black-people/\"\u003eTulsa massacre in 1921\u003c/a\u003e was born out of white racial resentment toward affluent African Americans, who used their oil wealth to turn Tulsa’s Greenwood neighborhood into a thriving enclave known as “Black Wall Street.” Those resentments exploded into violence after it was rumored that a black teenager had sexually assaulted a 17-year-old white female elevator operator. Angry whites destroyed Greenwood during the 18-hour race riot, which resulted in 300 black people dead, and 10,000 people left homeless.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe United States kept black people from building wealth in other ways. When the GI Bill was created in 1944, \u003ca href=\"https://www.history.com/news/gi-bill-black-wwii-veterans-benefits\"\u003esome lawmakers feared that it would increase upward mobility for blacks\u003c/a\u003e, since the bill promised to provide war veterans with resources such as unemployment benefits, low-interest mortgages, and vocational training. \u003ca href=\"https://www.neh.gov/humanities/2014/julyaugust/feature/how-the-gi-bill-became-law-in-spite-some-veterans-groups\"\u003eRepresentative John Rankin\u003c/a\u003e of Mississippi, the chair of the House Veterans Committee at the time, successfully argued that the bill should be administered by individual states rather than the government. By doing that, Rankin, who also tried to block a provision that provided unemployment benefits to black soldiers, guaranteed that black soldiers would receive inequitable treatment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eSo while white soldiers were using these benefits to buy homes and businesses during the height of the post–World War II housing boom, black soldiers were excluded from fully utilizing these benefits for years.

As many historians and economists have noted, if black soldiers had been able to fully participate in the postwar housing boom, there might have been wealth to pass down to subsequent generations. \u003ca href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/brookings-now/2019/06/18/a-conversation-about-the-racial-wealth-gap-and-how-to-address-it/\"\u003eAccording to the latest data\u003c/a\u003e, the median average white family in the United States has a net worth of $171,000, while the average African American family has only $17,000.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe resistance to black empowerment exposes deep-held insecurities and blatant hypocrisy.

The first question, to polling leader Biden, was whether he thought Warren and Sanders were pushing policies that were \u0026ldquo;too far beyond where Democrats want to go and where the country needs to go.\u0026rdquo; Biden dodged, saying that\u0026rsquo;s up to the voters. For her part, Warren didn\u0026rsquo;t make any efforts to ding Biden, maintaining her consistent position of keeping her fire trained on Trump.

Well, I\u0026#8217;m for Barack [Obama].\u0026rdquo; Biden repeatedly pressed for answers on cost from Warren and Sanders, who have an unofficial \u003ca href=\"https://time.com/5670161/2020-democratic-primary-candidates-friends/\" \u003enon-aggression pact\u003c/a\u003e between them. And when talk turned to union-negotiated insurance plans that are more generous than Medicare and why workers would sacrifice benefits, Biden questioned Sanders\u0026rsquo; assertion that workers would have their pay raised in exchange. \u0026ldquo;For a socialist, you\u0026#8217;ve got a lot more confidence in corporate America than I do,\u0026rdquo; Biden snarked.\u003cem\u003e\u0026mdash; Philip Elliott\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e3.

Moderator Linsey Davis noted that some of the Senator\u0026#8217;s positions in her recently released criminal justice plan, including her support for marijuana legalization, marked a shift from policies she had implemented as a prosecutor.\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003eHarris was ready with a response.

Harris also acknowledged that she had sometimes fallen short of that goal. \u0026#8220;Was I able to get enough done? Absolutely not,\u0026#8221; she conceded. But she argued that her experience will help her finish the job as President.

If people were given a limited menu of characteristics from which to choose, what would be the non-negotiables?

Each dollar represented an increase of 10% in one trait. To make their partner funnier than 40% of the population, for example, participants had to spend $40. At first they spent big on everything, but as their budget grew smaller in each round of the study, they had to really figure out what they wanted. After kindness, men almost universally favored physical attractiveness and women chose good financial prospects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe asked the researcher Andrew G. Thomas, a senior lecturer in Psychology at Swansea, to explain his research.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYour study looks at the differences in mating preferences between countries that are traditionally considered \u0026ldquo;Western\u0026rdquo; and countries that are traditionally considered \u0026ldquo;Eastern.\u0026rdquo; Why were you interested in this?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\nWithin social sciences, there\u0026rsquo;s this view that attitudes and desires are primarily the product of learning or culture. As an evolutionary psychologist, I believe that some behaviors emerge consistently across cultures \u0026ndash; they are human \u0026ldquo;universals.\u0026rdquo; Looking at very different culture groups allows us to test this idea. If we find that men and women act in a similar way across the globe, then this adds weight to the idea that some behaviors develop in spite of culture rather than because of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe results suggest that across the board, men show a preference for youth and beauty, while women show a preference for ability to provide. Why is that?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\nThis is a finding that crops up time and time again within evolutionary psychology. The most convincing theory is that ancestral men and women evolved to choose partners in ways that helped them reproduce successfully, and that modern men and women continue to do this today. Because women\u0026rsquo;s fertility declines with age, ancestral men prioritized youth and beauty to ensure they picked a fertile mate. Similarly, because resources can make raising a child easier, and because the ability to provide resources varies from one man to the next, ancestral women evolved to prioritize social status to ensure they picked a mate who could invest in them and their offspring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAfter those three, which you classify as necessities, the next most popular trait was humor, at least in the Western group. Did its high prioritization surprise you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\nHumor ended up being a priority in the Western group, but not the Eastern one. The fact that humor was important wasn\u0026rsquo;t too surprising, as there are a few good theories that suggest that humor is important in mate selection. However, the East-West difference was surprising. Upon reflection, I think this is because some of the traits included in the task (e.g., religiosity and chastity) are more important in Eastern cultures than the Western ones. So when budgets were tight, Western participants were able to ignore these attributes and spend more dollars on humor, while Eastern ones could not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo how different are people from Western and Eastern cultures in terms of what we want in a partner? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\nWe found cultural differences for almost every trait. However, in most cases, these were a simply matter of degree. For example, for men and women from both cultures the most important trait, hands down, was kindness. This far outweighed traits like creativity, religiosity and humor. Sure, there were small cultural differences in the importance of kindness, but the real finding is that this was consistently a top trait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWere there any other significant differences between men and women?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\nOne very interesting difference was in a partner\u0026#8217;s desire for children. We found that this wasn\u0026rsquo;t a priority in the Eastern sample at all. However, within the Western one, women gave it priority but not men. We think this may have something to do with family planning. In cultures where contraception is widespread, a partner\u0026rsquo;s desire for children may predict the likelihood of starting a family. In contrast, in cultures where contraception use is less widespread, having children may be a natural consequence of sex within a relationship, making actual desire for children less relevant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAre there any other circumstances in which people prioritize kindness more or less in a mate?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\nWhile the precise number of dollars allocated to kindness is different across cultures and sex, these don\u0026rsquo;t change the overall finding that kindness is king. However, one thing that we know does kill kindness is a change of relationship context. In our study we asked participants to design a long-term partner. But other versions of the task have asked people to design a short-term partner. When this happens, kindness is given much less priority.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat small difference between the groups you studied intrigued you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\nIt always surprises me with this task that creativity takes a back seat to most other traits, and this pattern was repeated in our large cross-cultural comparison. Highly successful creative individuals, such as musicians and artists, are often highly desirable mates, but maybe what\u0026rsquo;s actually being valued here is not creativity as such but the social status that accompanies it. It makes me wonder what groupies really like about the bands they follow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAny takeaway from all this for people who are currently dating?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\nFirst of all, I think it\u0026rsquo;s great that kindness is king and appears to be a human universal.

A few years later, Schleichkorn began remixing classic cartoons like Looney Tunes and Muppets footage with commercial hip hop tracks and uploading them to YouTube and Facebook, where he began to get viral traction, even winning a Webby Award in 2017 that led to a freelance gig shortly afterwards with Adult Swim.

Cory Booker (D-NJ) speaks during the third Democratic primary debate of the 2020 presidential campaign. | Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images\u003c/small\u003e\n\n  \u003cp\u003eWhy didn’t he seize the chance to talk about his animal welfare plan?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp id=\"MXUc4v\"\u003e“You are a vegan since 2014, and that’s obviously a personal choice,” moderator Jorge Ramos said to Sen. Cory Booker during the Democratic debate. “Should people follow your diet?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"BC0w0U\"\u003eIt was a question that seemed to come out of nowhere. Booker looked surprised by it, which makes sense — when’s the last time you remember veganism getting airtime in a presidential debate? But he quickly recovered and gave his answer: No.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"OSjSGa\"\u003eThen, very briefly, he talked about the factory farming system that supplies most of the meat we eat, a system that subjects animals to such cruel conditions that there are \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/1/11/18176551/ag-gag-laws-factory-farms-explained\"\u003elaws to keep the mistreatment hidden from public view\u003c/a\u003e. In the US, a small number of corporations controls most of our meat production and \u003ca href=\"https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/fact-sheets/2012/07/18/how-corporate-control-squeezes-out-small-farms\"\u003esqueezes out small farms\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"rhILXh\"\u003e“One of the reasons that I have a bill to put a moratorium on this kind of corporate consolidation is because this factory farming is destroying and hurting our environment, and you see independent family farmers being pushed out of business because of the kind of incentives we are giving that don’t line up with our values,” Booker said. “That’s what I’m calling for.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"dKdPJG\"\u003eAnd that was it. “But I want to switch,” he continued, and turned the discussion to US war veterans, making the inarguable point that they deserve better care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"gtobHA\"\u003eIt’s understandable that Booker didn’t dwell too long on the veganism question; perhaps he didn’t want to risk alienating voters by coming off as preachy. Telling everyone that they should give up all animal products would probably not have played well, especially since the debate took place in Texas, which raises \u003ca href=\"https://www.beef2live.com/story-top-10-states-cattle-0-110713\"\u003emore cattle than any other state\u003c/a\u003e in the country.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"rPK3Nz\"\u003eBut Booker missed a golden opportunity to talk about his \u003ca href=\"https://corybooker.com/issues/animal-welfare/\"\u003eanimal welfare plan\u003c/a\u003e. If you haven’t heard about it, you’re not alone — the plan appears on Booker’s website, but he hasn’t really been hyping it. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"uZW8MS\"\u003eBy contrast, last month \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/8/21/20826598/julian-castro-animal-welfare-plan-trump-endangered-species\"\u003eJulián Castro rolled out his own plan for animal welfare\u003c/a\u003e — which is much more comprehensive than Booker’s — and he savvily framed it as\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003ea way of sticking it to President Trump. “This groundbreaking plan will undo Donald Trump’s damage,” Castro said. His \u003ca href=\"https://issues.juliancastro.com/paw-plan/\"\u003eProtecting Animals and Wildlife\u003c/a\u003e plan would strengthen the \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2019/8/12/20802132/endangered-species-act-trump-weakening\"\u003eEndangered Species Act\u003c/a\u003e, which Trump has weakened. And it would stop Americans from importing animal trophies that result from big-game hunting — something \u003ca href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/juli-n-castro-s-new-animal-rights-plan-takes-favorite-n1044106\"\u003eDonald Trump Jr.\u003c/a\u003e is known to love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"GFeCKD\"\u003eIt’s good policy as well as smart politics. Americans are increasingly concerned with animal welfare. The incredibly rapid \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/5/28/18626859/meatless-meat-explained-vegan-impossible-burger\"\u003eembrace of plant-based meat products\u003c/a\u003e like \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/4/29/18522640/burger-king-impossible-whopper-vegan-meat\"\u003eImpossible Burgers\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/5/2/18525601/beyond-meat-ipo-vegan-burger\"\u003eBeyond Meat\u003c/a\u003e is, in part, attributable to a growing sense that we can and should be inflicting far less suffering on animals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"SvIU6D\"\u003eA 2015 \u003ca href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/183275/say-animals-rights-people.aspx\"\u003eGallup poll\u003c/a\u003e found that 62 percent of Americans said animals deserve some legal protections. Another 32 percent — nearly one-third — expressed an even stronger pro-animal stance, saying they believe animals should get the same rights as people. In 2008, only 25 percent voiced that view.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"MtgVbo\"\u003eIt seems more and more Americans are coming to see animals as part of our \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/4/4/18285986/robot-animal-nature-expanding-moral-circle-peter-singer\"\u003emoral circle\u003c/a\u003e, the boundary we draw around those we consider worthy of ethical consideration.

After all, he has a strong record on animal welfare issues. As his own website says:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"pTgors\"\u003eCory has led his colleagues in the Senate in blocking appropriations riders that sought to undermine the Endangered Species Act and delist vulnerable species such as Grey Wolves and Grizzly Bears, and he has introduced legislation that would require federal facilities to comply with the minimum standards of care in the Animal Welfare Act. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"gAFitm\"\u003eWhen Cory helped write a major update to our federal chemical safety law, Cory worked for over a year to include new limits on animal testing in the bill — and it is estimated that these protections will save hundreds of thousands of animals from needless suffering. Cory has also introduced a bill to extend federal prohibitions on animal fighting to the U.S. territories and got it passed into law in the final 2018 farm bill, saving thousands of animals every year from suffering and dying. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"PIcwiM\"\u003ePlus, Booker’s animal welfare plan contains some worthy ideas, any one of which it would have been great to mention.

Had he leaned into the moderator’s question, he also could’ve presented himself as a leader on an issue that’s increasingly attracting American voters’ concern.

Warren’s presence onstage also spoke to the momentum she’s picked up in recent polls and the leadership she’s established across a number of policy areas ranging from her detailed plans on universal pre-k to housing. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"HKOPBU\"\u003eBooker and Harris haven’t been polling quite as high, but both also sought to capitalize on the event to further establish themselves. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"HV1cGa\"\u003eBooker’s speaking time was perhaps the most noteworthy given his ranking in the polls — and captured some of the more extensive responses he gave on questions related to criminal justice reform and charter schools. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"GgPpUd\"\u003eAcross gender lines, women candidates spoke more than men on average — a sign of how dominant both Warren and Harris’s candidacies continue to be.

And after watching Thursday night’s Democratic primary debate, it seems to me that the same thing would be true if the primary was held the next day. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"6gw8o6\"\u003eThrough hours of sometimes exciting and sometimes tedious arguing, no candidate laid a real hand on the frontrunner. And what’s particularly striking is that barely anybody tried. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"RL4E6X\"\u003eThe dynamic is an eerie echo of the scenario that played out in the 2016 Republican primary. It seems absurd to compare a loudmouth reality television host to the former vice president. But in both cases a candidate with a base of older working class voters leapt out to an early lead. And now Biden’s main Democratic rivals — just like Trump’s four years ago — are acting like his campaign will collapse on its own and they do not need to take him on. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"bF1gpG\"\u003eBut while Biden does not look to me like any kind of unstoppable political juggernaut — he misspeaks constantly, rambles oddly at times, and does not have a particularly impressive record across his several decades in the Senate — he’s a popular former VP to a popular former president. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"fY4MLD\"\u003eAnd, crucially, the Democratic Party primary electorate as a whole is more moderate than Biden’s two main rivals, Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. Warren and Biden used their stage time Thursday to remind voters of this, flanking Biden to his left — and left of the typical primary voter. The rest of the field by and large didn’t even bother to attack him. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"GWltnm\"\u003eIf these dynamics hold, Biden could easily cruise to victory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"NDcw00\"\u003eCriticism from the left isn’t taking Biden down\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"itrYCF\"\u003eWarren and Sanders are neck-and-neck for second place and both tangled with Biden a little bit on the issue of health care. They’re proponents of a Medicare-for-all system, and they both make a good case for it. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"QtThe9\"\u003eOther candidates chimed in with Biden contrasts from other directions. Some Democrats favor a mandatory buy-back for assault weapons. Beto O’Rourke wants a reparations program for African Americans. Cory Booker favors more aggressive steps toward reducing incarceration. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"nbGET5\"\u003eThis is not an effective strategy for taking Biden down a peg. We’ve seen for months now that simply staking out policy positions to Biden’s left doesn’t take him out of first place. That’s not because voters haven’t heard the message, but because most Democrats say they consider themselves more moderate than Sanders or Warren and as of the beginning of 2019 most Democrats said they want the party to go in a more moderate direction. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"vPkZP7\"\u003eWhat’s even more striking, neither Sanders nor Warren really tried to make an argument about why it would matter to put one of them in the White House rather than Biden. A Medicare-for-all bill is obviously not going to pass Congress in 2021 — Amy Klobuchar and Kamala Harris were right there on stage explaining they don’t support it and lots of Democrats are more conservative than those too — and a mandatory gun buyback certainly isn’t. There almost certainly are real differences in how the different candidates would approach governance, differences that would manifest themselves in executive branch appointments and regulatory policy. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"HP4D3b\"\u003eBut nobody talked about that. Instead, several of Biden’s rivals staked out policy positions they can’t deliver on and that it’s not clear Democratic primary voters even want. Other more moderate candidates, meanwhile, just got lost in the shuffle.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"W7viuD\"\u003eNon-Biden candidates aren’t criticizing Biden\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Qx3h7w\"\u003ePolitical stats geeks generally think, based on her past electoral track record in Minnesota, that Amy Klobuchar has a very strong electability argument to be made on her behalf. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ddmaSJ\"\u003eAnd throughout the campaign she’s stuck to an electability-focused formula, advancing popular progressive positions — a higher minimum wage, an assault weapons ban, a public option, an antitrust crackdown — while avoiding politically risky ones. When talking about criminal justice, she was the only candidate to strongly emphasize that communities of color’s need for fairness extends to a need for law enforcement to arrest the criminals who prey on them. If you listen closely to her answers it’s easy to see why she runs ahead of other Democrats statewide in Minnesota — she’s a very smart, nuanced politician. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"VnEIao\"\u003eBut she was nowhere in the polls six months ago and she’s nowhere in the polls today. To the extent she gets into the mix, it’s to argue with the leftist candidates in making the case for moderation. But the people backing Warren and Sanders aren’t persuaded by the case for moderation. And the people persuaded by the case for moderation are currently voting for Joe Biden — the well-liked Vice President from the Obama administration. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"0EeGuo\"\u003eIt’s certainly possible in theory that electability-minded moderate Democrats could be convinced to go for Klobuchar. Her election results are better and more recent than Biden’s. She’s younger, she’s a woman, and she doesn’t need to defend things like a 2002 vote to authorize the war in Iraq or issue a complicated semi-defense, semi-apology for the 1994 crime bill. But she would have to actually go make that case instead of drifting off to irrelevance and occasionally sparring with Bernie Sanders. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Q7KqUy\"\u003ePete Buttigieg and Beto O’Rourke, similarly, look like people whose campaigns have totally lost relevance. Both men have at times become darlings of Democratic Party professionals who want a youthful energetic alternative to the rising forces of the left inside the party. But the whole premise there is that Joe Biden is not youthful enough or energetic enough — something neither of them want to actually say, which leaves them flailing. Of the entire field, only Julián Castro seems to want to address the elephant in the room but he’s poorly situated to do the job. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"z0LTR9\"\u003eJulián Castro, the exception that proves the rule\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"4fuTo5\"\u003eIn contrast to the other eight people on the stage, Castro twice took shots at Biden’s age. Once he accused him of having “forgotten already what you said two minutes ago” and quipping “that was a lot” after Biden delivered a rambling answer that somehow started on education and ended on Venezuela. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"1Zvo4Z\"\u003eFramed as under the table jabs rather than an above board argument that 76 is too old, Castro came off as mean-spirited even though polls do show that concern about a septuagenarian president are widespread. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"lm5eUp\"\u003eBut worse for Castro, he even more than Sanders and Warren is specifically associated with ideas that terrify electability-minded Democrats. He’s the one who initially injected the idea of \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/6/26/18760665/1325-immigration-castro-democratic-debate\"\u003edecriminalizing illegal immigration into the primary\u003c/a\u003e and she’s the one whose done things like \u003ca href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/03/10/julian-castro-bernie-sanders-slavery-reparations-1214836\"\u003ehit Sanders from the left on reparations\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"rvpOde\"\u003eAs a housing policy junkie myself, I have a soft spot for Castro who build on his experience as a big city mayor and former HUD Secretary to deliver what’s \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/7/30/20681101/housing-crisis-democrats-2020-warren-harris-booker-castro\"\u003eprobably the best housing program in the race\u003c/a\u003e. But nobody currently backing Biden over Sanders and Warren is going to suddenly flip to Castro over age concerns. If you think of him as auditioning for a job as Warren’s vice president, it was arguably an impressive performance, but that’s all worth nothing if Biden becomes the nominee and right now it looks like Biden’s going to be the nominee. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"02k9w7\"\u003eThere’s a lot of time left, etc. \u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"d4QjaI\"\u003eBiden’s lead in the polls is not exactly unassailable. There will be more debates and more moments and there’s plenty of time left for him to lose this thing. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"uKm4Et\"\u003eBut most of the candidates in the field seem to be acting as if there’s some law of nature that will magically cause him to lose even without anyone really going after him in a persuasive way. The voters’ current views, however, seem very clear. A large minority of them want a left-winger like Sanders or Warren but the majority do not, and that more moderate majority sees Biden as their champion. Sanders or Warren could change that dynamic by trying to assuage Democrats worries that they are too far left, but currently they are too locked in a Cold War with each other to do that. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"bwFnPo\"\u003eAnd any of a wide range of non-leftist Democrats could try to offer a fundamentally non-ideological critique of Biden focused on his age, his speaking fees, \u003ca href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/08/02/joe-biden-investigation-hunter-brother-hedge-fund-money-2020-campaign-227407\"\u003ehis son’s weird shenanigans\u003c/a\u003e, and other weaknesses. But so far all they seem to want to do is spar with Warren and Sanders and warn about the dangers of going too far left. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"PEbKpI\"\u003eAs the author of takes about how \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/7/23/17575768/swing-voters-exist\"\u003eswing voters are real\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/9/11/20856802/swing-voters-base-democrats-trump-2020-election\"\u003epersuasion is important\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/7/2/20677656/donald-trump-moderate-extremism-penalty\"\u003emoderates do better at winning elections\u003c/a\u003e, I certainly agree with those warnings.

It is also a pioneer of FOMO-inducing marketing. Target touts its “Design for All” credentials, but really, as the collections have become larger and more hyped, it’s more like “design for whoever can get in line the earliest.” Still, fans plot, get in line, and fire up multiple laptops in anticipation. The added nostalgia embedded in this anniversary collection guarantees people will shop it. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"aeSd8e\"\u003eTarget knows it has a winner here. “We are prepared.

British stylist and designer Bartley trafficked heavily in cherry print and colorful plaid while fashion designer Mizrahi, who had been designing expensive custom clothes for New York City society doyennes and fashion people, had been designing regularly for Target since 2003.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ydkjeA\"\u003eKatz was working at a job with a financial services company at the time and she was miserable. She skipped out of an anti-money-laundering conference and went shopping at Target instead, where she discovered the collection. “I bought a blouse and all of these Isaac Mizrahi shoes. I still have an Isaac Mizrahi suede skirt. Isaac and Luella were my gateway drug to Target fashion,” she says.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"nH8UaQ\"\u003e“You would have no masstige if it wasn’t for me,” the characteristically effusive and unfiltered \u003ca href=\"https://www.racked.com/2016/3/10/11183334/isaac-mizrahi-target-qvc\"\u003eMizrahi\u003c/a\u003e tells me on a call, using a marketing portmanteau for affordable goods that seem like they should be more expensive. I can’t totally confirm his assertion, but he certainly helped cement Target as the faux-fancy “Tar-jay.” He stayed for seven years, producing cute and affordable clothes every season. This was different from Target’s collaboration model now, in which a small limited-edition collection drops and is gone. You could go in at any season and find something. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"pcGRux\"\u003eAt the time, it was risky for his career. “I remember sitting with one of my clients and her going, ‘Oh, I can’t ever buy your clothes again because you make clothes for Target,’ and I was like ‘What!’ It really scared the shit out of me,” he says. Several of Mizrahi’s \u003ca href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1516588\u0026amp;xs=1\u0026amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fc%2Fisaac-mizrahi-for-target%2F-%2FN-x32ui\u0026amp;referrer=vox.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003edesigns\u003c/a\u003e appear in the anniversary collection.

Her collection of sweet babydoll dresses was her response to the cultural moment in which US Weekly and Perez Hilton set the tone for the public discourse around celebrity. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ylh3iT\"\u003e“The girls in the spotlight in my age group are flashing the paparazzi out of cars not wearing underwear and releasing sex tapes. There was a vulgarity around femininity, so putting something out that was so saccharine and girly was actually very rebellious in a way,” Fetherston says. Zooey Deschanel and Kirsten Dunst were drawn to her designs. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"QMjOuf\"\u003eNostalgia is going to get people back into the store, as is the promise of a second chance.

I do that a lot,” says Katz, whose mom lives in Pennsylvania, where the hype is slightly less than in the New York City metro areas. She got the zigzag luggage, towels, clothes, and dishes. She also got a rug, but had to resort to the secondary market for that, paying about $500 on eBay for a rug that was originally $250 at Target. She has no regrets.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"EgPW8q\"\u003eThis is where Target’s “for all” proposition starts to break down a little bit. The manufactured scarcity and hype ensure that these collections will sell out, and it’s led to a lot of irritation from shoppers. A commenter on a post on the \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/today/posts/10157513341271350?__tn__=-R\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eToday\u003c/em\u003e show’s\u003c/a\u003e Facebook page announcing the 20th anniversary collection is just one of many examples. She wrote: “No thank you, Target. The Lily [sic] sale last time was a madhouse! We were 80something in line, people were grabbing entire racks of clothes that were up for resale an hour later. It was insane. Everything was gone in 15 minutes.” On top of that, it took almost 15 years for Target to produce its collaborations in extended sizes, after years of criticism from plus-size activists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"fiWwBC\"\u003eMany customers love these collaborations, and they can be good for the designers. But above all else, they are good for Target. “Lilly Pulitzer was the biggest one we’d done from a sales perspective. Then we did Hunter and it was bigger than that. Then Vineyard Vines was bigger by sales than Hunter,” says Gomez. Partially it’s because the collections are getting bigger, as Target adds home, mens, and kids’ clothes to the mix, when it used to be primarily womenswear. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"hivnrX\"\u003eStill, he acknowledges, “part of it is also the power of social media, frankly.\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eNow there’s so much hype and buzz leading up to these and pent-up demand.

Back in the ’60s or ’70s, living in big cities and metro areas, it worked out better for everybody, because yes, things were getting more expensive, but salaries were growing back then, too. But starting in the ’70s, salaries start to stagnate. From an economic standpoint, cities are a much better bargain for companies than they are for the workers who have to work there, who bear the brunt of all the commuting and the high cost of living.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"mmeDiS\"\u003eI wish that as a society we were more open and ambitious about telework. There are so many jobs, especially white collar office stuff, where you don’t need to be there. A lot of employees are completely on board with this. They’re like, “Yeah, if my boss would let me telework, I would absolutely do it.” [But] employers are really timid about it. Workers will have to push for that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"suILcu\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo you make the move to Minnesota, and you find that a lot of the stereotypes are true: people were way more welcoming and neighborly in your small town than they ever were in Baltimore. Why was that?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"IHAc9A\"\u003eIn a small town, and especially the place up here where the winters are really brutal and there’s a real survival aspect to making it through, you have to have that social cohesion. There isn’t that political or economic infrastructure that might otherwise handle it. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"DcOKhb\"\u003eAnd when you only walk by two people in a given day, you’re going to notice those people, and you may stop and chat.

Race is lurking behind every social story, and I honestly don’t know how it would’ve been if I were a black reporter. Or if, conversely, the place I ended up visiting ended up being someplace in Alabama with a very high African American population. It’s hard to do a counterfactual on that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ryAG4T\"\u003eI mention in the book that I see a lot less overt racism here the way that I did in upstate New York. You don’t see a lot of Confederate flags or symbols that have white pride connotations. The Trump thing is very complicated, though. I do believe that not all Trump voters are racist, but that in order to vote for Trump, you have to be okay with his racism on some level or another. You have to be able to rationalize it away. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"SPwPVv\"\u003eBecause we are fairly privileged — we are white and middle class — a lot of his policy decisions don’t affect us. It’s not a life or death thing the way it is for many non-white people. I don’t have to confront my neighbor about his voting record if I don’t want to. And so I try to be empathetic about that, both in regards to my neighbors here and in regards to people elsewhere who are like, “I can’t imagine living someplace where most people would vote for a guy who’s locking up kids on the Southern border.

God.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"bLeq5Q\"\u003eThose essential services — water, sewer, garbage pickup, and local taxes — those are all surprisingly higher than there were in Baltimore.

There’s the cost of living, obviously, which is the big thing. But the social support these kids have here — the older kids watch out for the little kids, and the community is heavily invested in its school, and it’s a small enough school where everyone knows each other. We found out after we moved here that my son Charles has autism, and everyone at the schools dropped everything and sat down with us to work through a plan. If we were in a bigger area with a bigger school, I would worry about him getting lost in the crowd or being branded as a bad kid and shunned to the side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"BkciuO\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eObviously not everybody can just pack up and move to a rural Minnesota town, and more people are moving to and living in cities than ever have before.

That way I’d have a long commute on a couple of days, but then I’d get the respite from it and that. In areas where there are those big rail networks, that might be something people can do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"gK4Al2\"\u003eBeyond that, there has to be more housing and there has to be better wages. And those are two huge problems. You compare so many of the problems that cities have — the crowding, the high cost of living — to the problems that the small towns have — not enough people, businesses are closing, tax base is shrinking — there’s a real need. You could solve a lot of this stuff by moving people from the cities and into these small towns.

None of them brought up one of America’s biggest public health crises: the \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/8/3/16079772/opioid-epidemic-drug-overdoses\"\u003eopioid epidemic\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"OxeEXC\"\u003eThis was a continuation of \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/8/1/20750007/democratic-debates-opioid-epidemic-drug-overdoses\"\u003ewhat happened in the previous debates\u003c/a\u003e, where the candidates and moderators also neglected the opioid crisis — only mentioning it in asides, as a vehicle to make a broader point rather than an issue in its own right. In those past debates, Joe Biden and Beto O’Rourke brought up opioids to criticize the health care industry. Cory Booker brought them up to blast incarcerating people who use drugs. Andrew Yang did so to vaguely talk about how the economy is sending people into despair. No one explained how they plan to fight the crisis head on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"5bcBH3\"\u003eThat didn’t change on Thursday, with no mention of the opioid crisis or drug overdoses throughout the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"NP2Ya4\"\u003eThat’s not because the crisis is over. In 2017, America hit a new record for annual drug overdose deaths at 70,000 — a figure so high it \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/11/29/18117906/opioid-epidemic-drug-overdose-deaths-2017-life-expectancy\"\u003econtributed to the third year in a row in declining or stagnating life expectancy\u003c/a\u003e.

But that would still make 2018 the second-worst year of all time for drug overdose deaths. And even in 2018, deaths linked to \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/5/8/15454832/fentanyl-carfentanil-opioid-epidemic-overdose\"\u003esynthetic opioids like fentanyl\u003c/a\u003e were still on their way up (while prescription opioid deaths declined just enough to make up for it); if that trend holds, 2019 could very well be worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"CiB9KO\"\u003eIt’s also not because the crisis is politically irrelevant. New Hampshire will be one of the first states to pick a candidate in the Democratic primary — and it’s also been one of the hardest hit by the crisis. Ohio and Pennsylvania, two swing states in the general election, are also among the hardest hit. An \u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@kfrydl/the-oxy-electorate-3fa62765f837#.w5hoj7chi\"\u003eanalysis by historian Kathleen Frydl\u003c/a\u003e even \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/11/22/13698476/trump-opioid-heroin-epidemic\"\u003efound\u003c/a\u003e that the Ohio and Pennsylvania counties that flipped from Barack Obama to Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election were hit particularly hard by opioid overdose deaths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"gA7GjV\"\u003eAnd it’s not because President Donald Trump has owned the issue. Although Trump gave some lip service to the crisis on the 2016 campaign trail, his administration’s response \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/2/5/18207386/trump-opioid-epidemic-state-of-the-union-2019\"\u003ehas been generally weak\u003c/a\u003e.

Pete Buttigieg put out \u003ca href=\"https://peteforamerica.com/mental-health/#\"\u003ehis own in-depth plan\u003c/a\u003e for addressing mental health and addiction, which includes a $100 billion investment in both over 10 years.

Michael Bennet’s answer to be when I asked him why he was running for president,” says Ezra Klein. “I didn’t expect it to be ‘Mitch McConnell.’” Since arriving in the Senate in 2009, Bennet has built a reputation as a senator’s senator. He’s smart and measured, thoughtful on policy, and good at working across the aisle. Klein mentions that he’s had colleagues say they wish Bennet would run for president, that he’s the kind of guy the country needs. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"DtQbAe\"\u003eBut Bennet has been radicalized. He believes America’s government is broken. So what happens when you radicalize a moderate? How far will an institutionalist go to save the institutions he loves? And at what point do you decide the problem is inside the institutions themselves? \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"VGmgi7\"\u003eThat’s the conversation, and at times argument, Bennet and Klein have in this podcast, and it’s an important one. Bennet’s critique is angry and sweeping. But are his solutions as big as the problem he identifies? They also talk about his plan to end extreme childhood poverty, which Klein thinks is one of the most important proposals in the race, his view that rural America is the key to passing climate legislation, why he opposes Medicare-for-all, what to do about the filibuster, and much more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"UcjBat\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSubscribe: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1516588\u0026amp;xs=1\u0026amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fus%2Fpodcast%2Fthe-ezra-klein-show%2Fid1081584611\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eApple Podcasts\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e | \u003ca href=\"https://www.google.com/podcasts?feed=aHR0cDovL2ZlZWRzLmZlZWRidXJuZXIuY29tL1RoZUV6cmFLbGVpblNob3c%3D\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGoogle Podcasts\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e | \u003ca href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/6NOJ6IkTb2GWMj1RpmtnxP\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSpotify\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e | \u003ca href=\"https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/vox/the-ezra-klein-show\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStitcher\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e | \u003ca href=\"http://tun.in/phNAN\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTuneIn\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"cdDMyi\"\u003e\n\u003ciframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"200\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP7197888378\" width=\"100%\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003chr class=\"p-entry-hr\" id=\"CkUQlB\"\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"X5M2DY\"\u003eSouth Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg \u003c/h3\u003e\n  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\"Buttigieg Attends a Community Peace Event as Funeral for Eric Logan is Being Held\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I4vIE1yeYZj1iWFNr3e-TLEKYhs=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18333237/1159077396.jpg.jpg\"\u003e\n      \u003ccite\u003eScott Olson/Getty Images\u003c/cite\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003eDemocratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg greets residents before the start of a Peace Walk hosted by Christ Temple Apostolic Church on June 29, 2019, in South Bend, Indiana. \u003c/figcaption\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"50CDSJ\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRecode Decode\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/4/3/18282638/pete-buttigieg-2020-presidential-campaign-policies\"\u003ePete Buttigieg\u003c/a\u003e talks with Recode’s Kara Swisher about his campaign for president of the United States.

Ezra Klein caught her on a campaign swing through California to ask her about that meta-plan. The plan behind her plans. Warren’s easy fluency with policy is on full display here, but it’s her systematic thinking about the nature of power, and what it takes to redistribute it, that really sets her apart from the field.

The reason for this plan: Tampa Bay is one of the areas in the US most at risk when hurricanes arrive because of its location, growing population, and the geography of the bay. If a Category 5 hurricane makes a direct hit on the bay, parts of Pinellas County — which is home to St. Petersburg — will temporarily become an island. People who choose to remain — or can’t evacuate — might be trapped. And the potential impact will only grow larger because we keep building and adding more people to hurricane-prone areas like Tampa Bay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"RWCOqO\"\u003eNone of these disasters are likely to occur this year or next year, given current models. Each one is an outlier, a rare, extreme event, the far end of bad.

They’re still building in the path of tempests, still replacing heat-mitigating trees and soil with concrete. Government agencies are leaving millions of dead trees in the forest, ready to burn at the first spark. \u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\"A woman holding a baby girl walks off a ferry with a crowd of other people carrying suitcases.\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jbOXjDIaQJcEY04Jf_hnB_Ibbhg=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19189805/GettyImages_1167107732.jpg\"\u003e\n      \u003ccite\u003eAndrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images\u003c/cite\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003eEvacuees get off a ferry in Nassau, Bahamas after leaving Abaco island in the aftermath of Hurricane Dorian on September 9, 2019\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"V7cmj8\"\u003eWith \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/9/11/20858981/hurricane-dorian-bahamas-death-toll-missing-grand-bahama-abaco-islands-marsh-harbour\"\u003eHurricane Dorian\u003c/a\u003e, which recently slammed into the Bahamas as a Category 5 storm, \u003ca href=\"https://beta.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/when-hurricane-dorian-blew-through-the-bahamas-it-exposed-one-of-the-worlds-great-faultlines-of-inequality/2019/09/12/9485f8ae-d415-11e9-8924-1db7dac797fb_story.html\"\u003emost of the deaths have been recorded\u003c/a\u003e in the community of undocumented Haitians who work on golf courses but live in shanty towns.

In the book, Appelbaum critically examines economists’ contributions to public policy in the last few decades.

Once markets were set up and individual ownership was protected by the rule of law, individuals were assumed to interact in ways that would produce the optimal amount of goods and services that people needed and desired to consume and invest.

The good news is that there’s a new economics that’s increasingly ascendant, one that rejects the market-centric framework and its conservative policy tools on behalf of Appelbaum’s simple but profound conclusion: “Communities can decide what they want from markets.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Teyldr\"\u003eThat probably sounds obvious. In democracies, why shouldn’t majorities decide what sorts of economic outcomes they desire and, conversely, those they’d like to avoid? If we want less child poverty, less environmental degradation, less financial risk, less concentrated wealth, and so on, surely we could distribute, tax, and regulate in the interest of achieving those goals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"pWc0mT\"\u003eNot according to the old economics, at least not unless we’re willing to unleash inefficiencies that will unravel the benefits of the “optimal” system, distort price signals, and give rise to incentives that will steer people and capital away from their most productive uses. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"cG7SH7\"\u003eTo which the new economics basically says … meh. The new economics doesn’t reject efficiency, but neither does it fetishize it. It is one laudable goal among many. It is guided by Appelbaum’s recognition that “efficiency has no special claims as the primary purpose of a marketplace.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"TXCw6H\"\u003eA higher tax rate, minimum wage, or regulation might or might not ding growth — there’s evidence on both sides. But we as a community or a society might decide that because we want workers to earn living wages, the wealthy to pay a fairer share, and businesses not to degrade the environment and regularly blow up financial markets, the benefits of these policies outweigh their costs. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"IqTcav\"\u003eIf that strikes you as obvious, all I can tell you is that a lot of at least marginally cool economists are finally catching up with you. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"IWcosb\"\u003eThe new economics, explained \u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"o0b1pc\"\u003eIt is not a coincidence that the new economics is in ascendency at this moment. Though by some measures, inequality has not grown much in recent years, it remains at levels as high as the late 1920s, which, for the record, didn’t end well. In one of the most disturbing developments emerging from recent \u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/09/09/poor-middle-class-americans-are-much-less-likely-survive-into-their-seventies-than-wealthy-federal-report-says/\"\u003eresearch\u003c/a\u003e, the inequality of income and wealth is increasingly associated with the inequality of life expectancy. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"sPip1t\"\u003eThe assumption that self-interested firms would self-regulate gave rise to repeated rounds of deregulation that gave us what I call the “shampoo economy”: bubble, bust, repeat. The old economics wrongly claimed we couldn’t have persistently low unemployment without spiraling inflation, yet that’s precisely what we’ve enjoyed in recent years. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"fkl85y\"\u003eIn other words, the new economics isn’t arising just because we want “better” outcomes from our markets. It’s also arising because a lot of the old stuff has turned out to be just plain \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/7/19/20699366/interest-rates-unemployment-globalization-minimum-wage-deficit\"\u003ewrong\u003c/a\u003e. The best way to learn more about this new strain of work is to briefly highlight some examples. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"k7COjU\"\u003eTo start with the most obvious, in recent years, inequality has become a subject of legitimate study and attention in the profession. Spearheading this shift have been Thomas \u003ca href=\"http://piketty.pse.ens.fr/en/\"\u003ePiketty\u003c/a\u003e, Emmanuel Saez, and Gabriel \u003ca href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w20625\"\u003eZucman\u003c/a\u003e, who brushed away the dire warning by 2004 Nobel laureate Robert Lucas: “Of the tendencies that are harmful to sound economics, the most seductive, and in my opinion the most poisonous, is to focus on questions of distribution.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"YWbCo6\"\u003eAnd they’re not alone. Raj Chetty and company’s highly influential work on \u003ca href=\"https://opportunityinsights.org/\"\u003emobility\u003c/a\u003e sits firmly in this camp. Think tanks like the Economic Policy Institute (which, for the record, predated the researchers named above), the Roosevelt Institute, the Institute for New Economic Thinking, and especially the Center for Equitable Growth put inequality and broadly shared growth at the core of their work, implicitly rejecting the old-economics’ precept that growth can be either efficient or equitable, but not both. Moreover, these economists’ work is now feeding directly into policy proposals, such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s \u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/01/24/senator-warrens-plan-tax-ultrawealthy-is-smart-idea-whose-time-has-come/\"\u003ewealth tax\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"XZ4EuG\"\u003eMany who elevate and practice new economics are card-carrying members of the profession’s mainstream. The chair of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, may be a lawyer by training, but he’s also the nation’s chief economist. He and the large staff of economists he oversees have taken a data-driven, critical look at the old monetary policy rulebook. For years, those rules militated against letting unemployment fall to levels where working people might gain a bit of the bargaining power they sorely lacked in slack labor markets. But the rulebook said that to allow this to occur would lead to runaway inflation. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"TVi4Y3\"\u003ePerhaps the simplest way to show how Powell and company are practicing a new type of economics is to note that the actual unemployment rate has been below the Fed’s own estimate of the so-called “natural rate” (the lowest rate consistent with stable prices) for over two years, and the central bank has been cutting, not raising, their benchmark interest rate. As they’ve done so, Powell has commented on the benefits of this policy stance in \u003ca href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190823a.htm\"\u003eproviding\u003c/a\u003e “second chances” to those “left behind,” rhetoric that suggests a renewed focus on those further down the economic ladder among our chief economic policymakers (Powell’s predecessor, Janet Yellen, made similar claims). \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"jQ03Au\"\u003eTo be clear, they’re not rejecting the old idea that low unemployment can trigger faster inflation. But they’re both being honest about our ignorance of the precise parameters in play in that relationship, and even should inflation rise some, willing to trade at least some of that off for second chances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"2w9vST\"\u003eAnother casualty of the new economics is austerity. Appelbaum provides painful memories from the very recent past of budget austerity: the far-too-early pivots to deficit reduction in the wake of the Great Recession, both here and especially in Europe. In response to such misguided policy, Stephanie Kelton and others in the Modern Monetary \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/4/16/18251646/modern-monetary-theory-new-moment-explained\"\u003eTheory\u003c/a\u003e (MMT) movement have disseminated a highly influential and far more expansionist way of thinking about fiscal policy and budget constraints. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"hzJI7E\"\u003eMore mainstream economists who have little sympathy for MMT, including Paul Krugman, Olivier \u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/01/10/very-good-economic-idea-may-be-about-replace-very-bad-one/\"\u003eBlanchard\u003c/a\u003e, Larry \u003ca href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/press/2019-01-28/furman-and-summers-argue-policymakers-should-focus-investment-not-debt\"\u003eSummers\u003c/a\u003e, and Jason \u003ca href=\"https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/page/files/20161005_furman_suerf_fiscal_policy_cea.pdf\"\u003eFurman\u003c/a\u003e, have nonetheless sounded similar notes, arguing for rejecting “deficit reduction” as sound fiscal policy in and of itself, especially when its opportunity costs are inadequate stimulus for weak economies or scrimping on investments in productive public goods. (I’ve long made similar \u003ca href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2018/04/11/601629178/deficit-attention-disorder\"\u003earguments\u003c/a\u003e.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"H7pfc4\"\u003eThe new economics has also rejected the old principle that assistance to poor people invokes a tradeoff between efficiency and equity — that anti-poverty programs distort the economic behavior and choices of the poor. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"bs885c\"\u003eThere is now a robust research agenda exploring and identifying long-term gains to society from investing in a variety of supports to the poor (especially children), including nutrition, housing, income and education.

Exciting work in this spirit is well underway on \u003ca href=\"https://openmarketsinstitute.org/\"\u003eantitrust\u003c/a\u003e, patent \u003ca href=\"http://cepr.net/blogs/beat-the-press/why-aren-t-the-democrats-talking-about-ending-patent-financed-drug-research\"\u003erules\u003c/a\u003e, minimum \u003ca href=\"https://arindube.com/minimum-wage-research/\"\u003ewages\u003c/a\u003e, union power, the environment, and even the fundamental measurement of growth \u003ca href=\"https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/new-metrics-of-wellbeing-not-just-gdp-by-joseph-e-stiglitz-2018-12?barrier=accesspaylog\"\u003eitself\u003c/a\u003e. In every case, the research is grounded in Appelbaum’s admonition about communities deciding what they want from markets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Ak5fgW\"\u003eIs this new strain of thinking as ascendant as I claim? Or could it be overwhelmed by the potent and toxic combination of economic orthodoxy and deep-pocketed, anti-government, conservative politics? \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"4hbZ21\"\u003eI’m confident that it will last. First, much of the work and people noted above are firmly ensconced in academia, implying that the profession has become increasingly ideologically diverse. In fact, some of the names cited above are \u003ca href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/about-aea/honors-awards/bates-clark\"\u003eBates\u003c/a\u003e medal winners, awarded to younger economists judged to have made the “most significant contribution to economic thought and knowledge.” In other words, many of these practitioners are embedded in the mainstream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"E6LxBy\"\u003eFar more important, from my perspective, is seeing these ideas show up in the thinking of policy makers, including many of the Democrats running for office (as with Saez and Zucman’s help with Warren’s wealth tax). Many of the people and think tanks named above are offering informal guidance to various campaigns on inequality, labor markets, and trade.  (Disclosure: I was chief economist for Vice President Biden, though I don’t advice his campaign in an official capacity.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"JsjPaP\"\u003eWhile we won’t know it until we see it, there’s a good chance that the next president will staff her economics team with non-usual suspects who are more than willing to shape market outcomes on behalf of the majority on the wrong side of the inequality divide. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"f1gIAB\"\u003eAny form of social analysis that aims to be useful to society must evolve in ways that enhance social welfare, equity, racial and gender justice, and environmental sustainability. For too long, much of economics failed that test — yet its interaction with the ruling class elevated it to a powerful perch. As Appelbaum documents, the pervasive damage of this interaction has cleared a path for a growing number of economists who are busy knocking the old school off its privileged perch. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"cOyWdO\"\u003eTo which I say: It’s about time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ryaUKf\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eJared Bernstein is a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and was the chief economic adviser to Vice President Joe Biden from 2009 to 2011.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","url":"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/9/13/20862607/economics-inequality-deregulation-wealth-taxes-policy","published":"2019-09-13T13:40:00Z","guid":"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/9/13/20862607/economics-inequality-deregulation-wealth-taxes-policy"},{"title":"Racism was discussed  — but it wasn’t debated — on the Democratic 2020 stage","content":"\u003cimg alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6xfPSL5ko_xE5pbbLIQPUUiugVM=/222x0:3774x2664/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/65238829/DemocraticDebatesRace.0.jpg\" /\u003e\n\n  \u003csmall\u003eThe audience watches as the top 2020 candidates debate on the campus of Texas Southern University, a historically black college.  | Win McNamee/Getty Images\u003c/small\u003e\n\n  \u003cp\u003eCandidates are getting better at talking about race and racism, but they’re still struggling to show it at the debates. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp id=\"x7rM6c\"\u003eThursday’s Democratic debate included an early discussion of racism that seemed poised to be substantive but didn’t fully pan out. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"GnyOtb\"\u003eIt began when ABC News correspondent Linsey Davis asked former Texas congressman \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/6/26/18744490/beto-orourke-2020-presidential-campaign-policy-explained\"\u003eBeto O’Rourke\u003c/a\u003e how he would address racism and a racial divide that young black voters have said they are particularly concerned about this year. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"FgWiA3\"\u003e“Racism in America is endemic,” O’Rourke said in his response. “It is foundational.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"8BZ4Op\"\u003eBeing that the September debate marked the first time that all of the leading candidates stood on one stage, the question seemed like the beginning of the most extensive discussion of race seen in a 2020 primary debate yet. After all, the first two debates in June and July were each split into two nights, and they were \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/6/27/18760829/democratic-debate-race-racism-booker-castro-de-blasio\"\u003eboth very\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/7/30/20747889/2020-democratic-debates-presidential-election-winners-losers-night-one\"\u003euneven\u003c/a\u003e in their attention to matters of race, racism, and racial inequality. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"dsbQDb\"\u003eBut the improved debate that was hinted at didn’t completely happen.

And save for a section on immigration and a brief discussion of race and education, the needs of many communities of color weren’t given attention at all. The needs of indigenous people, who have seen \u003ca href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/native-american-voters-2020-democrats-iowa_n_5d586a71e4b0d8840ff41dbb\"\u003eincreased attention in recent months\u003c/a\u003e from several Democrats, weren’t discussed.

Compared to sections on immigration and health care, conversations on race at the 2019 debates have felt less like an opportunity to seriously compare policies and idea\u003cem\u003es \u003c/em\u003ebetween candidates, and more like watching a string of requisite statements denouncing things like white supremacy, police violence, voter suppression, and health inequality. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"23X09N\"\u003eTo be fair to the candidates, some of this is due to how questions get framed, and the fact that these debates move quickly means that a serious discussion of each and every policy isn’t possible. And the issue isn’t that they’re ignoring race and racism on the campaign trail. Many of the candidates are talking about them often, and they’ve presented a number of differing policy plans. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"PNH9UV\"\u003eBut even limited statements on these topics matter: Various \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/5/21/18634407/2020-primary-democrats-black-voters-poll-blackpac\"\u003epolling\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/identities/2019/5/29/18643125/black-voters-election-democrats-black-census-project-survey\"\u003eof black voters\u003c/a\u003e this year have shown that they are concerned about the economy, health care, and racism — and that includes how they intersect and influence disparities in education, quality of life, and other things. As the Trump administration continues to be criticized for emboldening white supremacists and rolling back civil rights efforts, voters of color more broadly say they want candidates to clearly explain how they will make their communities better. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"5dWO30\"\u003eSo far the candidates have shown that, as a whole, they all want to improve race relations and the lives of communities of color from where the Trump administration stands. That certainly matters, and given President Trump’s unpopularity, voters of color likely see any of these candidates as an improvement. But for people who aren’t surrounded by policy discussions on a daily basis, the shallowness of the recent debates makes it harder to truly understand how these candidates differ in the scope of their proposals and how much they plan to use policy to help communities of color, communities that have some shared concerns but also have distinct and specific needs. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"s0awDG\"\u003eThis is a big task. But to reach a large swath of voters of color in the primaries, it is also a necessary one. The debates are how many of these voters will begin to understand these issues and figure out which candidates to look at further. Unfortunately, Thursday night was yet another example of how the debates aren’t giving them enough information. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"55ZLQ4\"\u003eCandidates are talking about racism — but they could go deeper\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"tThTYx\"\u003eThe section of the debate that most clearly focused on race covered a decent amount of ground, but it moved quickly among several candidates, changed focus more than once,  and skipped some people entirely, making it hard to get a clear picture of exactly what plans candidates have and how they differ from one another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"olqEhY\"\u003eSome of this is due to the fact that talking about race means talking about a lot of things: It certainly includes discussing racism and white supremacy, but it also means discussing how race affects one’s experience of the economy, of healthcare, of the justice system, of education, and of democratic process itself. It also means talking about a number of marginalized communities with specific needs. And on Thursday, what could have been a nuanced discussion about race and racism quickly fractured as different candidates were asked to weigh in on different topics in quick succession. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"tHKiZ7\"\u003eFor example, before Davis’s question to O’Rourke fully had time to breathe — and before any candidate besides Castro could respond to O’Rourke’s point about America’s long history of racial injustice — candidates were already being asked about their specific records in the justice system. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"vDEpIk\"\u003eThis kept happening. \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/2/1/18173263/cory-booker-2020-presidential-campaign-policies\"\u003eSen. Cory Booker\u003c/a\u003e, when asked what he would do to fight racism, discussed the justice system but also said that he would “make sure that systemic racism is dealt with in substantive plans from criminal justice reform to the disparities in health care to even one that we don’t talk about enough, which is the racism that we see in environmental injustice in communities of color all around this country.” But even after highlighting a way that the discussion of racism has often fallen short, he didn’t actually get a chance to explain what he would do because he ran out of time. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"bL5PMN\"\u003eIt wasn’t the only instance where this happened. At July’s debates in Detroit, for example, the first night of debates often framed the issues of voters of color against “Midwestern voters,” dismissing the fact that a lot of people of color live in the Midwest. Thursday didn’t do anything as harsh and even improved in some ways, but it still felt undercooked, as if the moderators and some candidates alike are still figuring out the best way to talk about these issues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"DCHVlM\"\u003eCandidates, for example, could have been asked about what exactly they would do on voting rights, or how their health care plans address significant racial disparities in health outcomes and access. They could have, as Booker suggested, started to have a conversation about environmental racism. They could have been asked about jobs and the economy. They could have taken the conversation about policing that was briefly raised and gone even deeper to explain not only why this is an issue, but what makes their specific plan on it the best for voters. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"DwCIY8\"\u003eThere’s been an argument that candidates going too big on matters of race and racism in the primary might frighten some white voters, giving President Trump more ammunition in the general election. But voters of color matter too, and given their power in the Democratic primary, clearly speaking to their concerns and experiences is something that needs to happen. As of now, voters are left with another debate that discussed race and racism but failed to really dig deep. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"GPA5Sd\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp

Climate change is causing stronger and more erratic rainfall with recurrent floods in low-lying areas while population growth is putting more people in risky areas. And another problem comes from deforestation in the mountain range where much of the water first fell: the Western Ghats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Western Ghats run for 1,600km in parallel with India’s west coast, from Gujarat right down to Tamil Nadu at the tip of the subcontinent. It is, or was, a picturesque landscape of serene valleys, steep gorges and virgin forests. Yet, recurring floods and landslides in the mountains, hills and areas downstream (between the Ghats and the sea) show that India must rethink its environmental law to balance the needs of nature and humans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mountains are teeming with life. Though they cover only a small part of India’s total land area, the Ghats are home to \u003ca href=\"https://www.wwf.org.uk/where-we-work/places/western-ghats\"\u003emore than 30% of the country’s species\u003c/a\u003e of plants, fish, reptiles, birds and mammals, including both wild elephants and tigers.

In Kerala, many are located in eco-sensitive parts of the Western Ghats, with some dating back to British rule. As demand for energy increases, India plans to build \u003ca href=\"https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/agri-business/more-and-more-dams-planned-but-where-is-the-water/article26323057.ece\"\u003emore dams\u003c/a\u003e which in turn could lead to massive deforestation and ecosystem destruction. All this makes flooding more severe, as deforestation in the catchment area of a river reduces the land’s ability to retain water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhether triggered by damming, deforestation, or exacerbated by climate change, human-induced natural disasters in the region have pointed to a need for stronger environmental protection laws.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eHow to protect the Western Ghats\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIndia’s 1950 constitution claims that protection of the environment is a \u003ca href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1644544/\"\u003efundamental duty of every citizen\u003c/a\u003e, and though it does not explicitly contain a right to a clean environment, legal authority for environmental lawmaking is derived from the document.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver the years, the country’s central government has enacted various laws that are applicable to the Western Ghats: the Environment Protection Act 1986, the Forest Conservation Act 1980, the Biodiversity Conservation Act 2002 and so on. However, these laws are not implemented efficiently, which makes me wonder if areas like the Himalayas and the Western Ghats⁠⁠—internationally significant ecosystems and biosphere reserves – need their own special laws.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdditionally, India’s water laws are inadequate. Existing legislation primarily focuses on pollution control, meaning the law has little to say about preventing or even managing floods which result from mismanagement of dams or too much riverside development.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe problem is enhanced in the case of rivers that flow across state boundaries. Some of the major floods in the past couple of years happened after dams at or near full capacity in one district or state were opened, letting water flow downstream \u003ca href=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/water/rains-apart-blame-the-dams-for-maharashtra-karnataka-floods-report-66172\"\u003einto another area\u003c/a\u003e.

For most people, poverty and earnings still matter more than climate mitigation or adaptation. Hence people’s perception should be moulded to recognise and realise how deforestation or climate change impacts their daily life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Western Ghats are south India’s lifeline, with millions dependent on the range either directly or indirectly. These mountains need protection. However, while new development in the region continues to be human-centric, the entire concept of nature preservation is relegated. To protect the Western Ghats, what we require is an attitude that recognises the significance of these mountains, and that will involve specific laws.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe piece originally appeared on \u003ca href=\"https://theconversation.com/india-must-stop-deforesting-its-mountains-if-it-wants-to-fight-floods-122669\"\u003eThe Conversation\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/em\u003e \u003cem\u003eWe welcome your comments at \u003ca href=\"mailto:ideas.india@qz.com\"\u003eideas.india@qz.com\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://qz.com/india/1708552/destruction-of-indias-western-ghats-causing-devastating-floods/","published":"2019-09-13T08:23:15Z","guid":"https://qz.com/1708552/auto-draft/"},{"title":"Presentation: How to add purpose to your productivity routine","content":"\u003cimg width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/feature_productivity.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;w=1024\" class=\"attachment-medium_10 size-medium_10 wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/feature_productivity.jpg 3200w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/feature_productivity.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/feature_productivity.jpg?resize=50,28 50w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/feature_productivity.jpg?resize=160,90 160w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/feature_productivity.jpg?resize=320,180 320w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/feature_productivity.jpg?resize=640,360 640w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/feature_productivity.jpg?resize=940,529 940w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/feature_productivity.jpg?resize=1600,900 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /\u003eHow do you organize the short- and long-term tasks you want to complete?

For her, the idea came from a personal experience at the pet store. “It was really by chance. I had just got Sara, my Labrador, and wanted to buy some nice treats for her. Nothing I found at pet stores had the quality I wanted.

She then started participating in pet care exhibitions with four to five niche products. “People seemed excited to see my customisable accessories and I thought I could take it to retail. But at least 200 stores said no to me and it was very discouraging. But it also pushed me to create my own space for these products,” she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNarang wanted to create pet care accessories that she says didn’t look dirty or “disgusting” like the ones she saw in most pet stores. This posed another uphill challenge—finding the right vendors and tailors for her products. “Initially, it was hard to even convince tailors. They would simply tell me, ‘\u003cem\u003eKutton ka samaan nahi banaayenge\u003c/em\u003e (we will not make products for dogs).’ It really was like finding my own path in the jungle,” says Narang, now 34.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"display: inline !important; float: none; background-color: #ffffff; color: #333333; cursor: text; font-family: 'PT Serif',serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;\"\u003eAnd find her path she did.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eChanging needs\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter several iterations, HUFT’s products finally hit the stores in 2008. Narang’s focus was to offer high-quality products that pet parents would love buying for their children.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor instance, when Anurag Arora, pet parent of the five-year-old boxer dog Mocha, wanted to buy winter wear for his son, he stumbled upon HUFT\u0026#8217;s kiosk in New Delhi\u0026#8217;s Select Citywalk mall. \u0026#8220;Winter clothing is a necessity. But you also want your pet to look cool,\u0026#8221; he says. \u0026#8220;They had a really cool bomber jacket last season. I feel their design stands out and made me pick products from HUFT,\u0026#8221; he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver the years, Arora has bought toys and feeding bowls, and is now looking forward to trying some of HUFT\u0026#8217;s personal pet care products. Parents like him spend \u003ca href=\"https://www.businesstoday.in/magazine/the-hub/the-pet-bet/story/376801.html\"\u003ean average of Rs5,000\u003c/a\u003e a month on their pet children.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor non-pet parents, expenses incurred on mental health, orthopaedic wellness, nutrition, and exercise of pets are only concepts.

From organic food, cutesy leashes, collars and tags, to orthopaedic beds and age-specific nutrition, Narang says her brand now offers them products for every aspect of a dog’s life, from puppyhood to senior living.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eGrowing needs\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs HUFT grew and diversified into newer products, Narang found herself looking for investors in her pet project. In 2015, a buzz had already begun around pet care in India, which was slated to be one of the fastest-growing pet industries in the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was also the time Narang would have found ready venture capital (VC) investors. But she chose to go a different way. “When it came to funding, we were picky. We really believed in our brand and did not want to take the VC route, which can often be aggressive and focussed on the short-term,” she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, she and her team handpicked high networth individuals in India who really believed in HUFT. “It was almost like we were interviewing our investors,” she laughs. In 2016, a group of HNI investors—their names undisclosed—offered $1 million in a first tranche, and another $2 million the next year. Yesterday (Sept. 12) HUFT announced it has raised another round of pre-series A \u003ca href=\"https://inc42.com/buzz/pet-care-brand-heads-up-for-tails-raises-10-mn-in-pre-series-a-funding/\"\u003efunding of $10 million\u003c/a\u003e from undisclosed HNI investors and existing promoters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=\"pull-quote\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"quote-line\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOn Sept. 12, HUFT announced it has raised another round of pre-series A funding of $10 million.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"quote-line\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003eThe first two tranches helped HUFT expand its online and offline reach.

The company clocked revenues of Rs12 crore in 2017, Rs20 crore in 2018, and Narang says the estimate for 2019 is upwards of Rs35 crore. That means an 80% year-on-year growth for a brand that is neither mass market nor inexpensive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough Narang says 70% of HUFT’s products are priced below Rs800, unique products like gluten-free biscuits for dogs and organic anti-tick sprays come at a premium. Not that it has stopped Indians from splurging on their beloved critters. \u0026#8220;I would say they\u0026#8217;re definitely more expensive than most brands, but you also don\u0026#8217;t find that kind of quality elsewhere,\u0026#8221; says Arora.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe is not alone. “People often want to mimic and create status symbols, which is now true of the luxury pet care segment, too,” explains Sheetal Jain, CEO and founder of Luxe Analytics, an Indian luxury market intelligence firm. “Indians want pets to reflect their own success and social mobility. So that means going taking holidays together, having matching accessories, etc,” she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe experiences section of HUFT’s business caters to this audience. While accessories can be customised with one’s pet’s name, the Birthday Club enables pet parents to make a day of their pet child’s special occasion.

It was not. Although things got a little testy during a debate over health care proposals, by the end Biden was expressing his admiration for Warren, saying she was correct when it came to articulating changes to trade policy, like giving unions, farmers, human rights activists, and environmentalists a seat at the table in negotiations. The senator from Massachusetts looked surprised by Biden\u0026#8217;s endorsement of her ideas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps Biden learned from their past infamous encounter, way back in 2005.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eBack in the day\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWarren, at the time a law professor and to this day a policy wonk, became interested in politics after researching US bankruptcies in the 1980s. By the late 1990s she was a nationally-recognized expert on bankruptcy and a Democrat who successfully lobbied to block the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention Consumer Protection Act (BAPCPA), which she argued targeted families but should target corporations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBiden, meanwhile, was a senator from Delaware, a state that attracts corporations with its friendly laws, including favorable bankruptcy proceedings. He supported BAPCPA and in a 2005 senate hearing about the legislation Biden got feisty with Warren. She criticized a part of the bill that enabled the energy company Enron to conduct its bankruptcy in Delaware, making it difficult for its employees to challenge decisions that included the future of their pension fund.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe senator grilled the Harvard Law School professor, defending his state\u0026#8217;s legal process and assailing her critique of its bankruptcy laws. He argued that the usurious interest rates charged by credit card companies was the real problem, not the bankruptcy bill that would limit individuals\u0026#8217; ability to seek relief. “But, senator, if you are not going to fix that problem, you can’t take away the last shred of protection from these families,” Warren replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"a1dbe\"\u003eBiden had to concede. “I got it, OK. You are very good, professor,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"a1dbe\"\u003eThe bankruptcy bill eventually passed anyway. And that\u0026#8217;s when Warren got political. She called for the creation of a federal Consumer Financial Protection Agency to shield Americans from unsafe financial products. After the 2008 financial crisis, the need for it was apparent. In 2012, Warren ran for senator in Massachusetts. Now, she and Biden are fighting for the same job.

According to \u003ca href=\"https://www.paultough.com/books/years-that-matter-most/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Years that Matter Most: How College Makes or Breaks Us\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, a new book by veteran journalist \u003ca href=\"https://www.paultough.com/about-paul/bio/\"\u003ePaul Tough\u003c/a\u003e, the effort has been either half-baked or just shockingly unsuccessful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTough spent six years reporting his book, which mixes the stories of students who are trying to get into college and stay there, often against great odds, against the data and economics driving admissions. In \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/college-mobility/\"\u003ean excerpt\u003c/a\u003e recently published in The New York Times, he describes the financial pressures creating a need for schools to accept a lot of rich students, and we learn about the financial-aid optimization experts employed by universities, who create algorithms to tell admission officers how much \u0026#8220;merit aid\u0026#8221; they need to offer those rich kids to get them to say yes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#8217;s a perverse system with perverse incentives, and Tough examines them in detail. The result is a deeply reported and damning portrait of fraying American social mobility, persistent inequality, and a handful of influential institutions playing fast and loose with the facts to pay lip service to the ideals of equality while glossing over the reality of raw economics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe book introduces us to \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/college-mobility/\"\u003ethe research\u003c/a\u003e of Raj Chetty, the \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/9/13/20862607/economics-inequality-deregulation-wealth-taxes-policy\"\u003enow-well-known\u003c/a\u003e Harvard economist who harnessed IRS data to analyze social mobility. As Tough recounts, Chetty\u0026#8217;s data shows that students who attend ultra selective colleges in the US become very rich as adults. Those who graduate from Ivy-plus schools—the \u003ca href=\"https://ivyleague.com/index.aspx\"\u003eIvy League\u003c/a\u003e plus Stanford, MIT, Duke, and the University of Chicago—have a 1-in-5 \u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003echance of making it into the top 1% by their mid-30s, earning more than $630,000; at other elite schools, the odds are 1-in-11; at community colleges it\u0026#8217;s just 1-in-300. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eAttending those institutions also closes real income and opportunity gaps. Poor kids earn $76,000 when they graduate, and rich kids earn $88,000—i.e. more, but not obscenely more. And while attending an elite college (compared to no college) increases the odds of making it into the top income quartile by a factor of four for rich kids, for the poor it increases those odds by factor of 14.  \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that\u0026#8217;s where the happy story seems to end. At Ivy-plus colleges, those elite institutions that propel people to greatness and equalize disparities, more than two-thirds of the students are from rich households and fewer than 4% are from poor households. \u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e“Elite college campuses are almost entirely populated by the students who benefit the least from the education they receive there; the ones who were already wealthy when they arrived on campus,” Tough notes. \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eThe worst offender: Princeton, which according to the 2016 data is 71% rich and only 2.2% poor.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTough said this is where the reporting made him angry. \u0026#8220;Higher education \u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003estill works for individual young people,\u0026#8221; he said. \u0026#8220;But [seeing] that paired with the data for how rare it is, how unusual it is, was what felt really frustrating.\u0026#8221; \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is not news that the campuses of elite universities are filled with the progeny of elite society, or that SAT scores correlate to income and not ability. But Tough\u0026#8217;s reporting also requires readers to meet the students and admissions officers and teachers who live in the grips of what one veteran admissions officer quoted in the book calls \u0026#8220;the admissions-industrial complex.\u0026#8221; The result is a clear-eyed portrait of what a stacked game it really is against smart, poor kids with epic determination but zero social capital, while schools continue to pave the way for kids who get in \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/10/magazine/college-admissions-paul-tough.html\"\u003esimply because they can pay\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eInside the machine\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReaders will meet Ivonne, who makes it to the University of Texas because she is second in her San Antonio class (Texas automatically allows the top 6% of students from Texas schools to pick their choice of school in the UT system) but who then struggles for various reasons, including the fact that the quality of the calculus class she took in high school was nothing like that of the calculus class the rich kids took in theirs. She spends her first semester lost, failing test after test, internalizing the message that she does not belong. Her sister tells her that poor Latina kids like them just don\u0026#8217;t fit in; her mother encourages her to come home so she can cook for her. After spending her high school years thinking she was smart, she suddenly suspects she was wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow consider the backdrop: O\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003enly a quarter of of college students born into the bottom half of the income distribution will get a bachelor\u0026#8217;s degree by age 24; meanwhile, \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e90% of those in the top quartile will get their degree, Tough writes. Is that because poor kids are not as smart? Hardly. According to data from the College Board, in 2018, kids whose parents earned $40,000-$80,000 a year had an average grade point average (GPA) of 3.6; kids whose parents earned more than $200,000 had a GPA of 3.7. But SAT scores show a very different picture: the rich kids on average score 169 points higher. That\u0026#8217;s because rich parents can hire tutors (we meet a particularly endearing one in the book) to make their otherwise middling children look great. K\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eids whose parents earn more than $200,000 have a 1-in-5 chance of scoring above 1400 (out of 1600) on the SAT; those who earn less than $20,000 have a 1-in-50 chance.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut back to calculus, the class with which Ivonne is struggling: It turns out only 48% of US high schools even offer calculus; one in three private schools have it and one in six public schools. Schools with white kids are twice as likely to offer it as schools with lots of black and Latino kids, and kids from families who earn in the top quintile are four times as likely to take it in high school as those from families in the bottom quintile, Tough writes. And yet, in 2017 at Harvard, 93% of the incoming freshman class had taken it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf taking calculus is an indication of student dedication or college readiness, it\u0026#8217;s a lot easier for rich kids than poor ones to come across as dedicated and ready. Meanwhile, when Ivonne sits in class with other bright kids who seem to get the material faster than she does, she feels these differences in every bone in her body. She wonders, constantly, if she should quit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIvonne is at the University of Texas Austin at a moment when the school is trying to help low-income kids succeed, and offering up a template for how to fix the mess that Tough describes. We meet Uri Treisman, a calculus teacher with his own compelling story, who has spent the better part of his career trying to figure out how to get low-income and minority students to succeed at school in part by first succeeding at freshman calculus. He is relentless in his efforts to convince his students they are mathematicians, that they belong; he makes them work and gives them guidance, puts them in small groups, schedules extra sessions. He knows his students intimately; he tracks them, he supports them. He forces them to see their own potential but also catches them when they are about to give up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTreisman\u0026#8217;s efforts are part of a larger initiative at the University of Texas Austin led by David Laude, a former chemistry teacher turned \u0026#8220;graduation rate champion,\u0026#8221; to increase the share of kids graduating in four years from 50% to 70%. The group not graduating in four years, he found, was disproportionately made up of black, Latino, and first-generation college students. The four-year graduation rate for students who were first in their families to go to college was more than 20% below that of kids whose parents had gone to college.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRather than try to get more rich kids graduating sooner—the low-hanging fruit—to hit his target, Laude decides to focus on the bright, low-income kids who drop out at way higher rates. He does this by doing the kinds of things Treisman does, finding ways to give extra support to kids who need it without stigmatizing them for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTough observes one of Treisman\u0026#8217;s teaching assistants coaching Ivonne at a real low point. \u0026#8220;You really are in a different place than these students,\u0026#8221; the TA tells her. \u0026#8220;[I]t is unfair;  you are at disadvantage. But that fact has nothing to do with you: you are a great mathematician, and if you want to claim that destiny, you can, and we will support you.\u0026#8221; Adds Tough: \u0026#8220;That\u0026#8217;s a complicated message, it has a lot of parts to it. But when an institution can get that right, it can be transformative.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaude succeeds in his mission: in 2012, the four-year graduation rate for students eligible for Pell grants (connoting a need for financial assistance) was 40%; by 2018, it was 61%. First-generation college students moved from 41% to 62%; black students from 37% to 58%. That\u0026#8217;s because the reasons poor kids fail have way less to do with ability and way more to do with myriad struggles involving identity, financial pressure from home, jobs, and a profound sense of imposter syndrome. To those who make the argument that elite universities don\u0026#8217;t accept more low-income kids because low-income kids can\u0026#8217;t hack it and drop out more, Tough offers compelling counter-evidence: \u0026#8220;What UT suggests to me is that they absolutely can hack it,\u0026#8221; Tough says. \u0026#8220;They just need a little bit more effort and colleges can, and should, do that.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHigher education in America traditionally operated from a place that it was not the job of colleges and universities to help kids succeed. That was the work of high school teachers; the job at the college level was simply to separate the wheat from the chafe. But that view is changing now. Tough is reassured that at least two of the Democratic presidential candidates are talking up the importance of higher education and how to make it more accessible to more people—particularly kids who don\u0026#8217;t have all the advantages that come with wealth and privilege. Meanwhile, parents of privileged kids should probably worry a little less about how many opportunities their kids have, and stop pretending there are too few. A Harvard-or-bust mentality still leaves plenty of opportunity for rich kids rejected from Harvard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;You don\u0026#8217;t have to freak out about this versus that university,\u0026#8221; Tough says. \u0026#8220;But we as a society need freak out that this very valuable source of social mobility is being so unevenly distributed.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://qz.com/1706334/college-admissions-are-a-game-that-still-favors-rich-over-poor/","published":"2019-09-13T15:25:44Z","guid":"https://qz.com/1706334/auto-draft/"},{"title":"Three in four Africans applying for student visas in Canada this year have been rejected","content":"\u003cimg width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/RTXQXN6-e1568384576761.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;w=1024\" class=\"attachment-medium_10 size-medium_10 wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" /\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat are the chances of getting a study permit approved in Canada?

And when politically incorrect speech is applied to groups with which conservatives sympathize, then liberals tended to like it more and conservatives liked it less.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBerkeley PhD candidate Michael Rosenblum, the paper\u0026#8217;s lead author, was surprised to discover that the group being discussed had such a dramatic impact on listeners. \u0026#8220;While we tend to think about political correctness as a phenomenon of political liberals, it can inspire the same reaction in political conservatives when applied to groups that they sympathize with,\u0026#8221; he told Quartz.\u003cdel\u003e\u003c/del\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat is political correctness?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first step in the study was to define political correctness. This notion, now commonly discussed in American culture, originated almost a century ago in Russia with the term \u003ci\u003epoliticheskaya pravil’nost. \u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday, academics say it has two components. One is \u0026#8220;the use of words, thoughts, or actions that minimize offensiveness or conform to social norms (which is sometimes considered a form of censorship,\u0026#8221; the paper states. The other is \u0026#8220;the use of tactics that are seemingly intended to help the disadvantaged.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe researchers came up with a definition for the study based on data about how contemporary Americans across the political spectrum consider political correctness. They asked about 200 individuals, liberal and conservative, to provide a definition and examples, and then had people unaware of the researchers\u0026#8217; hypotheses categorize the answers. The definition of \u0026#8220;politically correct\u0026#8221; ultimately employed in the study is \u0026#8220;using language (or behavior) to seem sensitive to others’ feelings, especially those others who seem socially disadvantaged.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;Correctness\u0026#8221; doesn\u0026#8217;t refer to truth or falsehood but to what seems morally right during a particular period in certain circles. However, the researchers distinguish between political incorrectness and other types of insensitive communication.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHate speech, for example, is a legally actionable attack on a particular group provoking hatred, and demagoguery is \u0026#8220;an appeal to prejudices in the pursuit of power\u0026#8221; characterized by oversimplification, or fear-mongering, among other things. Politically incorrect language, unlike demagoguery, is used in many contexts, not solely political or by those in pursuit of power. And unlike demagoguery or hate speech, politically incorrect formulations aren\u0026#8217;t necessarily \u003cem\u003eintended\u003c/em\u003e to generate a certain response but can be based on ignorance of \u0026#8220;correct\u0026#8221; labels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIndeed, the researchers note that even a speaker who intends to be sensitive can end up being politically incorrect depending on the context they are operating in because labels change quickly. An example used in the study is \u0026#8220;LGBTQ,\u0026#8221; which might be viewed as politically incorrect in certain circles where \u0026#8220;LGBTQIA\u0026#8221; has since been deemed more inclusive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSchroeder also distinguishes between political correctness and politesse. \u0026#8220;Political correctness, at least in today\u0026#8217;s language, is more about the appearance of seeming sensitive toward certain (usually marginalized) groups. Politeness is a broader category—it can exist in behavior toward anyone and it\u0026#8217;s not so much just appearance-focused.\u0026#8221; But she admits that extreme manners could seem inauthentic, just like political correctness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eScrutinizing language\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter defining political correctness, the researchers went on to conduct nine additional experiments involving nearly 5,000 people that measured the effects of language on listeners. Some tested their perceptions of recordings of politicians, others involved individuals judging written communications, or debating each other. The academics concluded that, overall, using politically incorrect language tends to seem authentic but cold to listeners, though which labels strike someone as offensive or real depends on the hearer\u0026#8217;s ideology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;There\u0026#8217;s a trade-off to being politically incorrect: on the one hand, it makes you seem authentic but on the other hand it makes you seem less warm,\u0026#8221; Schroeder said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso notable, when study subjects debated each other, those who used politically correct language were viewed by their debate partners as more susceptible to persuasion. So, being politically correct in speech gives listeners the impression that you\u0026#8217;re the kind of person who might change your mind. The speakers who used \u0026#8220;correct\u0026#8221; language, however, did not report feeling particularly susceptible to influence, despite listeners\u0026#8217; impressions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"page\" title=\"Page 24\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"section\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"layoutArea\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"column\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe paper concludes that there are at least two potential consequences of the association between authenticity and politically incorrect language. First, politically incorrect speech tends to strike listeners as sincere, indicating that the communicator’s beliefs are truly held. That sense then gives listeners the impression that they can know how the communicator will behave in the future. Second, being politically correct may create an illusion that the communicator is persuadable regardless of actual persuadability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor politicians, there is no right way to be that will work for every voter. Some may prefer to know their representative will not bend on the issues they believe in, while others may see leadership as more akin to diplomacy and hope for a flexible negotiator. Thus, there is no correct combination of words a politician can use to net every voter. But there are certainly consequences to their word choices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eMaking the right linguistic impression\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBased on these findings, it seems that if you want to appear authentic and intractable, being politically incorrect has benefits (but then again, \u003ca href=\"https://qz.com/881289/a-new-study-linking-profanity-to-honesty-shows-people-who-curse-are-more-authentic/\"\u003eswearing can also indicate authenticity\u003c/a\u003e, so if you\u0026#8217;re just looking to keep it real, try spicing up your speech with profanity, like Democratic presidential candidate \u003ca href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/09/06/beto-orourke-f-bomb-228038\"\u003eBeto O\u0026#8217;Rourke\u003c/a\u003e).

In both, the goal is to end the nonviable pregnancy—effectively a termination, though OB/GYNs point out that if a fetus isn't viable it's not considered an abortion—in order to protect the person from potentially facing life-threatening hemorrhaging. As the Mayo Clinic \u003ca href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ectopic-pregnancy/symptoms-causes/syc-20372088\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eexplains\u003c/a\u003e, “An ectopic pregnancy can't proceed normally.

Referencing \u003ca href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3213855/#R24/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ea 2012 paper\u003c/a\u003e published in the \u003ci\u003e Journal of Family Planning and Reproductive Health Care\u003c/i\u003e, she writes that many ectopic deaths in the late 90s and early 2000s in the United Kingdom were ultimately attributed to misdiagnosis. There’s no way, Boorman says, to know if those women would have lost their lives had a doctor correctly diagnosed an EP and chosen to closely monitor the pregnancy until it ended on its own or required intervention. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe article also implies that people diagnosed with EP would be better off rupturing a fallopian tube and experiencing internal bleeding than choosing to terminate the pregnancy. Boorman references a procedure called autotransfusion (where a person receives their own blood for a transfusion) as having “a higher success rate than the most commonly employed abortive method.” Why does she suggest this? Because, she writes, putting one’s life at risk is preferable to “purposely destroying your own child.” Besides, she adds, “If left alone, a small minority of babies will reimplant in a safer location (such as on top of the tube) between weeks 5 and 10 and continue developing.”\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe odds of a successful ectopic pregnancy are actually \u003ca href=\"https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/110015\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eextremely rare\u003c/a\u003e—and cannot happen if the fertilized egg has implanted in the fallopian tube, which happens in more than 90 percent of EP cases.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIt’s not the first time that those opposed to abortion have used inaccurate information regarding EPs as a way to advance their agenda that termination is never medically necessary.

Providers monitor patients' hormone levels and perform ultrasounds anywhere from one to three times a week until intervention is required or the EP shrinks and dissolves on its own.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e“For patients who present with low or declining levels of HCG (Human Chorionic Gonadotropin) and don’t have evidence of internal bleeding, we would recommend expectant management. That’s a very small subset of people,” she said. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBut, Meckstroth cautioned, the risk of rupture in the fallopian tube is high. \u003ca href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=10203662\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eOne population-based study\u003c/a\u003e published in 1999 found that 18 percent of 843 French women with EP experienced tubal rupture. \u003ca href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3329644/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAnother review\u003c/a\u003e found that the rate of rupture for patients who received methotrexate—the medication administered to stop cell growth and dissolve existing cells if an EP is confirmed early, meaning the fallopian tube hasn't ruptured—still ranges from 7 percent to 14 percent.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e“Every OB-GYN has seen at least one patient present with massive internal bleeding that was the result of an ectopic pregnancy,” Meckstroth said. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIndeed, Jen Gunter, an OB-GYN and author of \u003ci\u003e The Vagina Bible\u003c/i\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/DrJenGunter/status/1171167907834806272?s=20\" target=\"_blank\"\u003etweeted\u003c/a\u003e on Monday: “STOP TRYING TO MAKE ‘ECTOPIC PREGNANCIES ARE BABIES TOO’ A THING. If you have never treated a woman with a belly full of blood from an ectopic you should shut the fuck up and sit down and learn before you get someone killed.”\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eUltimately, one of the main points Boorman and other anti-abortion activists and lawmakers are trying to make is that the reason doctors treat EP the way they do is because abortion is legal—not because removing the ectopic tissue is necessary to save lives. She claims that “doctors would be more likely to develop solutions that safeguard the welfare of both patients” if abortion wasn’t an option in any circumstances. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBut, as Meckstroth pointed out, the science just isn’t there yet. Researchers have spent their whole careers trying to understand the complex mechanisms that connect a mother to a fetus, she said, yet no one has figured out how to successfully transplant a pregnancy that started elsewhere to the uterus where it can safely develop.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAs another OB-GYN \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/MWinchesterMD/status/1171190173008154629\" target=\"_blank\"\u003etweeted\u003c/a\u003e on Monday after reading Boorman’s piece: “To any woman reading this - an ectopic pregnancy can KILL you.

And she had yet to take up the mantle of a global feminist leader as straightforwardly as she would do with tracks like \"Run the World (Girls)\" (2011) or \"Flawless\" (2014). With \"Single Ladies,\" she was just beginning to make videos that looked like they were supposed to be timeless, and there was uncertainty about whether institutions like the VMAs, which typically favored white pop stars like Britney Spears or Lady Gaga, would appreciate her bolder material.

Giannascoli has managed to stake out such an unpredictable career—from a self-released Bandcamp bedroom auteur to a Domino-signed artist who's collaborated with Frank Ocean—by imbuing his songs with a heavy dose of heart and beguiling ambiguity. His music can shift from disarmingly childlike to menacing and angry.

Lead single \"Gretel\" kicks off with an eerie wall of feedback and pummeling guitars, but as the song unfolds it grows more delicate and almost sweet. He sings over brightly strummed acoustic guitars, \"I don’t wanna go back / Nobody’s gonna push me off track, uh huh.\" It sounds defiant and even hopeful, but this aural optimism is an illusion. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile the album title is an obvious reference to Hansel and Gretel, the Grimms' fairy tale where two siblings encounter a cottage made of candy (a \u003ci\u003e House of Sugar)\u003c/i\u003e and overcome a witch, Giannascoli's interpretation of the German story is apparently more sinister. According to a \u003ca href=\"https://www.thefader.com/2019/06/05/sandy-alex-gs-haunted-american-dream\" target=\"_blank\"\u003erecent \u003ci\u003e Fader\u003c/i\u003e cover story\u003c/a\u003e, \"on Alex’s re-telling of the classic tale, 'Gretel,' the titular hero lets her brother get eaten by the witch.

He says in the interview, \"Everything that I do, and everything that everyone does—you’re just gobbling up everything around you.\" Another track, \"Taking,\" also explores this gluttony: \"That's how she found me this morning / Bundled my head in her arms / Lifted my spoonful of sugar.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eEven without the explanation, Giannascoli's songs have an inherent mystery to them, oscillating between inviting and dreadful, dreamlike and reasonable, or good and evil. It's one of his biggest strengths, and likely why he's reticent about explaining his own material in interviews. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\"Without fail, every time I’ve loved a song and looked it up to figure out what it’s about, I won’t care about it anymore,\" \u003ca href=\"https://www.stereogum.com/1933104/qa-sandy-alex-g-on-idiotsplaining-rocket-working-with-frank-ocean-the-business-of-being-himself/franchises/interview/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehe told \u003ci\u003e Stereogum\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e in 2017.

Take \"Southern Sky,\" the LP's strongest track and arguably his most infectious song to date, due to his longtime collaborators—vocalist Emily Yacina and violinist Molly Germer—adding rustic charm. While lyrics like, \"It’s OK we don’t cry... we love the southern sky,\" might sound comforting at first, in his recollection: \"It must have been in a dream or something.

The same goes for an even more left-field song in \"Project 2,\" a track that makes do with pulsing, unpredictable drum beats and ambient synth stabs.

A principal made me put on a sweater and lectured me about how one should only wear \u003ci\u003e nude\u003c/i\u003e bras under white shirts because they’re less visible. My face got hot, I apologized for...wearing the wrong bra??, and cried in the bathroom out of embarrassment that someone had noticed the boobs I didn’t even want to have. Now that I’m closer to my then-principal’s age, I wonder (I hope) she felt just as uncomfortable pointing to a 14-year-old’s chest and saying, \u003ci\u003e your boobs are too apparent\u003c/i\u003e.

Ayala mentions that she frequently got in trouble for wearing dresses that were shorter than her knee-length apron at a recent barista job. A fellow Vice staffer, Amy Rose Spiegel, 28, remembers the embarrassment of getting called out by a manager at her job right after college, when she was 22 and hadn’t yet stocked up on adult clothes. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e “I remember the ‘your attire’ line perfectly, and how she took this deep breath through her teeth in the middle of delivering it, like the message was going to be something really grievous,” Spiegel says. “It felt like the message was that my body was making men uncomfortable, more than it was I looked unprofessional.” \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e And Richardson carries the same lessons she learned playing college tennis into her adult job as a sports manager.

They had six times the lethal dose. Absolutely heartbreaking, no parent should have to deal with that. And you’d think that’s the sort of person who’d hate my guts.

One place I went to we don’t hear about so much is Tajikistan; that’s a small, rocky country in Asia where all the smack comes into Russia from Afghanistan. We drove along the border and just across the river was Afghanistan. Every now and then a poor hick gets shot carrying a backpack of dope along a winding mountain trail.

Opium smoking is a traditional habit in Iran, but alcohol’s frowned upon. They still like a drink there, of course, but opiates are weirdly more socially acceptable, at least in some circles. Meanwhile over in Japan, there’s a very conformist, collectivist culture which looks down on anything illegal. But the drug of choice there is methamphetamine. It fits perfectly with their fast-paced, workaholic lifestyle. If you’re pulling a manic 12-hour shift you’re not going to sneak away to smoke a fat doobie.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn the favelas of Brazil or the Mafia-run neighborhoods in Sicily the drug use was very obvious. But what I’d noticed in stricter countries like Japan is it almost seems seedier, in a way, because drug users and dealers are much more social outcasts.

I think it comes down to how you don't actually have to read those messages, whereas if you've sat facing a masked gunman it's kind of late to back off now.

I used to think Duterte’s a mass-murdering asshole. I still do, but having been to Manila I kind of see why people support him. Even if their own family were murdered by motorbike-riding assassins, they think he’s doing the right thing. It’s a reminder we all live in our own little bubbles.

The same with drug addicts. If a little girl gets raped repeatedly by a family friend, how are you gonna tell her not to get high to numb the pain? And it’s the same with me. Maybe if kids at school hadn’t treated me like the weird immigrant kid I wouldn’t have been a drug dealer with something to prove and fucked up my life.

In truth, then, the origins of environmentalism are closer in spirit to the safari or trophy hunt than the march or sit-in.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe Civil Rights movement—and trash—had a big hand in making environmentalism more diverse. In 1978, Linda McKeeven Bullard recruited her husband, Dr. Robert Bullard, then a junior sociologist at Texas Southern University, to serve as expert witness in the first case to claim environmental discrimination under civil rights law. The lawsuit, Bean v. Southwestern Waste Management, sought an injunction against the siting of a garbage dump in Northwood Manor, a middle-class Black suburb of Houston. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"article__media\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1568365009556-GettyImages-181883527.jpeg\" alt=\"Robert Bullard, the \"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"article__image-caption\"\u003eDr. Robert Bullard is regarded as the father of environmental justice, but he still describes himself as “accidentally environmentalist.” Photo by Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post via Getty Images\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e \u003cp\u003eBullard was tasked with producing maps and statistics to prove that race was the decisive factor driving placement. “I grew up in the South, I knew the segregation and the power of racism to deprive neighborhoods.” said Bullard. “The maps we generated showed, without a doubt, that race was a major player in where the city sited environmental hazards.”\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn 1983, following the Bean case, the Congressional Black Caucus conducted a study of waste facilities in the South and found that 75 percent were in Black neighborhoods even though Black people made up less than a quarter of the population. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBullard went on to study environmental injustice in the Alabama Black Belt, in predominantly Black “Cancer Alley” in Louisiana and in West Virginia, compiling research for his first book, \u003ci\u003e Dumping in Dixie\u003c/i\u003e. In 1987, the Commission for Racial Justice of the United Church of Christ took his thesis nationwide in its pathbreaking \u003ca href=\"https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML1310/ML13109A339.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ereport\u003c/a\u003e on “Toxic Wastes and Race in the United States.” Though many regard Bullard as the father of environmental justice, he still describes himself as “accidentally environmentalist.” \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhere data, maps, and litigation blazed a trail, a movement followed. In 1982, the predominantly Black, poor, and rural residents of Warren County, North Carolina took a stand against a PCB oil dump in their community. Schoolchildren were arrested for laying their bodies in front of trucks carrying oil. National organizations such as the NAACP, United Church, and Congressional Black Caucus stepped up. “If you look at some of those photographs and some of that footage, and if you look at what was happening in Standing Rock—that was a microcosm or smaller or earlier version of people saying no,” said Bullard. Similar protests challenging instances of environmental racism began coalescing across the country. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn 1991, Bullard helped convene the First National People of Color Environmental Leadership Summit in Washington, D.C. In Minnesota, Winona LaDuke, the Ojibwe environmentalist and one-time Green Party vice presidential candidate, encouraged Tom Goldtooth, a Dakota and Diné organizer and director of the Red Lake Nation’s environmental protection program, to attend.

I want to give that to other people.”\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBut an inconvenient truth remains: climate change does not answer to racism, politics, or even justice—at least not directly. Its only principles are chemistry and physics. And this might be its greatest cruelty. Power is grazing the fingertips of people of color for the first time.

In a nifty new report out of the University of Swansea in the U.K., researchers got 2,700 college students from five countries to progressively narrow down which characteristics were most important to them in a lifetime mate, and the one that emerged from all cultures was kindness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003ca href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jopy.12514\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003estudy\u003c/a\u003e, which was published in the Journal of Personality on Sept. 8, compared the dating preferences of students from two countries traditionally considered as \u0026#8220;Eastern\u0026#8221; (Singapore and Malaysia) and three counties considered as \u0026#8220;Western\u0026#8221; (Australia, Norway and the U.K.).\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt offered up eight attributes on which participants could spend \u0026#8220;mate dollars\u0026#8221;: Physical attractiveness, good financial prospects, kindness, humor, chastity, religiosity, the desire for children, and creativity. Each dollar represented an increase of 10% in one trait. To make their partner funnier than 40% of the population, for example, participants had to spend $40. At first they spent big on everything, but as their budget grew smaller in each round of the study, they had to really figure out what they wanted. After kindness, men almost universally favored physical attractiveness and women chose good financial prospects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe asked the researcher Andrew G. Thomas, a senior lecturer in Psychology at Swansea, to explain his research.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYour study looks at the differences in mating preferences between countries that are traditionally considered \u0026ldquo;Western\u0026rdquo; and countries that are traditionally considered \u0026ldquo;Eastern.\u0026rdquo; Why were you interested in this?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\nWithin social sciences, there\u0026rsquo;s this view that attitudes and desires are primarily the product of learning or culture. As an evolutionary psychologist, I believe that some behaviors emerge consistently across cultures \u0026ndash; they are human \u0026ldquo;universals.\u0026rdquo; Looking at very different culture groups allows us to test this idea. If we find that men and women act in a similar way across the globe, then this adds weight to the idea that some behaviors develop in spite of culture rather than because of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe results suggest that across the board, men show a preference for youth and beauty, while women show a preference for ability to provide. Why is that?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\nThis is a finding that crops up time and time again within evolutionary psychology. The most convincing theory is that ancestral men and women evolved to choose partners in ways that helped them reproduce successfully, and that modern men and women continue to do this today. Because women\u0026rsquo;s fertility declines with age, ancestral men prioritized youth and beauty to ensure they picked a fertile mate. Similarly, because resources can make raising a child easier, and because the ability to provide resources varies from one man to the next, ancestral women evolved to prioritize social status to ensure they picked a mate who could invest in them and their offspring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAfter those three, which you classify as necessities, the next most popular trait was humor, at least in the Western group. Did its high prioritization surprise you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\nHumor ended up being a priority in the Western group, but not the Eastern one. The fact that humor was important wasn\u0026rsquo;t too surprising, as there are a few good theories that suggest that humor is important in mate selection. However, the East-West difference was surprising. Upon reflection, I think this is because some of the traits included in the task (e.g., religiosity and chastity) are more important in Eastern cultures than the Western ones. So when budgets were tight, Western participants were able to ignore these attributes and spend more dollars on humor, while Eastern ones could not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo how different are people from Western and Eastern cultures in terms of what we want in a partner? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\nWe found cultural differences for almost every trait. However, in most cases, these were a simply matter of degree. For example, for men and women from both cultures the most important trait, hands down, was kindness. This far outweighed traits like creativity, religiosity and humor. Sure, there were small cultural differences in the importance of kindness, but the real finding is that this was consistently a top trait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWere there any other significant differences between men and women?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\nOne very interesting difference was in a partner\u0026#8217;s desire for children. We found that this wasn\u0026rsquo;t a priority in the Eastern sample at all. However, within the Western one, women gave it priority but not men. We think this may have something to do with family planning. In cultures where contraception is widespread, a partner\u0026rsquo;s desire for children may predict the likelihood of starting a family. In contrast, in cultures where contraception use is less widespread, having children may be a natural consequence of sex within a relationship, making actual desire for children less relevant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAre there any other circumstances in which people prioritize kindness more or less in a mate?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\nWhile the precise number of dollars allocated to kindness is different across cultures and sex, these don\u0026rsquo;t change the overall finding that kindness is king. However, one thing that we know does kill kindness is a change of relationship context. In our study we asked participants to design a long-term partner. But other versions of the task have asked people to design a short-term partner. When this happens, kindness is given much less priority.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat small difference between the groups you studied intrigued you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\nIt always surprises me with this task that creativity takes a back seat to most other traits, and this pattern was repeated in our large cross-cultural comparison. Highly successful creative individuals, such as musicians and artists, are often highly desirable mates, but maybe what\u0026rsquo;s actually being valued here is not creativity as such but the social status that accompanies it. It makes me wonder what groupies really like about the bands they follow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAny takeaway from all this for people who are currently dating?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\nFirst of all, I think it\u0026rsquo;s great that kindness is king and appears to be a human universal. At the same time, this type of research can give people guidance as to what attributes the other sex prioritizes when making mating decisions. If the findings of our study are correct, then men would be able to enhance their attractiveness to a greater degree by focusing on the development of their financial prospects rather than their creativity or religiosity. And this tactic may well be as successful in Norway as in Malaysia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/time/topstories/~4/_UUGRjsaGqI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/_UUGRjsaGqI/","published":"2019-09-13T15:57:32Z","guid":"http://time.com/?p=5674697"},{"title":"Eddie Money, ‘Two Tickets to Paradise’ Singer, Dies at 70","content":"\u003caside class=\"right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad\" id=\"right-rail__ad-5677061\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module\" data-src=\"https://time.com/5677061/eddie-money-died/\" data-widget-id=\"SB_2\" data-ob-template=\"timemag\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(NASHVILLE, Tenn.) \u0026mdash; A publicist for Eddie Money said the rock star has died after he recently announced he had stage 4 esophageal cancer.

That means Badshah and others can continue to tout their \u0026#8220;records,\u0026#8221; tainted as those claims may now be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe changes won\u0026#8217;t likely mean the end of this sort of music video advertising, however.

To encourage students to continue their education after they graduate from high school and ensure every student learns the skills they need, my plan also provides two years of free in-state tuition and fees at a public university, community college, or technical school to everyone who completes one year of my mandatory national service program.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e4.

In the wake of terrorist attacks, legislation in India and Australia has sought to give law enforcement access to encrypted communications, in moves that could threaten the security of encryption around the world. In the United States, Apple has staked its reputation on protecting encrypted communications even when they belong to terrorists — while Facebook pledged this year to shift the company to private messaging. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"UaFHBc\"\u003eThe moves have exposed obvious tensions between free speech and safety. In an effort to move the discussion forward, the \u003ca href=\"https://fsi.stanford.edu/news/stanford-internet-observatory-seeks-detect-internet-abuse-real-time\"\u003eStanford Internet Observatory\u003c/a\u003e today held a conference in which tech platforms, government agencies, nongovernmental organizations, civil rights activists, and academics met to hash it out. I was among a handful of journalists who attended the event, and I came away mostly encouraged that all sides are determined to find a workable balance — even though it seemed clear that each group would strike that balance somewhat differently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"0Wftb4\"\u003eThe government agencies want to maintain what they call “lawful access” to communications when needed for investigations, even if it means hacking into devices. Civil rights groups (represented today by the Electronic Frontier Foundation) warned that law enforcement is building a powerful surveillance operation and is increasingly arguing in court that they shouldn’t need a warrant to snoop on our communications. Tech platforms want to promote democratic free speech of the variety that produced Black Lives Matter and the #MeToo movement while also helping to catch terrorists and child predators. And nongovernmental organizations, such as those who work on protecting exploited children, worry that efforts to protect speech with encryption will make catching those predators much harder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"VFJclk\"\u003eAn example from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children drove the point home. The organization has long operated a tipline in which people can report coming across child pornography and other incidents of abuse. In the late 1990s, the tipline received 200 to 300 reports per week, said Michelle DeLaune, NCMEC’s chief operating officer. But as the internet gained adoption, and platforms began collaborating with the organization, reports to the tipline exploded. In 2018, NCMEC received more than 18 million reports of exploitative imagery. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"MfJVUG\"\u003eStrikingly, 99 percent of those reports come directly from the tech platforms. Through the use of artificial intelligence, hashed images, and partnerships between companies, we’re now arguably much better informed about the scope and spread of these images — and are better equipped to catch abusers. A Facebook executive says that the company bans a whopping 250,000 WhatsApp accounts a month for sharing child exploitation imagery. And a representative of GCHQ, the United Kingdom intelligence agency, said that in the UK last year 2,500 people were arrested due to NCMEC reports.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"mlf8D3\"\u003e“That’s what we lose if we get this wrong,” said Crispin Robinson, GCHQ’s technical director for cryptoanalysis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"tqWDLY\"\u003eMeanwhile, the flip side of this discussion — the potential for government abuse of these tools — is on full display in Hong Kong. Maciej Ceglowski, the brilliantly acerbic writer-thinker-entrepreneur, recently returned from a month in the city-state reporting for the \u003cem\u003eNew Yorker\u003c/em\u003e. He described how young pro-democracy protesters organize on Telegram, with the largely leaderless movement coordinating via in-app polls. Curiously, he said, the app has become popular even though its messages \u003ca href=\"https://www.abacusnews.com/digital-life/why-telegram-isnt-secure-you-think/article/3014398\"\u003enot end-to-end encrypted\u003c/a\u003e by default. But it allows users to find nearby protesters, to speak to thousands of them at once, and to send disappearing messages that make prosecuting them harder if they are arrested — and that has been enough to make it an anchor of the pro-democracy movement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"6pgOnS\"\u003eCeglowski’s talk underscored a point made throughout the day’s talks: that something can be secure even if it’s not encrypted, and something can be unsafe even if it is. As with so much in our conversations about technology, security, and democracy, encryption debates can be emotional in a way that undercuts nuance. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"rqDY8K\"\u003eAlex Stamos, who came to the Internet Observatory from Facebook and who organized the event, reminded the audience that encryption solves another, growing problem for platforms. As countries demand that they remove more speech from their servers, it becomes desirable to remove products from speech debates entirely. A company can’t moderate what it can’t see — and so it may increasingly have an incentive not to see it. There are lots of public-minded reasons a company like Facebook wants to promote encryption — but there are nakedly self-interested ones, too. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"5nYeRc\"\u003eNo one in the room on Thursday morning offered a simple solution for squaring all these circles. But it was heartening, at least, that they came into the room and were willing to have at least some of these discussions in public.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"Ks4dnV\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Ratio\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"HViZ87\"\u003e  \u003cstrong\u003eTrending up\u003c/strong\u003e: \u003ca href=\"https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2019/09/updating-the-values-that-inform-our-community-standards/\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFacebook\u003c/strong\u003e updated the values that inform its community standards\u003c/a\u003e.

Instead, ranking for top-watched music videos will be based on organic plays, \u003ca href=\"https://youtube.googleblog.com/2019/09/maintaining-credibility-and-consistency.html\"\u003eaccording to a new blog post\u003c/a\u003e.

YouTube’s blog post acknowledges that people use these stats — many often touting record-breaking 24-hour views — as a “definitive representation of its instant cultural impact,” and it wants to ensure those numbers are accurate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"vq14J1\"\u003e“It’s a great honor and one we take very seriously,” the blog post reads. “As we look to maintain consistency and credibility across our platform, we’ve made some necessary revisions to our methodology for reporting 24-hour record debuts.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-float-right\"\u003e\u003caside id=\"V8OI1M\"\u003e\u003cq\u003e“It’s a great honor and one we take very seriously.”\u003c/q\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"5k7tSA\"\u003eThe new changes mean that videos eligible for record debuts must come from organic sources, including “direct links to the video, search results, external sites that embed the video and YouTube features like the homepage, watch next and Trending,” according to the blog post. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"5IIvnF\"\u003eYouTube’s music chart system has faced a few controversies over the last few months. In July, Indian rapper Badshah broke the record for most views in 24 hours, beating out BTS with 75 million views to their 74.6 million just months earlier. But people suspected that the rapper’s view total was inflated with artificial views. \u003ca href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-30/bollywood-rapper-sets-viewer-record-youtube-isn-t-talking-about\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eBloomberg \u003c/em\u003elater reported\u003c/a\u003e that Badshah and his team purchased advertisements that either embedded or promoted the video. This led to a dramatically increased view count. YouTube decided not to acknowledge the record-breaking numbers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"re1Fi9\"\u003e“Video advertising is an effective way to reach specific audiences with a song debut, but paid advertising views on YouTube will no longer be considered when looking at a 24-hour record debut,” the blog post reads. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"clEWMV\"\u003eSimilar tactics are often used by movie studios and TV networks that fight for record-breaking numbers, but those won’t be impacted. A YouTube spokesperson told \u003cem\u003eThe Verge \u003c/em\u003ethat the change “is focused on aligning YouTube Music Charts and records with the industry standard and how we report to Nielsen and other third party charting companies.” The company isn’t making any platform-wide changes. \u003c/p\u003e","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/13/20864306/youtube-music-charts-views-organic-advertisment-record-breaking-badshah-bts","published":"2019-09-13T15:58:09Z","guid":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/13/20864306/youtube-music-charts-views-organic-advertisment-record-breaking-badshah-bts"},{"title":"Discord gives up on subscription games because no one was playing them","content":"\u003cimg alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U7Kn0-gnfkq6v58tVKBB03yaNMc=/206x0:2453x1498/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/65239918/Screen_Shot_2019_09_13_at_10.50.45_AM.0.png\" /\u003e\n\n  \u003csmall\u003eImage: Discord\u003c/small\u003e\n\n  \u003cp id=\"YiHchK\"\u003eDiscord seemingly isn’t the place where people want to go for subscription gaming.

Discord realizes that the sudden axing of this Nitro perk might turn some customers away, and the company says it’s willing to offer refunds to those who want it. But Nitro, which was launched in 2016 as a premium step up from the standard, free-to-use Discord app, will continue on as a premium tier for power users who want extra features. “While the nuts and bolts of Nitro have changed since three years ago, the spirit remains the same: keep Discord’s core features free. Nitro features should feel like enhancements to the core Discord experience,” the company says.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"YNcKiy\"\u003ePerhaps to counter the loss of the games collection, Discord says it’s “launching a doubled upload size of 100MB for Nitro $9.99 subscribers.” Games purchased through Discord are unaffected by this change, as are Nitro Game Perks. Subscribers will be able to keep playing the library of 60-plus titles until they vanish on October 15th. \u003c/p\u003e","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/13/20864278/discord-nitro-games-subscription-bundle-discontinued","published":"2019-09-13T15:38:17Z","guid":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/13/20864278/discord-nitro-games-subscription-bundle-discontinued"},{"title":"Hear The Verge’s first impressions of the iPhone 11","content":"\u003cimg alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/93nU_Zi4pEBBwGa124SrZjS2aCM=/0x1:4096x2732/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/65239906/IMG_1960.0.jpg\" /\u003e\n\n  \u003csmall\u003ePhoto by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge\u003c/small\u003e\n\n  \u003cp id=\"KLkZNu\"\u003eThis week on \u003ca href=\"http://applepodcasts.com/vergecast\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Vergecast\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e,\u003c/em\u003e as you can imagine, Dieter Bohn, Nilay Patel, and Paul Miller discuss what was announced at Apple’s hardware event on Tuesday. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"qIytsv\"\u003eBoth Nilay and Dieter were able to attend the event and demo the \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/10/20857974/apple-iphone-11-hands-on-features-photos-video-price-camera\"\u003eiPhone 11\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/10/20857971/apple-iphone-11-pro-max-hands-on-features-photos-video-camera-price\"\u003eiPhone 11 Pro\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/10/20857975/apple-watch-5-series-hands-on-features-photos-video-price\"\u003eApple Watch Series 5\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/10/20858844/apple-ipad-7th-gen-10-2-inch-hands-on-features-photos-video-price\"\u003enew iPad\u003c/a\u003e in person.

Both films were directed by Richard Linklater, and as his first films following his major studio release \u003cem\u003eThe Newton Boys\u003c/em\u003e, they helped cement his reputation for unpredictability. But where \u003cem\u003eTape\u003c/em\u003e mostly received polite nods, \u003cem\u003eWaking Life\u003c/em\u003e won over viewers who were beguiled by Linklater’s attempt to use animation to realize the landscape of dreams. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"GuWjLH\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eWaking Life\u003c/em\u003e follows an unnamed protagonist (played by \u003cem\u003eDazed and Confused\u003c/em\u003e star Wiley Wiggins) through a series of vignettes featuring characters expressing their most deeply held views about the meaning of life via conversations or monologues. The protagonist describes the process as mostly “just people goin’ off about whatever.” That’s accurate, but as a description, it misses the complexity of the film, which touches on the function of language, technology’s possible role in human evolution, André Bazin, Philip K. Dick, fate, death, the unknowable nature of reality, and other topics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"li2qWz\"\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"\u003e\u003ciframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SbPgprcMtjo?rel=0\" style=\"border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"encrypted-media; accelerometer; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Tik4wc\"\u003eThe people he encounters, observes, or even just imagines include Linklater himself, Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy (reprising their characters from Linklater’s \u003cem\u003eBefore Sunrise\u003c/em\u003e for the first time), Alex Jones (an Austin eccentric before he became an insidious influence on national politics), and famed New York tour guide Timothy Speed Levitch. Each presents an idea or a point of view for the protagonist to ponder. Then they fade away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"jBqZKn\"\u003eThough the film has a progression that ultimately leads Wiggins’ character to consider the role of death in shaping meaning, it mostly drifts from one notion and memorable character to the next, letting the concepts and their presenters shape the animation. As Jones’ rant intensifies, for instance, his face turns red. Some characters look cartoony, others appear almost photorealistic. Backgrounds shimmer, bend, and melt away. The cumulative effect is of reality being pulled in and out of focus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"PTBUfz\"\u003eThe rotoscoping process makes that effect possible. The animation style, broadly speaking, traces animation over live-action footage. It’s an old technique, but the film puts it to new uses, thanks to a computer program called Rotoshop, which is created by art director and programmer Bob Sabiston. Where hand-drawn rotoscoping had previously been used to make animation look more realistic, here, it makes the real world resemble animation.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QooPhYuUD-s9ZoQjgE7UVQ_7HrM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19189088/WakingLife2.jpg\"\u003e\n      \u003ccite\u003ePhoto: Fox Searchlight Pictures\u003c/cite\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"1jzl0b\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Watch Now?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"xvSeIe\"\u003eSabiston, like Linklater, was based in Austin, and they collaborated again on the 2006 Philip K.

The circumstances that brought her to that moment and the choices she makes after the accident are wrapped up in a mystery from her past she previously didn’t even realize existed. Now, her late father (Bob Odenkirk) serves as her guide as she explores her own memories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"RE0DPe\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eUndone\u003c/em\u003e visibly draws on both \u003cem\u003eA Scanner Darkly\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eWaking Life\u003c/em\u003e. From the former, it uses rotoscoping’s not-quite-solid quality to create an atmosphere of unease in the service of a science fiction plot. From the latter, it borrows the ability to blast reality open at any moment. In the second episode, Rosa cycles through several different variations on the same experience, each time watching as what she believes is really happening falls apart and cycles back on itself. Like Linklater on \u003cem\u003eWaking Life\u003c/em\u003e, Hulsing understands how this particular style of animation can capture a feeling between sleep and wakefulness and how it shows that some stories can only be told in that space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"bkUdXv\"\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"\u003e\u003ciframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6uWCNHQgfnc?rel=0\" style=\"border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"encrypted-media; accelerometer; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"LKkEGY\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho It’s For\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"v3CjzV\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eWaking Life\u003c/em\u003e defies categorization, resembling no film so closely as Linklater’s \u003cem\u003eSlacker\u003c/em\u003e, a live-action tour of an Austin populated by colorful characters with a lot on their mind and a willingness to share their thoughts.

It starts with Aegon the Conqueror, the first Targaryen king of Westeros who conquered Westeros with his siblings, and it goes all the way through Aerys II, the Mad King, who \u003cem\u003eGOT\u003c/em\u003e fans will recognize as Daenerys’ father and the last of the Targaryen kings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"S9AtHb\"\u003eThere are a few issues with \u003cem\u003eFire and Blood\u003c/em\u003e, the book, however.

(The rule of Aegon III, the last Targaryen ruler to have living dragons until Daenerys, would come along another 150 or so years later.) And as anyone who watched the end of \u003cem\u003eGame of Thrones\u003c/em\u003e now knows, \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/21/18633029/game-of-thrones-got-ending-season-8-george-rr-martin-apology\"\u003eadapting an unfinished Martin series is a difficult prospect\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-float-right\"\u003e\u003caside id=\"sQSt96\"\u003e\u003cq\u003eThe real issue is that ‘\u003cem\u003eFire and Blood’ \u003c/em\u003eis \u003cem\u003eboring\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/q\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"242qCB\"\u003eBut the bigger issue is that \u003cem\u003eFire and Blood \u003c/em\u003eis \u003cem\u003eso boring.\u003c/em\u003e The book is written as an in-universe historical tome, allegedly written by Archmaester Gyldayn, and it’s styled after Edward Gibbon’s \u003cem\u003eThe History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, \u003c/em\u003ewhich is a wonderful historical set (or so I’m told) but not exactly entertaining reading.

There’s also the issue that the later years of the dynasty (which, again, Martin has yet to write) obviously butts up against the current series in the sort of unnecessary prequel style that \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/30/13783230/fantastic-beasts-vs-star-wars-phantom-menace-comparison\"\u003ealready haunts\u003c/a\u003e the \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/27/18114205/fantastic-beasts-crimes-of-grindelwald-attack-clones-last-jedi-george-lucas-jk-rowling-prequel\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eStar Wars\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eHarry Potter\u003c/em\u003e franchises\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"LjYA54\"\u003eThere’s also the far longer time period, although that could be managed if HBO takes more of an anthology approach. A \u003cem\u003eFire and Blood\u003c/em\u003e show could, for example, adapt one monarch’s reign in one season and then jump ahead in time to the next. Such a strategy could also help the network avoid ballooning actor salaries that helped \u003cem\u003eThrones\u003c/em\u003e become one of the most expensive shows that ever aired. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"HOtHPF\"\u003eAll of this is still in the early stages. \u003cem\u003eDeadline\u003c/em\u003e’s report only notes that a pilot may be nearing an order, which isn’t a guarantee of any sort.

One day, he’ll post a comic with the characters speaking French, and the next, they’ll be speaking Japanese. It’s hard to keep count of all the different languages he’s incorporated into his artwork — like Korean, German, Russian, Catalan, and Chinese, just to name a few examples.

Doing so makes it even easier to use the virtual assistant to do more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe refrigerator helps you by making lists and shopping for groceries, checking and sharing weather forecasts, managing your calendar, looking up recipes, and playing music.

The \u003ca href=\"https://www.lg.com/us/refrigerators/lg-LNXS30996D-door-in-door\"\u003eLG InstaView ThinQ refrigerator\u003c/a\u003e is a technology marvel. Here is my product review of this smart refrigerator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eUnique Product Features\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are many smart connected refrigerators available. However, these refrigerators talk to an external virtual assistant like Alexa. What makes the LQ InstaView ThinQ refrigerator so different is that Amazon Alexa is built into it. Doing so makes it even easier to use the virtual assistant to do more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe refrigerator helps you by making lists and shopping for groceries, checking and sharing weather forecasts, managing your calendar, looking up recipes, and playing music. It just means you have to get used to talking to your refrigerator as it operates on voice commands thanks to Alexa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter wp-image-159643 size-large\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-11-at-7.53.57-AM-900x374.png\" alt=\"LG Instaview ThinQ Refrigerator\" width=\"900\" height=\"374\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-11-at-7.53.57-AM-900x374.png 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-11-at-7.53.57-AM-260x108.png 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-11-at-7.53.57-AM-300x125.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother unique feature is the 29” HD transparent LCD touch-screen. With the screen, you can use WiFi-enabled features to set and check food expiration dates, see everything you have in the refrigerator without having to open the door, upload photos, and leave messages for your family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe music sounds really good coming from this French-door refrigerator. That\u0026#8217;s due to the LG Bluetooth audio speakers that are hidden on top of the refrigerator. The speakers sync with your devices so everyone can use the refrigerator as a sound system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThe LG ThinQ Technology\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind these unique features is LG\u0026#8217;s \u003ca href=\"https://www.lg.com/us/lg-thinq\"\u003eThinQ technology\u003c/a\u003e, including its app. Everything about the mobile app is easy to understand and use.

It\u0026#8217;s a Super-capacity with 30 cubic feet with a significant amount of usable space to fill it full of food.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe refrigerator also has a Door-in-Door feature with ColdSaver Panel. This keeps cold air inside your refrigerator to help keep food fresher for a longer period of time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ice and water dispenser fits a wide range of container sizes. It measures 12.6 inches so you can even get a tall pint glass or drink bottle in there. The ice maker is powerful but doesn\u0026#8217;t take up as much room as traditional ice machines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe refrigerator also uses Smart Cooling Plus technology. It features a Linear Compressor and Dual Evaporators that senses humidity and temperature levels along with vents throughout the refrigerator that further maintain the optimum environment for food freshness. The air filter also does a good job of keeping the air fresh and free of food odors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother convenient feature is the easy-to-reach compartments at the front of the refrigerator. These are the ideal spots for putting snack items as well as things you reach for often like sandwich supplies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter wp-image-159640 size-large\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/LGInstaViewRefrigerator-900x529.jpg\" alt=\"LGInstaView Refrigerator\" width=\"900\" height=\"529\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/LGInstaViewRefrigerator-900x529.jpg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/LGInstaViewRefrigerator-260x153.jpg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/LGInstaViewRefrigerator-300x176.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/LGInstaViewRefrigerator.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThe Look\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother standout about this particular refrigerator is how it looks, elevating your kitchen to gourmet, high-end levels. Beyond the traditional choice of stainless steel, this refrigerator comes in what\u0026#8217;s called black stainless steel for a satin appearance minus all those smudges you see on regular stainless steel. Surprisingly, the color blends well with all cabinetry colors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eEnergy Efficiency\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe refrigerator qualifies for the ENERGY STAR rating. In fact, it exceeds federal energy standards. In the long run, you\u0026#8217;ll be able to get a significant return for this investment in terms of savings on your energy bill. Plus, it feels good knowing you are helping the environment by lowering your energy consumption.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThe Price\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe coolness factor of this refrigerator is going to cost you. It\u0026#8217;s over $6,000, which is considerably more than most people are willing to pay for a refrigerator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eImprovements Needed\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the first-of-its-kind, LG has set a precedent. However, with the advancement in technology also comes room for improvement. Recommended improvements include greater flexibility for connecting calendars and other apps as well as better streaming and WiFi capabilities. The menu is fairly basic for such a high-tech appliance, so it will be good to see what future models offer in terms of greater functionality and choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter wp-image-159641 size-large\" src=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/LGInstaViewThinQRefrigerator-900x594.jpg\" alt=\"LGInstaView ThinQ Refrigerator\" width=\"900\" height=\"594\" srcset=\"https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/LGInstaViewThinQRefrigerator-900x594.jpg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/LGInstaViewThinQRefrigerator-243x160.jpg 243w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/LGInstaViewThinQRefrigerator-300x198.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/LGInstaViewThinQRefrigerator.jpg 940w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWarranty Information\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe LG smart refrigerator model has a one-year warranty that covers parts and labor. There is additional warranty coverage of seven years for the Sealed System and 10 years for the linear compressor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhere to Buy\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can buy the LG InstaView ThinQ Refrigerator at appliance stores like Home Depot, Lowe\u0026#8217;s, and Best Buy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eOverall Thoughts\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe LG InstaView ThinQ refrigerator is a top-of-the-line smart appliance that is chock full of the latest technology with thoughtful design inside for more food storage and outside for a slim-line fit into your kitchen. The smart and connected appliance shows us what the future will look like. However, at the current price point, it\u0026#8217;s clearly not for everyone and is a significant investment that most people cannot make. Although there are improvements to be made with some of the features, overall, this refrigerator sets a precedent for what smart devices can do to change our homes and lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor those that have room in the budget, this high-end smart refrigerator is ideal for its energy savings, connectivity, convenience, and tech

This time the format was limited to a single night with 10 participants, which meant that for the first time, all the top-tier candidates were onstage together. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren defended their respective healthcare plans, but the center of attention was frontrunner Joe Biden, who spent the night fending off attacks from his rivals.

As Greta has told us so often: “Our house is on fire.” And I firmly believe that there are three things that have to align if we are going to douse the flames. First, we need the courage to dream of a different kind of future. To shake off the sense of inevitable apocalypse that has pervaded our culture. To give us a destination, a common goal, a picture of the world we are working towards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut those dreams are useless unless we are willing to embrace the other two forces. One is the need to confront the truth of our moment in history — the truth of how much we have already lost and of how much more we are on the brink of losing if we do not embrace revolutionary levels of change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other thing we have to do is this: We have find our fight. We have to come together across differences and build credible, unshakable power. In the face of the fires roiling our world, we have to find our own fire. Truth and fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreta Thunberg is one of the great truth-tellers of this or any time. Let me refresh your memories about some of her most iconic lines. To the U.N. climate negotiators in Poland last December, she said: “You are not mature enough to tell it like it is. Even that burden you leave to us children.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo the British MPs who asked her to speak, she asked, “Is my English OK? Is the microphone on? Because I’m beginning to wonder.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo the rich and mighty at Davos who praised her for giving them hope, she replied, “I don’t want your hope. … I want you to panic. I want you to feel the fear I feel every day. I want you to act. I want you to act as you would in a crisis. I want you to act as if the house is on fire, because it is.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe also told them that not everyone is to blame for the climate crisis. No, she looked them in the eye and said that they were to blame. And we will always love her for that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p2\"\u003e\u003c!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[0](%7B%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"shortcode\" data-shortcode=\"newsletter\" data-campaign=\"\" data-cta=\"\" data-headline=\"\" data-layout=\"\" data-subhead=\"\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[0] --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Greta is not all talk. All of this began with action. It began when Greta realized, one year and one month ago, that if she wanted powerful politicians to put themselves on emergency footing to fight climate change, then she needed to reflect that state of emergency in her own life. And so she stopped doing the one thing all kids are supposed to do when everything is normal: Go to school to prepare for their future as adults.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, she stationed herself outside of Sweden’s parliament with a handmade sign that said simply: “School Strike for the Climate.” She started doing it every Friday, and pretty soon she attracted a small crowd. Then other students started doing it in other cities as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStudents like \u003ca href=\"https://www.teenvogue.com/story/alexandria-villasenor-teen-activist-united-nations-climate-strike\"\u003eAlexandria Villaseñor\u003c/a\u003e, who stations herself outside the United Nations in this city every Friday, week after week, rain, snow or shine. Sometimes the student climate strikes were just one lonely kid. Sometimes tens of thousands showed up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, on March 15, came the first \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/03/15/youth-climate-strike/\"\u003eGlobal School Strike for Climate\u003c/a\u003e. Over 2,000 strikes in 125 countries, with 1.6 million young people participating on a single day. 1.6 million people. That’s quite an achievement for a movement that began just eight months earlier with a single 15-year-old girl in Stockholm, Sweden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now this movement is gearing up for its biggest challenge yet: They have called on people of all ages to join the and go on strike, all around the world, on September 20. Because protecting the future is not a spectator sport.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThunberg and the many other amazing young organizers have been very clear that they do not want adults to pat them on the head and thank them for the hope infusion. They want us to join them and fight for the future alongside them. Because it is their right. And all of our duty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe post \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/09/13/greta-thunberg-naomi-klein-climate/\"\u003eGreta Thunberg on the Climate

Due to resource constraints and more dangerous adversaries, Army formations must maximize every capability, synchronize operations across domains, and mass at the decisive point to win future battles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Brig.

Stephen Michael, speaking at an Association of the U.S. Army \u0026#8220;Hot Topic\u0026#8221; forum on aviation, Sept. 5.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe technology will allow pilots and drivers to train inside their primary operating vehicles. Virtual embedded system trainers are already being used for the Integrated Visual Augmentation System, a single-platform, heads-up display that lets Soldiers train in realistic virtual environments. The Army expects to reach initial operating capability for the IVAS by the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe synthetic training environment, an augmented virtual training platform, could further enhance Soldiers\u0026#8217; opportunities to train at their home station or at combat training centers, said Larry Hamby, STE capability manager at CAC. The embedded system trainers will have a switch that activates the training simulations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u0026#8220;The intent is to reuse that STE software (and) have the virtual trainer in the future vertical lift platform and the next-generation combat vehicles,\u0026#8221; Hamby said. \u0026#8220;The trainer is the actual piece of equipment.

The Army Research Laboratory at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, and the Institute for Creative Technologies in Southern California have been developing the One World Terrain, a virtual training management tool that will eventually become a pillar of the synthetic training environment. OWT features augmented reality software that uses data collection and data mapping to create realistic training scenarios for Soldiers on the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the Army transitions from fighting anti-insurgency battles to large-scale ground combat operations, some Soldiers have already embraced the changes in training Army leaders said last Thursday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCol. Kenneth Cole, the deputy commander at the Army\u0026#8217;s Aviation Center of Excellence at Fort Rucker, Alabama, recently completed a two-year stint as the 12th Combat Aviation Brigade commander in Ansbach, Germany, where he could see the change in Soldiers who transitioned to his unit in Western Europe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u0026#8220;The Soldiers are coming out already familiar with the concepts of large-scale combat operations,\u0026#8221; Cole said. \u0026#8220;And the doctrine is being embedded into the programs of instruction all across the board.\u0026#8221;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne challenge the Army faces with its aviation platforms, including the AH-64 Apache and the CH-47 Chinook, is successfully creating realistic training scenarios in simulations that accurately depict the complexities of the aircraft, said Col. John Ferrell, director of simulation for the Aviation Center of Excellence. He said the aviation branch lags behind in training for each of the platforms as the service prepares for multi-domain operations \u0026#8212; in the air, land, space, cyberspace and sea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u0026#8220;Our simulations still do not replicate the complexity of MDO as described in the doctrine,\u0026#8221; he said. \u0026#8220;Although we\u0026#8217;re doing the best that we can with the simulations we have.\u0026#8221;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen asked how the Army could improve its training, Michael said a focus on leader development and helping commanders drive training standards could help prepare Soldiers better.

problem at the core of progressive foreign policy","content":"\u003cp\u003eBy Thomas Wright\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 2016, Donald Trump took on and defeated the Republican foreign-policy establishment. Some progressives wonder if they may be able to accomplish the same feat in the Democratic Party in 2020. They are \u003ca href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/01/democrats-defeat-trump-radically-anti-war\"\u003elooking \u003c/a\u003efor a nominee who rejects the post–Cold War bipartisan consensus, which they believe makes the United States too quick to get into wars and too committed to American primacy, in favor of a strategy of restraint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe newly formed Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft—founded with large grants from the Charles Koch Foundation and George Soros’s Open Society Foundations—is the latest addition to this effort. Quincy seeks to bring together progressives with anti-intervention conservatives to “restore the pursuit of peace to the nation’s foreign-policy agenda,” as its co-founder Andrew Bacevich \u003ca href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2019/06/30/soros-and-koch-brothers-team-end-forever-war-policy/WhyENwjhG0vfo9Um6Zl0JO/story.html\"\u003eput it\u003c/a\u003e. It’s not just Quincy. A number of scholars and experts have \u003ca href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2018-09-04/toward-neo-progressive-foreign-policy\"\u003ewritten \u003c/a\u003ethoughtful \u003ca href=\"https://tnsr.org/roundtable/policy-roundtable-the-future-of-progressive-foreign-policy/#intro\"\u003epieces \u003c/a\u003etrying to flesh out a progressive alternative.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the progressives succeed, we could be on the cusp of a revolution in U.S. foreign policy along the lines of the rise of internationalism in the 1940s or neoconservatism in the 1980s. However, the revolutionaries have their work cut out for them. Thus far, the progressive presidential candidates are closer to President Barack Obama’s worldview than their rhetoric lets on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe progressive candidates have signaled their desire to pursue a policy in which the United States reduces its military commitments overseas—what is usually called a “foreign policy of restraint.” The interesting question, though, is whether that is possible at an acceptable cost. Outside of the Middle East, the answer is almost certainly no. If they were to go further toward adopting a strategy of restraint whereby the United States does much less militarily around the world, they would have to make major sacrifices on alliances, nuclear proliferation, and spheres of influence that no Democratic commander in chief seems likely to want to make.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo candidates for president—Bernie \u003ca href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-political-scene/bernie-sanders-imagines-a-progressive-new-approach-to-foreign-policy\"\u003eSanders \u003c/a\u003eand Elizabeth \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/world/2019/5/7/18525841/elizabeth-warren-foreign-policy-ganesh-sitaraman\"\u003eWarren\u003c/a\u003e—have embraced the progressive-foreign-policy label. Reading their speeches and articles, two major themes stand out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first is that \u003ca href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2019-06-24/ending-americas-endless-war\"\u003eSanders’s \u003c/a\u003eand \u003ca href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2018-11-29/foreign-policy-all\"\u003eWarren’s \u003c/a\u003especific ideas to change U.S. foreign policy are focused on the Middle East. They oppose military intervention in Syria and Iraq. They support the Iran nuclear deal. They want to get tough with Saudi Arabia, going beyond simply ending U.S. support for the war in Yemen. Both favor an end to the war in Afghanistan, and both have questioned the extent of ongoing operations against terrorist networks. Sanders and Warren do differ over Israel—Sanders is very critical of Israel and has questioned U.S. aid, whereas Warren is generally seen as supportive of the alliance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, when you drill down, the two presidential candidates are difficult to pin down on whether they oppose military intervention on principle or, if not, under what conditions they might support it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSanders opposed the Vietnam War, the Gulf War, and the Iraq War of 2003, as well as numerous U.S. interventions in Latin America and the Middle East. However, he also \u003ca href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/evs/1998/roll482.xml\"\u003evoted \u003c/a\u003efor the Iraq Liberation Act of 1998 and later \u003ca href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4547945/bernie-sanders-expresses-concern-bombing-iraq-1998\"\u003ecalled \u003c/a\u003eSaddam Hussein “a brutal dictator who should be overthrown.” He opposed Operation Desert Fox, a bombing campaign in Iraq in 1998, primarily because it did not have congressional or United Nations approval, but also because he did not \u003ca href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4547945/bernie-sanders-expresses-concern-bombing-iraq-1998\"\u003ethink \u003c/a\u003eit would bring about regime change. He \u003ca href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/evs/1999/roll103.xml\"\u003evoted \u003c/a\u003efor the 1999 Kosovo War and subsequently supported the NATO bombing campaign, even as he argued that President Bill Clinton’s failure to secure congressional support meant it was unconstitutional. He voted for the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force and \u003ca href=\"https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/dec/22/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-bernie-sanders-voted-get-rid-/\"\u003edid not oppose\u003c/a\u003e the 2011 intervention in Libya in its initial stages, when the sacking of Benghazi by Muammar Qaddafi’s forces seemed imminent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnlike Sanders, Warren never had to vote or comment on these interventions. She has been careful not to shed any light on her views on them since becoming a U.S. senator. However, Warren does have a track record from when she entered politics in 2012. In Warren’s first-ever \u003ca href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/elizabeth-warren-national-security_n_4861778\"\u003espeech \u003c/a\u003eon foreign policy, at Georgetown University in 2014, she implicitly criticized Obama for not being sufficiently sensitive to civilian casualties in his drone strikes. In 2014, she \u003ca href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/international/216559-warren-destroying-isis-should-be-our-no-1-priority\"\u003esaid \u003c/a\u003ethat the defeat of ISIS should be the Obama administration’s top priority, but that the United States should avoid getting dragged into a war. She \u003ca href=\"https://www.masslive.com/politics/2014/08/sen_elizabeth_warren_warns_abo.html\"\u003esupported \u003c/a\u003eObama’s air strikes in Iraq in 2014, while \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/19/world/middleeast/senate-approves-isis-bill-avoiding-bigger-war-debate.html\"\u003eopposing \u003c/a\u003ehis plan to train and equip Syrian opposition forces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Warren adviser, who spoke under the condition of anonymity to engage in a broad-ranging discussion on the senator’s worldview, told me that Warren sees force as a last resort, and that when it is employed, she believes there should be an exit strategy, it should be limited, and it should be multilateral, preferably through the United Nations. It’s a position that sounds almost identical to Obama’s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe 44th president was also deeply skeptical of military interventions, but found himself drawn in. For instance, by 2014, Obama had pulled American troops out of Iraq and was holding fast against involvement in Syria. But the rise of ISIS, the beheading of hostages, and the fall of Mosul created a groundswell of public pressure to deal directly with the threat. It was a reminder that even a president skeptical of intervention is one terrorist attack away from getting involved. That dynamic will not change in 2021. A progressive president is unlikely to argue that the United States should be indifferent to an ISIS-style group in the Middle East that conquers territory or attacks Americans. Sanders’s track record suggests that he is more pragmatic than he lets on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is little doubt that Sanders and Warren are sincere in their desire to prioritize diplomacy over the use of force, but here, too, they have a dilemma: When it comes to preventing a rogue state from acquiring nuclear weapons, a credible threat to use force often creates the leverage necessary to get the other side to the table. In her book, Wendy Sherman writes about how the Obama administration deliberately deployed a bomb that could penetrate Iran’s underground enrichment facility, “backing up our diplomacy with the credible use of force.” Would Sanders and Warren do the same thing? If not, what’s their theory of building leverage? Matt Duss, who serves as Sanders’s foreign-policy adviser, told me that Sanders is “against large-scale military interventions or the threat of them, and would rely more on economic sanctions to create leverage for negotiations like those for the Iran nuclear deal.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second theme is that both of them draw a dramatic divide between democratic and authoritarian states. In a major address at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies, Sanders \u003ca href=\"https://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sanders-speech-at-sais-building-a-global-democratic-movement-to-counter-authoritarianism\"\u003esaid\u003c/a\u003e:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere is currently a struggle of enormous consequence taking place in the United States and throughout the world. In it, we see two competing visions. On one hand, we see a growing worldwide movement toward authoritarianism, oligarchy, and kleptocracy. On the other side, we see a movement toward strengthening democracy, egalitarianism, and economic, social, racial, and environmental justice. This struggle has consequences for the entire future of the planet—economically, socially, and environmentally.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSanders went on to identify the authoritarian movement as including Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro, Russia’s Vladimir Putin, Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu, Saudi Arabia’s Mohammed Bin Salman, and President Trump, whom Sanders sees as on the wrong side of the struggle between autocrats and democrats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn her Foreign Affairs essay, Warren \u003ca href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2018-11-29/foreign-policy-all\"\u003estruck \u003c/a\u003ea similar note:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eAuthoritarian governments are gaining power, and right-wing demagogues are gaining strength. Movements toward openness and pluralism have stalled. Inequality is growing, transforming rule by the people into rule by wealthy elites. And here in the United States, many Americans seem to accept—even embrace—the politics of division and resentment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWarren has focused more on China than Sanders, although Sanders intends to address China more in the coming months.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor both candidates, the democracy-versus-autocratic-oligarchs framing is a way to kill several birds with one stone. It allows them to talk about the global economy as a rigged system and to fight inequality. It is a way of getting tough with Russia and China. It allows them to stand up for democracy and human rights. Most important of all, it allows them to paint Trump as part of a global problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, democracy versus autocracy is not a radical departure from traditional Democratic foreign policy. Both Sanders and Warren essentially accept the diagnosis of more hawkish Democrats that the United States is locked in a geopolitical struggle with authoritarian regimes, but they depart significantly on the prescription—they would both slash the defense budget and switch the topic away from geopolitical rivalries and toward inequality, economic policy, and democracy. This sets up a fundamental contradiction: Sanders and Warren will be forced to choose between waging the struggle against autocrats and cutting the defense budget and deemphasizing military power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://warontherocks.com/2019/04/the-emergence-of-progressive-foreign-policy/\"\u003eWriting\u003c/a\u003e in War on the Rocks, a longtime adviser to Warren, Ganesh Sitaraman, argues that there is no such contradiction. “When progressives use hawkish language,” he says, “they are doing so with respect to economic challenges, not with an eye toward military buildups and war.” The Warren adviser I spoke with said that the senator is generally happy with America’s traditional strategic role in Europe through NATO, but that she would be taking a close look at the U.S. military footprint in the Asia Pacific. Economic competition would be Warren’s primary focus with regard to China. They went on to say, “It’s important to defend our systems and values; it is possible to engage in a robust defense of our system without ending up in a military conflict.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany Democrats believe that diplomatic and economic tools are more benign than and preferable to the deployment of troops and deterrence, so it is no surprise to see progressives embrace their use. But the reason Russia and China have a problem with the Western order has as much to do with soft power as with hard power. It is the prospect of color revolutions, fed by a free press, open information networks, anti-corruption measures, and the wide appeal of democratic ideas that scares Moscow and Beijing the most, not tanks in eastern Europe or aircraft carriers in the Pacific. Take the example of Hong Kong. China does not worry about Western military intervention. What it views as a threat are statements of support for the protesters—exactly of the kind that both \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/BernieSanders/status/1163437741389930501\"\u003eSanders \u003c/a\u003eand \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/ewarren/status/1160997167026376704?lang=en\"\u003eWarren \u003c/a\u003ehave issued. Even when it comes to hard power, China worries less about military interventions and more about the long-term balance of power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s nothing wrong with using these measures to counter Russian and Chinese influence. (I’ve written regularly in support of them.) However, it’s important we acknowledge that this is a competitive and tough policy that incurs risk. Sanders and Warren give the impression that they believe this choice is inherently more benign than the blob’s approach and they can opt out of military competition. In truth, escalating political warfare while pulling back militarily could create an incentive for America’s rivals to test the United States. Deterring geopolitical aggression—whether in the South China Sea or Ukraine—will become a precondition for managing and limiting tensions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Sanders or Warren is elected, they will find themselves confronted with these questions immediately. Indeed, some progressives and commentators worry about precisely that. For instance, Daniel Bessner of the University of Washington and Udi Greenberg of Dartmouth College recently \u003ca href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/foreign-policy-progressive-good-evil/\"\u003ewrote \u003c/a\u003ein The Nation, “For all their ingenuity, both candidates sometimes insist that this moment is defined by a battle between good and evil. In doing so, they frame geopolitics in simplistic terms that undermine the left’s long-term goals.” Bessner has argued for a more radical foreign-policy agenda for Democrats akin to that espoused by the Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOthers have argued that the Democrats are just offering up a new version of American hegemony. Janan Ganesh of the Financial Times \u003ca href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/us/democrats-still-cling-to-idea-of-us-as-a-redemptive-force-in-the-world-1.3931316\"\u003elambasted \u003c/a\u003eDemocrats for failing to question the assumptions of leadership, and argued that on foreign policy, they were “stranded in time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put this to Duss. He felt the critics were underplaying the extent of change on military intervention in the Middle East, as evidenced by Sanders’s work to stop the war in Yemen. He told me that when it comes to Europe and Asia, “there are no prebaked plans, but there is a willingness to ask fundamental questions, listen to new ideas, and to develop a new consensus.” “Very little is sacrosanct,” he said. He expressed the hope that organizations such as the Quincy Institute would inject the Washington debate with a new vigor. Duss did make the point that Sanders is not an old-style leftist. “Some leaders are hostile to the very idea of American power, but Senator Sanders is not one of those,” he said. “The question is when and how that power is deployed. American diplomacy, humanitarian and development aid are formidable tools, and he will work closely with allies to use those tools to create a more peaceful world.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo understand why Sanders, Warren, and other Democrats are unlikely to embrace a foreign policy of restraint, it is useful to look at restraint’s intellectual origins. No one has thought more deeply about how to implement a strategy of restraint than academic realists—the school of thought within foreign policy that defines national interests narrowly, sees the world in terms of power politics, and believes that the United States is massively overextended in the world. If you read the realists closely, it’s clear that they believe restraint is only possible if the United States takes radical action—actions at which almost all progressives would balk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s hard to do less while maintaining America’s alliances in Europe and Asia. The academic realists who developed the theories of restraint understood this. For instance, in his 2015 book, \u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00KNPMS2A/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8\u0026amp;btkr=1\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eRestraint\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, the MIT professor Barry Posen argues that the United States should withdraw from NATO. Progressives understand how toxic this is, which is why they have rejected it. But if presidents simply confine themselves to tough talk about how allies need to do more, they will be following the pattern set by Obama.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRealists also understand that one of the consequences of U.S. retrenchment is that former allies will get nuclear weapons. For the most part, realists are fine with that, publishing articles with titles such as “More Is Better.” Progressives tend to believe in arms control, and most would be horrified by the prospect of nuclear proliferation. But preventing nuclear proliferation means being serious about extended deterrence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRealists recognize that retrenchment means accepting that America’s rivals will acquire and expand their own spheres of influence. They don’t see it as a problem up until the point that rivals appear poised to dominate their entire region. Some progressives have come around to this idea. Writing in these pages, Peter \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/09/shield-of-the-republic-a-democratic-foreign-policy-for-the-trump-age/570010/\"\u003eBeinart\u003c/a\u003e argued that Sanders and other Democrats must accept that China is displacing the United States from part of Asia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpheres of influence are incompatible with Sanders’s and Warren’s description of a struggle between authoritarianism and democracy, but even laying that aside, the approach is fraught with risk. The lines of such spheres are unclear and would be subject to constant revision, often through the use or threat of use of force. If even China and Russia are entitled to their spheres, why not Japan, Britain, and Germany? And would the United States, particularly under a progressive president, seriously sit down with a Chinese or Russian leader and divide up the world over the objections of the smaller countries that would be served up?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIndeed, China’s rise has been so rapid that many realists are rethinking their previous support for restraint. Jennifer Lind, a professor at Dartmouth, told me:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe restraint school that emerged in the late 1990s counseled husbanding resources for the “main event” of a regional peer competitor. Sadly, no one listened to them; America’s power and position are weaker today as a result. But today we’re seeing an increasingly powerful and assertive China: grabbing resources, ignoring international law, militarizing the South China Sea. Its neighbors can’t or won’t balance. The question for the restraint school is: At what point does China become the main event—and how should U.S. policy change when it does?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor their part, progressives are also much more comfortable with ending the forever wars accommodating China’s rise. In January, a few months before he helped set up the Quincy Institute, \u003ca href=\"https://www.georgesoros.com/2019/01/24/remarks-delivered-at-the-world-economic-forum-2/\"\u003eSoros \u003c/a\u003egave an impassioned speech at Davos warning of “the mortal danger facing open societies from the instruments of control that machine learning and artificial intelligence can put in the hands of repressive regimes.” Soros called Xi Jinping “the most dangerous opponent of those who believe in the concept of open society.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrue restraint—whereby the United States significantly reduces its military commitments overseas—will be all but impossible for a Democratic president to achieve in a deliberate and orderly fashion. It would involve too many compromises of core principles. Progressive presidents will not want to pursue the destruction of the alliance system, acquiesce in nuclear proliferation, or embrace the imperialist notion of spheres of influence. They will be unable and unwilling to promise credibly never to intervene militarily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is possible that Sanders and Warren find themselves stuck between the mainstream national-security worldview they have articulated and their aspirations to opt out of geopolitical competition and military interventions. This could hobble the early years of their administration. Alternatively, they could embrace a practical and modest progressive approach. This would seek to pull back from the Middle East, keep the basic structure of America’s role in Europe and Asia intact while modernizing the military, sharpen the ideological divide with authoritarian states, and endeavor to change the world on specific issues, much as Obama did by opening up relations with Cuba, prioritizing climate change, and playing a constructive role in international institutions. In this, much of the blob would agree. If Warren or Sanders emerges as the nominee, there will undoubtedly be tensions and disagreements with the Democratic foreign-policy establishment, but this type of practical progressivism may form the basis for a rapprochement and an avoidance of the kind of schism Trump brought to Republican foreign policy.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2019/09/13/the-problem-at-the-core-of-progressive-foreign-policy/","published":"2019-09-13T13:45:54Z","guid":"https://www.brookings.edu/?p=611694"},{"title":"Bolton’s departure signals Trump’s foreign-policy pivot","content":"\u003cp\u003eBy Thomas Wright\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJohn Bolton’s sudden departure from the Trump administration was inevitable. It had nothing to do with his fabled mustache or even his very real personality clash with the president. It was a matter of principle. Trump wants to write a new chapter, closing the one marked “Militarism and Maximum Pressure” and opening one called “Dealmaking and the Pursuit of the Nobel Peace Prize.” He wants a summit with Iran’s leaders and deals with the Taliban, Kim Jong Un, and Vladimir Putin on arms control. He does not care about most of the details, as long as he gets the credit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFew of his officials are particularly enthusiastic about this pivot, but led by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, they accept it and will seek to shape it. Bolton did not accept it—with the exception of Russia, where he was playing a constructive role in advancing Trump’s goals—and played the role of a saboteur. This tension has been clear for several months, but with Bolton keen to hang on and Trump famously averse to personal confrontation, it dragged on over the summer. With a Trump summit with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani now imminent, it could not drag on much longer. And earlier this week, it came to an end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI talked with several current or former Trump-administration officials for this piece, all of whom spoke under condition of anonymity to freely discuss Trump’s foreign policy after Bolton. These officials had different views of Bolton. Some saw him as brilliant and a surprisingly good diplomat who fell down on issues such as Iran, Cuba, and Venezuela, where he took a particularly hard line. Others were less forgiving, and argued that Bolton had failed to work well with other senior officials to advance Trump’s strategy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut all agreed that the Trump pivot is real. We are entering into a new phase. Trump has always had two images of himself on national-security issues—as a militarist and as a dealmaker. As he nears the election, he hopes to move from the former to the latter, spending the capital he built up as a hard-liner, and wrong-footing his Democratic opponents. Ever since he got rid of the axis of adults, he has sought to remove the institutional constraints on his decision making, allowing him maximum room to maneuver in line with his instincts and core beliefs, which date back more than three decades.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough Trump has fired Bolton, he is not wholly rid of him. Everyone has been waiting for a centrist—Jim Mattis, H. R. McMaster, or Gary Cohn—to turn against the president, but they have stayed silent. Ironically, Bolton is now poised to walk through that door. He tweeted 12 minutes after Trump, contradicting the president’s account of his departure. He answered his door to reporters and texted with them, \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/costareports/status/1171459982102917126\"\u003etelling \u003c/a\u003eone “I will have my say in due course. But I have given you the facts on the resignation. My sole concern is US national security.” Earlier today, Bloomberg \u003ca href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-11/trump-rouhani-meeting-odds-improve-after-john-bolton-s-exit\"\u003ereported \u003c/a\u003ethat Trump and Bolton disagreed over whether to lift sanctions on Iran to help facilitate a meeting with President Rouhani at the United Nations General Assembly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Bolton does speak out, it will grow harder for the so-called hawks in Congress to turn a blind eye to criticism from centrists, and to continue to support Trump unconditionally. This is particularly true given that Bolton’s critique of Trump concerns Iran, an issue about which they care passionately. It is not far-fetched to imagine Trump meeting Rouhani with Bolton criticizing the summit live on cable news. Trump will likely react as is his wont—with full-scale attacks on Bolton personally, and on anyone who associates with him. The result could be a new Republican divide on foreign policy, with the challenge coming from the right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrump, of course, will have his supporters on the subject. As one official told me: “Trump is right in his orientation. We need to focus first on China. So, ultimately, we do need to get to a different place with the Russians. The more distracted we are by North Korea, the better for Beijing. And we need to get out of Afghanistan or really reduce our role there.” But many Republican foreign-policy experts remain unconvinced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe international repercussions of this diplomatic pivot will be profound, particularly because it will be carried out with Trumpian characteristics—with little formal preparation, a focus on summits, and an eye on the politics. Martin Indyk, who served in several senior positions in the Clinton and Obama administrations, \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/Martin_Indyk/status/1171734200585805824\"\u003eposed \u003c/a\u003esome interesting questions on Twitter: “What do Kim, Rouhani, Xi and the Taliban conclude about Trump’s need for deals with them? And what do Bibi and MBS do as the limb they’re on gets sawn off?” he asked, referring to the Israeli and Saudi leaders. These are the right questions to ask. Absent an external crisis, Trump’s diplomatic pivot will define world politics for the next year, and it has a dynamic of its own. In particular, it puts America’s rivals in pole position. They know that Trump needs his talks not to fail, and they hope he will make concessions to keep them afloat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJung Pak, my colleague at the Brookings Institution and formerly an analyst at the CIA, told me, “Kim Jong Un perceives he is in a position of strength going into 2020, and the closer we get to the election, the weaker Trump will be and the more he will want to deal. Trump is so invested in a win with North Korea that all Kim has to do is whisper quietly that he is thinking about breaking the Singapore promises to secure concessions from the United States.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIran may be in an even stronger position. It could allow the talks to gather pace and then weaponize its diplomacy with Trump as the election approaches. Russia is in a slightly different category, because Putin likely wants Trump to win reelection. Putin could capitalize on an arms-control agreement to smooth his reentry into the G8 and have some sanctions lifted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman will be left to stew in their own juices. They only have themselves to blame. They cheered Trump leaving the Iran nuclear deal, but erred in believing they could control the fallout. Trump did what they wanted at the beginning, but he was always unlikely to use force, making diplomacy a more likely outcome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrump’s most immediate challenge is picking Bolton’s replacement. More than a dozen names are \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/ZcohenCNN/status/1171525757002080257\"\u003efloating \u003c/a\u003earound Washington. If he is true to past form, Trump will revel in the drama and have a parade of candidates interview with him. However, he ultimately has a choice to make—does he go with a personal advocate who will fight for him, or does he go with a seasoned professional?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe may be tempted to go with an advocate like Richard Grenell, the U.S. ambassador to Germany. Grenell is often regarded as a Bolton ally because he served as his spokesman when Bolton was ambassador to the United Nations. But Bolton and Grenell have not been on particularly good terms for the past 18 months. Grenell has been gunning for Bolton’s job from the beginning, frequently using his connections to Trump’s family, particularly Donald Jr., to advance his case. Those ties were in evidence in a tweet by the president’s son in March, when he called for the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine to be fired. He wrote: “We need more @richardgrenell’s and less of these jokers as ambassadors.” Grenell is in Washington this week, having arrived extra early for the UN General Assembly, and will have \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/mawilner/status/1171852179088560133\"\u003edinner \u003c/a\u003ewith Trump on Saturday night—several observers I spoke with believe he is actively angling for the job. Donald Jr.’s support and Grenell’s own tensions with Bolton may work in his favor, but he has other problems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrump has no time for bureaucracy or process, but he is tired of the infighting among his staff. He does not care much for the interagency process, but he does understand that if he is to succeed in his pivot, he needs his team to meet a minimum level of cooperation. Grenell would make the combative Anthony Scaramucci look like Mahatma Gandhi. He clashed repeatedly with other administration officials and with other U.S. ambassadors in Europe. Many National Security Council staffers have made clear they would leave if he was appointed. And Grenell has a strained relationship with Pompeo, including a very public \u003ca href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/trump-admin-tells-u-s-embassies-they-can-t-fly-n1015236\"\u003edisagreement \u003c/a\u003eabout whether he could fly the rainbow flag over the U.S. embassy in Germany on Pride Day. Under Grenell, an implosion of what’s left of the National Security Council process seems likely. Ultimately, it is hard to imagine Trump staking the success of his pivot on Grenell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he passes on Grenell but still wants an advocate, he could opt for retired Colonel Douglas Macgregor, who regularly appears on Tucker Carlson’s show on Fox News. Macgregor always strikes a Trumpian tone and has endorsed the president’s views on Syria and Russia. Trump has consulted with Macgregor on national-security matters, including when he canceled the planned missile strikes on Iran in June. However, Macgregor poses one of the same problems as Grenell—he may not actually be able to deliver the diplomatic pivot and he would be seen as a disastrous appointee by the Republican foreign-policy establishment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Trump decides to go for a serious professional who follows his lead and works well with Pompeo, he has several options. The top two may be Steve Biegun, the president’s special envoy for North Korea, and Rob Blair, who serves as Mick Mulvaney’s national security adviser. Both are well regarded by their colleagues, but have less of a relationship with Trump. Robert O’Brien, who currently serves as the U.S. special envoy for hostage affairs, is said to have the backing of Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and several other influential figures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrian Hook, the U.S. envoy for Iran, has also been mentioned, and is close to Pompeo. He is well regarded by Republicans, although some worry that his focus on Iran and the Middle East may detract from Asia and Europe. He could also enter the frame if Pompeo were to follow the lead of Henry Kissinger, and take on the dual role of secretary of state and national security adviser. Pompeo will be wary of this option. He has the Goldilocks level of access to Trump at the moment—enough to always matter, but not so much that he gets under Trump’s skin. But if he fears the wrong person being tapped for the job, he may try to take it on himself, delegating much of the day-to-day responsibility to a deputy like Hook.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegardless of whom he chooses, Trump is in control. He is calling the shots. Those who survive, like Pompeo, do so because they accept this. Newcomers like Mark Esper are learning the same lesson—he recently raided funds assigned for the U.S. military to counter Russia in Europe to pay for the wall on the southern border. The next national security adviser will have to make similar compromises with his own principles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany people will undoubtedly breathe a sigh of relief that Trump is embracing diplomacy, but with Trump, things are never that simple or straightforward. His focus on the political benefits of negotiation and his egomaniacal desire to be seen as a dealmaker extraordinaire could undo his project, bringing about the very crises he hopes to avoid.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2019/09/13/boltons-departure-signals-trumps-foreign-policy-pivot/","published":"2019-09-13T13:30:39Z","guid":"https://www.brookings.edu/?p=611698"}]},{"url":"https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/world/rss","items":[]},{"url":"https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/world/feed","items":[{"title":"Tropical Storm Warning Issued for Northern Bahamas, Same Area Devastated by Dorian","content":"","url":"http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/world/2019/september/tropical-storm-warning-issued-for-northern-bahamas-same-area-devastated-by-dorian","published":"2019-09-13T13:55:02Z","guid":"http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/world/2019/september/tropical-storm-warning-issued-for-northern-bahamas-same-area-devastated-by-dorian"}]},{"url":"https://www.pri.org/stories/feed/everything","items":[]},{"url":"https://rss.csmonitor.com/feeds/world","items":[{"title":"The Islamist who would be president","content":"","url":"https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2019/0913/The-Islamist-who-would-be-president","published":"2019-09-13T15:23:01Z","guid":"732b5568d69af4398b24a7de7750396a"},{"title":"To annex or not to annex?
