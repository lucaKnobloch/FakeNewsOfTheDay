The move late Friday deflated tensions with Mexico and, as far as Canada is concerned, clears a path for the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement to move forward, Canadian Finance Minister Bill Morneau said Sunday on Bloomberg TV.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat leaves House Democrats as the last major stakeholders still to get on board. Speaker Nancy Pelosi's decision on when (and whether) the deal will get a vote depends on talks with the Trump administration to address Democrats' concerns, according to a senior Democratic aide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We're not ready,'' Representative Debbie Dingell, a Michigan Democrat, said Sunday on Fox News. \"The votes in the House are not there yet until these changes take place.''\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring last week's uncertainty over trade with Mexico, most Democrats publicly separated USMCA deliberations from Trump's tariff plan, which means that removing the tariff threat doesn't necessarily clear the way for a new deal to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement.

Louisiana Representative Steve Scalise, a top member of GOP leadership, renewed that call Friday after Trump said he won't impose tariffs on Mexico, lauding the breakthrough that \"puts us in a better position to make USMCA a reality.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lawmaker working groups that Pelosi appointed to negotiate with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer are beginning to drill down on the details of how to resolve Democrats' outstanding issues, according to the aide, who asked not to be named when talking about internal discussions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePelosi has repeatedly said that her members \"want to get to yes,\" but only if the agreement resolves their doubts.

Trump's position sets him apart from free-trade Republicans, and it also creates a dilemma for 2020 Democratic candidates. Democrats traditionally have been more skeptical than Republicans when it comes to free trade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe 2020 presidential race also squeezes the timing for a vote on the bill to implement the USMCA. Lawmakers of both parties have warned that passing such a deal will be politically tricky in an election year. That means the best chance for a vote would be before Congress recesses in August to avoid typical end-of-the-year budget fights, according to North Carolina Representative Mark Meadows, a close Trump ally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hopefully, we can get together and make sure that happens in the latter part of July,'' Meadows said on Fox News's \"Sunday Morning Futures.''\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven amid rising tensions from Trump's tariff threat, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has reaffirmed his support for the new Nafta deal. Its prospects in Mexico's Congress are good, given the support of Lopez Obrador, whose party controls the nation's legislative branch. Major opposition parties also want it to be enacted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNonetheless, the tariff confrontation may have created lasting damage to ties between the two countries. Republicans previously pleaded with Trump to remove steel and aluminum tariffs on Canada and Mexico, and they've publicly worried about the lasting impact of changes to global commerce as a result of Trump's multi-front trade wars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as Trump retains some bipartisan support for taking a hard stance against Chinese trade practices, few lawmakers wanted him to rip up the accord with Mexico and Canada without a replacement.

You may remember that last summer media mogul Jeffrey Katzenberg and former eBay and HP CEO Meg Whitman announced they had raised $1 billion in funding to create high-quality content for a mobile audience. Quibi is the name of the duo's short-form video venture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDetails around the company have been sparse, but \u003ca href=\"https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/quibi-jeffrey-katzenberg-meg-whitman-produced-by-1203236854/\"\u003ewe learned more at the Produced By conference on Saturday\u003c/a\u003e. Several things to know:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[ts_bullet_primary] The startup has already raised $1 billion from investors, and there are plans to raise \"about half that\" again either this fall or next spring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[ts_bullet_primary] The company currently has projects in the works from A-listers like Guillermo del Toro, Antoine Fuqua, and Sam Raimi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[ts_bullet_primary] Each series is expected to be two to four hours in length, with each one divided into segments that will last no longer than 10 minutes each.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[ts_bullet_primary] The service will have two pricing tiers at launch on April 6, 2020. The first will cost $4.99 with one pre-roll ad before each video segment. The second option will be ad-free and cost $7.99.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I've noted before, mobile streaming is hardly a new concept. People have been consuming short-form videos on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and Snapchat for a pretty long time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdditionally, let's not forget when Verizon tried something similar in 2015. Verizon debuted its mobile video service Go90 in hopes of capturing a younger demographic that had ditched traditional TV in favor of watching videos on their phones. Verizon invested as much as $200 million early on to make Go90 work. But Go90 ultimately shut down after the service failed to gain traction with the public.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs \u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/longform/katzenberg-whitman-hollywood-mobile-streaming-quibi/\"\u003ea \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e feature from January notes,\u003c/a\u003e if Quibi can't sign up customers who are willing to pay for a subscription, its clever approaches to content creation won't really matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If they don't get the subscribers, and the cards are stacked against them getting subscribers, your series won't be a hit, and who's going to want to buy it?\" wonders Dan Rayburn, who tracks streaming media for the consultancy Frost \u0026amp; Sullivan. \"You don't see people clamoring to rebroadcast stuff from go90,\" he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI'm personally not convinced of the model (and I fall right in their target demographic, which is users who are 25 to 35 years old). I use Facebook and Instagram regularly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo I watch short-video content on Facebook Watch, Instagram TV, or Snap Originals?

Tail Tag plops a cute tail on half the competitors and the ability to snag a tail off others if you don\u0026#8217;t have one \u0026#8212; only those with a tail as the timer runs out move on.

The Mediatonic team and our friends at Devolver Digital are excited to announce that \u003ca href=\"https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/fall-guys-ultimate-knockout-ps4/?smcid=pssocial:blog:game:fall_guys_bounces_and_bumbles_to_ps4_in_2020:6_9_19\" aria-hidden=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eFall Guys\u003c/a\u003e will launch as a console exclusive on PlayStation 4 early next year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that we’ve established that we should probably tell you what the heck Fall Guys is and why we think you’ll love it. Fall Guys is sort of a dream game for our studio that combines the slapstick-hilarity of obstacle course television shows like Takeshi’s Castle with the mass-multiplayer competitive feel of a modern battle royale game \u0026#8212; just with more falling over things, and into things, and into each other. Because physics. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlayers will enter a Fall Guys match with up to 99 other competitors online in a mad dash through five uniquely selected rounds of escalating chaos until one victor remains. Each round will have a set number of competitors that can qualify to move onto the next, in the final round the successful (or just plain lucky) handful of remaining Fall Guys battle it out for the top prize. Winners are rewarded handsomely with new ways to customize their character while the others are left to wallow in embarrassment and best-spectacular-failure replays.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are dozens of possible courses and challenges that can be arranged to make a five-round match. Door Dash is a straight up race through a series of walls with multiple doors to slam into and hope your first choice allows you to crash through. Tail Tag plops a cute tail on half the competitors and the ability to snag a tail off others if you don’t have one \u0026#8212; only those with a tail as the timer runs out move on. Fall Mountain is a frantic rush up the titular mountain where Fall Guys must dodge and weave through traps, obstacles and descending boulders on the way to the top. But it’s not always every Fall Guy for themselves, some rounds will force players to work together, even briefly, to reach a common goal together and move on. You never know what’s coming, ensuring every game will play out very differently from the last!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur team is thrilled to finally reveal Fall Guys and are excited about building a community around this ambitious game! We have lots more to share in the future \u0026#8212; prepare for your inevitable failure in front of the whole world!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/PSBlog/~4/ji-qE9hBQKM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/PSBlog/~3/ji-qE9hBQKM/","published":"2019-06-10T02:10:16Z","guid":"https://blog.us.playstation.com/?p=212387"},{"title":"Final Fantasy VII Remake Arrives on PS4 March 3, 2020","content":"\u003cp\u003eTetsuya Nomura (Director, FFVII Remake) and Yoshinori Kitase (Producer, FFVII Remake) delighted fans in person at the Final Fantasy VII: A Symphonic Reunion concert this evening when they announced Final Fantasy VII Remake will be coming to PS4 worldwide on March 3, 2020.

Players barrel their way through each heart-racing encounter by mastering a deadly combination of skill, raw firepower, and fast movement. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo keep obliterating your enemies, aggressive resource management is key. If you need something, charge into combat and take it from the demons.  Use the all-new shoulder-mounted Flame Belch to burn demons for armor. To replenish health, use firepower to stagger a demon and move in for a brutal Glory Kill, and cut demons in half with your trusty Chainsaw to refill your ammunition.      \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour demon-crushing skills will be put to the test by lethal new foes like the Tyrant – a hulking class of demon whose imposing height and deadly design call back the formidable boss from the original 1993 Doom and cover star of Doom II \u0026#8211; the Cyberdemon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48034179272_1630cbcd80_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48034179272_fd9c3df2f6_b.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Doom Eternal\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThankfully, the Slayer came prepared for the new demonic threat.

And yet I am struck by how pristinely iterative this game feels—a perfect execution of the cheesy poster quote, \"If you liked \u003ca href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/05/doom-2016-single-player-review-back-to-basics/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eDOOM\u003c/em\u003e 2016\u003c/a\u003e, you'll love \u003cem\u003eDOOM Eternal\u003c/em\u003e.\" By carrying familiar elements forward and then supercharging them with compelling twists, \u003cem\u003eDOOM Eternal\u003c/em\u003e (launching November 22 on Windows 10, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and Google Stadia) could very well rank alongside past elite sequels like \u003cem\u003eSuper Mario Bros. 3\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eUncharted 2\u003c/em\u003e, and \u003cem\u003eBurnout 3: Takedown\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eFamiliar demons, meet new flamethrower\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI mention those specific sequels because they each returned to unsurprising gameplay mechanics and art styles, only polished like crazy and met with a zillion new features that all somehow fit. \u003cem\u003eDOOM Eternal\u003c/em\u003e sits in that category, so much so that a peek at its supercharged screenshots might elicit a mix of \"ooh, crazy demons\" and \"uh, haven't we seen this before?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1516919#p3\"\u003eRead 21 remaining paragraphs\u003c/a\u003e | \u003ca href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1516919\u0026comments=1\"\u003eComments\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"feedflare\"\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?a=vWzOyeH_YLw:2_LG0rr0zCI:V_sGLiPBpWU\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?i=vWzOyeH_YLw:2_LG0rr0zCI:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?a=vWzOyeH_YLw:2_LG0rr0zCI:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?i=vWzOyeH_YLw:2_LG0rr0zCI:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?a=vWzOyeH_YLw:2_LG0rr0zCI:qj6IDK7rITs\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?a=vWzOyeH_YLw:2_LG0rr0zCI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","url":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1516919","published":"2019-06-10T01:50:23Z","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1516919"},{"title":"Bethesda says its Orion tech can make all cloud gaming better, faster","content":"\u003cdiv id=\"rss-wrap\"\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ca name=\"page-1\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"image shortcode-img right medium\"\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-06-09-at-9.31.40-PM.png\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"It's \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;Doom\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;, only streamed more efficiently to your phone thanks to Orion.\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-06-09-at-9.31.40-PM-300x154.png\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-06-09-at-9.31.40-PM.png 2x\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-06-09-at-9.31.40-PM.png\" class=\"caption-link\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eIt's \u003cem\u003eDoom\u003c/em\u003e, only streamed more efficiently to your phone thanks to Orion.\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003eLOS ANGELES—Bethesda Softworks announced Sunday that it is getting involved in the increasingly competitive field of cloud gaming. But rather than announcing a service to compete with the likes of \u003ca href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/06/google-stadia-requires-130-upfront-10-per-month-at-november-launch/\"\u003eGoogle Stadia\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/10/microsoft-announces-project-xcloud-xbox-game-streaming-for-myriad-devices/\"\u003eMicrosoft's Project Xcloud\u003c/a\u003e, Bethesda's Orion system is focused to improving streaming performance on those or any other cloud platforms.\n\u003cp\u003eWhile most cloud gaming efforts try to improve performance by throwing hardware at the problem—often in the form of prime data center locations loaded with high-end servers—Bethesda says Orion is instead incorporated \"at the game engine level.\" The result of what Bethesda calls \"years of research and development,\" the company says its group of patented Orion technologies can optimize frame rendering time by approximately 20 percent per frame. Improved compression also leads to streams that require 40 percent lower bandwidth for the same quality, reducing the potential costs for both users and streaming services, Bethesda said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt a pre-E3 demonstration \u003ca href=\"https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-06-09-bethesda-unveils-orion-game-streaming-tech\"\u003eattended by GamesIndustry.biz\u003c/a\u003e, the 2016 edition of \u003cem\u003eDoom\u003c/em\u003e running on a MacBook went from 7 ms of combined GPU rendering and encoding time to 5.3 ms. That may not sound like much, but when it comes to increasing streaming quality and reducing apparent latency, every little bit helps. Average bandwidth usage in a 10-minute gameplay test reportedly dropped from 23.43 Mbps to 13.67 Mbps at the demo, while GPU utilization on the server side dropped from a high of 64 percent to a low of 55 percent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1519267#p3\"\u003eRead 1 remaining paragraphs\u003c/a\u003e | \u003ca href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1519267\u0026comments=1\"\u003eComments\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"feedflare\"\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?a=Syz2pbN82d8:MgJJMA1gtz4:V_sGLiPBpWU\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?i=Syz2pbN82d8:MgJJMA1gtz4:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?a=Syz2pbN82d8:MgJJMA1gtz4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?i=Syz2pbN82d8:MgJJMA1gtz4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?a=Syz2pbN82d8:MgJJMA1gtz4:qj6IDK7rITs\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?a=Syz2pbN82d8:MgJJMA1gtz4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/gaming?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","url":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1519267","published":"2019-06-10T04:35:10Z","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1519267"}]},{"url":"https://www.indiegames.com/atom.xml","items":[{"title":"Top 10 Games of BitSummit 7 Spirits: ‘Untitled Goose Game’","content":"\u003cp\u003eSnatching sandwiches and throwing rakes into a river.

You\u0026#8217;re a goose who can grab stuff, dragging it or using it as you like. Maybe you want to turn on the sprinkler. Haul produce around. Carry a little radio. However you want to accomplish your mission is fine. Also, you have a dedicated honk button. What\u0026#8217;s the point of being a goose if you\u0026#8217;re not honking at folks?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe open world of the initial map offered a lot of freedom to see how things were all connected. If you snatched the radio, the farmer would follow the sound of it and take it back. If you turned on the sprinkler, the farmer would find the source of the water and shut it off. It felt like you were looking to set off chain reactions of events through your actions, carefully seeing how you could affect your environment and the characters based on your actions. There was a lot to discover simply by playing around with things, adding some interesting exploration to the game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-25245\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/indiegamesplus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/untitled-goose-game-3.jpg?resize=640%2C360\u0026#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/indiegamesplus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/untitled-goose-game-3.jpg?w=740\u0026amp;ssl=1 740w, https://i1.wp.com/indiegamesplus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/untitled-goose-game-3.jpg?resize=150%2C84\u0026amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/indiegamesplus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/untitled-goose-game-3.jpg?resize=300%2C169\u0026amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a blast to see how these systems connected in intuitive ways as well. Stealing veggies would get the farmer to chase you. Still, you could use that distract him while you snatched his keys. While stealth games can often offer complicated tools that allow you to skulk around your pursuers, simply being able to steal things and honk had multiple uses that would baffle your targets. It all felt quite natural, the game steadily teaching you how to be cunning as a trouble-making goose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this way, Untitled\u003cem\u003e Goose Game\u003c/em\u003e was extremely approachable now matter how much experience you\u0026#8217;ve had with games. It was simple to pick up, with only a few abilities to play around with, yet the map would hide so much interactivity and play using those simple powers. It was easy to become a sneaky goose, and the humor of watching the farmer\u0026#8217;s troubles with your actions made for a silly, wonderful time.

Post-Brexit Paradox of ‘Global Britain’","content":"\u003cp\u003eLONDON—Brexit is an all-consuming maelstrom of political dysfunction, one that has compelled Britain’s eyes inward. Yet amid the chaos, Prime Minister Theresa May has been steadfast in her determination that the country’s international role should not succumb to the same myopic fate as its departure from the European Union has.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the febrile early months following the June 2016 referendum when Britain voted to leave the EU, its allies were fearful that the vote would see the country’s drawbridges snapping upward. Sensing the urgent need for optimism, May and her then–foreign secretary (and now possible successor), Boris Johnson, gave bold speeches, setting out ambitions for what they \u003ca href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/av/uk-politics-37535867/theresa-may-calls-for-truly-global-britain\"\u003ecalled\u003c/a\u003e a “truly global Britain.” Conjuring an image of a triumphant, swashbuckling nation retaking its rightful place on the world stage, a global Britain embodies the promise of a Brexit dividend, one in which the country is no longer hemmed in by what Brexiteers see as a European cage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlmost three years on—through failed parliamentary votes, cabinet resignations, and May’s announcement that she will step down as prime minister—this mantra of internationalism remains one of the few legacies of May’s premiership. So far, however, a global Britain has been nothing more than a hollow promise.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith British diplomats struggling to convince their international peers of the phrase’s fundamental purpose and meaning, a cross-party group of lawmakers leading the parliamentary Foreign Affairs Select Committee \u003ca href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/12/foreign-office-policy-of-global-britain-is-superficial-rebranding\"\u003ewarned\u003c/a\u003e last year that “Global Britain” had only succeeded thus far as “a superficial rebranding exercise.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt the heart of the global Britain promise is a great paradox: Those who are most naturally inclined to support such an idea—young, university-educated, well-traveled Britons—fundamentally resent the notion that any project forged on the back of Brexit could be truly internationalist.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eForeign policy has often served only as a sideshow to British domestic politics. However, with Brexit sparking complex new conversations about trade, diplomacy, and defense policy—as well as more elemental questions about Britain’s role in the world—foreign affairs may well become one of the most active battlegrounds of Britain’s deepening social fault lines.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd with about a dozen contenders lining up to replace May as Britain’s prime minister, the future of the ”global Britain” catchphrase and the strategy it was intended to inspire will become central to the Conservative Party’s, and the country’s, future. False silos that have long separated domestic and foreign policy will have to come down.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2019/05/who-will-be-britains-next-prime-minister-cheat-sheet/590518/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: The race to replace Theresa May: a cheat sheet\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Foreign policy isn’t about foreigners,” Tom Tugendhat, a Conservative member of Parliament and the chair of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, told me. “It’s about us, and how we shape the world around us in the interest of our people, our friends and partners.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt won’t be easy: New research I have conducted with the British Foreign Policy Group, an educational think tank, and the pollster BMG makes clear that Britain is phenomenally divided on the country’s international identity, spearheaded by a government unable to make the trade-offs necessary to truly achieve the idea of a global Britain. The notion that citizens will instinctively support the costs necessary to become a more prominent military, diplomatic, and trading power does not stand.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePolitical momentum is instead building behind those who see more downsides than upsides in our changing world, and for whom liberalism and internationalism inspire suspicion, mistrust, or even fear. These Britons generally have lived less mobile lives, hold identities more closely rooted in their communities, and are less bothered by events outside the confines of the nation. For example, just 6 percent of those who traveled abroad frequently last year consider immigration to be an important issue, compared with 44 percent of those who didn’t leave Britain. Among those who never stray abroad, there is, to be sure, a significant degree of distinction between people whose socioeconomic circumstances have hampered their access to international opportunities and the older, wealthier Britons who have chosen to prioritize an exclusive national identity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2019/04/brexit-inevitable-britain-europe/586888/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: The EU’s one-sided love affair with Britain\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMay herself supported remaining in the EU ahead of the 2016 referendum. But after the vote, while many of her colleagues in the Conservative Party espoused a so-called Liberal Leave argument—that Brexit would allow Britain to secure new free trade deals and to better work with fast-growing developing countries—she recognized the role that concerns about the economic and social consequences of globalization had played during the referendum. At the first Conservative Party conference following the vote, she spoke to the growing reticence toward internationalism and the clamor for a strong expression of national pride, \u003ca href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/how-britain-made-me-a-citizen-of-nowhere/\"\u003etelling\u003c/a\u003e the audience, “If you believe you are a citizen of the world, you are a citizen of nowhere.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis extraordinary moment broke with 20 years of political consensus behind a form of loose cosmopolitanism, beginning with Tony Blair’s election victory in 1997, signifying the radical early ambitions of May’s premiership. It also pitted her government’s two core messages against each other—at once pushing for a global Britain while denouncing globalism. Ultimately, her efforts to promote a global Britain without the support of global citizens were always doomed to fail.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn a divided Brexit Britain, only one issue provides space for common ground: trade. Those who voted to leave the EU and those who cast ballots to remain differ on many issues—only a quarter of Leave voters support increases to Britain’s overseas spending, and Remain supporters are twice as likely to care about climate change and global conflicts—but all agree that trade should be at the heart of the country’s global priorities.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlthough Matthew Elliott, who led the Vote Leave campaign, recognizes that the “liberal, internationalist, free-trading” argument for Brexit was not the primary driving force for core Leave voters, he told me he was certain that it was decisive in persuading swing voters. In this way, the Leave campaign was incredibly effective at mustering diverse constituencies to support the vision of a sovereign, global Britain, unshackled from the EU.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNonetheless, there is little appetite to stomach the compromises of free trade: Only 26 percent of Leave voters we surveyed would be willing to accept any increases in immigration from, for example, India, one of Britain’s priority markets—even if they were crucial to securing a free-trade agreement.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt can be difficult to reconcile the pulsating tribalism of post-referendum Britain with the immense popularity of the flagrant internationalism promoted by the successive Blair governments. At the 2005 Labour Party Conference in Brighton, the then–prime minister forcefully rebuked the growing disquiet around globalization, \u003ca href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/sep/27/labourconference.speeches\"\u003eannouncing\u003c/a\u003e, “You might as well debate whether autumn should follow summer”.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2019/03/britain-europe-brexit-distrust/585181/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: Britain’s distrust of Europe helped cause Brexit. Now it could stop it.\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBlair’s political fortunes were not evergreen, though. His decisions on economic policy, immigration, and the Iraq War would crucially challenge the public’s trust in an increasingly connected world order and the institutions that seek to uphold it. As Britons cast ballots more than a decade later in the EU referendum, voters had begun to reject the sense of inevitability they had been sold around the nation’s trajectory. Indeed, by 2016, Blair would launch his own policy institute in London, its mission—“Making globalisation work for the many”—hinting at a degree of regret.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWestminster will undoubtedly continue to debate Blair’s legacy for many years to come. It is clear, however, that no other leader in this political generation is likely to inherit the fortuitous climate for internationalism that he enjoyed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith the clock ticking on May’s premiership, the paradox of a global Britain she unwittingly exposed will need to be reconciled by her successor. The candidates jostling to replace her as the Conservative Party leader and, by extension, prime minister, appear committed to championing a global Britain, but have not yet articulated any means of persuading the large swaths of the country skeptical of internationalism to fall in line.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf her successor calls for a general election and the opposition Labour Party comes to power, it will face its own reckoning around the discord between its membership’s broad support for international institutions and its leadership’s radical positions on unilateral nuclear disarmament, NATO, and the military.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor now, however, the challenge falls to the party that has made itself the party of Brexit and a global Britain, without delivering either.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/sB_3eGqwAn4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/sB_3eGqwAn4/","published":"2019-06-10T05:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-591244"},{"title":"Democrats by the Dozen in Iowa","content":"\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eCEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa—When Winston Churchill said democracy was \u003ca href=\"https://winstonchurchill.org/resources/quotes/the-worst-form-of-government/\"\u003e“the worst form of government except for all those other forms,”\u003c/a\u003e he did not foresee the tailgate party that descended on northwest Iowa Sunday morning.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eFormer Texas Representative Beto O’Rourke’s campaign rented a taco truck and dished out free chorizo.

The goal of the “dinner” was to puff up some big donors and activists as the 2020 campaign cycle enters the summer months. The Iowa caucuses, the idiosyncratic but overwhelmingly consequential presidential primary, are eight months away. The caucuses, themselves, are pretty ridiculous: Iowans gather in nearly 1,700 church basements, high school gyms, community centers and the like, huddling and re-huddling until a winner is decided. That person has a pretty good shot of becoming the party’s nominee, and in many cases, the president. This is the state that propelled Barack Obama to the White House in 2008, and where Sanders’s surge was first apparent four years ago. But it’s also the state where the past few Republican winners have more or less peaked: Mike Huckabee (2008), Rick Santorum (2012) and Ted Cruz (2016).  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe Iowa Dems invited almost every candidate in the massive field to attend Sunday’s event, and 19 said yes, with the exception of former vice president—and current frontrunner—Joe Biden and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro.

But everyone else showed up, each with his or her own walk-on music: ELO’s “Mr. Blue Sky” for Washington Governor Jay Inslee, Lizzo’s “Good As Hell” for New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, John Mellencamp’s “Small Town” for Montana Governor Steve Bullock.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eMost of the candidates’s speeches were underwhelming. They touched on their biographies, their voting records, and what they hope to achieve as president.

There’s not much a candidate can do with five minutes—a brief introduction, maybe an applause line or two. The audience heard many digs at President Donald Trump. “We now expect more out of our preschoolers than we do out of the president of the United States,” Bullock said.

These conservatives claimed that theological liberalism had taken root in the denomination’s seminaries and agencies and was taking the group down the path of heresy. Seminary professors were openly questioning the historical accuracy of some of the Bible’s miraculous stories such as Noah’s flood. Progressive churches were embracing the ordination of women and even debating accepting LGBTQ people into the life of the church. These “problems” could only be corrected by a disruptive overhaul of leadership.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo shift the balance of power, these conservatives implemented a strategy that was as simple as it was genius: recruit and assemble messengers who would attend the denomination’s annual meeting and vote for a handpicked conservative for the SBC presidency. The new president would, in turn, nominate only conservatives to serve on governing boards of seminaries and agencies. And finally, once conservatives controlled a majority share of these boards, they would replace establishment liberal leaders with conservative foot soldiers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSome 15,000 Southern Baptist messengers gathered in Houston in 1979, and after the ballots were counted, a fiery 47-year-old conservative preacher named Adrian Rogers was elected president. His unparalleled command of rhetoric and uncompromising belief in the inerrancy of scripture made him the perfect person to inaugurate the conservative revolution. Rogers only received 51 percent of the vote over several other candidates, but that was enough. His election was the toppling of the first domino, triggering a purge of left-leaning leaders and churches from the denomination. Just like that, the Southern Baptist Convention was born again.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis week the group gathers in Birmingham, Alabama, exactly 40 years since the Southern Baptist Convention as we know it came into existence. Just like many individuals of similar age, the denomination is experiencing a bit of a midlife crisis, defined by lack of purpose and deep internal conflict. Our rapidly changing world has, in the words of Baylor University historian Barry Hankins, “\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/06/southern-baptists-call-off-the-culture-war/563000/?utm_source=feed\"\u003ethrust the group into the middle of an identity crisis\u003c/a\u003e.” In the early days of their revolution, conservative SBC leaders united around the common goal of defeating their left-leaning brethren. But the liberals are long gone now, leaving no enemies for these “battling Baptists” to fight—except themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe SBC is \u003ca href=\"https://www.christianitytoday.com/news/2017/june/southern-baptist-convention-churches-baptisms-sbc-acp.html\"\u003econtracting\u003c/a\u003e in both membership and church attendance. It has shed a stunning one million members since 2003, and is on pace to lose nearly 100,000 people each year for the foreseeable future. Annual baptisms, which are of obvious importance to Baptists, have plummeted to a 70-year low. Additionally, the denomination is failing either to attract new young people or retain the ones it has. Only \u003ca href=\"https://www.christianitytoday.com/news/2019/may/southern-baptist-sbc-decline-conversion-retention-gss.html\"\u003ehalf of children\u003c/a\u003e raised Southern Baptist choose to remain Southern Baptist. Although the denomination has made attempts to curb the decline through evangelism task forces and mission efforts, such tactics aren’t working as hoped.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere is no easy explanation for this decline. You can’t merely blame secularization or chalk it up to the growing number of religiously unaffiliated people in America, because evangelicals in general have increased in number. So what gives? Underneath the numeric slippage lies a more substantive problem: cultural irrelevance. The denomination used to contribute to, or even drive, conversations on the day’s most pressing issues. At the height of the conservative takeover, the goings on in the denomination were closely monitored by national media and regularly covered by network nightly news programs such as ABC’s “Nightline.” In 1985, the wildly popular daytime TV host Phil Donahue devoted an entire show to the denomination. Now, only a handful of religion journalists are paying close attention. The world has moved on.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eConservative leaders who clutched control of the group decades ago were nearly unified in their convictions and hyper-focused on their chosen mission. Today, the group is fractured and endlessly consumed by infighting. They’ve \u003ca href=\"http://www.sbcannualmeeting.net/sbc17/news/71/connect316-urges-loyal-opposition-to-calvinism\"\u003efought\u003c/a\u003e over the growing influence of Calvinism, a theological system based on the teachings of John Calvin.

It’s difficult to cultivate a fresh vision for the future when you’re preoccupied with putting out fires.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the past, the election of a Republican president would have unified a conservative group like the SBC, infusing it with fresh energy. But Donald Trump’s election further fractured the group instead. Some prominent Southern Baptist pastors—including \u003ca href=\"https://www.dallasobserver.com/news/dallas-pastor-robet-jeffress-says-anti-trump-christians-are-morons-11561290\"\u003eRobert Jeffress\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/of-course-evangelicals-can-vote-for-trump\"\u003eJack Graham\u003c/a\u003e—vocally supported Trump for his conservative positions on issues such as abortion and his promise to appoint conservative judges. But many others—such as \u003ca href=\"https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2017/politics/state/russell-moore-donald-trump-southern-baptists/\"\u003eRussell Moore\u003c/a\u003e, the head of the denomination’s public policy arm—could not stomach the thrice-married, foul-mouthed, serial lying candidate’s poor character.

When Vice President Mike Pence was invited to speak at last year’s annual gathering, many pastors \u003ca href=\"https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/religion/2018/06/12/mike-pence-southern-baptist-convention-dallas/693797002/\"\u003eprotested\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNothing said here will come as a surprise to most Southern Baptist leaders, particularly younger ones. They see their crisis as clearly as outsiders do. Last year, Southern Baptists elected North Carolina pastor JD Greear as their president in hopes of ushering in “\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/jimmyfunchess/status/1006632522095251456\"\u003ea new day in the SBC.”\u003c/a\u003e At 45-years-old, Greear is one of the \u003ca href=\"https://www.christianitytoday.com/news/2018/june/jd-greear-elected-southern-baptist-president-sbc-2018.html\"\u003eyoungest men\u003c/a\u003e elected to the post, and he has asserted his desire to \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/06/southern-baptists-call-off-the-culture-war/563000/?utm_source=feed\"\u003ecall off the culture war\u003c/a\u003e and partisan politics. He wants to promote “\u003ca href=\"https://jdgreear.com/blog/cultural-racial-diversity-sbc/\"\u003eracial reconciliation and cultural diversity\u003c/a\u003e.” But as Greear concludes his first term, little seems to have changed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePerhaps his election was a cosmetic solution to an existential problem, a change akin to a middle-aged friend purchasing a cherry red sports car. The hum of the Corvette engine is exciting at first, but in a blink, you realize the same person with the same problems is behind the wheel. Southern Baptists can’t simply vote their way to revival this time. They must do some deep self-examination and get their house in order.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis week in Birmingham, Southern Baptists have an opportunity to do just that. The emerging sexual abuse crisis in the denomination should undoubtedly be the first priority. An investigation released by \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/investigations/article/Southern-Baptist-sexual-abuse-spreads-as-leaders-13588038.php\"\u003eThe Houston Chronicle\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/em\u003ein February revealed decades of sexual abuse and a pattern of repeat offenders stretching back decades and affecting hundreds of victims. New revelations continue to emerge and Southern Baptists should expect this story to get worse, not better for them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThough Greear has made several proposals for seriously addressing the matter, denominational leaders are split. Some claim that Southern Baptist churches are autonomous and that the denomination has no place interfering in the matter. Others believe that sexual abuse demands a serious response, including restitution for victims. The latter have the better argument.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Roman Catholic Church’s failure to adequately respond to its sex abuse scandal has had \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/02/baptists-can-learn-catholic-sex-abuse-scandal/583111/?utm_source=feed\"\u003edevastating effects\u003c/a\u003e. Donations have dropped, members’ faith in clergy has fallen, and the total number of Catholics in America has plummeted by more than 3 million since 2007 alone—more than any other religious group. Parents will avoid any space, no matter how sacred, if they question the safety of their children, and few people will donate their hard-earned money to an institution they don’t respect and trust. Southern Baptists must learn from Catholics’ mistakes and deal aggressively with this scandal in its early stages.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAccording to psychoanalyst Erik Erikson, midlife marks a period of time when one must choose between “stagnation” and “generativity.” You can stay the course, retreating to a life of nostalgia, regret, and fear. The other option is to accept the new normal, stop trying to reclaim past glories, and transform to meet the needs of the moment. For Southern Baptists, a posture of generativity would require leaders to refocus on the emerging moral issues of our age.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFew issues are more relevant now than racial division. The Southern Baptist Convention, which was founded over the issue of slavery and was mostly supportive of segregation and Jim Crow laws, is still 85 percent white. It issued an \u003ca href=\"http://www.sbc.net/resolutions/899/resolution-on-racial-reconciliation-on-the-150th-anniversary-of-the-southern-baptist-convention\"\u003eapology\u003c/a\u003e for its racist past in 1995, but the group struggled to pass resolutions condemning \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/06/the-southern-baptist-convention-alt-right-white-supremacy/530244/?utm_source=feed\"\u003ewhite supremacy\u003c/a\u003e and the \u003ca href=\"https://religionnews.com/2016/06/14/southern-baptists-discontinue-the-display-of-the-confederate-battle-flag/\"\u003eConfederate Flag\u003c/a\u003e. As Greear wrote, “In theory, very few people in the American church are opposed to the idea of racial and cultural diversity. But experience would suggest that on this issue good intentions do not equal forward progress.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen the denomination’s executive committee, which oversees the day-to-day business of the denomination, set about selecting a new leader this year, many minority leaders pressed for a person of color as a tangible marker of progress. The suggestions were disregarded and instead the committee selected Ronnie Floyd, a white Baby Boomer from Arkansas. When a prominent black Baptist pastor criticized Donald Trump for \u003ca href=\"https://blackchristiannews.com/2018/01/pastor-dwight-mckissic-calls-on-president-trumps-evangelical-advisers-to-either-condemn-or-condone-his-remarks-regarding-african-caribbean-countries/\"\u003eracist remarks\u003c/a\u003ein which the president called Caribbean and African nations “shithole countries,” he was largely ignored. Several prominent Southern Baptist pastors continue to serve on Trump’s religious advisory council. This kind of tone deafness by white Southern Baptist leaders sends a message to people of color that the denomination does not take their concerns seriously.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd what about the dignity and equality of women? The SBC has bombed in that department as well. Last year, troubling allegations emerged about revered Southern Baptist leader Paige Patterson. Recordings of his sermons revealed Patterson body-shaming a young woman and downplaying domestic abuse. For weeks, the Southern Baptist old guard rallied around their friend even in the face of a petition calling for his resignation signed by thousands of Southern Baptist women. Finally, evidence emerged that Patterson had mishandled an abuse allegation at a seminary he led and he was terminated.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRecently, wildly popular Bible teacher Beth Moore was bullied online by prominent Baptist leaders and bloggers for teaching men in a Sunday church service. Attacks on Moore grew so intense that \u003cem\u003eThe Washington Post \u003c/em\u003ereported that the issue was dominating official denominational discussions. Southern Baptist teaching holds that the office of the pastor is reserved for males, and some parishioners presumably wouldn’t support a woman preaching in their church.  But what message does it send that such a petty matter sparked such furor? Given that half of Southern Baptists are women, the denomination must find ways to elevate women, affirm women’s gifts, and oppose gender-based violence and discrimination.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor some, discussions about reinventing the Southern Baptist Convention elicit fear that conservative control is slipping away. But they can no longer be avoided. If the decline continues and leaders remain unable or unwilling to make changes, America’s largest denomination won’t just be over the hill, it’ll be in the grave.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/QoGra9BxILM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/QoGra9BxILM/","published":"2019-06-10T10:30:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-591331"},{"title":"If the Democrats Know What to Do About China, They’re Not Saying","content":"\u003cp class=\"dropcap\"\u003eListening to the Democratic candidates for president, you would probably not know that globalization, as it has existed for the past several decades, may soon cease to exist. Since at least the turn of the century, the close ties between the United States and China, which together constitute 40 percent of the world’s GDP, have bound the world economy together. But this deep interdependence—which is sometimes called “Chimerica”—may not survive Donald Trump. It’s not just his tariffs on Chinese goods, and China’s retaliatory tariffs on American products, which if not repealed will likely depress trade between the nations. Trump is also building a wall between China’s and America’s biggest companies.

In an interview on PBS last year, Sanders \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/5/21/18628128/trump-tariffs-2020-presidential-election-joe-biden-bernie-sanders\"\u003esaid\u003c/a\u003e he “strongly supports” tariffs against China, but thinks “Trump gets it wrong in terms of implementation.” Warren has \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/5/21/18628128/trump-tariffs-2020-presidential-election-joe-biden-bernie-sanders\"\u003esaid\u003c/a\u003e that “tariffs are one part of reworking our trade policy.” By contrast, Buttigieg, in his MSNBC town hall, \u003ca href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/transcripts/hardball/2019-06-03\"\u003esaid\u003c/a\u003e “a tariff is a tax” that will make Americans “all pay, on average, 800 bucks more a year, starting now.” In hers, Harris also \u003ca href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/transcripts/the-last-word/2019-05-28\"\u003eslammed\u003c/a\u003e the “Trump trade tax,” which means “we are paying more for washing machines and shampoos.” The implication is that unlike Sanders and Warren, Buttigieg and Harris don’t just oppose the way Trump has imposed tariffs. They oppose tariffs in general.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut the debate the candidates should be having—and media interviewers should be nurturing—is about much more than tariffs. It’s about whether and how to alter the terms of Chinese-American interdependence. Right now, Trump’s efforts to change the relationship seem likely to break Chimerica apart and end globalization in its current form. Yet most Americans haven’t heard a clear Democratic alternative.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are three broad arguments that Democratic hopefuls could make. The first is that Trump is right to pressure China to open its economy to U.S. corporations, but that he shouldn’t do so unilaterally. Yes, Democrats might argue: Trump is right to demand that Beijing permit American companies to do business in China without forming joint ventures with Chinese counterparts. He’s right to demand that China do a better job of protecting intellectual property so Chinese companies can’t create cheap knockoffs of American goods. Where he’s wrong is in trying to accomplish all this on his own. In Beto O’Rourke’s CNN town hall, the former Texas representative brought forth the kernel of this argument. “When in the history of this country have we ever gone to war, a military fight or a trade war, without allies?” O’Rourke \u003ca href=\"http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1905/21/se.01.html\"\u003easked\u003c/a\u003e. “Because that’s exactly what we are doing now with China.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe implication is that the U.S. should quickly settle its trade disputes with Japan, South Korea, and Europe. If they band together, the democracies can focus instead on pushing China to accept the responsibilities that come with being the global economic power that it is. In trade matters, China still portrays itself as a developing country, a status that allows it to protect Chinese companies and impose unfavorable conditions on Western firms that want to sell to Chinese consumers. The natural forum in which to pressure Beijing would be the World Trade Organization, which the United States could empower rather than \u003ca href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-china-swallowed-the-wto-1509551308\"\u003etrying to cripple\u003c/a\u003e, as Trump has.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor Democrats, such a strategy would make intuitive sense. In economics, as in war, Democrats tend to prefer multilateral to unilateral interventions, and to support international institutions that legitimize American power. Barack Obama’s administration was thinking in these terms when it tried to create the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which it hoped would create rules for trade and investment across Asia that China felt pressured to match. Politically, the current Democratic candidates probably can’t endorse the TPP, because sentiment in the party has shifted so far against the proposed agreement. But it’s easy to imagine the more moderate Democrats—Biden, Buttigieg, Harris, and O’Rourke—pursuing a modified version of Obama’s strategy of preserving the Chimerica relationship while making it work better for American businesses.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSecondly, Democrats could make a different, more radical, argument: Opening up China’s economy to American companies and American investment isn’t the answer at all. In this view, the larger problem at the heart of globalization is that big corporations can scour the world seeking the cheapest workers with the fewest labor and environmental protections.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBy this logic, Democrats shouldn’t assemble foreign partners to achieve Trump’s current trade goals, because the goals themselves are wrong. America should only seek trade agreements with strong, enforceable labor and environmental standards, and perhaps even some form of global minimum wage. The University of Rhode Island historian Erik Loomis has \u003ca href=\"https://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/left-vision-trade-tpp-isds-international-law\"\u003eproposed\u003c/a\u003e that future trade deals create international courts that, rather than allowing corporations to sue governments for impeding investment and trade, as the TPP would have, allow citizens to sue corporations for mistreating workers or harming the environment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe goal of this approach would be less to recalibrate the relationship between America and China—which now possesses its own “\u003ca href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-parliament-jobs/in-chinas-rustbelt-towns-displaced-coal-steel-workers-lose-hope-and-voice-idUSKBN16C0Z3\"\u003eRust Belt\u003c/a\u003e” as corporations shift to poorer countries with lower wages——than to recalibrate the relationship between corporations and workers. America would focus not on pushing China to better protect the intellectual property of American businesses but to allow independent labor unions so American and Chinese workers can together pressure their employers to raise wages and improve working conditions. Democrats, \u003ca href=\"http://inthesetimes.com/working/entry/21277/anti-China-nationalism-Donald-Trump-trade-wars-left-Bernie-Sanders-unions\"\u003ewrote\u003c/a\u003e the activist Tobita Chow in a plea to the 2020 contenders, should “recognize Chinese workers as potential comrades in a shared struggle against global corporate power.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor anti-corporate Democrats such as Sanders and Warren, Chow’s argument might constitute a natural international extension of their domestic agenda. But this more dramatic rewriting of globalization’s rules is likely harder to achieve. Permitting more foreign investment doesn’t threaten the Chinese government’s hold on power; permitting independent labor unions could. Beijing surely remembers that Solidarity, the independent labor union led by Lech Walesa, was what helped bring down the Communist government in Poland. Sanders and Warren are not Trump-style hyper-nationalists. They don’t want to undo globalization; they want to stop corporations from defining it. But the more ambitious your goals for a trade deal, the harder that deal is to reach, which for Sanders and Warren may be an acceptable risk. If America and China can’t reach an agreement, the tariffs remain—an outcome that the two liberal senators appear more comfortable with than their more centrist opponents.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"dropcap\"\u003eThe third Democratic approach for remaking Chimerica would be, politically, the easiest. It’s to focus not on China but on America. Instead of decrying the Made in China 2025 initiative, in which Beijing subsidizes crucial emerging industries such as robotics and green energy, the MIT economist David Autor has \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/new-money/2017/3/29/15035498/autor-trump-china-trade-election\"\u003esuggested\u003c/a\u003e that the U.S. adopt something similar—for instance, by dramatically boosting investment in the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health. Democrats could frame their openness to immigration as a way to bring in the talent necessary to compete with China. And they could propose infrastructure investments that, for instance, accelerate America’s transition to 5G. Rather than breaking up Chimerica, the United States would strengthen its competitive position within the relationship by making changes at home.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe third option isn’t incompatible with the first or second one. But so far, it’s hard to know which approach the Democratic candidates prefer, because while they are laying out proposals for expanding health-care coverage, making college cheaper, saving abortion rights, and converting to green energy, they are barely debating the U.S.-China relationship at all.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen the primary debates begin, at the end of this month, the networks must pin the Democratic candidates down. If voters go to the polls early next year knowing nothing about how the Democratic contenders envision the future of a relationship that for decades has anchored the world as we know it, those candidates and the media will both have failed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003csmall\u003eFaith Hill contributed research to this article.\u003c/small\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/TzKqsSQ21nM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/TzKqsSQ21nM/","published":"2019-06-10T10:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-591295"},{"title":"Trump Has Killed Democrats’ Sense of the Possible","content":"\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eTo former vice president Joe Biden’s benefit, “electability” has become the unofficial buzzword of the 2020 presidential campaign.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWhile it’s still early, most polls show Biden as the clear frontrunner among Democrats.

According to the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics, the black incarceration rate rose from 1,200 per 100,000 in 1985 to 2,450 per 100,000 in 2000.

My daughter-in-law’s parents live three hours away.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEven though he lives close by, my son hardly calls or comes over. He tells us he’s busy working and being a father and husband. We do hear from him when he needs something, like someone to watch the grandkids.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor most of the holidays, my son, daughter-in-law, and grandkids spend several days visiting with my daughter-in-law’s parents and her other family members. This year, I asked my son whether his family would be coming over on Easter, and I explained that I had Easter gifts for the grandkids. He texted that they didn’t have time to come by, not even for 30 minutes. My daughter-in-law’s parents came to town for the Easter holiday and stayed overnight at my son’s house, as they do for Christmas and other holidays. They spent the entire day with the grandkids and the rest of my daughter-in-law’s family. My husband and I were hurt and felt it was somewhat selfish of my son and his family not to spend any time with us. Is it unrealistic for me to expect an Easter visit with my grandkids, even for a few minutes, or for our son to visit us periodically?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSome potentially relevant information is that our son was hospitalized four months ago for pancreatitis. He drinks quite a bit and has been warned of the consequences if he continues. I learned that my daughter-in-law is covering up our son’s drinking.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy son also has always felt that my daughter got more than he did when they were growing up. However, this is not the case. Sometimes he doesn’t remember what we did for him and the help and support we have given him.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI don’t understand why we can’t have a closer relationship with my son and daughter-in-law. Any help would be appreciated.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnonymous\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDear Anonymous,\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI understand how painful it is to feel rebuffed by your son. After all, from your perspective, you’ve been loving parents, and your son should call to say hello and offer to make arrangements to see you on the holidays, especially when he and his family live so close by.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMany truly well-meaning parents like you are baffled when their adult children seem to have so little regard for them. Sons or daughters may take days or weeks to respond to a phone call, say they’re too busy for a visit even though they seem to find time to see other family members or friends, get angry when you try to constructively advise them, have no curiosity about how you’re doing, and share little about their own lives when asked.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eChildren, however, often do let their parents know why they’re keeping their distance. The problem is that sometimes what they’re saying is hard to hear—so hard to hear that parents spend more time rejecting their complaints than considering how to repair the relationship. This pushes the children further away, because eventually they get tired of trying to be heard. If sharing their experience feels futile, they’ll simply withdraw.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne common complaint that adult children have is that their parents are critical—of their life choices or appearance or partner or job—when what they need is to feel supported and accepted for who they are. Another is that their parents still treat them like children, trying to micromanage their lives. Or that their parents are intrusive, calling constantly and not allowing for comfortable space. Sometimes, too, what parents perceive as emotional closeness with their child is viewed by their son or daughter as parental neediness, of relying on the adult child to fill a parent’s own emotional voids.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI don’t know whether you understand yet why your son has pulled away, but the good news is, he has given you some clues. Keep in mind that none of what your son says makes you bad parents. Even parents who do their absolute best will sometimes unwittingly leave their children feeling hurt in one way or another. So it’s important to be open to hearing his perspective, especially because a child often sees his parents in ways that contain some valuable feedback.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor instance, when your son lets you know how he feels about the way he and his sister were treated, he’s not saying, “You were awful people.” Instead, he’s saying something like, “Sometimes I didn’t think you were there for me when I needed you.” And if you reply with, “This is not the case—we did so much for you,” what he hears isn’t your love, but another perceived rejection: “You’re not interested in my experience. My inner world doesn’t matter to you.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat’s not to say you didn’t do everything you remember doing for him. It’s just that it’s equally true that he has different recollections and experienced the dynamics in the family differently than you and your husband did. If you want a relationship with your son and his family, you’ll need to take his perspective seriously—you don’t have to agree with it, but you do have to understand it and know that it’s just as valid as yours. There’s no point in arguing over whose version is more accurate, because the truth is that both of your experiences are subjective.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYour resistance to hearing his pain surrounding this may be one reason he’s choosing not to spend time with you, but it might not be the only one. Perhaps he’s genuinely overwhelmed by the responsibilities he mentioned—his job, his spouse, his children. Perhaps he’s struggling with alcohol addiction and  is avoiding you (who will call him out on it) as a way to avoid dealing with his need to get treatment. And perhaps there is something else that isn’t even on your radar yet. The only way to know is to ask—but from a place of deep empathy rather than blame.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo instead of, “Why don’t we ever see you? Is a quick visit too much to ask?” you might try something like, “I imagine there’s a reason we don’t see much of you, and I wonder whether we’ve done something to push you away. We love you and care about you deeply, and I know we haven’t been as open as we should have been in the past when you’ve shared some of how you felt about us and our family. We regret that we weren’t more receptive to your experience, but we are now. The last thing we wanted to do was hurt you, but we probably have, and we’d like to understand more about that so we can do things differently to support you.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYour son may not be open to this conversation initially, but the more you refrain from complaints like, “What, you can’t drive 15 minutes to see us when you spent the entire day with your wife’s family?” and instead stay on point about wanting to hear him out and support what he needs from you, the more inclined he’ll become to move toward you and share what’s really going on.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, you can send more enticing invitations. There’s a world of difference between “Will you be coming over for Easter?” (meaning: for our sake) and “Hey, we’d like to do something fun with you. Why don’t we take you all out for dinner at your favorite restaurant—or take the grandkids to the movies so you two can have some downtime?” When your son begins to see you as helping him rather than asking something of him, the dynamic will gradually shift, making it more likely that he’ll be inclined to talk to you about what has been getting in the way of having a closer relationship.

A woman needed basic items for her kids—formula, diapers, and the like—but didn’t have the money. In the comment thread below, people began tagging other Facebook groups, known as “blessing groups,” dedicated solely to handling cases of small but pressing monetary needs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWiley joined one of these groups, called “\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/gmymu/\"\u003egive me your money\u003c/a\u003e.” Once inside, she was met with a never-ending stream of people begging for help with small emergencies, medical expenses, and unfulfilled needs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWiley gave what she could, a few dollars here, a few dollars there. This week, after her company closed down, laying her off, she posted herself, asking for $80. “I have been looking for a little to cover the overdraft fee and gas since I won’t get paid until the end of the month for my new job, which I start on Monday,” she said. So far she’s received $10.  “I was embarrassed to post, it was embarrassing to me. I’ve always taken care of my children, but I just had this bump in the road,” said Wiley.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWhile larger sites such as GoFundMe have \u003ca href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/01/go-fund-yourself-health-care-popularity-contest/\"\u003ebecome popular for raising funds for large expenses such as medical bills\u003c/a\u003e, there is no one-stop platform to crowdfund just a few dollars. In the past, some have resorted to begging, or asking friends and family to help cover costs. But now thousands of people are turning to Facebook Groups to plead for the help they need, from people who are essentially strangers online.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe groups have straightforward names, including “\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/gmymu/\"\u003egive me your money\u003c/a\u003e,” “\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/paypalprayersandblessings\"\u003ePayPal Prayers and Blessings\u003c/a\u003e,” “\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/2532471256798152\"\u003eCash App Blessings\u003c/a\u003e,” “\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/306335153563225/\"\u003estrangers helping strangers\u003c/a\u003e,” and dozens more. In them, people ask for small amounts of money; most have caps of $500 per post. In many of the groups women—often moms—make most of the requests, looking for money for diapers, formula, or help paying for child care. But the groups are also populated by students trying to make ends meet, people with medical debt, and, occasionally, people just asking if anyone would buy their family pizza for the night.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e“I have a balance of $53 due on my gas bill. I just got off the phone with the gas company.

They also include photos and sometimes “proof” that they’re a real person and not a scammer. As the poster is funded, they update their listing with how much they’ve received. People usually ask questions in the comments below, sometimes trying to suss out how dire the situation really is, and comment with receipts when they donate so that everyone can see how much funding the original poster has received.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003ePeople who donate say that they primarily do so because they like the feeling of helping others. It feels more direct than just donating to a faceless charity. Plus, some figure, if they ever need to ask the group for a few bucks in the future, people might remember them. “This group is all about paying it forward,” Cameron Ellis, a member of “give me your money” recently posted in the group. “If you have been helped you do the helping when you can whether it’s in the form of money, compassion, or animal pictures. It’s all about helping to make someone's day a little better than it was before.” Jamie Ice, a fellow member of the group added, “We’re not just a ‘Facebook crowdfunding group.’ We're family.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eMost people in blessings group rely on Venmo, Cash App, or PayPal. But Facebook wants to make it easier to exchange money through the platform itself. At the company’s annual developer conference in May, Mark Zuckerberg \u003ca href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/01/mark-zuckerberg-at-f8-payments-commerce-to-become-more-important.html\"\u003eannounced that\u003c/a\u003e “it should be as easy to send money to someone as it is to send a photo.” The company has been working on integrating more payment features into its suite of apps and you can already \u003ca href=\"https://www.thebalance.com/facebook-messenger-payments-send-and-receive-money-315074\"\u003esend money directly through Facebook Messenger\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eAll blessings groups are free to join, but some allow those who make suggested donations to collective funds to skip the line. Admins of the groups then allocate those funds to particularly needy cases. People who kick in a few dollars for someone else know they can return with their own asks, when they find money tight themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eMelinda Keeton, a mom in Ohio, is in seven of the groups and has found them to be a lifeline when she’s on hard times. After she overdrafted her bank account and was in the red for several dollars, she posted in one of the groups and received money to clear her overdraft fees. “It’s a good resource to have,” she said. “I just funded a mom three hours ago who needed $10 for food. A person said if someone else gave $5 she’d give $5, so I did.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eUnsurprisingly, scammers run rampant in these groups. Keeton ended up conversing with one who managed to obtain her bank information and personal details, subsequently draining her account. Some users have also created Facebook groups \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/1862782143833723/?ref=gysj\"\u003especifically to expose scammers\u003c/a\u003e. But, Keeton says, “No one vets the stories, it’s just follow your gut. One lady I donated to was in a foreign country and said she needed formula for her child. Today I got online and she had a whole new post in a different group asking for something different.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe appetite for these groups has reached such a level that John Ford, an activist who \u003ca href=\"https://www.wired.com/2011/11/boston-occupy/\"\u003emade a name for himself during the Occupy Boston movement\u003c/a\u003e, has even managed to build a business off one group thorough merch sales. He and his wife run “\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/gmymu/\"\u003egive me your money\u003c/a\u003e,” a group with more than 20,000 members which has spawned countless spinoffs and copy cats. Their group, unlike many others, is built on a unique fee structure. People are asked to include a 10 percent tip on top of all donations, which goes to paying moderators for their work in keeping the group organized. Ford also set up \u003ca href=\"https://givemeyourmoney.net\"\u003ea separate website\u003c/a\u003e where users can pay $5 to pin their post, $5 to mute someone or reveal who muted you, and $10 to ban or reinstate a fellow member of the group.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003eRead: \u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/05/when-youre-not-just-the-product-on-facebook-but-the-manager/560864/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eWho should profit from running a Facebook group\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThis payment structure can sometimes lead to disagreements. Most people pay to ban spammers and trolls, but occasionally people will simply pay to kick out members of the community who they don’t like. That person must then pay $10 to be re-added. A few former members I spoke to left the group over these policies. Meital Salerno, a woman in New York who has joined several blessings groups said that she stopped being active in “give me your money” after one woman was banned for expressing ideological differences with other members. “She could have used that $10 [someone spent on banning her] to help pay her bills,” Salerno said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThough charging for bans and reinstatements does bring in a little bit of cash, Ford and his wife primarily monetize the group by selling pins and other items under his and his wife’s merchandise brand, \u003ca href=\"https://therovinghouse.com/\"\u003eThe Roving House\u003c/a\u003e. The Roving House creates custom pins for “give me your money” fundraisers and members. These pins are highly prized by members of the community. People can also pay to become a “\u003ca href=\"https://givemeyourmoney.net/collections/frontpage/products/luxury-membership\"\u003eLuxury member\u003c/a\u003e” of “give me your money,” in order to \u003ca href=\"https://givemeyourmoney.net/collections/frontpage/products/luxury-membership\"\u003ereceive special perks\u003c/a\u003e and access a separate Facebook group mostly comprised of people who donate, rather than make asks. Just six months ago, Ford also created “give me your money Gold,” a group for fans of The Roving House pins. For $10 per month you get a sneak peek of new pins coming out, and you can join the Gold Facebook group. No one asks for money in that group.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eFord uses money from The Roving House merchandise sales to cover living expenses for him and his wife. He also takes a portion of the money made off selling bans, reinstatements, and luxury group memberships. But a large portion of that money, he says, goes to paying the group’s moderators. “A lot of other groups are very scam heavy,” Ford said. “We conduct background checks, follow-ups with abortion clinics, etc. There are actual administrative hoops that we go through so that our members feel like they know where their money is going. We are a registered business in the state of Massachusetts.” Ford is also in the process of launching an app that enables peer-to-peer funding. “We are not rich. We are having a little bit of success, but I don’t want people to think we’re tycoons at all,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e“Give me your money” is one of several groups that \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/05/what-are-facebook-tag-groups/589669/?utm_source=feed\"\u003ebegan as a tag group\u003c/a\u003e, but morphed into a blessings group. (Tag groups are Facebook Groups that act like mini-forums and mostly exist to function as replies in the comments of posts.) Ford said he sees the evolution of his group, which was the first major blessing group, as filling a real need. “After Occupy fizzled out a lot of people were left with, ‘Well, what do we do?’ My path was to take the principles of mutual aid and try to popularize it a little bit. Let's take an old anarchist concept and try to make it accessible to the Facebook crowd, regular folks,” Ford said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe need is there: An increasing number of Americans live every day without a safety net. Getting sick or in an accident can lead to skyrocketing medical bills, a job layoff can mean loss of a stable housing situation, and 78 percent of American workers are living paycheck to paycheck, \u003ca href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/the-report/articles/2019-01-11/stretched-thin-majority-of-americans-live-paycheck-to-paycheck\"\u003eaccording to a study by CareerBuilder\u003c/a\u003e. \u003ca href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/08/07/for-most-us-workers-real-wages-have-barely-budged-for-decades/\"\u003eWages have remained stagnant compared to inflation\u003c/a\u003e, while living expenses, education, and health care costs\u003ca href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cost-of-living-2018-increasing-at-fastest-rate-in-10-years/\"\u003e have all risen significantly\u003c/a\u003e over past decades.

Supporting peers directly through small amounts of money sent via Cash App, PayPal, and Venmo was also popularized by the LGBTQ+ and sex worker community. “Being in queer communities, there’s a very emphasis on helping people out in these situations,” said \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/yung_nihilist/\"\u003eBianca Perez\u003c/a\u003e, a content creator on Instagram as \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/yung_nihilist/\"\u003e@yung_nihilist\u003c/a\u003e, who has supported herself through direct donations before. “I’ve done it periodically on and off throughout my time on Instagram. It’s really precarious to be out on your own. I don’t receive any money from my family members and so literally the internet is my parents.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut sometimes the internet doesn’t come through. One issue with crowdfunding is that only the neediest cases or most compelling stories receive help. Dick Rueckert, a former paramedic in Utah, posted in a blessing group last week asking for $50 for new boots. He was in a car accident, and his boots were shredded. He woke up in the hospital without shoes. He can’t go back to work after the accident, and so money is short. So far only two people have responded, neither of whom donated.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eSalerno said that another downside is how political the groups can get. One woman in “give me your money” was chastised after asking for money for utilities, when she had previously used her Facebook page to criticize those who kneeled during the National Anthem. After she defended her stance a commenter replied, “You won’t get funded if you double down like that instead of listening and understanding.” Other people have not received funding for childcare after making anti-abortion comments, and one white woman was denied funding after she used a meme including the N word.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDespite the drama, most people in blessings groups say that they don’t know where they’d turn without them. Traci Kendrick, an armed services member in Texas, has seen firsthand how the groups can save people from financial ruin. After a friend’s father had a car accident, the family was able to help pay his medical bills with money from blessings groups. “No one really has the money to save up in bank accounts,” Kenrick said. “When there’s an emergency, there is no back up plan. These groups are it.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/kIH-kBFwnRQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/kIH-kBFwnRQ/","published":"2019-06-10T12:36:21Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-591307"},{"title":"Better Schools Won’t Fix America","content":"\u003cp class=\"dropcap\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"smallcaps\"\u003eLong ago, I was \u003c/span\u003ecaptivated by a seductively intuitive idea, one many of my wealthy friends still subscribe to: that both poverty and rising inequality are largely consequences of America’s failing education system. Fix that, I believed, and we could cure much of what ails America.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis belief system, which I have come to think of as “educationism,” is grounded in a familiar story about cause and effect: Once upon a time, America created a public-education system that was the envy of the modern world. No nation produced more or better-educated high-school and college graduates, and thus the great American middle class was built. But then, sometime around the 1970s, America lost its way. We allowed our schools to crumble, and our test scores and graduation rates to fall. School systems that once churned out well-paid factory workers failed to keep pace with the rising educational demands of the new knowledge economy. As America’s public-school systems foundered, so did the earning power of the American middle class. And as inequality increased, so did political polarization, cynicism, and anger, threatening to undermine American democracy itself.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTaken with this story line, I embraced education as both a philanthropic cause and a civic mission. I co-founded the League of Education Voters, a nonprofit dedicated to improving public education. I joined Bill Gates, Alice Walton, and Paul Allen \u003ca href=\"http://blogs.seattletimes.com/politicsnorthwest/2012/10/30/another-week-another-million-for-charter-school-initiative/\"\u003ein giving more than $1 million each\u003c/a\u003e to an effort to pass a ballot measure that established Washington State’s first charter schools. All told, I have devoted countless hours and millions of dollars to the simple idea that if we improved our schools—if we modernized our curricula and our teaching methods, substantially increased school funding, rooted out bad teachers, and opened enough charter schools—American children, especially those in low-income and working-class communities, would start learning again. Graduation rates and wages would increase, poverty and inequality would decrease, and public commitment to democracy would be restored.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut after decades of organizing and giving, I have come to the uncomfortable conclusion that I was wrong. And I hate being wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat I’ve realized, decades late, is that educationism is tragically misguided. American workers are struggling in large part because they are underpaid—and \u003ca href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/08/07/for-most-us-workers-real-wages-have-barely-budged-for-decades/\"\u003ethey are underpaid because 40 years of trickle-down policies\u003c/a\u003e have rigged the economy in favor of wealthy people like me. Americans are more highly educated than ever before, but despite that, and despite nearly record-low unemployment, most American workers—at all levels of educational attainment—have seen little if any wage growth since 2000.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo be clear: We should do everything we can to improve our public schools. But \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/05/college-poor-students/560972/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eour education system can’t compensate\u003c/a\u003e for the ways our economic system is failing Americans. Even the most thoughtful and well-intentioned school-reform program can’t improve educational outcomes if it ignores the single greatest driver of student achievement: household income.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor all the genuine flaws of the American education system, the nation still has many high-achieving public-school districts. Nearly all of them are united by a thriving community of economically secure middle-class families with sufficient political power to demand great schools, the time and resources to participate in those schools, and the tax money to amply fund them. In short, great public schools are the product of a thriving middle class, not the other way around. Pay people enough to afford dignified middle-class lives, and high-quality public schools will follow. But allow economic inequality to grow, and educational inequality will inevitably grow with it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBy distracting us from these truths, educationism is part of the problem.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"dropcap\"\u003eW\u003cspan class=\"smallcaps\"\u003ehenever I talk \u003c/span\u003ewith my wealthy friends about the dangers of rising economic inequality, those who don’t stare down at their shoes invariably push back with something about the woeful state of our public schools. This belief is so entrenched among the philanthropic elite that of America’s 50 largest family foundations—a clique that manages $144 billion in tax-exempt charitable assets—40 declare education as a key issue. Only one mentions anything about the plight of working people, economic inequality, or wages. And because the richest Americans are so politically powerful, the consequences of their beliefs go far beyond philanthropy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA major theme in the educationist narrative involves the “\u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/1/7/18166951/skills-gap-modestino-shoag-ballance\"\u003eskills gap\u003c/a\u003e”—the notion that decades of wage stagnation are largely a consequence of workers not having the education and skills to fill new high-wage jobs. If we improve our public schools, the thinking goes, and we increase the percentage of students attaining higher levels of education, particularly in the STEM subjects\u003ci\u003e—\u003c/i\u003escience, technology, engineering, and math—the skills gap will shrink, wages will rise, and income inequality will fall.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe real story is more complicated, and more troubling. Yes, there is a mismatch between the skills of the present and the jobs of the future. In a fast-changing, technologically advanced economy, how could there not be? But this mismatch doesn’t begin to explain the widening inequality of the past 40 years.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 1970, when the golden age of the American middle class was nearing its peak and inequality was at its nadir, only about half of Americans ages 25 and older had a high-school degree or the equivalent. Today, 90 percent do. Meanwhile, the proportion of Americans attaining a college degree has more than tripled since 1970. But while the American people have never been more highly educated, only the wealthiest have seen large gains in real wages. From 1979 to 2017, as the average real annual wages of the top 1 percent of Americans rose 156 percent (and the top .01 percent’s wages rose by a stunning 343 percent), the purchasing power of the average American’s paycheck did not increase.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSome educationists might argue that the recent gains in educational attainment simply haven’t been enough to keep up with the changing economy—but here, yet again, the truth appears more complicated. While 34 percent of Americans ages 25 and older have a bachelor’s degree or higher, only 26 percent of jobs currently require one. The job categories that are growing fastest, moreover, don’t generally require a college diploma, let alone a STEM degree. According to federal estimates, four of the five occupational categories projected to add the most jobs to the economy over the next five years are among the lowest-paying jobs: “food preparation and serving” ($19,130 in average annual earnings), “personal care and service” ($21,260), “sales and related” ($25,360), and “health-care support” ($26,440). And while the number of jobs that require a postsecondary education is expected to increase slightly faster than the number that don’t, the latter group is expected to dominate the job market for decades to come. In October 2018 there were 1 million more job openings than job seekers in the U.S. Even if all of these unfilled jobs were in STEM professions at the top of the pay scale, they would be little help to most of the 141 million American workers in the bottom nine income deciles.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" height=\"812\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/06/DIS_Lead_Hanauer_spot/e962bb3c3.jpg\" width=\"672\"\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"credit\"\u003eEdmon de Haro / Monkey Business Images / iStock\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s worth noting that workers with a college degree enjoy a significant wage premium over those without. (Among people over age 25, those with a bachelor’s degree had median annual earnings of $53,882 in 2017, compared with $32,320 for those with only a high-school education.) But even with that advantage, adjusted for inflation, average hourly wages for recent college graduates \u003ca href=\"https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/22/rip-van-skillsgap/\"\u003ehave barely budged since 2000\u003c/a\u003e, while the bottom 60 percent of college graduates earn less than that group did in 2000. A college diploma is no longer a guaranteed passport into the middle class.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, nearly all the benefits of economic growth have been captured by large corporations and their shareholders. After-tax corporate profits have doubled from about 5 percent of GDP in 1970 to about 10 percent, even as wages as a share of GDP have fallen by roughly 8 percent. And the wealthiest 1 percent’s share of pre-tax income has more than doubled, from 9 percent in 1973 to 21 percent today. Taken together, these two trends amount to a shift of more than $2 trillion a year from the middle class to corporations and the super-rich.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe state of the labor market provides further evidence that low-wage workers’ declining fortunes aren’t explained by supply and demand. With the unemployment rate near a 50-year floor, low-wage industries such as accommodations, food service, and retail are struggling to cope with a shortage of job applicants—leading \u003ca href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/available-jobs-in-u-s-edge-higher-in-october-1544457618\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe Wall Street Journal\u003c/i\u003e to lament\u003c/a\u003e that “low-skilled jobs are becoming increasingly difficult for employers to fill.” If wages were actually set the way our Econ 101 textbooks suggested, workers would be profiting from this dynamic. Yet outside the cities and states that have recently imposed a substantially higher local minimum wage, low-wage workers have seen their real incomes barely budge.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll of which suggests that income inequality \u003ca href=\"http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2016/12/we-are-losing-the-battle-against-inequality-without-a-fight.html?gtm=bottom\"\u003ehas exploded\u003c/a\u003e not because of our country’s educational failings but despite its educational progress. Make no mistake: Education is an unalloyed good. We should advocate for more of it, so long as it’s of high quality. But the longer we pretend that education is the answer to economic inequality, the harder it will be to escape our new Gilded Age.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"dropcap\"\u003eH\u003cspan class=\"smallcaps\"\u003eowever justifiable their focus\u003c/span\u003e on curricula and innovation and institutional reform, people who see education as a cure-all have largely ignored the \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/01/economists-your-parents-are-more-important-than-ever/283301/?utm_source=feed\"\u003emetric most predictive\u003c/a\u003e of a child’s educational success: household income.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe scientific literature on this subject is robust, and the consensus overwhelming. The lower your parents’ income, the lower your likely level of educational attainment. Period. But instead of focusing on ways to increase household income, educationists in both political parties talk about extending ladders of opportunity to poor children, most recently in the form of charter schools. For many children, though—especially those raised in the racially segregated poverty endemic to much of the United States—the opportunity to attend a good public school isn’t nearly enough to overcome the effects of limited family income.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs Lawrence Mishel, an economist at the liberal-leaning Economic Policy Institute, notes, poverty creates obstacles that would trip up even the most naturally gifted student.\u003ca href=\"https://prospect.org/article/opportunity-dodge\"\u003e He points to the plight\u003c/a\u003e of “children who frequently change schools due to poor housing; have little help with homework; have few role models of success; have more exposure to lead and asbestos; have untreated vision, ear, dental, or other health problems; … and live in a chaotic and frequently unsafe environment.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIndeed, multiple studies have found that only about 20 percent of student outcomes can be attributed to schooling, whereas about 60 percent are explained by family circumstances—most significantly, income. Now consider that, nationwide, just over half of today’s public-school students \u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/majority-of-us-public-school-students-are-in-poverty/2015/01/15/df7171d0-9ce9-11e4-a7ee-526210d665b4_story.html?utm_term=.be7df90a5efe\"\u003equalify for free or reduced-price school lunches\u003c/a\u003e, up from 38 percent in 2000. Surely if American students are lagging in the literacy, numeracy, and problem-solving skills our modern economy demands, household income deserves most of the blame—not teachers or their unions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf we really want to give every American child an honest and equal opportunity to succeed, we must do much more than extend a ladder of opportunity—we must also narrow the distance between the ladder’s rungs. We must invest not only in our children, but in their families and their communities. We must provide high-quality public education, sure, but also high-quality housing, health care, child care, and all the other prerequisites of a secure middle-class life. And most important, if we want to build the sort of prosperous middle-class communities in which great public schools have always thrived, we must pay all our workers, not just software engineers and financiers, a dignified middle-class wage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eToday, after wealthy elites gobble up our outsize share of national income, the median American family is left with $76,000 a year. Had hourly compensation grown with productivity since 1973—as it did over the preceding quarter century, according to the Economic Policy Institute—that family would now be earning more than $105,000 a year. Just imagine, education reforms aside, how much larger and stronger and better educated our middle class would be if the median American family enjoyed a $29,000-a-year raise.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn fact, the most direct way to address rising economic inequality is to simply pay ordinary workers more, by increasing the minimum wage and the salary threshold for overtime exemption; by restoring bargaining power for labor; and by instating higher taxes—much higher taxes—on rich people like me and on our estates.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEducationism \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/06/is-philanthrophy-compatible-democracy/531930/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eappeals to the wealthy and powerful\u003c/a\u003e because it tells us what we want to hear: that we can help restore shared prosperity without sharing our wealth or power. As Anand Giridharadas explains in his book \u003ci\u003eWinners Take All: The Elite Charade of Changing the World\u003c/i\u003e, narratives like this one let the wealthy feel good about ourselves. By distracting from the true causes of economic inequality, they also defend America’s grossly unequal status quo.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe have confused a symptom—educational inequality—with the underlying disease: economic inequality. Schooling may boost the prospects of individual workers, but it doesn’t change the core problem, which is that the bottom 90 percent is divvying up a shrinking share of the national wealth. Fixing that problem will require wealthy people to not merely give more, but take less.\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003csmall\u003e\u003ci\u003eThis article appears in the July 2019 print edition with the headline “Education Isn’t Enough.”\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/small\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/cqho4AmQHNw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/cqho4AmQHNw/","published":"2019-06-10T12:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:39-590611"},{"title":"Trump’s Man in Russia May Be Coming Home Soon","content":"\u003cp\u003eDonald Trump’s man in Moscow may soon be coming home.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJon Huntsman, who has served as United States ambassador to Russia since 2017, is expected to leave his job by the end of the year and is seriously considering a run for governor of Utah, according to four sources familiar with the situation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHuntsman’s potential interest in the governorship—which he previously held from 2004 to 2009—has been a point of speculation in Utah political circles for months. Earlier this year, both Salt Lake City daily newspapers reported that he might be eyeing the 2020 gubernatorial race. But Huntsman’s allies say the prospect has gotten more serious than many realize.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“It’s not idle chatter,” said Chuck Warren, a Republican consultant who served  for a time as Huntsman’s campaign manager during his first bid for governor. “He’s seriously considering it.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDerek Miller, the head of the Salt Lake City Chamber of Commerce and a well-connected figure in Utah’s donor community, told me Huntsman is said to be “making the rounds and talking to people about his prospects [in the race], doing his due diligence.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen Huntsman was tapped to serve as ambassador in 2017, he told the Trump administration he would commit to staying in Russia for two years, according to several people close to him, who like others I talked to for this story spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss private plans. He intends to return to his home state after hitting the two-year mark this fall, the sources said.

Hundreds of American diplomats have been expelled from the country amid growing tensions over Russia’s interference in the 2016 election. And during a now-infamous summit in Helsinki last year, Trump drew global outrage after appearing to side with Russian President Vladimir Putin over U.S. intelligence agencies on the question of election tampering.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the aftermath of the summit, many called on Huntsman to resign his post. Even the \u003cem\u003eSalt Lake Tribune\u003c/em\u003e—a paper owned by his brother— ran a column making the case. “Ambassador Huntsman, you work for a pawn, not a president,” columnist Robert Gehrke \u003ca href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/2018/07/16/gehrke-ambassador/\"\u003ewrote\u003c/a\u003e. “It’s time to come home.” (After the column drew national media attention, the paper published a house \u003ca href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/opinion/2018/07/18/tribune-editorial/\"\u003eeditorial\u003c/a\u003e arguing Huntsman “should stay put.”)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUltimately, Huntsman chose to remain in the embassy and keep his head down, casting his service as an act of patriotic duty rather than loyalty to Trump. In an \u003ca href=\"https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900038961/the-last-statesman-can-jon-huntsman-jr-keep-the-art-of-diplomacy-alive-in-the-time-of-president-trump.html\"\u003einterview\u003c/a\u003e last year with the \u003cem\u003eDeseret News\u003c/em\u003e, he said his sons, who serve in the Navy, “don’t have the luxury of saying, ‘Well, what party is our president and do I agree or disagree and then I’ll decide whether to deploy.’ That’s not the way we operate. We salute those who are duly elected and try to do our best to serve. It’s pretty simple.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut people close to Huntsman say he has come to miss the governor’s mansion—and the autonomy that comes with it. As an ambassador, every consequential move must be made in coordination with the White House and the State Department. A governorship—especially in a state, like Utah, that’s dominated by a single party—is different. “It’s the one job in the United States where you actually get to make decisions,” said a former Huntsman adviser.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis wouldn’t be the first time Huntsman left a diplomatic job to run for office. Back in 2010, I \u003ca href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/manchurian-candidate-66823\"\u003einterviewed\u003c/a\u003e him while he was serving as ambassador to China under former President Barack Obama. Huntsman was in the states for the holidays, and we spoke in the sparsely furnished Washington, D.C., home he’d recently bought with his wife, prompting speculation about his political future. The notion that he would run for president in 2012 seemed far-fetched at the time. But when I asked him about it, he replied with a calculated coyness: “I think we may have one final run left in our bones.” Within a few months, he had resigned and announced his candidacy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe resulting presidential campaign was short-lived, and Huntsman has made clear to friends he has no interest in running for the office again. But he’s been heard using the same “one final run” phrase more recently when asked about the gubernatorial race.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSome Utah political observers are skeptical that Huntsman will actually choose to run when the time comes. And even those close to him stress that any number of outside factors could change his thinking in the coming months. Last year, he acknowledged that he’d been diagnosed with skin cancer. (“It’s just stage 1,” he \u003ca href=\"https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900038961/the-last-statesman-can-jon-huntsman-jr-keep-the-art-of-diplomacy-alive-in-the-time-of-president-trump.html\"\u003etold\u003c/a\u003e the \u003cem\u003eDeseret News\u003c/em\u003e. “So we’ll probably get it taken care of, and we’ll be fine.”)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf Huntsman decides to run, he will do so with considerable advantages. He was enormously popular last time he was in office, with approval ratings that hovered around 80 percent. Many local Republicans credit Huntsman—who cut taxes and loosened the state’s strict alcohol laws—with laying the groundwork for Utah’s \u003ca href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/utahs-economy-is-booming-11547808301\"\u003enow-thriving economy\u003c/a\u003e. And as a member of Utah royalty—his father, Jon Huntsman Sr., was a revered industrialist and philanthropist—he could easily fund his own campaign.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMiller noted that Huntsman could face tough competition in the Republican primary. While the field is still taking shape, Spencer Cox—the state’s well-liked lieutenant governor—has already announced. (Former Utah congressman Jason Chaffetz recently said he won’t run for governor.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut, Miller said, “Huntsman is going to have higher name ID, a stronger record to run on, and of course the money to back him up. He wouldn’t have to raise a dime.

The legislature is expected to approve the deal this week. The agreement means low-income adults between the ages of 19 and 25 living in California illegally would be eligible for California\u0026#8217;s Medicaid program, the joint state and federal health insurance program for the poor and disabled.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot everyone in that age group would get the health benefits, but only those whose incomes are low enough to qualify for the program. State officials estimate that will be about 90,000 people at a cost of $98 million per year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe move is part of a larger effort to make sure everyone in California has health insurance. The proposal also makes California the first state in the country to help middle income families pay their monthly health insurance premiums. It means a family of four earning as much as six times the federal poverty level \u0026mdash; or more than $150,000 a year \u0026mdash; would be eligible to get about $100 a month from the government to help pay their monthly health insurance premiums.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut to pay for part of it, the state will begin taxing people who don\u0026#8217;t have health insurance. It\u0026#8217;s a revival of the individual mandate penalty that had been law nationwide under former President Barack Obama\u0026#8217;s health care law until Republicans in Congress eliminated it as part of the 2017 overhaul to the tax code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe budget agreement still must be approved by the full state Legislature. State law requires lawmakers to enact a budget by midnight on June 15. If they don\u0026#8217;t, lawmakers would lose their pay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe health care proposals are a win for first-term Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, who proposed both of them. Several lawmakers in the Democratic-dominated state legislature wanted to go further by offering health coverage to all adults living in California illegally. But Newsom opposed that, noting it would cost $3.4 billion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNewsom did not get everything he wanted in the deal. Advocates say more than 1 million people in California don\u0026#8217;t have access to safe drinking water. Newsom had proposed a 95-cent tax on most residential water bills as well as fees on dairies, animal farms and fertilizer sellers, to help water districts pay for improvements and boost supplies. Lawmakers rejected the tax, arguing it was too burdensome in a year when the state is projected to have a $21.5 billion surplus \u0026mdash; the largest in at least 20 years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, lawmakers decided to use $130 million in existing tax revenue to pay for the drinking water improvements. Most of that money \u0026mdash; about $100 million \u0026mdash; would come from the state\u0026#8217;s sale of carbon credits as part of its \u0026#8220;cap and trade\u0026#8221; program. The move means the state\u0026#8217;s agricultural industry, whose pollution is often blamed for the drinking water problems, would have ab out $100 million less than it normally gets from the program for various projects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNewsom also wanted to expand spend $800 million to boost the annual tax refunds for low-income people who have at least one child under the age of 6. But to pay for it, he wanted to selectively adopt some of the changes to the federal tax code that Trump signed into law in 2017. The changes, which would mostly impact businesses, would have brought the state an extra $1 billion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the legislature did not include the tax changes in its version of the budget proposal.

However, gender equality is not guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution and it won\u0026rsquo;t be unless the \u003ca href=\"http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2025424_2025993_2026015,00.html\" \u003eEqual Rights Amendment\u003c/a\u003e passes.

That is happening now, with the Senate allowing the Violence Against Women Act to expire and doing away with Obama-era guidelines protecting against discrimination based on gender. \u0026ldquo;Constitutional amendments are safe from Donald Trump, unlike Melania\u0026rsquo;s hopes and dreams and any American flag he gets close to,\u0026rdquo; said Oliver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ERA passed the Senate and then the House of Representatives, and then in 1972, the proposed 27th Amendment to the Constitution was sent to the states for ratification. Thirty-seven states have ratified it so far, meaning just one more is needed to make the ERA law. However, momentum for ratification came to a halt, thanks in part to Phyllis Schlafly, described by Oliver as a \u0026ldquo;pre-internet internet troll.\u0026rdquo; Due to her efforts and vitriolic debate, the deadline for ratification came and went.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that the ERA is dead on arrival though. According to Oliver, legal scholars believe that Congress can simply change the deadline again or do away with the deadline entirely and allow the ERA to be ratified. To that point, Nevada and Illinois have ratified the ERA in the last few years and now just one more state is needed to make the ERA law. There are 13 states that Oliver points out could genuinely make history by making the ERA the law of the land. \u0026ldquo;None of this is that complicated,\u0026rdquo; said Oliver. \u0026ldquo;Equality for women should be a basic principle for our society. If you think it already is, great, all the more reason to write it down. And if you think it isn\u0026rsquo;t, then we badly need the ERA.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo do that Oliver beseeched the states to take a stand and ratify the ERA. The states that could make history, include Arizona, Georgia, Oklahoma, either Carolina, Utah, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, Alabama (\u0026ldquo;It definitely won\u0026rsquo;t be you,\u0026rdquo; said Oliver) or Virginia (\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re the birthplace of Chris Brown, Rick Santorum and Pat Robertson, so frankly you owe America this.\u0026rdquo;)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOliver just had one request: \u0026ldquo;Somebody please do it before Florida, because I do not want to give them credit for this.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/time/topstories/~4/KqCi7muIq-0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/KqCi7muIq-0/","published":"2019-06-10T08:52:49Z","guid":"https://time.com/?p=5603729"},{"title":"Internet Entrepreneur Kim Dotcom Fights U.S. Extradition in New Zealand Court","content":"\u003caside class=\"right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad\" id=\"right-rail__ad-5603802\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module video-2\" data-src=\"https://time.com/5603802/kim-dotcom-us-extradition-new-zealand/\" data-widget-id=\"SB_4\" data-ob-template=\"timemag\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(WELLINGTON, New Zealand) \u0026mdash; Internet entrepreneur Kim Dotcom and three of his former colleagues on Monday took their fight against being extradited to the U.S. to New Zealand\u0026#8217;s top court.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Supreme Court began hearing arguments in the seven-year-old case after Dotcom and the others lost several previous court rulings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut even if the men lose their latest appeal, they have legal options which could keep their case alive in the New Zealand court system and delay any extradition for several more years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eU.S. authorities in 2012 shut down Dotcom\u0026#8217;s file-sharing website Megaupload and filed charges of conspiracy, racketeering and money laundering.

Researchers tracked about 1,100 U.S. and U.K. adults, including 240 pairs of twins, for two weeks. They monitored participants\u0026#8217; blood sugar, insulin and fat levels after they ate pre-formulated meals like muffins and glucose drinks; tested the microbes living in their guts; and tracked their sleep and exercise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFoods that spiked one person\u0026#8217;s blood sugar or kept their fat levels elevated for hours didn\u0026#8217;t necessarily do the same for the person dining next to them\u0026mdash;even if they were twins. Individuals even had different responses to the same meals when they were eaten at different times of day. These results suggest that nutrition facts alone cannot predict how a certain food will affect health and weight, Spector says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;It doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean you throw [all nutrition advice] out,\u0026#8221; Spector says. \u0026#8220;There are some guidelines and recommendations around the world that near-everybody agrees on,\u0026#8221; including eating plenty of produce and fiber, and cutting back on calories and\u003ca href=\"https://time.com/5589702/processed-foods-weight-gain-diet/\" \u003e ultra-processed foods\u003c/a\u003e. But plenty of lingering nutrition questions\u0026mdash;\u003ca href=\"https://time.com/5516364/is-eating-breakfast-healthy/\" \u003eIs it okay to skip breakfast\u003c/a\u003e?\u003ca href=\"https://time.com/5354498/is-intermittent-fasting-healthy/\" \u003e Does fasting work\u003c/a\u003e?\u003ca href=\"https://time.com/4919448/low-fat-v-low-carb-diets/\" \u003e Is a low-carb or low-fat diet better for weight loss\u003c/a\u003e?\u0026mdash;may not have one single answer, Spector says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026#8217;s not a terribly surprising finding, especially for anyone whose scale has refused to budge even after careful dieting. That frustrating phenomenon is, in part, why Spector founded\u003ca href=\"https://joinzoe.com/\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003e ZOE\u003c/a\u003e, a company developing a personalized consumer nutrition test. (ZOE also funded the new study.) Spector says he can envision a world where a dieter could search for a food in a personalized database, and immediately get insights into how it would affect their health.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Deborah Good, an associate professor of human nutrition, foods, and exercise at Virginia Tech, says we\u0026#8217;re not there yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile genetic links to certain diet-related conditions, like lactose intolerance and celiac disease, are firmly established, Good says the scientific community doesn\u0026#8217;t fully understand the complicated matrix of genes, environment and biomarkers that influences an individual\u0026#8217;s reactions to a wide range of foods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;We don\u0026#8217;t know enough about all the different things that contribute to it,\u0026#8221; she says. \u0026#8220;Some time in our lifetime we may be able to, at least genetically, be given a set of information at the beginning of our lives [about our health needs]. But we\u0026#8217;re not there yet, and I don\u0026#8217;t know how long it would take.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven some research about gene-specific dieting has been disappointing.\u003ca href=\"https://time.com/5162731/low-fat-low-carb-diet-weight-loss/\" \u003e A major 2018 study\u003c/a\u003e, for example, found that just as many people succeed (or fail) to lose weight on low-carb versus low-fat diets, with no clear reason why. The genetic markers researchers thought would correlate with success on one plan or the other turned out not to, pushing off the prospect of gene-based diets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRather than genetics, Spector says the secret to personalized dieting may rely on the microbiome, or the colony of microbes living in your gut. There\u0026#8217;s still a lot scientists don\u0026#8217;t understand about the microbiome, but buzzy studies suggest it affects\u003ca href=\"https://time.com/5597688/microbiome-diabetes-premature-birth-prediction/\" \u003e many aspects of human health\u003c/a\u003e. The latest study presented at the American Society of Nutrition conference revealed that even identical twins only had about 37% overlap in gut microbes\u0026mdash;compared to 35% for unrelated individuals\u0026mdash;which may explain why they respond to foods differently, Spector says. In light of those differences, Spector says tailoring food choices around the microbiome, not just the genome, may unlock the full potential of personalized eating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScientists still don\u0026rsquo;t know enough about gut bacteria or diet-gene interactions to offer the type of personalized advice that would actually be helpful for dieters. For now, Spector says, all people can do is follow nutrition suggestions that do appear to be universal, like eating a diverse array of plants and cutting back on processed food, and take blanket nutrition guidelines with a grain of salt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/time/topstories/~4/dL4EASfH0Ko\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/dL4EASfH0Ko/","published":"2019-06-10T13:00:48Z","guid":"https://time.com/?p=5600706"}]},{"url":"https://rss.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml","items":[{"title":"Tony Awards 2019: Live Updates","content":"","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/09/theater/tony-awards.html?emc=rss\u0026partner=rss","published":"2019-06-10T00:00:22Z","guid":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/09/theater/tony-awards.html"},{"title":"Sudan Protesters, Devastated but Defiant, Regroup Underground After Crackdown","content":"","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/09/world/africa/sudan-protest-crackdown.html?emc=rss\u0026partner=rss","published":"2019-06-10T00:16:01Z","guid":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/09/world/africa/sudan-protest-crackdown.html"},{"title":"How NYC Taxi Drivers Bought Medallions and Became Victims of a Reckless Lending Scheme","content":"","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/07/the-weekly/nyc-taxi-medallion-suicides-the-weekly.html?emc=rss\u0026partner=rss","published":"2019-06-10T00:20:21Z","guid":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/07/the-weekly/nyc-taxi-medallion-suicides-the-weekly.html"},{"title":"‘Help Us!’ The Panic at D.C.

Even better, it unearths all kinds of new drama, as its scheming socialites try to resume their lives after the events of season one, while evading the scrutiny of the cops, the town, and the mother of the man they may have killed. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"TSxjlC\"\u003eThe season’s first episode dives back into the drama of the lives of the Monterey Five after Perry’s death\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"K5qS7t\"\u003eWhen news of the second season was announced, we at Vox \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/4/3/15162574/big-little-lies-season-2-finale\"\u003ehad our doubts\u003c/a\u003e about how much story the show could sustain after its \u003ca href=\"http://www.vox.com/culture/2017/4/2/15123422/big-little-lies-season-finale-recap-you-get-what-you-need-kidman\"\u003ecataclysmic season one finale\u003c/a\u003e.

But now with director Andrea Arnold (\u003ca href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3721936/?ref_=nm_knf_t1\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eAmerican Honey\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e) at the helm, season two kicks back and has fun with itself while taking a gently probing look at the aftermath of season one. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"5dJKuA\"\u003eEpisode one picks up after a long summer, dropping back in on Madeline, Celeste, Jane, Bonnie, and Renata as they endure the gossip of parents at their kids’ elementary school on the first day of classes. The whole town is talking about them, in fact, as Jane (Shailene Woodley) learns later from a cute co-worker at her new job at the Monterey Bay Aquarium. He informs her that they’ve all become known as the “Monterey Five,” because they were all together and present at the scene on the night Celeste’s husband, Perry Wright, “accidentally” fell to his death. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"lP1VRe\"\u003eThe five of them, following the lead of Madeline (Reese Witherspoon), gave police a modified version of the story where no one was to blame. But the truth about that night — when Bonnie (Zoë Kravitz)  pushed Perry (Alexander Skarsgård) to his death while trying to help stop his violent assault of his wife, Celeste (Nicole Kidman) — has been haunting several of them ever since. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"hrOiNd\"\u003eBonnie in particular has become withdrawn and taciturn since the incident, much to the consternation of Nathan (James Tupper), her husband and Madeline’s ex-husband. Nathan’s so frustrated by the situation he even seeks out Madeline’s current husband, Ed (Adam Scott), and asks him if he can have a heart to heart with Bonnie. Ed, however, derides the idea that talking to his wife’s ex’s new wife would create anything but drama, and tensions between the two men, who were never exactly friendly to begin with, deepen. Bonnie stonewalls Madeline’s own attempts to get her to confide in her, but she makes it clear that she’s having major guilt over her part in Perry’s death and especially the subsequent cover-up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"faM2uN\"\u003eEqually guilt-ridden is Celeste, who’s grappling with a complicated mix of grief for the husband she loved, anger at his abuse, and trauma from her experience. Even worse, she’s doing it all under the laser focus of her mother-in-law, Mary Louise (Meryl Streep), who swings from making polite-but-cold sympathetic gestures, to insinuating what role Celeste played in her son’s death, to unleashing carefully controlled rage. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"zmGchj\"\u003eMary Louise’s presence in the household also makes it more difficult for Celeste to move on from Perry’s violence, especially because her two sons, Josh and Max (real-life twins \u003ca href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm7805172/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t20\"\u003eCameron\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm7805169/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t25\"\u003eNicholas Crovetti\u003c/a\u003e), have picked up some of their father’s abusive habits. We saw glimpses of this in season one, but it seems to have worsened — but with Mary Louise around, it’s not easy for Celeste to warn her boys about being too much like their father. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"4qLEjT\"\u003eIt also makes it harder for Celeste to keep another secret she’s been sharing — that Perry raped Jane and fathered her son, Ziggy. Jane receives regular payouts from Perry’s estate after his death, but she hasn’t been cashing the checks because of her own complicated feelings about the assault. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Bm7KRf\"\u003eThe one woman who’s primarily unbothered by all of this — so far — is Renata (Laura Dern). She’s busy expanding her entrepreneurial pursuits and doing photoshoots for magazine covers. But all is not well in Renata’s immaculate seaside mansion, if her husband’s heavy drinking and depressive behavior is any indication. And if there’s one thing this episode makes clear, it’s that changes are on the way for all of the Five, whether they’re ready for them or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"1fZdRE\"\u003e“What Have They Done?” arrives at the end of a lull before a deluge of consequences\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"34ZGba\"\u003eI initially felt like “What Have They Done?” was deliberately motionless; it reads like the calm before the storm. But in recounting all that happens in it, I realized that this episode is actually full of subtle ebb and flow between characters, all of whom are concentrating their energy on the past — on alternately trying to forget it and making sure it can’t be forgotten. Series creator David E. Kelley, the writer for this episode, emphasizes characters interacting through deflection: again and again, they attempt to communicate or share things with one another, only to be brushed aside or gently rejected. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ivbBV9\"\u003eYou’d think this might be frustrating to watch, but Arnold directs these scenes with a touch of poignance. At the beginning of season one, nearly all of these women hated each other; by the end, they’d formed deeper bonds of friendship out of necessity and collective secrecy. Now, it’s as if the events of season one have left them without the ability to fully communicate because of their common desire to leave the past behind. What\u003cem\u003e Big Little Lies\u003c/em\u003e coheres on now is a kind of paradoxical intimacy: a feeling of mutual protectiveness, expressed while keeping careful distances from each other. Even when Nathan and Ed are getting hostile over their rivalry, you get the sense that they’re still operating under this new community code: a strange dance that allows Nathan to attempt a game of trust and Ed to say no thanks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Y8vaU5\"\u003eIn the middle of all of this denial and avoidance, Meryl Streep is, obviously, brilliantly methodical as the kind of nightmarish mother-in-law who meddles in everyone’s lives without a trace. What she does is so much worse than dramatic scheming: she watches, listens, and waits for her prey to become so unnerved by her that they reveal too much. Streep plays Mary Louise as possessing a strain of grief-driven, myopic self-regard that hovers between tragic and comic; she’s just ever so slightly unhinged, and it’s a delight to watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"w7mqqu\"\u003eEven more delightful is whatever is going on with Renata this season, because even though Laura Dern is barely in this episode, she owns it. Her two-second speech about how she’s not going to pose like a demure prude for a cover story about empowered women is still giving me life, and I can’t wait to see what the show does with her next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"shZanm\"\u003eThis episode as a whole, in fact, breathes new life into a series that seemed to have well and truly concluded. Instead, the cast and creative team have made the resuscitation feel effortless, probing each of its intricate relationships with frequent humor and a gently wry perspective. The season’s central theme — that the secrets of the past have a way of resurfacing — isn’t by any means a new one; but \u003cem\u003eBig Little Lies\u003c/em\u003e has never been predictable, and this go-round feels fresh and engrossing.

Traditionally, the award ceremony is powered by live performances from the year’s Best Musical nominees, but in the 2017 and 2018 seasons, the most exciting race was between the plays. The musicals were either exciting but under-rewarded (2017’s \u003cem\u003eNatasha, Pierre, and the Great Comet of 1812\u003c/em\u003e), or there was \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/6/10/17447270/2018-tony-awards-winners-losers\"\u003ea single beloved show\u003c/a\u003e in a crop of franchise-movie-to-franchise-musical adaptations (we do not speak of 2018). \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"DFe2ia\"\u003eThat’s why at first, things looked bright for 2019’s 73rd annual Tony Awards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"OM2xkj\"\u003eAfter all, the musical race heated up again this year. There were multiple frontrunners, and there was an argument to be made that plenty of them were worthy of the Best Musical trophy — including the big-hearted \u003cem\u003eThe Prom\u003c/em\u003e (traditional music with a sweet queer love story), the smoothly stylish \u003cem\u003eAin’t Too Proud to Beg\u003c/em\u003e (a jukebox musical with soul!), the glitzy and nostalgic \u003cem\u003eTootsie\u003c/em\u003e (it … well, it’s \u003cem\u003eTootsie\u003c/em\u003e), and the excitingly untraditional \u003cem\u003eHadestown\u003c/em\u003e (Greek myth, but make it anti-capitalist!). \u003cem\u003eHadestown\u003c/em\u003e was the night’s projected winner, but it wasn’t a \u003cem\u003eHamilton\u003c/em\u003e-style juggernaut: There was plenty of possibility for a dark horse to upset the race.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"cVNvIO\"\u003eAnd yet in the end, despite a strong Best Musical field, the 2019 Tonys ceremony was kind of a snooze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"TUq7cx\"\u003eWas it the soft-energy hosting from James Corden? Was it the sluggish camerawork that cut up the dancing and frequently neglected to focus on the actors who the audience was supposed to be looking at? Was it the decision from nearly every musical in the program to go with a low-key mood piece rather than a big showstopper? (Shoutout to Best Revival nominee \u003cem\u003eKiss Me Kate\u003c/em\u003e, whose “It’s Too Darn Hot” was a notable exception.) Was it just a quiet year? Whatever it was, we had plenty of time to catalog those who came out of the night ahead — and those who lost something. Here are four winners and one big loser from the 2019 Tony Awards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"9asVX3\"\u003eWinner: \u003cem\u003eHadestown\u003c/em\u003e\n\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"gi4c0D\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/4/22/18508067/hadestown-review-broadway-anais-mitchell-rachel-chavkin\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eHadestown\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e’s 14 nominations made it the most-nominated show of the season, so it was the favorite for Best Musical\u003cem\u003e \u003c/em\u003egoing in.

There’s not too much I can talk about there, but that’s the gist. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"xsstZg\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOkay, so you’re consulting for them, have been consulting for them?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"fQHkH4\"\u003eYeah, working part-time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"PZtcIw\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThey’re using your brain as well.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"oiPJPo\"\u003eCorrect. Yes. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"sysQja\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd we get it for free, awesome. Yeah, I can see lots of things you could do with \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDespicable Me\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e 1, 2, 3, and all of those.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"IwNW8W\"\u003eYeah, they’re phenomenal characters. I think in general, when you take a look at what’s the type of media that goes from one world to another world, you have some of the players in the market. Pixar is a phenomenal storytelling company. I don’t know how many people sit back and they watch \u003cem\u003eCoco\u003c/em\u003e or they watch \u003cem\u003eUp\u003c/em\u003e and they say, “I want to live in this world, I want to take this character in my pocket elsewhere, I want to do a video game or interactive experience.” Illumination in particular is so oriented around character-first storytelling that when you start to take a look at what are the opportunities in interactive, in digital, that’s an incredibly fertile storytelling ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"YjDeg1\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYeah, and you’re speaking to someone who just spent a lot of money to take one of their kids around Universal. We spent a lot of time in the \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDespicable Me\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e corner of the world.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"A5yWee\"\u003eIt’s very popular. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"uXcv6W\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYeah. I’ve got a lot of minion products at our house. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"pn8FBj\"\u003eI can imagine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"MYs5Q5\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOkay, so let’s start talking about how you view the world and then we can work backwards a little bit. We’re speaking a day after Apple’s WWDC conference. A lot of stuff that most regular people don’t care about. Along the way they dropped a three-minute preview of one of their Apple+ TV shows. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Ecn9Ha\"\u003eRight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"04yGgH\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd sure enough, there’s Matt Ball commentary on Twitter about it. Your thought about them displaying that video at WWDC was?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"jYZGzZ\"\u003eI found it pretty surprising that their first opportunity to really show off with their video product was a few months ago at their video-centric release.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"rQL6Fw\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou would think you would do that there.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"B6bByk\"\u003eYou would think so, and the company does have a strange history of when and how they, of course, present their video content.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"6d9LN1\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYeah, you mentioned me indirectly.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"QwtyAs\"\u003eYeah, so when they first came out with their trailer for \u003cem\u003ePlanet of the Apps\u003c/em\u003e, the short-lived TV series that I think came back out in 2017. Their first foray into video, they did that at a $3,000/ticket Code Media conference. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Tjx8R4\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA very successful conference. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"1zgFyi\"\u003eI believe there was a livecast, but those of us listening at home not attending in person couldn’t see the trailer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"YONYk6\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYeah, that’s sort of standard for that sort of thing. They show something in the room, but they can’t stream — which, by the way, Disney just did for their investor day. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"hXmhxa\"\u003eDisney did too, but it’s very strange to have a secretive video program that no one knows about that everyone up into the talent that’s shooting the show, that’s starring in the show, knows very little, and we know nothing about it until they start doing the private behind-the-scenes displays of that trailer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Hxq5D9\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYeah, so let’s just talk about what you think about Apple’s plans as far as we know, what they’re gonna do. Right, where they’ve said this is a subscription product, which could or couldn’t mean you do or don’t pay money for it. It’s coming out in the fall. They’re paying a lot of people with well-known names, Steven Spielberg, Jennifer Aniston, etc., to make content. What do you think they’re trying to do?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"SgtKTP\"\u003eIn the simplest way, I think what they’re trying to do is replicate what Amazon has been doing for several years. If you take a step back and you take a look at the rise of D2C [direct to consumer] services, such as HBO Now or Showtime, those services all launched first and foremost on iOS. I believe HBO had a six- or nine-month first window exclusive to the iOS devices. Despite that fact, Amazon, which has a very strong anchor asset in Prime Video, seems to have by most third-party estimates \u003cem\u003ereally\u003c/em\u003e driven share gains in that share of direct-to-consumer subscriptions. Which is to say, the majority of customers who are signing up for Starz or HBO or Showtime, despite the fact that they tend to have iPhones, they tend to have Apple TVs and iPads, are choosing to subscribe to those services through Amazon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"hELWMR\"\u003eApple is cognizant of that and is trying to understand, what can they do to drive more usage of their ecosystem to make them the primary destination for video services, and it looks like Prime Video is a solution to that. My guess would be that their goal is to come out at a modest monthly price or a free price to broadcast to consumers, “Use us as your core destination for video,” subscribe to HBO through Apple and consolidate all of that usage of iTunes up and down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"0IWC5U\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis is weird. This sounds like something I wrote.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"dfYGQp\"\u003eThat wouldn’t surprise me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"8VqNKi\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd so broadly, right, the idea is Amazon sells subscriptions to other people’s stuff through Amazon. That has been a good business for Amazon. Apple would like to do the same thing. They already do that. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Z1lXuz\"\u003eRight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Lw4MLw\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBy the way, you can already buy HBO and Showtime, etc., and the thought is we’re going to spend maybe billions of dollars to create content that we’re either going to give away or give away for a very little fee in order to get people to hang out and buy more stuff.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"snmv51\"\u003eCorrect. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"U6bsbv\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFacebook, I think, is still exploring this idea. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"tVdmXj\"\u003eMm-hmm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"NgqNDx\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBasically, we’re just going back to the old TV guide world, except it’s TV guide plus buying other services, right? Everyone wants to own that sort of dominant home screen, whatever that right metaphor is for video viewing. Right?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"IHzp4K\"\u003eYeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"jBaQva\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIt’s sort of obvious? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"dBxPtx\"\u003eI think that’s right. When you take a look at what’s distinctive at video versus music through licensing agreements for the fragmentation of the industry, services such as Apple and Spotify are able to effectively get \u003cem\u003eall\u003c/em\u003e of the content in existence and offer it to subscribers. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"UlIOk7\"\u003eYou can’t do that in video for a number of different reasons, which means that at the end of the day, as long as you believe consumers will want some video that you can’t produce or you can’t acquire, you have to find opportunities to bring that all together. We know from the era of traditional television, that aggregated experience, the pay-TV bundle, adds value to it. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"SK2HIR\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAdds value to who?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Rl81qE\"\u003eThe consumer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Lxpa0U\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYeah.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Yg1s8R\"\u003eJust imagine if you needed to hook up a different input on your TV to watch HBO versus Showtime. You needed a different line into your house to watch ABC versus ESPN. That’s a terrible experience. No one \u003cem\u003ewants\u003c/em\u003e that. There’s friction. My parents can still barely understand how to change their inputs from one to another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"HAgTV0\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIt’s the same reason when the music companies first try to do digital music, they actually did break up labels and there was like a Universal and BMG label, and one that was Warner and EMI, whatever it was. So that doesn’t work. We could talk about the merits of the bundle, but it’s clear that Apple wants to get into this sort of creating their own bundle, selling versions of the bundle. Do you think that they need to spend billions of dollars to create video to make this work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"3Qt4oB\"\u003eI don’t know whether or not they do or don’t to make it work. I think what they are seeing is that they’re struggling to compete with Amazon in that video space, despite some of the aforementioned advantages, and they’re trying to figure out ways to improve that offering. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"AKu5O3\"\u003eAnd they know that people are particularly passionate about video. They know that their brand can attract top-tier creators, and so the idea that they can take some of their cash reserves, put out about a dozen or a half-dozen TV shows per year, and use that to become an anchor asset around that video content, is a very plausible strategy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"xazqHp\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePlausible?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ACS1Cw\"\u003ePlausible. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"wytQcL\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd you’re ... We’ll talk about this more, but you’re pretty fierce at least writing-wise, right? You’re a big fan of Netflix. I think you’re pro-Disney, we can talk about this. I think you’re quite skeptical with Time Warner, so when you say Apple’s plan is plausible that counts as a compliment, right?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"pP0UTh\"\u003eIt does count as a compliment. I think it’s one bolstered by the massive reach they have, and with all these tech companies, to some extent, it comes down to a question of how long and how deep do you want to play for this? They have the opportunity to take a third pass at video. If you count \u003cem\u003ePlanet of the Apps\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eCarpool Karaoke\u003c/em\u003e as the first. They also have the time to spend 10 years trying to get this right. Video isn’t going anywhere, attention isn’t going anywhere, nor are their systemic hardware advantages. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"TeEucV\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRight, so if Apple gets this wrong, right, let’s say they just completely boff this. They can still recover, they can still have ... Their iPhone business isn’t going away, right? They’re trying to build up additional businesses?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Rr6OZ0\"\u003eRight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"JFXV8o\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLet’s go through some of the other big media companies. So you are a big Netflix fan.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"l9UD3c\"\u003eI am. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"OsnVfH\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou’ve written about them multiple times. Usually, along ... and it’s great. You have a ... You do these tweetstorms and then you also do actual written copy. The tweetstorms get longer and longer, and then you retweet yourself, periodically. It’s kind of fun to watch the recursive ...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Havyf9\"\u003eIt’s a good format.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"LTYeKj\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYeah, for you. What is the thing ... And you’re always telling people what they don’t understand about Netflix. What is the big thing most people don’t understand about Netflix?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"rQBT3q\"\u003eI think the biggest thing that’s misunderstood about Netflix is really what their objective is. If you take a look at the company overall, the primary competitors that are identified are the HBOs, are the Amazons, are the Hulus. What’s different is, Netflix overall is going after what we would today consider pay TV. An aggregated bundle of all genres, all styles, that is intended to deliver to audiences for multiple hours per day of usage. You take away ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"TMj1Zl\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRight, \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ethey\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e are the bundle. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"0DNP4r\"\u003eCorrect. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ZbNTeN\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIn their minds.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"JzpAl9\"\u003eThe difference is they are bundling all of those genres — what we used to consider different styles of content or networks — all within one, and so the difference there is, when you take a look at what Netflix is doing, as an example, there’s a lot of criticism as to the average quality that they put out. The fact that HBO’s average quality of programming is very different, it’s higher, it’s more elevated, it’s more aspirational.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"RDOb6I\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYeah. You hear this a lot from people who work in media. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"K8OvZw\"\u003eYou do, but I think the difference is many of those people in media \u003cem\u003ealso\u003c/em\u003e produce content that you would consider easier going, more “low-brow” if you want to use a loaded term, but the reality is audiences watch five-and-a-half hours per day of video. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"zjYVyy\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd they’re not all watching \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDowntown Abbey\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e, though.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"vGqIGl\"\u003eThey’re not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"kCvQ6P\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDownton\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e. It’s not \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDowntown Abbey\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e. I’ve never watched it anyway.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"fa1Ur0\"\u003eBut that’s the point. Some of that time per day is highly intentional prioritized time. The lights are off, your screens are off, you’re not whispering to your partner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"tqgvOA\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd if there’s something I want to watch that’s specific, I’m choosing it.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"JrBEPP\"\u003eRight. The reason why you have five-and-a-half hours a day of video — which seems impossible — is the fact that much of that is multitasking. You are cleaning up after your kids, you’re cooking dinner, you’re relaxing, you got off work. You don’t really want to pay attention, you just want to listen. You want to be idly entertained. Netflix is going after the entirety of that consumption. That means programming differently, that means spending differently, that means building a service arranged around different principles, and so when companies look at Netflix and they say, look at what they’re acquiring, look at what they’re not acquiring, look at the volume of spend, it’s all oriented around that massive pie of video.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"eJO3xA\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNow, when ... In the past, when Reed Hastings would talk about competition he’d mention Verizon or Amazon and he still will, and a lot of times there’s a lot of focus on HBO, for a while now he’s been saying things like “our major competitor is Fortnite” or “our major competitor is sleep,” and it’s kind of a wink and a nudge, but you take it very seriously. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"tnehY3\"\u003eI do take it seriously, and I think to some extent, that focus does explain why the company has been so resilient. So you take a look at the past six years, Netflix has effectively grown its pricing by 60 percent. Their catalog is believed to have shrunk by anywhere from 40 percent to 60 percent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"fz7cla\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBecause the networks are pulling stuff back, and/or they’re saying we don’t want to pay network X for this stuff.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"cUIdCR\"\u003eCorrect. They’ve had to go from 15 percent penetration — the early adopters who usually have lower standards are more willing to try things — to an excess of 50 percent penetration in the US. Those customers who are late adopters, they’re typically harder to get. Despite having their price go up, their offering go down, reaching harder-to-reach customers, the company continues to grow as quickly as possible. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"PCyRyP\"\u003eThe answer to that is twofold. One is the company is excelling in the space they’re operating. That’s digital video, direct-to-consumer video, and the traditional ecosystem of pay TV is rapidly eroding. They don’t need to monopolize much of that share shift to still grow. What’s important there is implicit in what Reed is saying is they know that when 10 minutes are taken from the old system they’re going to win two to three to four or at least one of those minutes. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Ud1Lgj\"\u003eWhat he also knows, however, is sometimes that decision is earlier. It is not, “I’m going to watch video online,” it’s not, “I’m not going to watch paid TV, I’m going to watch Netflix.” It’s customers saying, “I want to spend time doing something, what am I going to do? Actually, I think I’m going to do video gaming. Actually, I think I’m going to play Fortnite.” That’s an earlier-stage decision, and what he’s reflecting on is the fact that they’re increasingly losing that choice and they can’t compete there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"VMLrjU\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd so when he talks about, like they ... If you go visit Netflix in the last few months, they play up this interactive stuff they’re playing, right? I’m going to call it choose your adventure. They call it something branched storytelling. It’s choose your adventure video.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"A0XXL6\"\u003eRight. I believe there’s a trademark issue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"dMknOm\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYeah, and sometimes they get offended by it, too. Or Steven Soderbergh did. “Branching narratives.”\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"SiYhNJ\"\u003eRight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"g5EwRo\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThat’s the term. To choose your adventure. But there’s not sort of a linear path, right? Where you say, “well, if we make our stuff more interactive, thus we’ll compete more with Netflix.” That’s just saying one of the things our customers might want to do is interact with our video. If they want to do that, and that makes them more likely to hang out with us than do something else, great. But it’s not a direct sort of, “We’re going to compete with Fortnite by doing X.”\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"1dWy4Q\"\u003eI think the more important way to think about it is really in this idea that what we traditionally think of as video games and what we traditionally think of as video is converging. We saw that a few years ago with Twitch, with more communal cheer-based, text-based, live experiences. That delineation between those two on extremes is continuing to meld.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"JgU73i\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, you think my thought that video games are something you do in one part of the house around one screen or one device or watching TV is something you do, it’s a distinct thing, that’s an old fuddy-duddy way of looking at it, and everyone is ... younger folks are going to increasingly converge?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"blXH6V\"\u003eYeah, I think so, and we’ve already seen numerous examples of that. So to take a step back, if you take a look at video gaming as a category, video gaming’s primary limitation today is the fact that the skill requirements are very high, the degree of immersion is very high. So if you take a look at that idea of how is it that 300 million Americans spend five-and-a-half hours a day watching video, it’s because it reflects, it allows, that full range of engagement. The challenge for video games is trying to find opportunities to allow for more passive play, to reduce the skill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"VqdiPW\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you pick up Fortnite for the first time ...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"6F3iB2\"\u003eIt’s intimidating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"JYGsxg\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEspecially if you’re old.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"MSwGHJ\"\u003eYeah. Well, and frankly, the very premise of Fortnite is how quickly it adapts. To some extent, and I talk about this with a friend of mine who you know, if you stop playing for a month, even that time can be daunting. So, what you’re seeing is whether that’s coming from the traditional game makers or the mobile game makers trying to make more of a leaned-back passive gaming experience or you see the video-related companies — and again, Soderbergh made \u003cem\u003eMosaic\u003c/em\u003e with HBO a year ago. \u003cem\u003eBandersnatch\u003c/em\u003e, that’s coming from the other angle. That’s bringing some interactivity and some involvement to video.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"miOKs2\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo you don’t have any spidey-sense, like when we saw 3-D a few years ago, and everyone said, “Oh, 3-D is the thing, we’re going to invest heavily in it,” and then they went to VR, “That’s the thing and we’re going to invest heavily in it,” and everyone sort of moved at once. And then we hit the valley, and everyone said, “Actually, consumers don’t actually want this.” You’re pretty confident consumers do want this. You point to things like Fortnite as an argument that, yeah, they’re doing it. You don’t have to worry about this being theoretical.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"CZx2Fc\"\u003eYeah, I think that’s right. I mean, if we were to take apart why 3-D worked, why VR didn’t work, and when and if those might come around, there are distinct reasons for that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"PaZwll\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYeah.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"KN84LZ\"\u003eI think the difference here is we have seen interactivity building for quite some time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"1YVzSs\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIt’s hard for me to gauge because, again, I’m way out of the demo, but ESPN did this thing at game two of the NBA Finals on Sunday where they said we’re going to have an alternate feed, which they’ve been doing for awhile. The alternate feed makes sense to me, but we’re going to do one aimed specifically at teens, and what we’re going to do is we’re going to get Katie Nolan, our sort of millennial-ish host, put here with three other people and they’re going to talk while the game is going on. We’re going to flash up graphics, like you’d see if you were playing an EA game, and they’re just going to chat. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"28f2Q1\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd I watched it, in and out, and again way out of the demo, it seemed terrible to me. And I can’t tell whether the idea is terrible or if it’s an execution thing, and/or if this is the kind of thing that an ESPN no matter how diligently they try, won’t be able to solve. If someone’s going to solve interactive sports it’s going to be a nontraditional company.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"RL3l8k\"\u003eOr the answer is you’re just too far out of the demo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"LBqq05\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYeah.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"qdqbwv\"\u003eIt may just be that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"3AG7kN\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYeah. Did you watch that?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"R8sAMM\"\u003eI haven’t watched it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"r6sO9t\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOkay. You take a look. It has ... As I said, I describe it as being \u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://giphy.com/gifs/30-rock-sme-how-do-you-1Qdp4trljSkY8\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ethe Steve Buscemi gif\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e, right? The, “Hey, kids.” It just seemed like I got ... It looked like, as I said, if you looked at Twitch for the first time and said, “Oh, well, how could we do this?” You’d end up with something that looks like this, except if you look ... I think the lesson here, I’m guessing, is it’s very hard for the incumbent company to figure out how to do a different version of itself. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"z2iFay\"\u003eYou cautioned me on giving long answers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"bTGLzQ\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYeah.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ysZEkN\"\u003eI’ll give you the longer answer, or rather the shorter version of said long answer. I think the key thing to keep in mind is what’s always interesting when you have a delivery change or a technology and distribution change is not so much how that content moves from one device to another device, but what new content is created, to begin with. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"g627gs\"\u003eThere are numerous examples of that. So to take an example, I was speaking recently to the former CEO of Square Enix, Wada-san, and he was talking about the fact that the original console or rather ... Let me step back. The gaming companies that led in the arcade era struggled to move over to the console era. That’s your Super Nintendo, that’s your PlayStation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"A2YXaw\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYeah.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"az5tby\"\u003eFor very fundamental reasons, when you played an arcade game, that experience was tapped out at 30 minutes. You couldn’t save, you don’t have multiple people playing. The skill set required to develop games there were very different than at home, where you could have a 20-hour story. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"XmRyIw\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo even though it’s video games, it’s a whole different idea.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"eirRVl\"\u003eRight. You’re trained to a different feedback loop. You hire different creators. You think creatively in a different way. Then you have the advent of mobile games. Very different format, very different monetization. We don’t see any of those classic companies. Even when we look at online games, the gaming companies that primarily thrived in the ’90s and the early 2000s are very different than those that really struggled in the online world or rather thrived in the online world\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"6xgrSf\"\u003eAnd then even we have an example today of Fortnite, which is a very different conception of an online game that frankly the Activision Blizzards of the world — themselves leaders in early online gaming — are struggling to replicate. That whole premise is important when you think about how interactivity comes from. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"cfQssx\"\u003eThe question is not necessarily, “Is this going to be engaging, is the technology too early, is it just hitting the right demo?” It’s going to take some time for the new creatives to emerge, to want to play with these tools, to see whether Bandersnatch works, how it does, what the limitations are. And to some extent, for audiences to digest how those experiences work. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"RXsGsN\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo this isn’t just a matter of ESPN saying, “Well look, if we’re going to do this, we’ve got to hire whoever works at Twitch,” or, “We’ve got to go hire the Fortnite team. However we’re going to make our stuff more interactive, we’ve got to go find those people.” It’s, “We also have to let people come to us, and say, ‘Here’s what we want to do with your product.’”\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"HDhlSz\"\u003eYeah, I think a huge part of it is actually just going to be the younger audience members, who have sat there watching for five years, 10 years, frustrated by what they can’t do. It’s that anecdote that people give, where their 2-year-old picks up a hard-copy magazine, tries to swipe it and can’t. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"uUvlZz\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOr yells at it. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"gvit3t\"\u003eRight. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"PxWH40\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThat’s the new one. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Xqwup0\"\u003eAnd so I think the question is, as you have this new generation that is used to different interaction models, used to spending their leisure time differently, then watches traditional sports and has a want for something, or wants to take it in a different way, a different expression. Once that talent, to some extent, grows up, to another another extent moves into more traditional media, that convergence of gaming and media occurs, that’s where you’ll start to see the innovation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"XhhZoM\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThat answer was not too long, that’s a great answer. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Ptz4Za\"\u003eI can make it longer. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"qg2AAe\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNo, no. This is great. I want to go through a few more media companies and then I want to talk more about you. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"39cfNS\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou’re a big Netflix fan, but you’re also a Disney fan. You like what Disney announced. There’s a shorthand for all this stuff, that sloppy thinkers like me do and they say, “Oh, this is a Netflix killer,” but that’s just a sloppy headline. You like both what Netflix is doing and you also think what Disney has lined up is also going to be a successful product.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"u4L1qv\"\u003eRight. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"3uZdr9\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBecause?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"c42Q7J\"\u003eI think at the end of the day, the interesting thing about taking a look at the future of SVOD, or these subscription video on demand services is, as is always with technology and companies in the media space, we get into this very Manichean narrative that basically says “distribution is king” or “content is king.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"HhXuwP\"\u003eBoth of these companies are likely to survive, for very different oppositional reasons. We know that Disney’s huge advantage here is their IP is so stellar. Frankly it’s actually so strong you are likely to underestimate how popular it is, not overestimate it or even value it appropriately. They may be coming late to market, but they are coming out with such a high volume of outstanding quality. And if we want to talk about Warner later a little bit, we can talk about that, a brand that consumers already know and love, that they’re ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"SdCF3B\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMultiple brands, right? Disney means a lot to a lot of people, but so does Marvel, so does Pixar.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"bk0VXB\"\u003eRight. And crucially, this is also content that audiences in the States alone are still spending in excess of $3 billion a year for home video for, for rental and DVDs, for just Disney. So, they’re bringing a fundamentally better consumer value proposition to a market that will bundle all the best content in the world, and is fundamentally about asking audiences to take existing spend, and not make room in their lives for more spend, for another video service, but instead to just change the channel, from Walmart to Best Buy, or iOS or Disney. That, I think, is going to be fundamentally successful. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"76OBUp\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIt’s funny, I’ve literally talked to my kids about the fact that we generally sort of buy/rent, we buy a movie a month, give or take. I said, “Well we’re going to stop doing that, because we’re going to be adding this Disney service.” And they said, “Oh,” and they thought through it, “Okay, fine.” Good, done. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"irfGEh\"\u003eRight, and there’s actually significant upside to Disney, because if you think about that $3.2 billion in consumer spend, half of that is markup that goes to the retailer. Half of that is captured by Best Buy or Walmart, it’s not going to Disney. Disney is likely to capture the entirety of that, or go after the entirety of that, with their SVOD service. So I think the point is, Disney is so strong in content, that to some extent ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"XRmmLi\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIt can show up late.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"e4G4XZ\"\u003eIt doesn’t matter whether it was this year or last year or even 2021. That content is still going to resonate. There’s still going to be demand for it. The fact that that is launching within a much broader Disney ecosystem ... There are still 30 million people who go to a Disney Park a year, the opportunity to give that as a free trial, to push it, to give a family that spends $5,000 on a cruise line a year-long subscription ... all of those augment their opportunity to get it. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"qITWjU\"\u003eBut what’s critical about that is, even when you think about Disney’s advantage, if you say that Disney is this example of “content is king,” many of the advantages that I just mentioned aren’t really about content. It’s about access. It is about cannibalization opportunity. It is about how you package or go to market. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"SPAm95\"\u003eSo the big story, and then if you look at Netflix, is really about distribution. But how do they do that? They’ve got it by buying the best content on Earth, in high volumes, typically at prices they shouldn’t have ever gotten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"zDdUnM\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis is Netflix we’re talking about?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"h0bdRM\"\u003eNetflix. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"IsUoh8\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYeah. They took everyone’s great content, and even mediocre content, and said, “We’re going to make something new with this.”\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"CemPfj\"\u003eRight. And so I think when you take a look at this apparent strangeness of being bullish on both, that’s because the market says it’s distribution, it’s content. Neither is really a pure play on either, that’s why the media industry is so interesting, why the technology shifts happen so often. There’s nothing oppositional about that. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"SBWbk6\"\u003eSeparate to that is when you say, “What is it that Netflix is scared of Disney doing?” Disney is not going after that five-and-a-half hours per day of video consumption. They don’t produce nearly enough of it. Their price point is low, but even if it were twice that, it’s not going to convince someone who’s watching, on average, 60 hours per month of Netflix, “You don’t need it anymore, because now you’re spending $8 on Disney.” They’re complementary. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"POtyQs\"\u003eThe question is like any other. We have always had times in the history of video where you have a primary service that drives tremendous value, that is bulk viewing, high tonnage, low cost per hour watched, and audiences still make time in their lives to go after what’s most important to them. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ds47dW\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo people have limited time, limited money ...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"NAKaat\"\u003eRight. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"mhoGTn\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut you think it’s a pretty good bet to think that they’re going to spend $10, $13, $15, $16 a month on Netflix, and watch a lot of stuff there, and for another $7 they’re going to watch less stuff from Disney, but stuff they really value.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"tLStxy\"\u003eRight. And frankly, HBO is the best hallmark of that. You had to spend $100 per month to get HBO, traditionally, and that means you were accessing untold thousands of TV shows per month, and audiences still said, “I’m going to spend an extra $15 to get HBO.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"meIR9r\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAny reason to think that the fact that Disney has not been in the business of streaming, it doesn’t have that technical expertise that Netflix has been building for years and years and years and had to go out and buy it, via BAMTech, etc., that that will be an issue for them? Or is it actually once, you know, actually streaming the stuff over the internet’s not that complicated in 2019?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Pegh4q\"\u003eYeah, I think there are a few different ways to unpack that. Firstly, the product and technology experience is highly critical. If you take a look at all of the advances that Netflix has made, that they’ve invested in, the supposed benefits that they’ve accrued from that, you have to put a lot of stock into that. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"yQQIpw\"\u003eAt the same time, there are three other elements there. One is, they have bought BAMTech, which is the market leader that has been in the business for 20 years, supporting most of the most-scaled transmissions globally. If you are buying expertise, they may have overpaid, they may have underpaid, they might have gotten a fair price, but they bought the best in the business. They also now own Hulu. Also has tremendous expertise in technology. And then finally, no matter how important product and technology is, like any technology, it \u003cem\u003eis\u003c/em\u003e getting easier at the basics level each year. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"DEli5h\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe’ve gone over Disney, Netflix, Apple, I’m going to save Amazon for a second. I’m thinking you were more skeptical about the company we used to call Time Warner. Now we call it AT\u0026amp;T/WarnerMedia.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"iEwpfx\"\u003eI think that’s fair to say, but one of the reasons why\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eyou have to do that is there are really two components here. One is, what’s the offering that’s going to come forward, and then the separate is, what’s the market context that’s already going to exist?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"6wmLxP\"\u003eWhen you spoke a minute ago about the fact that audiences are going to pay $7 for Netflix, or rather ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"LvGcj3\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$7 for Disney. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"xJQM1i\"\u003e$7 for Disney and then $12 for Netflix, you have to look at it at a broader context. Amazon has said that Prime is in 100 million homes. That means 100 million homes have access to a very large catalog of Prime Video, for zero. We know that in the United States, there are 28 million homes that have Hulu. That’s a number growing by 6-8 million per year. If Apple comes out at a free price point, you’re now all of a sudden going to have 1 billion active iPhones that have access to that content.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Gk3utU\"\u003eOnce you look at those default subscriptions, the free services like Apple, like Amazon, the effectively free services like a Netflix, the guaranteed services, or at least very compelling services like Netflix, you start to get into a world in which you are spending $20-30 getting a tremendous amount of content. The real question there is, we know that on digital, the feedback loops are very strong. You’re watching on Netflix, you’re less likely to plug out and plug in, you’re just going to keep watching. You know that there’s so much content, you’re never ever going to finish it anyway. It becomes very tough to say, “How are you going to go to market and, say, pay even another $5?” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"85jbkh\"\u003eSo when we take a look at the WarnerMedia offering, and I don’t know any of the details there, the content can be really strong, but the value proposition is a little bit unclear. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"sXpZxW\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYeah, so there were two stories in the last couple days about this. Time said they’re trying to figure out how much to charge for this. They’re built in to their cable distribution deals, that HBO has to be $15 a month, so do you charge more by adding other stuff in there? Do you throw in other stuff and make that free? And then John Stankey did an interview with Bloomberg, within hours of that story coming out, and saying, basically it’s going to be $15, but whatever it is, it’s going to be some kind of ... there’ll be HBO, and then they’ll add more stuff and they may or may not charge extra for it.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"BU2oX3\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe standard AT\u0026amp;T argument has been, “We have HBO. They’re the best. We have all this other stuff we put out through Turner. We’re going to spend more money to make more stuff. We have Warner Bros., the actual movie studio. We’ve got a ton of stuff. People are going to love what we have.” You seem more skeptical, about the sheer tonnage argument/brand argument. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Ms7fZb\"\u003eI think the truth of the matter is less around how I might adjudicate the quality or the volume of the Time Warner/WarnerMedia content, but the reality is, there are many different players in market who have sizable catalogs. NBCUniversal is making a very similar argument. Disney is making a similar argument. Sony has a large catalog. MGM has a large catalog. Some are being retained internally, some are still going to be sold on the open marketplace. The reality is, everyone has a large library. They’ve been in this business for quite some time. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Wj3kC5\"\u003eThat’s different from saying two things. One is that consumers today are going to value that in an à la carte experience. The second is that you are going to be able to build a large, viable business. And then again, you put that within the market context of where we are. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"rd6cmx\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou said Disney has stuff that they do value enough, the brand is meaningful enough, it’s going to work. Everyone else, question mark. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"qSe6Pa\"\u003eYeah, and part of that is really just a question of brand. I think there are a number of people in the marketplace who have said that Disney would be better off just selling their content to Netflix, and of course there are going to be many consumers who sit back and they say, “I kind of preferred when I could see \u003cem\u003eBlack Panther\u003c/em\u003e on Netflix and now you’re saying I have to go pay for it on Disney.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"3dH3gp\"\u003eAt the same time, I think that there is a very valid argument that consumers, that families and parents, would prefer a dedicated Disney-branded service. They know what Disney stands for, they know what’s in Disney, they know what Disney’s going to do and what Disney’s never going to do. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"4R20af\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNot going to find weird shit there. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"4HynAR\"\u003eRight. The idea I think of assembling a WarnerMedia offering is just more challenging because that connection between the brands, what that brand means, is just a lot more opaque. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"6q601E\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRight. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e kids know what DC means.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"lf4OSv\"\u003eThey know what DC is, and we’ve seen AT\u0026amp;T has been trying to build, or rather WarnerMedia was, back when it was Time Warner, a DC-centric offering. This is not altogether dissimilar from one of the advantages that Fox News has, that may be vestigial, may not be, but the fact is Fox has always branded very strongly, Fox Business Network, Fox Broadcast Company, Fox Sports. They’re all these strange inheritances that we’ve gotten from the old world, that do or do not position you well. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"l7gm2W\"\u003eTo some extent, no one knew, when HBO came out in the ’70s, that all of a sudden in the late 2000s, pay TV would erode.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"NCKTn8\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJust boxing and soft-core porn. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"tnwRYc\"\u003eRight, but not even from a content perspective. It just so happened that if the new thing is SVOD, having an à la carte premium cable network positioned you phenomenally well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"jrH8C6\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI do want to ask you about bundles and re-bundling. At the beginning of this, you were explaining how the bundles have great value to customers, lots of people have argued that persuasively, it seems pretty clear that, like, you’re better off paying one small fee.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"yBfLvd\"\u003eI think the real point is, aggregation has value. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"WMZWUn\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOkay. Frequently when someone writes about ... Oh, everyone’s ... There’s a Disney service and a Warner service and Amazon, etc. By the way, these things are splitting up even more, right? So the Netflix stuff is going to disperse to different services. The Hulu stuff is going to ... The NBCUniversal stuff is going to come off Hulu, go to somewhere else. Inevitably, someone says, “Boy, it seems like someone’s going to have to create a service that takes all these channels and bundles them together. We can call it cable TV, ha ha ha.” \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"zJLJvg\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd then the non-joke version is, paying for all this stuff is going to be too much and we should just go back to the old cable TV days. I have a counter to that, but I want to hear yours. Or I want to hear what you think of that argument.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"pGnGi0\"\u003eThere are two things that are important there. One is, there has been a lot of disruption, as I mentioned earlier, about how we access and who we pay to access content, but the reality is that content hasn’t been disrupted. Content today is no cheaper to produce than it was five-10 years ago. Anything that consumers want to consume in massive volumes is going to just, through tonnage, be expensive. That’s the same with gas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Gqd6yz\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat about \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eall\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e the stuff on YouTube that is free/nearly free?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"HgYukn\"\u003eBut again, there are not 300 million Americans saying, “I want to watch five-and-a-half hours of YouTube.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"9bvPmn\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut there are a lot of Americans watching a lot of it, right? So isn’t some of it just demographic? I mean, again, not everything is my kids, but my kids will watch unlimited amounts of people playing Fortnite on YouTube.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"5sz6eg\"\u003eYeah, that’s true. And we’ll see how that shakes out, but I think the core is, there is still demand for massive amounts of content that has not gotten cheaper, and in fact most of the new entrants, Amazon, Apple, and so forth ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"O56wwT\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRight, it’s more expensive now.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Rv9gPC\"\u003eAre coming in with more. At Amazon, we took a British series, \u003cem\u003eTop Gear\u003c/em\u003e. We reinterpret it as \u003cem\u003eThe Grand Tour\u003c/em\u003e. The budgets reportedly went up by several fold. The reality is, most of these companies are actually saying, “We’re going to give you bigger, better, more expensive content.” That money has to go somewhere, whether there’s a bundle or whether there’s not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"je0waQ\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut it doesn’t have to go to TV, right?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"7zgtnm\"\u003eIt doesn’t have to. But the audience is choosing that they still want it there. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"THrxGF\"\u003eAnd then the second component is just, until audiences say, “We either want to reduce how much we watch, or we just want to take what Netflix has,” you’re not going to see a reduction. As long as no one can corner the market in video, and as long as audiences are still going to say, “I want some of that, I want some of that, I want some of that,” it’s going to be expensive. The bundle needs to exist. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"bpsm6d\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut they haven’t had the choice to live in an unbundled world, up until now. Now they’re getting there, and now they’re getting to the point where they’re saying, “You know what I really value? I really value Netflix, and whatever is there. I really value Disney. Maybe I value one or two other things, maybe I think Quibi’s great, maybe I think the WarnerMedia thing is great.” Whatever it is. “Maybe I’m going to pay for some version of ESPN, or something in sports.” \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"IDh992\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe point is, what I’m going to pay is finite, especially now that I have the actual choice. I think that it’s going to be very difficult for a lot of these services to survive because people aren’t going to say, “I want this and this and this and this.” They’ll say, “I want these two things, and the rest of it I can live without.”\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"07fudC\"\u003eYeah, I certainly agree with that, and as I mentioned earlier, one of the big challenges is, we ask this existential question which is, “How many services is it going to be?” John Stankey has said that he believes this — this is the CEO of WarnerMedia. He doesn’t think it’s going to be as many as 10, he thinks it’s going to be more than four. There’s this really critical question, if you’re a participant in this space, “Is it five or is it seven?” That’s a massive difference. The real challenge to me is not so much “are there going to be five or are there seven?” but how many of those five or seven are the free services that are just going to squeeze everyone out? \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"9OrUf8\"\u003ePeople take for granted now that Prime Video is going to be one of those. They say that that’s because Prime Video is spending more than anyone else, save for Netflix. That may or may not be true, but at the end of the day when it’s being given away for free to 100 million households, that’s a guaranteed slot. If Apple does the same thing, it’s a guaranteed slot. Then you have those who have been first to market, such as Netflix. Then you have those like Disney, who are just need-to-haves. That makes it very ruthless for those who are left, and if you believe that it’s not going to get to 10, it’s very hard to see how many people are going to win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Uuz9aq\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo if you’re AT\u0026amp;T, you should be ... nervous?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"6cvn7c\"\u003eI think you can see that they’re nervous, and you can see that because they have multiple different video products in market. They have been very aggressive in launching new ones, and also very aggressive in cutting back those who don’t work. They also have a product like DirecTV Now, which they have continuously re-keyed, re-bundled, changed the programming cost structure for, cut the price for, raised the price for. It’s a company that is trying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"EfcK2h\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo it’s a company that spent  $85-100 billion dollars on this thing, and you might consider them underdogs in this race?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"CzWIcC\"\u003eI think the question of how they’re an underdog really depends on to what extent you’re looking at HBO. As said before, if you wanted to be a late entrant, there is no better gateway asset than HBO on earth, and the reality is, no matter how good Disney is, Disney’s still starting from zero. HBO in the United States has 36-38 million subscribers. They’ve got another 90 or 100 million globally. They have a stunning brand. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"0kZECq\"\u003eHow you use that asset is challenged by its price point, by it’s most-favored nations clauses for current distribution, the fact that it is not an ad-supported system, the protection of the brand, those are all challenges, but if you said that you were an underdog and you got to use HBO, people would laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"8ikP1C\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYeah, all right. That’s a good laugh. I wanted to see what you said anyway. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"vAWQDh\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNow we’re going to discuss who Matthew Ball is. You first started coming to my attention under someone else’s name. You were not Matthew Ball at that point, you were writing for Jason Hirschhorn under a pseudonym. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ikuquw\"\u003eI was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"C9F4jE\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat was the pseudonym?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"mdYoJY\"\u003eLiam Boluk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"vgMjvn\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Liam Boluk?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"xBAc4U\"\u003eLiam is my middle name, Boluk is my mother’s maiden name, and it has this brilliant aftereffect of being incredibly SEO-optimized. Any time that I was picked up or covered ... It has been nine years and I guarantee you you’re not getting false hits. There’s a ballerina who shares my name who constantly destroys my search relevance, and yet Liam persists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"pN7jbz\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou’re a handsome man, you do not look like a ballerina. But maybe you do, who knows. I don’t want to judge. I don’t want to pre-judge. I don’t want to keep talking about ballerinas. What were you doing prior to writing for Jason Hirschhorn? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"tzBliJ\"\u003ePrior to that, I was a management consultant at Accenture. I focused on corporate strategy, primarily for media and entertainment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"tsqIy2\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWas that a first job out of school type of thing?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"RBlEe0\"\u003eYeah. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"5hSVr6\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYeah. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Dm4MCu\"\u003eWell, first job out of B school, which is ... I’m Canadian. In Canada, is an undergraduate job.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Q9DLpD\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI detected this. Yeah. Okay, so you do the standard, “I’m going to be a consultant”?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"2XXeMU\"\u003eYeah, so the story of me connecting with Jason is a funny one, and a really lucky one on my part, which is ... I entered management consulting with this perception of the halcyon days that probably ended in ’97, where you do two years of management consulting and everyone wants to hire you. They’re desperate to, you’re the best, you’re the brightest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"q0CRiE\"\u003eI then found, out once I got there, that that was subsequently actually investment banking, and then the time period I was in, it was actually going to tech. It was going to Google in 2004. It wasn’t ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"NmLGyp\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYeah, plus also consulting got blown up, sort of post-Enron.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"zmj32u\"\u003eGot blown up 500 times bigger, and so forth. And so, at the same time, I had been writing, just out of general interest with the stuff that I had been learning, that I had disagreed with, that I wanted to talk about, and I started writing under my own name, and it ended up pretty popular. Felix Salmon wrote a big piece. He disagreed with me about Netflix, as an example, and that started to make some of the partners ... \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"1R8aJH\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou were just writing on a blog?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"YZRPCp\"\u003eYeah, out of my old B school publication.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"KyOcpG\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd what’s that impulse to write? Right? Because I know a lot of writers.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"AXIV5W\"\u003eMm-hmm. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"qeWUPY\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThey generally aren’t people who want to be management consultants. Usually these two things are pretty split.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"tSzJeU\"\u003eYeah. The impulse kind of comes from one of three areas. One is, as with the Netflix pieces, it’s a frustration with a narrative that I think is wrong and I have the selfishness to want to correct it. The second is ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"39eUAq\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSome people say everyone’s wrong, and then they go, “I’m going to profit from it, but I don’t need to write about it.” \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"vd3Qx7\"\u003eYeah. But you have to put it in the perspective too, to some extent, it’s a relatively unnoticed 24-year-old kid who is like, I’m just going to explore, have conversations, see what people think about this. And so, I just started doing that. The partners did not like that. The notability was a little bit too high. It was one of those catch-22s where if it’s bad, no one cares and it doesn’t help you. But if it’s great, then all of a sudden you’re flying a little too high. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"PXgtjJ\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e“Hey, we’ve got to talk about this,” yeah. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"hSfZmb\"\u003eSo, I was told very clearly, “You have to stop this. If you do it again, you’ll be fired.” And I made the very natural decision to just change it to a weird name. And I kept doing that. And Jason had discovered the blog at one point and curated it in his Media Redef newsletter. And then, a few weeks passed and I think he had rediscovered the blog and I had written another eight pieces. And he just fastidiously combed through it and published all of them in one day. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"RQKaPI\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e“Here’s this random guy.”\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"5e7wyq\"\u003eRight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"GhlcFF\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIt was Liam at the time, right?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"7uMr41\"\u003eYeah, it was under Liam at that point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"PMnexS\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e“I found all his stuff. I’m going to share it with you.” \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"t1uXtO\"\u003eRight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"hZz8Lm\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOkay.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"B1xHbh\"\u003eAnd so, Jason gave an incredible promotional opportunity. And I started hearing from people. And, at the same time, again, this is from the perspective of, I don’t know what the next job I’m going to do is. I don’t know the gateway there. I don’t have connections. I’m Canadian. I had recently moved to the United States. And, at the bottom of that Redef newsletter, it said where his address was. It said, I think, 25 Morton Street. He’s not there anymore. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"H7Sdb2\"\u003eAnd I decided that I’d just walk in and try to introduce myself. It was really strange because, of course, I’m still young, I put on a suit, I had a tie, which is not the way to do it with Jason when he doesn’t know you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"oYAAvZ\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou go down to Tribeca, knock on his penthouse door. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"02xG9X\"\u003eIn West Village.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"KQ4GHT\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOkay. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"U0Qavf\"\u003eAt the office. And I showed up and it was a very strange situation because I basically had to say to the attendant who didn’t even work for him, it’s a startup space, I was like, “My name is Liam Boluk.” And she says, “Can I see your ID?” And, of course, I have to say, “Well, it says Matthew Ball.” And so, she has to pass this weird note to Jason that says, “This guy Liam ...” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"5VVMxI\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHad you said you were coming? Or you were just door-knocking? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"hzbuJz\"\u003eNo. I just showed up. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ERp2B2\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYeah. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"l7IFeQ\"\u003eBut so, Jason doesn’t know the names of this random blogger, let alone this double hyphenated, weird name. And so, I think I waited for 20 or 30 minutes and he finally comes out and is like, “What is going on here?” And I just said, “Hey, you seem to like my work. Can you help me find a job?” And he had a very reasonable response that should have been the one that I went in with at the time, but I was too young and naïve. And he said, “Why don’t you write for me? Keep doing what you’re doing, but I’ll work with you to make the pieces better. We’ll plan them, I’ll connect you with those who have the information to make them even better than we can just together, and we’ll see where that goes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"K8lP2v\"\u003eAnd so, I spent about a year prepping pieces so that they could come out in rapid succession, working with Jason. And, as part of that, I started connecting with a guy, Jesse Jacobs, who was the president of Peter Chernin’s company, the Chernin Group. I sat down with him at Eight and a Half over, I think, like a Hanukkah dinner, and started talking to him. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"AB90KO\"\u003eAnd it was a great example of, I worked with Jason, I got smarter, I was still writing under a pseudonym, but he also was able to act as an intermediary to go to a guy like Jesse and say, “Meet this guy. You’ve read his stuff, he isn’t who he seems to be, you should talk to him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Yi5yUN\"\u003eAnd then, a few months later, I went to work for The Chernin Group, specifically at Otter Media under Sarah Hardin. And that was really the big opportunity where I started getting out of the old path, into the new one. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ViXdNa\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, you were still consulting when you went to work for Jason? Or had you stopped already? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"eGvpS8\"\u003eI never worked for Jason. I just wrote for him. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"BfEXPq\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI was going to ask you if he paid you living wages.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Ukw97C\"\u003eNo. Look, it is probably not the best use of time, at least not where my relative specialty is. I think I’m ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"XQ1YQj\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut he opened up a world for you, or helped you open up a world.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"y8fuMq\"\u003eYeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"xNxU7b\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYeah. And so, you go work for Chernin.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"O4wS0f\"\u003eRight. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"fyK7iP\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd then, you do that for X amount of time. And then, at some point, you end up at Amazon.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"8bD5BB\"\u003eYeah. So, I mean look, this is really the story of the same opportunity. I connected with a guy, Ted Hope, who now runs original movie production at Amazon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"dd1Alp\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSort of one of the ’80s, ’90s indie producers of note.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"clS04H\"\u003eYeah. We’ll say 2000s and 2010s of note, too. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"YxTIBy\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOkay, good. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"rgjr7T\"\u003eAnd \u003cem\u003eManchester by the Sea\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eBig Sick\u003c/em\u003e, big movies. And I connected with him and that was prior to me going to the Chernin Group. He had connected me with the then head of Amazon Studios. I almost went there instead of going to Chernin, decided to go to Chernin. And then, Amazon had come and said that they were starting a new group, the strategy and planning group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"34sFAY\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWithin movies? Or within video? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"hL56kk\"\u003eNo, within Amazon Studios.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"n2yaOJ\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOkay. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"dX0QVL\"\u003eAnd this was really, as part of a big process at Amazon — which at the time was still very small, I think they had 100 employees at the studio, they were only in four countries. By the end of the year, they went to 200 countries and territories. And they needed to start building up that managerial level. How do we make sure that we’re making the right decisions, that we’ve learned from the prior decisions, that our data, which was originally hypothesis-driven and oriented around first seasons, is now being data-driven around multiple seasons? And so, I went to run that. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"qXaNBI\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, they hire you to be sort a brain at Amazon. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"DUvC8L\"\u003eRight. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"3wvRwT\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd what was that experience like working there for you at that time? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"iUHcH8\"\u003eIt was the perfect example of a company that has strong convictions, incredible assets, but is new to the space. And I don’t mean that in a pejorative way. I mean that in the sense of, when you go to a media company to consult, they talk about there’s 20 years of hierarchy, there’s ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"eHa2nN\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e“This is how we do it.”\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ZP8rV1\"\u003eThere’s process. It’s not just how we do it, it’s just things happen. Right? At Amazon, there was a need to carve out, well, how \u003cem\u003eare\u003c/em\u003e we going to do this? \u003cem\u003eWhy\u003c/em\u003e are we going to do this? There was a general rigor towards reevaluating prior decisions that were being made. And, to some extent, the street analysis said, Amazon keeps pivoting and moving, and what does that mean about the last strategy? And the answer is, the company is always organized to do the thing that works then, and then move to the new thing. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"bwrfuE\"\u003eAnd so, when you talk about someone like me who had written first about what I think the digital opportunity looks like, Chernin was focused on going after, with real rigor, emerging but generally overlooked small to modest opportunities like Crunchyroll, and then going to Amazon, which is saying, “We’re going for it. We want to be the dominant destination for video. We think we can be the seller of everyone else. And we have the capital, we have the talent, the tech, and the reach.” That was an incredibly large purview and that’s just exciting. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"r1dNGE\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWas there anything where they said, “We think we’re going to go this way,” and you said, “I looked at it, let’s try this instead.” And they actually listened?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"55eLHc\"\u003eI mean, the fundamental anchoring of that company was rigorous decision-making. I think no one would be successful at any level in that company if they couldn’t say that they affected a decision one way or another. The great thing about the way that they make decisions — and of course, there are downsides with every process, tech looks at content differently — is that doc-based decision-making process meant that the entire company, from marketing, to production, to development, to post-production, to finance and research, comes together and decides whether or not they think that this is the right decision. And my job was basically to chaperone, guide, and help that process as it went up to the studio heads to make a decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"kMDpRT\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, you were there under the Roy Price era. He has since left. You left after he left.\u003c/strong\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"XyL57c\"\u003eMm-hmm. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"s6GyxR\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, now you’re on the outside. What’s your sense of how they’re operating differently now than they did under your tenure?\u003c/strong\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ihAIsd\"\u003eI don’t think that there’s anything fundamentally different about how they operate internally. I think the more interesting question is, how, as with anything at Amazon, the complexity shifts. So, I’ll give you a good example of that, which was, when I was there, one of the first decisions was what to do with an HBO renewal. We had renewed for X million dollars per year. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"OnMERH\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThrough an Amazon Prime sub, you could watch \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGirls\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e and other older HBO shows.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"pUo0VA\"\u003eYeah. You could basically watch, with some exceptions, like \u003cem\u003eGame of Thrones\u003c/em\u003e, you could watch a show ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"V67KMG\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou could watch \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Sopranos\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e, yep. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"SckCO3\"\u003eAn HBO original with a three-year holdback. So, when \u003cem\u003eVeep\u003c/em\u003e season six comes out, you’ve got seasons one to three on Amazon. This is all a long-winded and very typical way of me answering a short question. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ub6mrI\"\u003eThe point is, we were looking at do we renew this? But then, that was right around the time in which we started selling HBO. And so, now we were going to customers and saying, “We will give you a better experience, with more content, with a direct access to the HBO content you like.” And, by the way, internally, we’re now no longer paying for that, right? We’re actually pocketing a few bucks per month. That changes what content you do acquire, how much you invest, what the business rationale is. Fire TV is another business that didn’t exist in the early days of Prime Video. It does today. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"CDpnyY\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut wait, the answer was “renew,” right? Because I just watched \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Sopranos\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e over the last few months through my Amazon Prime sub.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"X0e7f8\"\u003eI mean, that depends on the term, but ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"myTc9C\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut they did. It’s still there. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"dORme1\"\u003eMy point is more, the whole question of how are they doing and what’s different is really a reflection of how that business has become more sophisticated. Four or five years ago, the marketplace was constantly looking at Amazon and saying, “Well, this is it. Netflix is over. It’s the existential threat. There’s a company with more cash with a longer time horizon.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"6Jp7pk\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI mean, Netflix would say, “We take Amazon very seriously.”\u003c/strong\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"zPsIvi\"\u003eThey will. But I think the whole point is, those businesses look very similar because they’re going after the same consumers with equivalent projects. The monetization is very different and the strategy around it is very different. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"xCvSSH\"\u003eThere’s always this question of, what is Amazon going to do with live sports? And I think one of the interesting questions is actually not just, are they going to add live sports, it’s how does Prime Video change if live sports exists? Do you still license catalog content? Do you just make \u003cem\u003eGame of Thrones\u003c/em\u003e, or rather \u003cem\u003eLord of the Rings\u003c/em\u003e-style content?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"KULebl\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYeah. Let’s talk about \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLord of the Rings\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e, right? So, Amazon gets into video, there’s an initial idea that says, “We’re going to do this, we’re going to disrupt Hollywood, we’re going to change the way scripts are vetted.” They come out with some shows that no one remembers. You do and I do because I went to one of the premieres. But no one remembers ... what was the DC one called? There was one with like John Goodman, bunch of Senators live in the same house.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"asOM4s\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eBetas\u003c/em\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"hqaJZf\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThere you go. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"odf23C\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eBeta House\u003c/em\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"K9qy8b\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBeta House\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e. That goes away. Then they do ...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ictImV\"\u003eNope. \u003cem\u003eAlpha House\u003c/em\u003e. \u003cem\u003eBetas\u003c/em\u003e was a show. \u003cem\u003eAlpha House\u003c/em\u003e was another show. It was very strange to have two of our first three shows be Greek letters. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"QtZ9pY\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOkay, so you worked there and you still can’t remember the name. Point taken. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"KhpiAf\"\u003eThey were gone by the time I got there. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"FKWpHT\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOkay. Then we get to \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTransparent\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e. All of a sudden, they’re winning awards. We have Jeff Bezos onstage. He explains that the reason it’s good for Amazon to do this is because we win an award and people buy that many more shoes or stick around in Amazon Prime. It’s better. Now, from the outside, it looks like that era is over and what they want to do is big swings, a \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLord of the Ring\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003es prequel, everything has to be bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger audiences. What changed?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"sqbWwx\"\u003eAgain, I think this is a question of how did the business evolve. One of the weird things to frame the business is just the idea of where Prime was in 2012 versus where it is in 2019, right? There’s this thing where people will talk about the fact that Amazon was doing Silver Lake programming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"BkRtMP\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you’re not hanging out in LA, it’s the Brooklyn of LA.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"pz22Gf\"\u003eRight? It’s this idea that it was primarily coastal, upper-income programming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"lAL8d8\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYep. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"uAOY1L\"\u003eAnd I think one of the things that’s important about that is, back in 2012, that is what the Prime subscriber base looked like. No one ever programs for the audience they don’t have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"hBf1Wl\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd, by the way, Netflix, when they were doing originals, started off doing that kind of programming. Right? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"MsbNDT\"\u003eRight. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"bXWCTD\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThey weren’t doing Ashton Kutcher shows until well after that.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"kbzyvB\"\u003eNo. They were doing a Washington-based power broker show. That’s \u003cem\u003eHouse of Cards\u003c/em\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"BjIv1j\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWith David Fincher and Kevin Spacey and it looks like it could be an HBO show. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"EFZFQm\"\u003eRight. Whenever you have a service that wants to grow, become scaled and more mass, you start by growing up from concentric circles. Look, I mean it’s not altogether ... when we talked about \u003cem\u003eAlpha House\u003c/em\u003e, that was another show about Congress staffers living together. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"TLhemu\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYeah.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"a3SHur\"\u003eThat’s a reflection of the base. And so, I think the real question is, as that business starts to expand, as your audience expands, and to some extent, Prime itself grew so much more than most of the Wall Street estimates believed it was going to, that you have to start growing your base. The decision then to go from one market to 200 countries and markets globally also changes that show. \u003cem\u003eMarvelous Mrs. Maisel\u003c/em\u003e is a marvelous show. It is not going to drive first-time Prime subscribers, not Prime Video, but first-time Prime subscribers in Malaysia, in India, in Brazil. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"DnTOzq\"\u003eWhen you start to look at what types of shows really break out, really differentiate, and most importantly, are going to change people’s perception about paying for video in the first place. In Japan, people do not pay for video. In India, people do not pay for video. You need so many different things in programming. And going for the second-best-selling novel of all time and trying to do something new and ambitious is an incredible pathway to that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"N9F7Me\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAmazon is bigger. Prime is bigger. If we want to use video to either subscribe to Prime or stick around to Prime, we have to reach many people with that video.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"e60lOq\"\u003eRight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"SfuRzq\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThat’s the short version. For a long time, I’ve assumed that the people who work at Amazon, Jeff Bezos on down, know what they’re doing. And the fact that they are spending billions of dollars on video, yet when I go to Amazon.com, I don’t see any evidence of the fact that there’s video there, there has to be a method to that madness. But now I’m sort of questioning it. And occasionally they’ll send me an envelope with a stamp and it’ll say, “You should watch whatever our show is.”\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Oz88oJ\"\u003eI haven’t checked your mail in years. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"e2ywAw\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIt seems to me they’ve got this weird ask they’re spending billions of dollars on, and yet still not spending a lot of time telling people about. It’s hard for me to imagine most people even know Amazon Prime Video exists. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"mu9ItN\"\u003eIs that a question?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"CyBJRX\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIt is a question. What am I missing? That’s the question. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"MPYLKz\"\u003eFirst of all, there is a video tab on the homepage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"gYspjp\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYes. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"vUC0Ek\"\u003eThat, if you were watching something, right below the search bar will say, “Finish watching \u003cem\u003eMan in the High Castle\u003c/em\u003e,” or rather, “Go watch \u003cem\u003ePatriot\u003c/em\u003e. It’s phenomenal.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"2mHGzU\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMm-hmm. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"3hvUtw\"\u003eI think the point is, one of the interesting elements about how you look at video — and I think this explains a lot of what Apple is doing and why — is, Jeff, in the early years talked a lot about the Amazon flywheel, the Prime flywheel. I think that’s really profound. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"f1Cnyx\"\u003eI think what Apple is looking to do is replicate the Amazon video flywheel. Which is to say, the Fire TV is now in, I think they said 36 million homes in the United States. Well, guess what? Now it doesn’t really matter as much if you’re getting it direct mail, if you’re getting an Amazon.com reminder. If you’re one of those one-in-four homes in the United States with a Fire TV, you know about Amazon programming. That’s part of what you do. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"budBg7\"\u003eYou also have the fact that Gartner has said that Amazon Video is now essentially neck and neck with iTunes, both domestically and abroad, in digital video downloads. Five years ago, iTunes was so laughably dominant in that space.

What makes a wine “natural”?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp id=\"0TiZdJ\"\u003eWhen Jenny Lefcourt moved to Paris in the 1990s to study French literature and cinema, she and her friends started drinking a particularly exciting type of wine. This wine tasted “totally different, and alive, and delicious,” she remembers. They found it in a couple of bars, and later stumbled into a tasting of it hosted at a neighborhood restaurant. “There wasn’t really a name for it yet,” but it was the stuff that we’ll now call natural wine, and she began importing it in 2000.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"BAyXDa\"\u003eNow natural wine has become a signifier of bourgeois taste in certain social circles and on certain menus across the United States. It has become a source of indie social capital, with wine labels that are as feverishly followed and obsessed over as album covers in the ’80s. But what makes a wine “natural” isn’t always clear to consumers who are more familiar with the under-$10 section at Trader Joe’s. And it’s become the subject of heated debate in the wine world, with natural wine purists arguing for its virtue and thrilling taste, and traditionalists criticizing the perceived flaws and even its idealism. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"kCZvYk\"\u003eBut while natural wine is recently trendy, it is not new: People have been making fermented grape juice without additives \u003ca href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/aug/30/traces-of-6000-year-old-wine-discovered-in-sicilian-cave\"\u003efor thousands of years\u003c/a\u003e. (The history of sulfites complicates this; some people believe that sulfites in one form or another were used to preserve wine as early as the \u003ca href=\"http://www.academicwino.com/2014/09/history-sulfite-use-wine.html/\"\u003eeighth century BC\u003c/a\u003e.) “People think that natural wine is a fad or a new thing, but it’s the traditional way to make wine,” explains Krista Scruggs, a winemaker and farmer based in Vermont and Texas. “It’s conventional wine that’s actually new.” Here’s what natural wine is, how we moved away from — and back to — it, and where it’s heading next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"PaBoLg\"\u003eWhat it is\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"9ak4Ka\"\u003eNatural wine is more of a concept than a well-defined category with agreed-upon characteristics. In its purest form, it is wine made from unadulterated fermented grape juice and nothing else. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-float-right\"\u003e\u003caside id=\"5CjmG3\"\u003e\u003cq\u003e“People think that natural wine is a fad or a new thing, but it’s the traditional way to make wine.

Scruggs calls her product “just fucking fermented juice.” But “natural wine” is the term that is most widely used, and anyone at a natural-inclined wine store, wine bar, or restaurant will know what you mean when you use it. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"MriJg1\"\u003eFor the purpose of this article, I am working under the assumption that natural wine is not a \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/RobertMParkerJr/status/418839188809588736\"\u003efraud\u003c/a\u003e, nor are its supporters delusional, but rather that it’s a highly debated and endlessly complicated topic that never ceases to get all manner of people \u003ca href=\"http://www.grubstreet.com/2018/07/sommeliers-are-obsessed-with-natural-wine-but-is-it-good.html\"\u003eriled up\u003c/a\u003e. Also, the stuff is very often delicious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"f0nkXH\"\u003eUnderstanding natural wine requires a basic understanding of the (generally complex) winemaking process. In the simplest terms, that process has two parts: growing and picking grapes, and then turning them into wine through fermentation. Natural wine, then, is made from grapes not sprayed with pesticides or herbicides. Natural winemakers handpick their grapes instead of relying on machines to harvest them. When it comes to turning those handpicked grapes into juice, natural winemakers rely on native yeast, the stuff that’s whizzing around in the air and will land on grapes if you put them in a vat for long enough, to set off natural fermentation. And unlike most conventional winemakers, they don’t use any additives (like fake oak flavor, fake vanilla flavor, sugar, acid, egg white, etc.) in the winemaking process. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"h7Aq46\"\u003eOccasionally, some natural winemakers will add some sulfites, a preservative and stabilizer that winemakers have been using longer than any other additive. Sulfites ensure that the wine you drink tastes roughly the same as it did when it went into the bottle. Natural winemakers either use no added sulfites or use it in small quantities, while conventional winemakers use up to 10 times as much. They also use it differently: Conventional winemakers add sulfites to grapes to kill off natural yeasts, and then add more throughout the rest of the winemaking process; natural winemakers will add a little bit just before bottling. The purest of the pure — naturally fermented grape juice with no sulfites — is often called “zero-zero,” referring to the lack of added anything. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-float-right\"\u003e\u003caside id=\"rsZre8\"\u003e\u003cq\u003eThe presence of sulfites doesn’t necessarily disqualify a bottle from the natural wine category\u003c/q\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"m9Hn2w\"\u003eThe presence of sulfites doesn’t necessarily disqualify a bottle from the natural wine category, though. Small amounts of sulfites — around 10 to 35 parts per million — are in natural wine circles generally considered an acceptable amount of preservative to add in the bottling stage. Conventional wine, on the other hand, often uses much higher amounts of the stuff, which some natural wine supporters think “deadens” the flavor of the finished product. In the US, the maximum amount is 350 parts per million. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"2jQ82q\"\u003eGiven that natural wine is often described as “cloudy,” “funky,” and/or “barnyard-y,” many people assume that it’s always loudly, inherently weird. While natural wine is often unfiltered (that leads to cloudiness) and can veer sharply into funky territory, there’s also lots of natural wine that won’t feel like an acquired taste if you’re used to buying yours at Costco. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"1q3wCy\"\u003e“There’s a misconception that natural wine is one thing — that it’s ‘funky’ or ‘not clean,’” Scruggs says. “And that’s an injustice. Because natural wine can still honor your palate if you’ve been drinking wine from the grocery store, but the cool thing is that it’s chemical-free, and that’s awesome.” Consumers shouldn’t be afraid to tell sommeliers and wine store owners that they want a natural wine that tastes like two-buck Chuck, she says. As longtime natural wine advocate \u003ca href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/how-to-drink-natural-wine\"\u003ePascaline Lepeltier told GQ,\u003c/a\u003e “Whatever you like as a more traditional wine drinker, you can find a [natural] alternative everywhere in the world.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Wc3Xow\"\u003eAnd then there’s \u003ca href=\"https://wine.sprudge.com/2018/01/30/a-brief-history-of-glou-glou/\"\u003eglou-glou\u003c/a\u003e, a popular type of natural wine made to be drunk without having to think about it too much. (The French term is onomatopoetic, their version of “glug-glug.”) While it doesn’t taste like two-buck Chuck, it does generally taste like delicious electrified juice: These are lighter red wines, often served chilled, and downed quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"pTnJtN\"\u003eWhat it isn’t\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"A5EnTB\"\u003e“Conventional” winemaking — shorthand for non-natural wine — is defined by technical intervention. In the vineyard, that intervention comes in the form of pesticides and herbicides. In the cellar, intervention generally comes in the form of lab-grown yeast (to control the fermentation process and regulate flavor), acid (to increase the wine’s acidity, which in turn can help the wine age better), and sulfites added at the time of bottling (to preserve flavor). Many winemakers also add sugar, which doesn’t make the wine sweet but instead, through turning into alcohol, creates the perception of “body.” (It’s common practice in Burgundy, Lefcourt notes.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"IPtSCR\"\u003eOn top of that, there are \u003ca href=\"https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr\u0026amp;sid=e616cf652c2a16d768ed4c4873ad2cb0\u0026amp;rgn=div8\u0026amp;view=text\u0026amp;node=27:1.0.1.1.19.12.343.7\u0026amp;idno=27\"\u003emore than 60 approved additives\u003c/a\u003e that American winemakers can use to manipulate their wines without listing them on the label. “A lot of wine is a grape product, plus all these millions of additives to create a product that is reliably the same every year,” Lefcourt explains. “It’s like Coca-Cola.” Egg white and isinglass, which is made from fish bladders, are \u003ca href=\"https://www.awri.com.au/industry_support/winemaking_resources/frequently_asked_questions/fining_agents/\"\u003eoften used to clarify wine\u003c/a\u003e, which makes many bottles non-vegan but not labeled as such.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y5D2IpYmieAd0KMHVQ9i26uCbTU=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16316538/GettyImages_97043961.jpg\"\u003e\n      \u003ccite\u003eKenzo Tribouillard/AFP/Getty Images\u003c/cite\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003eMarcel Lapierre, a French producer of Beaujolais “natural” wine.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"SjyqG3\"\u003eConventional wine, as we know it now, is less than a century old. Technological advances are the most influential factor in this change: Pesticides became widespread after World War II, when soldiers sprayed their sleeping bags with DDT to prevent the spread of diseases; commercial yeast entered the market \u003ca href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2999870/\"\u003ein the mid ’60s\u003c/a\u003e. But wine criticism has also played a small role. Partially to thank is American wine critic Robert Parker, who established a 100-point wine rating system in the 1980s. Parker billed himself as the first wine critic not influenced by industry interests, an objective consumer advocate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"JOTg63\"\u003eAs Parker gained notoriety, his scoring began to significantly affect wine sales, so winemakers began manipulating their product to fit his tastes, which often favored full-bodied, fruity wines. “When that started happening,” Lefcourt explains, “there was a homogenization of what people thought good wine was.” (Parker \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/22/dining/decanting-robert-parker.html\"\u003ehas denied the existence of the “Parkerization” phenomenon, and instead attributed these trends to a “successful industry.”\u003c/a\u003e) \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Z41rRu\"\u003eThat homogenization of taste, Lefcourt says, led winemakers to rely more heavily on additives that would ensure a consistent result every year, regardless of climate or yield. This gets to the core of a large debate between natural wine fanatics and those who think they’ve gone off the rails: Is the “best” wine made with minimal intervention? Or is it made by seasoned, well-informed winemakers looking to achieve a particular result that reflects their land and traditions? \u003ca href=\"https://punchdrink.com/articles/will-natural-wine-make-it-in-the-mainstream/\"\u003eThis debate\u003c/a\u003e likely \u003ca href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/may/15/has-wine-gone-bad-organic-biodynamic-natural-wine\"\u003ewon’t\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://www.grubstreet.com/2018/07/sommeliers-are-obsessed-with-natural-wine-but-is-it-good.html\"\u003eslow\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://punchdrink.com/articles/separating-fad-from-future-in-natural-wine/\"\u003edown\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/16/dining/16pour.html\"\u003eanytime\u003c/a\u003e soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"4D6OPQ\"\u003eWhere it came from, and where it’s going\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"gVhGHq\"\u003eMost people agree that the modern natural wine movement \u003ca href=\"https://www.eater.com/drinks/2016/5/20/11713332/natural-wine-france-sulfite-organic-eastern-europe\"\u003ebegan in rural France\u003c/a\u003e, where a handful of low-intervention winemakers who had been toiling (and tilling) in their own organic bubbles found out about each other and began growing a community. “These were natural winemakers who were isolated in their appellations [regions], maybe the only ones there working organically in the vines with little to no additives in the cellar,” Lefcourt remembers. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"BJiFch\"\u003eOne of the first organized, formal natural wine tastings was La Dive Bouteille in 1999, which started with 15 winemakers and around 100 attendees, Lefcourt says.

Organic and \u003ca href=\"https://www.demeter-usa.org/downloads/Demeter-Farm-Standard.pdf\"\u003ebiodynamic certifications\u003c/a\u003e exist, but they are expensive; many small vineyards that adhere to these practices don’t shell out for the label.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"9iZ34A\"\u003eComplicating things further is the fact that many winemakers who \u003cem\u003edo\u003c/em\u003e pay for organic certification will then use additives — high amounts of sulfur, yeast, acid, etc. — when making their wine. This brings us to one of the biggest obstacles standing between consumers and the experience of drinking natural, low-intervention, organically farmed wine: It can, at face value, be hard to identify. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"m1XUNn\"\u003eOne last thing: What about hangovers?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"LkxS4m\"\u003eYou’ll often hear that natural wine causes fewer \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2018/11/27/18112576/hangover-cures-science-shaughnessy-bishop-stall\"\u003ehangovers\u003c/a\u003e.

She ultimately went to a different hospital to have an abortion. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"gNXAJh\"\u003eHer congressman is Rep. Dan Lipinski, one of the last remaining anti-abortion Democrats in the House.

And already, Newman is encountering some roadblocks. Though the district leans heavily Democratic, the national party has erected rules to protect incumbents like Lipinski. Newman says she can’t find a pollster who will work for her. Four political consultants have left her campaign because of a policy, made public in April, that the official campaign arm for House Democrats won’t do business with political vendors — like direct mail companies or political consultants — that also work for candidates challenging incumbent Democrats. Party superstars like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez oppose the rule; she also managed to topple an incumbent in a primary challenge. But the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee isn’t budging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"07sQSh\"\u003eThe DCCC says it’s committed to incumbents, a loyalty to dues-paying members, that it believes represent the party’s best chance of keeping control in the House. And the DCCC’s chair, Illinois Rep. Cheri Bustos, is a big proponent of “big tent” politics. Progressive lawmakers in Congress are still railing against what they see as a “divisive” policy that effectively “blacklists” groups and candidates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"CsOHTg\"\u003eThe Democratic Party may need ideological diversity to regain national power, but already, Lipinski’s side of the “big tent” is looking sparse. Newman came within 2,200 votes of beating Lipinski in 2018. She’s running again, already picking up endorsements from progressive groups like Emily’s List and NARAL, as well as from 2020 presidential candidates Sen. Bernie Sanders and Gov. Jay Inslee. In a year when Democrats are newly energized around abortion rights, the Democratic apparatus protecting an anti-abortion candidate in friendly territory is raising eyebrows. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"e0X1Mz\"\u003eLipinski is one of the last anti-abortion Democrats in a liberal district\u003c/h3\u003e\n  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\"Marie Newman speaks during event to receive the endorsement of Illinois Reps.

Only three sitting House Democrats regularly vote against abortion rights; Lipinski; Rep. Collin Peterson, who represents a conservative Minnesota district; and Texas Rep. Henry Cuellar. Everyone else has moved on the issue or left. Even Joe Biden, the current frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination, recently revised his position, saying the ban on using federal funds for abortions, which he used to support, should be overturned. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"iQbC8T\"\u003eThe issue has taken on new urgency in the 2020 primaries as Republican state legislatures pass stricter abortion laws explicitly designed to be brought before an increasingly conservative Supreme Court and unravel \u003cem\u003eRoe v. Wade\u003c/em\u003e. Bustos was pressured into canceling her fundraiser for Lipinski in light of the Alabama state law banning abortions at six weeks, without exceptions for rape and incest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"IAq4Sw\"\u003eBut in the liberal stronghold of Illinois’s Third Congressional District, the anti-abortion Lipinski family has been in power for nearly 40 years — first Lipinski’s father, William, held the seat before passing it on to Dan — and they’re fighting against the current.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"pvWloZ\"\u003eOnce known for its conservative pockets, the area — surrounding Midway Airport, which spans parts of Cook and Will counties — is more diverse both socioeconomically and politically than it once was.

There’s a growing Latinx population. Sanders beat Hillary Clinton here in 2016 by 8 points. Clinton went on to beat Donald Trump by an even bigger margin. Interestingly, Lipinski, who was a superdelegate in the 2016 elections, \u003ca href=\"https://www.politico.com/blogs/2016-dem-primary-live-updates-and-results/2016/04/dan-lipinski-bernie-sanders-222171\"\u003epledged his vote to Sanders\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"kHMa4C\"\u003eBut between Newman and Lipinski, only one has adopted Sanders’s worldview. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"8p1oxF\"\u003e“I’m a \u003cem\u003ereal\u003c/em\u003e Democrat,” Newman likes to tell voters. “To be a real Democrat, you have to believe in the platform,” she said to Vox. She, like Sanders, identifies income inequality as the root cause of American suffering. At a Saturday morning Pet Parade in Chicago’s Garfield Ridge neighborhood, Newman led a procession of staffers and volunteers — and their dogs — with signs supporting Medicare-for-all, a $15 minimum wage, and a Green New Deal. Newman supports abortion rights, the Equality Act, and free college and thinks Immigration and Customs Enforcement should be “repealed and replaced.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"CkFoT9\"\u003eSteps behind, Lipinski’s team, in T-shirts reading “Commonsense Leadership for the 3rd District” on the backs, represented a different world of Democratic politics.

In this community, Lipinski is known for this kind of affair; he regularly holds events for seniors and veterans. His district office is known for getting their concerns taken care of. Reiff said Lipinski’s staff organized his paperwork for the Veterans Affairs hospital and got his Vietnam War medals mailed to his home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"rT2ira\"\u003eAs far as Reiff was concerned, Newman’s insurgency is a “reflection of the millenniums” — referring to the progressive millennial energy that has boosted candidates like Sanders.

He said his focus was on the “kitchen table issues.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"mQY0QQ\"\u003eThere’s probably a reason for that. To most in that room, his anti-abortion position was either irrelevant or unknown. There are longtime constituents, like Kathy Voigt, a 72-year-old OB-GYN nurse who voted for Lipinski in 2018, only to learn about his record on abortion after the fact.

Already, Newman is outpacing Lipinski in fundraising, with nearly quadruple the individual contributions. She spent the end of last year working on local campaigns to learn even more about the district. Walking through a local farmers market, introducing herself and passing out stickers, she said roughly half the people she comes across at community events know who she is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"wRPu3p\"\u003eBut House Democrats, facing a tough year to hold on to their current majority, have made incumbents a priority.\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eAnd it’s hard to find a greater beneficiary than Lipinski. Newman says her campaign has been forced to create a new way to poll the district: gathering data from outside groups, and relying more on door-to-door events. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"tvDoyY\"\u003eShe’s familiar with fighting against the party apparatus. The “Chicago Machine” is infamous for its dirty tricks, and while Newman can’t definitively blame the party for her loss in 2018, she has a long list of fishy happenings she’s happy to share. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"rG6UIB\"\u003eShe says her office internet would go out without any explanation from the service providers. Her staff’s cars would get keyed outside the office. And most shocking of all, Newman said her name didn’t show up on the ballot at all in more than a dozen precincts. This time, they will have election watchers on the ground at every polling station. Above all, she says, fighting against the machine is fighting against a negative playbook.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"uz2dlm\"\u003eHer supporters see the DCCC’s now public policy in the same vein.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"LiRgmY\"\u003e“It’s disappointing the DCCC is learning from the Chicago old-style machine tactics,” José Torrez, an immigration activist and educator in the district, said. “We are watching what the Democratic Party is doing.

One big reason: pirates, including Kazakh neuroscientist Alexandra Elbakyan. Her (illegal) website Sci-Hub sees more than 500,000 visitors daily, and hosts more than \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/2/17/11024334/sci-hub-free-academic-papers\"\u003e50 million\u003c/a\u003e academic papers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"UGAz7k\"\u003eBut Sci-Hub is just one tool to get around paywalls.

More and more, Elsevier’s business is not in the publication of journal articles, but in data-mining its enormous library.

One could imagine a system where researchers upload their drafts to preprint servers and then other academics choose to peer-review the articles. After peer review and revision, that preprint paper could be given a stamp of approval and added to a digital journal. This system is called an overlay journal (in that the editing and journal gatekeeping is overlain on top of preprints),\u003ca href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1516588\u0026amp;xs=1\u0026amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Fnews%2Fleading-mathematician-launches-arxiv-overl\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e and it already exists to a small extent\u003c/a\u003e.

The five-member SWAT team crept to the front door of the waterfront estate, according to a Pasco County Sheriff's Department arrest report.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe Bearcat's blue and red lights and blaring siren pierced the serenity of Hayward Lane, a quiet residential street in Port Richey, a small city on Florida’s west coast. A sergeant pounded his fist on the front door of the two-story home, shouting, \"Sheriff's Office! Search warrant! Come to the door!\"\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eNo one answered. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe sergeant banged again—one, two, three, and four times, announcing himself. Still nothing. He tried yet again, screaming the same command, his fist drumming the door five times. No response from inside the house. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe sergeant stood aside as two of his squad mates took position: One of them, cocking a shotgun, blasted off the door's locks. The other, lugging a battering ram, bashed the door. Once inside, officers set off a flashbang device. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eA few seconds later, two loud pops rang inside the home. The SWAT team retreated, ducking for cover behind the Bearcat. An officer shined the vehicle's spotlight on the second floor window, where police spotted a middle-aged man with wiry graying hair. He gripped a .40 caliber pistol in one hand and a cellphone in the other.\u003c/p\u003e \u003chr\u003e \u003cdiv data-iframely-id=\"pRkLsXV\" data-embedded-url=\"https://video.vice.com/en_us/video/smuggling-weed-in-the-florida-everglades/5a03563a177dd4736a1f87d1\" class=\"article__embed article__embed--iframely\"\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;\" data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"\u003e\u003ciframe data-img=\"\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/pRkLsXV\" style=\"border:0;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;\" allowfullscreen allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e \u003chr\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe incident might sound like just another \u003ca href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/topic/florida-stories\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSunshine State absurdity\u003c/a\u003e, but the shooter was no ordinary Florida man. He was Dale Massad, at the time the mayor of Port Richey, and a character whose brazen lifestyle has come into fuller view since he was arrested and charged with attempted murder in connection with that episode. Press reports, court records, and interviews describe an elected official whose personal life spiraled out of control as he engaged in a romantic relationship with a woman who was jailed three times for allegedly assaulting him, while welcoming into his home petty thieves with long rap sheets who allegedly supplied him with a steady diet of crack and meth. Regular visits by the police to his home were followed by his advocating the dissolution of the local police department, a policy stance he has since argued put an even bigger target on his back.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eEven in the post-Rob Ford era, the image of a drug-addled, gun-toting mayor blasting bullets at cops busting down his door is so absurd that it got its moment in the national spotlight. But it's also a reminder that, even as national politics dominates headlines everywhere, Americans' daily lives are often most affected by their local governments. And like the rest of the country, those governments are occasionally run by oddballs, charming incompetents, and outright criminals. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class=\"article__pull-quote\"\u003e'It reflects on fucking America. I was mayor and they came in at 4:30 in the morning for no reason.'\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFlorida alone has more than 400 cities, towns, and villages, each with its own mayor and commissioner types. And with so many fiefdoms that garner little to no ethical oversight, it’s especially easy for grifters, kooks, and other unqualified individuals to win local elections. The population in Port Richey was 2,739 when Massad was elected in 2015—about 60 percent were eligible to vote, but only 26 percent turned out to the polls. Of the 449 Port Richey citizens who voted, 182 cast ballots for Massad. He got 20 more votes than the second place finisher. And just like that, a guy who'd end up in a firefight with the cops was running the town. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\"Small groups can be very successful in getting out the vote and bringing out unusual candidates,\" said Peter Cruise, executive director of Florida Atlantic University’s Leroy Collins Public Ethics Academy, adding, \"Florida has a terrible record of not paying attention to local races.\"\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIndeed, it often seemed like no one paid attention to Port Richey during Massad's strange time within the local power structure, which dates back to 2002. But for a small town unaccustomed to a ton of outside scrutiny, the SWAT raid was just the beginning of Port Richey’s dirty laundry being put out to dry.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cdiv class=\"article__media text-center\"\u003e \u003cimg src=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1559938375080-2019-Dale-Massad-1.jpeg\" alt=\"Dale Massad\"\u003e \u003cdiv class=\"article__image-caption\"\u003eDale Massad after his arrest earlier this year. Courtesy of Pasco County Sheriff's Office\u003c/div\u003e \u003c/div\u003e \u003cp class=\"article__text--dropcap\"\u003eDale Massad sat behind a bullet-proof glass window in a concrete room of the Land O' Lakes Detention Center, the local jail near Florida's Gulf Coast run by the Pasco County Sheriff's Office. His former status as Port Richey’s mayor hadn't won him any special privileges: Shortly after his arrest and before being interviewed, jail deputies tasered and forced Massad to the ground, according to a motion filed by prosecutors.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe ex-mayor, prosecutors said, was kicking and thrashing at the guards, and was tased when he refused to comply with their commands. (\"We felt it was completely unnecessary,\" Denis deVlaming, Massad's attorney, said in an interview. \"He was in his cell when it occurred. He was having an episode and they tasered him.\")\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eDespite his colorful personal life, cops hadn't show up at Massad's house on February 21 because of any violent or recreational tendencies on his part, at least not directly. Agents from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) called in the heavy artillery to help gather evidence that the former physician was treating patients, even though he had relinquished his medical license more than two decades ago. When the smoke cleared, Massad was arrested and charged for attempted murder of five Pasco County deputies, as well as the original crime they wanted him for: practicing medicine without a license. He could spend the rest of his life behind bars. (Massad has pleaded not guilty to all the charges against him.)\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, Caj Joseph, Massad's girlfriend who was also in the house that day, was booked into county jail on charges of gun possession by a convicted felon. Inside the home, officers said, they recovered five shotguns, four handguns, and five rifles, including two AR-15s. In the master bedroom, they confiscated a stethoscope, a blood pressure monitor, a syringe, an EKG machine, and other medical equipment and supplies, according to an evidence list. Denied bail and suspended from office by Republican Governor Ron DeSantis, Massad quickly resigned as mayor.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class=\"article__pull-quote\"\u003e'We've been to his house like 50 times in the past three years.'—Port Richey Police Chief Gerard DeCanio\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eA tall man with wide blue eyes, Massad sported a salt-and-pepper five o'clock shadow when interviewed in jail. His shoulders sagged in orange-and-white prison scrubs—the word \"INMATE\" was stenciled across the back—and his hands were handcuffed. A pair of stone-faced deputies stood guard, with one of the officers training a video camera on the disgraced politician.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\"I grew up in Oklahoma, raised with the spirit of America and being free,\" Massad said. \"I am finding out these things are not true anymore. These guys look at me like I am a dog.\"\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHis voice was hoarse, and he spoke in a low, rumbling Southern drawl. His eyes grew wider as he compared his predicament to the tribulations of the billionaire real estate mogul occupying the White House. \"[President] Trump has a way of putting it when you get put in a negative light by the media,\" declared Massad, a registered Republican who—like most Florida mayors—technically ran as a nonpartisan. \"Fake news! That's what you guys got.\"\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eDuring a 45-minute interview in March, Massad spoke at length about the split-second decision that cost him his elected office and his freedom. He agreed to talk knowing that the Pasco County Sheriff's Office would video record our meeting—and that any recorded statements he made could be used against him. Massad was eager to deliver his side of the bizarre standoff with cops: To hear him tell it, he was the victim of a \"tenuous\" relationship with local law enforcement during his on-and-off again stints on the Port Richey city council. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThat the relationship was rocky is one point he and local police can agree on.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\"We've been to his house like 50 times in the past three years,\" Port Richey Police Chief Gerard DeCanio said. \"Everybody told him on more than one occasion to change the people he hung out with.\"\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe grandson of a Lebanese immigrant, Massad said he relocated from Oklahoma to Gainesville, Florida, in 1976, landing a one-year residency at a local hospital's emergency room shortly after graduating from medical school. In his first 13 years as a physician, he never had a complaint filed against him, and spent five of those years running a hospital emergency room, according to online health department records.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBut on August 22, 1990, his pristine medical career started flatlining. At the time, Massad resided in Palm Harbor, another Gulf Coast city about 15 miles south of Port Richey. A laser surgery on a three-year-old girl to remove skin discolorations known as \"port wine stains\" went horribly awry. A dentist, brought in by Massad to act as the anesthesiologist because the affected area was around her mouth, injected the little girl with lidocaine that turned out to be a lethal dose. She had a seizure and turned blue, but Massad didn't have any oxygen in his office. Precious minutes passed before paramedics arrived to take the patient to the emergency room, according to a Florida health department complaint. The child died three days later. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe health department charged Massad with practicing substandard medicine and failing to notice early signs that the child's life was in danger. In October 1992, Massad voluntarily surrendered his license, and the girl’s family received a $300,000 settlement. In a 1998 \u003ci\u003e Sun-Sentinel \u003c/i\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/fl-xpm-1998-11-29-9811250806-story.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003estory\u003c/a\u003e, Massad expressed remorse for the death: \"I'm the captain of the ship. That's the bottom line. If I could be where that child is and let her be alive, I'd do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eDuring the jailhouse interview, Massad didn't back away from accepting responsibility for the death. \"I told her mother I would give her all the money I had,\" he said. \"I decided not to fight the thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eLeaving behind the havoc in Palm Harbor in 1999, Massad resettled in Port Richey, where he bought the waterfront house for $151,000, according to the Pasco County property appraiser's website. \"I just went up the coast and found this place,\" he said. \"It wasn't a really wonderful house, but it was a beautiful lot.\"\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOver the years, he remodeled the property to his liking. At the time of the raid, the five-bedroom home featured an elevator that took riders from the second-floor down to the ground level that led to a game room, pool, patio, and separate guesthouse. The garage fit up to five cars, along with two boat docks, a boat lift, a fish-cleaning station, and a boat ramp. According to Zillow, the property was worth an estimated $601,820 as of early June. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMassad said he supported himself with a retirement investment fund, and that life by the water in Port Richey was more affordable than waterfront neighborhoods in other Florida coastal cities. \"I live on the bayou,\" he said. \"I have fishing. I have everything I need. I have skiing.\"\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAround 2000, Massad carved a new path, launching his political career when friends encouraged him to seek an appointment to a vacant seat on the Port Richey city council. He still introduced himself to residents as \"Doc.\" Two years later, voters gave him another two-year term when he was among the first three top finishers in a five-person race. \"I got into politics in Port Richey and God help me,\" Massad said. \"I always felt like I do something. And I think I did.\"\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn 2004, Massad lost his re-election bid, but voters put him back on the council two years later. In 2008, he lost again, and stayed out of Port Richey politics for the next seven years. But in 2015, again goaded by friends, Massad said, he ran for mayor in a special election, and won.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThroughout his political career, Massad campaigned on a promise, among other pitches, to secure funding for the dredging of 25 canals in Port Richey.

The officers didn't find any intruders.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eA review of police incident reports and other court records suggests Massad often enjoyed the company of some of Port Richey’s less-than-reputable inhabitants. His live-in girlfriend Caj Joseph has been arrested at least 21 times in Pasco County since 2011, picking up five felony convictions during that period. Among the charges the 58-year-old woman pleaded guilty to was battery on Massad: On June 4, 2017, Joseph punched the mayor and struck his leg with a car door.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eJoseph was sentenced to nine months in county jail, after which she and Massad appear to have reconciled. In late August of last year, the couple were both arrested on charges of domestic battery against one another. They spent the night in jail, but the charges were dropped. Reached on her cellphone, Joseph said her lawyers advised her not to speak to the press.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eJoseph wasn't the only person living on Massad's property who was regularly on the radar of local law enforcement. For a few months between 2017 and 2018, a drifter named Corey White moved into Massad's guesthouse, agreeing to pay $400 a month in rent. A 50-year-old man, White has been arrested for alleged battery on a pregnant woman, burglary, harassment, cyber-stalking, shoplifting, and criminal mischief since 2016, according to Pasco County jail records. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhite's troubles filtered onto Massad's property. On January 24, 2018, White called police claiming a woman broke into the guesthouse and stole $80 and three prescription bottles containing Xanax, morphine, and oxycodone. Massad, speaking to the responding officers, backed up White's account. The then-mayor said he saw a woman and another individual standing near the guest house in the early morning. He gave them a warning, \"'I have a gun,' and they ran off,\" according to the incident report.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe friendship between the men apparently soured soon after. By sometime in April of the same year, according to court records, Massad filed an eviction lawsuit against White for allegedly failing to pay rent since February. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOne day last October, however, Massad found White passed out on his back porch and called the cops. White woke up, grabbed a towel, and took off before officers showed up, according to an arrest report. When cops caught up with him, White was arrested for alleged burglary of an unoccupied dwelling. Attempts to reach White were not successful—his last known phone number was disconnected.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWord of Massad's troubles reached city hall over the years, but his council colleagues and top administrators seem to have enabled the then-mayor's bad behavior. City Manager Vincent Lupo gave Massad a pistol in 2017 that was allegedly among three guns stolen from the waterfront home a year later, according to a police report described in a May \u003ca href=\"https://www.tampabay.com/investigations/2019/05/05/drugs-guns-and-politics-collided-in-the-small-town-of-port-richey-two-mayors-went-to-jail/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e Tampa Bay Times\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e story detailing the mayor's exploits. Lupo told the newspaper he once saw one of Massad's kitchen cabinets stocked with prescription pill bottles that were not under his name. Lupo advised the mayor to trash the bottles and didn't report what he saw to the police until FDLE launched its investigation.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eLupo was more forthcoming with what he knew about Massad after the state policing agency began its probe into the mayor's alleged illegal medical practice. Another \u003ci\u003e Tampa Bay Times\u003c/i\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/ex-port-richey-mayor-dale-massad-used-crack-cocaine-and-meth-new-records-show-20190411/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003estory\u003c/a\u003e identified White as one of two informants who helped kick that process into gear by telling police they saw Massad treat people's injuries—and provided him with illegal substances. The ex-mayor's former tenant told police last year that he bought drugs for his landlord around 60 times, mostly crack cocaine and meth. He said he witnessed Massad smoke both and that the mayor would use runners to buy his dope to avoid getting caught. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eDeCanio, the Port Richey police chief, confirmed he received a tip from people who lived in the mayor's house that he was practicing medicine without a license. To avoid any potential conflicts of interest, DeCanio said, he passed along the tip to the FDLE, which deemed the information credible. One source claimed to police that Massad removed a fishing hook from their back and supplied a cortisone shot, and another witness said Massad stitched up a deep laceration in the ankle, according to a criminal complaint. Massad's patients have not been identified. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\"My relationship with [Massad] was good,\" DeCanio said. \"He supported me. But I have a duty to act on the information. I can't sweep it under the rug.\"\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMassad, on the other hand, expressed a nonchalant attitude about the alleged activities occurring on his property. He said he didn’t judge those who entered his strange abode, either. \"I am not going to call the police department to get their rap sheet,\" he grumbled. \"If you are in Pasco County, every other person is a criminal. I don't ask people about their past if they come into my house. But no one was a murderer or a rapist or anything like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhen asked if he misused illegal substances and alcohol, Massad offered a coy response. \"Listen, I am a child of the 60s,\" he said. \"Do I do drugs now? No. Have I done them? Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe FDLE probe picked up steam on September 29, 2018, when Port Richey Police Officer Donald Howard showed up to Massad's house, feigning a knee injury. Massad allegedly diagnosed Howard with an injured tendon, and was said to tell the undercover that he could obtain injectable medicine for the officer to administer on himself in the future. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhen asked about this in jail, an unrepentant Massad suggested he was the victim of a conspiratorial plot by DeCanio and police underlings to get rid of him because he had advocated Port Richey voters dissolve the police department. But the main person backing up that claim is \u003ca href=\"https://www.wfla.com/news/pasco-county/ex-girlfriend-of-ousted-port-richey-mayor-claims-his-arrest-was-payback/1852399234\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ea former girlfriend\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\"We've even got one person that has it on tape, with the chief saying... 'If he gets a felony, he can't be mayor,'\" Massad said, suggesting cops had to concoct something to protect their own existence. \"So they came up with practicing medicine without a license because I took some fish hook out of a guy’s back.\"\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThere is nothing in the public record to back up Massad's claim, and DeCanio dismissed the ex-mayor's allegation as fabrication. \"Instead of taking responsibility for what he did, he wants to claim the police have a vendetta against him,\" DeCanio said. \"Nothing could be further from the truth.\"\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOne might think being busted in a pre-dawn raid that got him slapped with attempted murder charges—of a SWAT team, no less—would rein in Massad's instincts. Instead, he was about to get himself in another pickle that brought even more negative attention to Port Richey.\u003c/p\u003e \u003chr\u003e \u003cdiv data-iframely-id=\"4JrKECS\" data-embedded-url=\"https://video.vice.com/en_us/video/graffiti-godfathers-miami-vandalism/5b5a35bebe40771e0b5c49b1\" class=\"article__embed article__embed--iframely\"\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;\" data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"\u003e\u003ciframe data-img=\"\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/4JrKECS\" style=\"border:0;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;\" allowfullscreen allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e \u003chr\u003e \u003cp class=\"article__text--dropcap\"\u003eShortly before 11 PM on March 3, while stewing inside the Land O' Lakes jail, Massad placed a phone call to Terrence Rowe, the Port Richey councilman selected by the other three members to serve as interim mayor in the wake of his ouster. For several minutes, the small time politicos shot the breeze like old pals catching up on lost time. Then Massad shifted the conversation to Howard, the Port Richey cop who went to him for medical treatment.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\"I believe Howard was hired illegally, fired legally, and rehired illegally,\" Massad said during the recorded call, according to an arrest report. \"I don't know why, but he is in on everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eRowe replied, \"You know, this doesn't go down without somebody answering for it!\"\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eEleven days later, Rowe was booked himself. At \u003ca href=\"https://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/dale-massad-faces-two-more-charges-as-port-richeys-acting-mayor-is-arrested-too-20190314/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ea bond hearing\u003c/a\u003e, prosecutors and Pinellas-Pasco Circuit Court Judge Mary Handsel concluded the acting mayor's comments implied he and Massad were going to tamper with a witness, in this case Officer Howard. Prosecutors tacked on felony counts of obstruction of justice and illegal use of a two-way communication device against the ex-mayor and charged Rowe with the same two counts. He, too, was suspended from office. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eRowe has pleaded not guilty, and his defense attorney did not return a phone message seeking comment. The five-member city council currently has two empty seats, but \u003ca href=\"https://www.tampabay.com/pasco/port-richey-council-the-dredge-isnt-dead-yet-20190529/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ea special election\u003c/a\u003e for a new mayor was scheduled for June 18. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, Massad has made futile efforts to win his release. In April, the Florida 2nd District Court of Appeal quashed his lawyers' request to overturn Handsel's order that Massad remain incarcerated without bail. And Handsel denied his motion to disqualify her as the presiding judge, which argued she displayed bias against him and had a conflict of interest because she is married to a former cop. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAs for the whole shooting at cops thing that got him into such massive trouble, according to an initial motion arguing for his release filed by his lawyers back in March, Massad armed himself so heavily because he believed he was about to be robbed and was in physical danger. The motion cited the history of dozens of 9-1-1 calls to Massad's home, including alleged burglaries, as proof that he had reason to protect himself. Massad's attorneys suggested that photographic evidence might prove he was firing warning shots and could not have hit anyone entering the home.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhen interviewed, Massad held fast to his defense strategy. He said it was hard to hear people knocking on the front door of his house unless he was ten feet away from it. \"I heard all this noise,\" he said. \"I am groggy when I jumped out of bed and I am scared to death.\"\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMimicking how he was aiming his gun, Massad added that he fired warning shots that hit the wall of his elevator and an area directly in front of him. He insisted there was no way the bullets would have hit the officers coming through the front door.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOn April 5, Massad's defense team gave reporters \u003ca href=\"https://www.abcactionnews.com/news/local-news/i-team-investigates/former-port-richey-mayors-attorneys-give-crime-scene-tour-to-demonstrate-his-side-of-events\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ea crime scene tour\u003c/a\u003e of his house to make the same point. Using \u003ca href=\"https://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/from-inside-dale-massads-home-his-lawyers-argue-he-was-only-defending-his-property-20190405/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ea laser pointer\u003c/a\u003e, his attorney, deVlaming, identified two spots on the second floor where the bullets struck. Based on where the bullets landed, the deputies were not in the line of fire, deVlaming told the assembled journalists. He also argued Massad feared home invaders masquerading as police were at their doorstep. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\"From the 9-1-1 tape, you can tell both of them didn't know if these were real cops or fake cops,\" deVlaming said of Massad and Joseph, who called the police during the raid. \"There have been plenty of times when fake cops have come to rip people off or do a home invasion burglary.\"\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAs of early June, Massad remained behind bars. He was set to go to trial on the obstruction and illegal communication charges later this month, but a trial date for the attempted murder and illegally practicing medicine counts—his original alleged crimes—had not yet been set. He also had a new bail hearing set for June 10.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAt the county jail earlier this spring, a defiant Massad scoffed at the suggestion that he reflected poorly on his city. \"It reflects on fucking America,\" he seethed. \"I was mayor and they came in at 4:30 in the morning for no reason. They bust my door and they shoot into the wall, into my doors, they crack my door open... and I reflect on the city? Doesn't that bother you a little bit?\"\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eShould he beat the charges, Massad could theoretically fight to get his job as mayor back. However, he seemed to have ruled out a return to Port Richey's city council. \"I don’t ever want to be in politics ever again,\" he said. \"I am a free spirit.

I really wanted a flexible schedule, too, so I found some online classes at a podunk school in Nebraska to make things a little easier. This was about five years ago.

I had to get those tests proctored—basically, I would go to a local library and there would be a guy sitting there next to me so I couldn't Google anything or use my calculator. I failed Calculus III, and the next term, I realized how I could get that and have all the answers, and plus, instead of having an hour, I would get, like, three days. I ultimately ended up pulling this scam to pass six high-level math classes over the course of a year and a half.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe way it works with these online classes is that they ask you who your proctor is at the beginning of the semester, and you have one week to send it over. So I set up a tutoring website through a popular website provider, which made it very cheap to do. I got an email that made it look official, and I really populated the page, and then made it look like proctoring was something we did on the side. I used a local library's address, put no phone numbers on there. I came up with a fake name, like \"Mike Stevens,\" or something like that. If the teacher thinks everything looks legitimate, they start corresponding with the company.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"article__pull-quote\"\u003e'If my kids cheated, it would be something I would talk to them about.'\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSomeone could have contacted me to be a tutor, and I would have been prepared to do that. But no one ever found the website. I still wouldn't have felt comfortable commercializing the cheating part, because I thought it could get me put in jail. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThis all really gave me a leg up on tests, but the cheating still wasn't powerful enough to overcome my hatred of school—I still don’t have my degree after six or eight years of taking classes on and off. My goal is to finally finish before my kids do, which means I still have about 15 years. And I’m close, but I really hate school, in case I didn't mention that. I mostly want to finish for them, because I know they're gonna struggle the same way I do, and I want to show them that they can finish no matter how long it takes. They're not disciplined. They're lazy, but they’re really smart.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIf my kids cheated, it would be something I would talk to them about. But the other thing is that cheating in school is way low on the ladder of things I'm concerned about. If that's the worst thing they do, then I've done very well. I'm expecting them to. If they're anything like me, they will. And if they're old enough to pull off something like I did, then it's not like I can do anything to stop them.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eDo I feel guilty? It would be one thing if I was trying to scam someone, but I was just trying to provide for my family. It was definitely deplorable what I did, but it was effective. I just happen to be a good liar.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI would probably feel regret if I hurt someone. Like, if I got the degree, and because of the degree I got a job, and then I screwed over the company because I didn't know how to do the work. It's one thing to say you have a degree but not know the material. But the other thing is, how much of this material do you actually keep? And how much of it are you doing from scratch? In the real world, like at my current job in banking, I do things as lazily as possible.

It explores how environments inform the cadences of our relationships, our ambitions, the way we love (cramped, frantic, expansive, chaotic) and the way we think (same).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv data-iframely-id=\"8DMs1sr\" data-embedded-url=\"https://video.vice.com/en_us/video/china-thriving-drag-queens-culture/5b084375f1cdb301470397f0\" class=\"article__embed article__embed--iframely\"\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;\" data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\"\u003e\u003ciframe data-img=\"\" data-iframely-url=\"//oembed.vice.com/8DMs1sr\" style=\"border:0;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;\" allowfullscreen allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e \u003cp\u003e Wang places herself in the school of “writing clearly about weird things.” Her stories have the immediate oxygen burst of Aimee Bender, the just-strange logics of Deborah Eisenberg, and the intense, alien curiosity of Mary Gaitskill. Her fiction is chameleon-quick and only casually surreal, just to enough to stay true to the weirdness of living. Her asides are vicious and quick, like how villains always get the best houses, don’t they? “I’ve been to some of those apartments in New York,” Wang laughs, “I’m like, \u003ci\u003e you could do bad stuff here\u003c/i\u003e! \u003ci\u003e But you just drink whiskey sometimes and you have a big cat!\u003c/i\u003e”\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e Rather than seek any pointed revelation about a character, she heightens endless fascination about all the ways people morph, change, and exist. Wang's perspective is satisfying and enlivening, and also peculiarly precise, probably best crystallized in her skill with naming. In the collection, there are siblings named Walnut, Pinetree, and Lucy. There is a cat named Small Cow.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e “I name things constantly,” she says. She got into the habit when she was living in Beijing, where she translated English and Chinese and was a fixer for the Olympics. “All the bartenders wanted English names. They’re from outside of Beijing, they would sleep in the restaurant booths after working. They were so sweet. One guy was like ‘my name is Joe,’ but then the other guy was like, ‘I don’t have a name because he used Joe.’ I was like, ‘You can be Nathan!’” She’s given many people in her family their English names. Her step-sister is Veronica, as Wang was reading Mary Gaitskill at the time.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cdiv class=\"article__embed article__embed--vice\" data-related-article=\"true\"\u003e\u003ciframe src=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/embed/article/evekp7/iraq-war-refugee-family-split-exile-grandmother-stories?utm_source=stylizedembed_vice.com\u0026utm_campaign=j5waxd\u0026site=vice\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:0px none;margin:0px;\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"article__embed article__embed--vice\" data-related-article=\"true\"\u003e\u003ciframe src=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/embed/article/597w43/normal-people-is-coming-to-hulu-because-we-cant-get-enough-millennial-love-stories?utm_source=stylizedembed_vice.com\u0026utm_campaign=j5waxd\u0026site=vice\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:0px none;margin:0px;\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e In \u003ci\u003e Home Remedies\u003c/i\u003e men narrate half the stories, and delving into their perspective took some warming up, Wang says. She read old LiveJournal entries and went to parties with the intent of letting a man talk at her “about dating or something.”\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e “I use people around me all the time,” she says. “I’m never writing about the people I’m close to, never my husband or my close friends. It’s the people who are not available to me who I’m interested in. I’m most fascinated when they’re not giving me everything.”\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e The collection is luxe, snaky, and perceptive, pulsing with new ideas about storytelling. The characters living in \u003ci\u003e Home Remedies\u003c/i\u003e are written with unleashed tenderness. They’re so present a couple of times, it feels like crawling inside someone’s body and wanting to steer them away from various heartbreaks or self-sacrifices. The watery grace of “Vaulting the Sea” encapsulates this probably best of the stories in \u003ci\u003eHome Remedies\u003c/i\u003e; the watery grace evokes Carol Anshaw’s under-read novel \u003ci\u003e Aquamarine\u003c/i\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e This close hew to specific human foibles doesn’t slow Wang from capturing the bigger forces that steer lives. In some ways, the book is a catalogue of portraits about life under the strangeness of globalization. Through portraits of Chinese and Chinese-American people, \u003ci\u003e Home Remedies\u003c/i\u003e pushes against the perception that culture is bounded, and looks at what morphs when cultures shift locations and time. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e Wang was born in 1985 in Heilongjiang, China. She remembers one television station that went blank at 10 p.m., when she would watch static for a bit. There was a bathhouse where people took a shower once a month, and wiped down the rest of the time. “Everyone in my generation can remember what it was like to really not have anything,” she says. Now, China’s major cities are arguably more advanced, with much greater wealth than in the U.S., where she moved when she was seven. “It just leapfrogged. I think that does something to a person. Also I think it did something to me.”\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e Wealth and its repercussions haunt \u003ci\u003e Home Remedies\u003c/i\u003e—close encounters with money, a sudden windfall at a cost, no money at all, too much of it. “My grandmother always encouraged us: \u003ci\u003e Why save money! Live life!\u003c/i\u003e That’s so different that most Asian families, and that generation,” Wang says. Her family had had a trucking business, but it was taken away during the revolution. “So my grandmother never thought about saving money for her kids. She thought, they’ll make their own, maybe this will all go away.”\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e \u003ci\u003e Home Remedies\u003c/i\u003e comes into a world that’s spinning at a breakneck speed, like a steady, inquisitive searchlight, always looking for a flash of an unguarded, true face in a world that might lose all its gravity any second.\u003c/p\u003e","url":"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/j5waxd/home-remedies-is-about-the-bizarre-experience-of-growing-up-in-rapid-globalization","published":"2019-06-10T12:00:00Z","guid":"j5waxd"},{"title":"Dominique Ansel's Kouign Amann Recipe","content":"\u003cp\u003e \u003cp\u003eServings: 4\u003cbr\u003ePrep time: 15 minutes\u003cbr\u003eTotal time: 30 minutes\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e \u003ch2\u003eIngredients\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e 3 cups + 2 tablespoons|472 grams bread flour\u003cbr\u003e2 tablespoons|12 grams kosher salt\u003cbr\u003e2 cups + 2 tablespoons|364 grams unsalted butter\u003cbr\u003e1 1/2 teaspoons|4 grams instant yeast\u003cbr\u003enonstick cooking spray\u003cbr\u003eall-purpose flour (for dusting)\u003cbr\u003e1 3/4 cups|360 grams granulated sugar\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e \u003ch2\u003eDirections\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e 1. Combine the bread flour, salt, 1 1/4 cups + 2 1/2 tablespoons water, 1 tablespoon of butter, and the yeast in a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook. Mix on low speed for 2 minutes to combine. Increase the speed to medium-high and beat for 10 minutes. When finished, the dough will be smooth and slightly tacky and will have full gluten development. Test by stretching it - the dough will have some elasticity. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e 2. Lightly grease a medium bowl with nonstick cooking spray. Transfer the dough to the bowl. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and proof at room temperature until doubled in size, about 1 hour. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e 3. Punch down the dough by folding the edges into the center, releasing as much of the gas as possible, and turn it out onto a large sheet of plastic wrap. Using your palms, press it to form a 10-inch (25-centimeter) square. Wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and place in the freezer for 15 minutes. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e 4. Flip the dough and return it to the freezer for another 15 minutes so that it chills evenly. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e 5. While the dough is chilling, draw a 7-inch (18-centimeter) square on a piece of parchment paper with a pencil. Flip the parchment over so that the butter won't come in contact with the pencil marks. Place the remaining 25 tablespoons|350 grams of butter in the center of the square and spread it evenly with an offset spatula to fill the square. Refrigerate the butter until firm but still pliable, about 20 minutes. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e 6. Remove the butter from the refrigerator. It should still be soft enough to bend slightly without cracking. If it is too firm, lightly beat it with a rolling pin on a lightly floured work surface until it becomes pliable. Make sure to press the butter back to its original 7-inch (18-centimeter) square after working it. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e 7. Remove the dough from the freezer; make sure it is very cold throughout. Place the dough on a lightly floured work surface. Arrange the butter block in the center of the dough so it looks like a diamond in the center of the square (rotated 45 degrees, with the corners of the butter facing the center of the dough sides). Pull the corners of the dough up and over to the center of the butter block. Pinch the seams of the dough together to seal the butter inside. You should have a square slightly larger than the butter block. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e 8. With a rolling pin, using steady, even pressure, roll the dough out from the center so that it triples in length. This will take several passes. Use extra flour to dust the work surface to ensure nothing sticks. When finished, you should have a rectangle about 24 by 10 inches (60 by 25 centimeters) and 1/4-inch (6 millimeters) thick. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e 9. Place the dough so the longer sides run left to right. From the right side fold one-third of the dough onto itself, keeping the edges lined up with each other. From the left side fold the remaining one-third of dough on top of the side that has already been folded. Line up all the edges so that you are left with an even rectangle. The dough is being folded as if it were a piece of paper going into an envelope; this is called a \"letter fold.\" Do not rest the dough and immediately move on to the next fold. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e 10. Starting with the seam of the dough on the right, roll out the dough, vertically from top to bottom, to a rectangle about 24 by 10 inches (60 by 25 centimeters) and 1/4 inch (6 millimeters) thick. Repeat the letter fold. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e 11. Immediately roll out the dough again to a rectangle about 24 by 10 inches (60 by 25 centimeters) and 1/4 inch (6 millimeters) thick. Repeat the letter fold. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 to 40 minutes to rest. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e 12. Sprinkle sugar in a thin, even layer on the work surface (as if you were flouring the work surface, but using sugar instead). Lay out the dough on the sugar. Starting with the seam of the dough on the right, roll out the dough once more, vertically from top to bottom, to a rectangle about 24 by 10 inches (60 by 25 centimeters) and 1/4 inch (6 millimeters) thick. Sprinkle a thin, even layer of sugar on the top. Repeat the letter fold. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e 13. Sprinkle another thin, even layer of sugar on the work surface. Place the dough on the sugar. Starting with the seam on the right, roll out the dough one final time to a rectangle about 24 by 10 inches (60 by 25 centimeters) and 1/4 inch (6 millimeters) thick. Sprinkle another thin layer of sugar on top. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e 14. Using a chef's knife, cut the dough into 4-inch (10-centimeter) squares. Each square should weigh about 3 1/2 ounces|100 grams. Sprinkle a little bit more sugar on the work surface. Fold in the corners of each square to meet at the center, pushing the center down firmly. Repeat with the new corners that were formed, again pushing down firmly in the center. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e 15. Line a half sheet pan with a silicone baking mat. Spray lightly with nonstick spray and sprinkle with enough granulated sugar to just lightly coat it. Place the ring molds 4 inches (10 centimeters) apart on the pan. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e 16. Place a square of dough in the center of each ring. The dough will hang over the edges of the mold. Fold the excess dough into the center of the DKA and press down firmly. Proof at room temperature, 15 to 20 minutes. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e 17. While the DKAs are proofing, place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 365°F for conventional or 340°F for convection. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e 18. Bake the DKAs on the center rack for 15 minutes. Rotate the pan 180° and bake for 15 minutes more. The DKAs are finished when they turn golden brown and have about doubled in size. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e 19. Remove from the oven. Using a pair of stainless-steel tongs, unmold the DKAs onto a sheet pan while still hot: Grab the metal rings with the tongs and flip the DKAs over so the flat side is up. Remove the rings. Let the DKAs cool completely, still inverted. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e Enjoy at room temperature. If you are looking for more adventure, slice a DKA in half horizontally and add a scoop of ice cream to make an ice cream sandwich. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e DKAs should be consumed within 6 hours of baking.

The legislature is expected to approve the deal this week. The agreement means low-income adults between the ages of 19 and 25 living in California illegally would be eligible for California\u0026#8217;s Medicaid program, the joint state and federal health insurance program for the poor and disabled.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot everyone in that age group would get the health benefits, but only those whose incomes are low enough to qualify for the program.

The proposal also makes California the first state in the country to help middle income families pay their monthly health insurance premiums. It means a family of four earning as much as six times the federal poverty level \u0026mdash; or more than $150,000 a year \u0026mdash; would be eligible to get about $100 a month from the government to help pay their monthly health insurance premiums.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut to pay for part of it, the state will begin taxing people who don\u0026#8217;t have health insurance.

Several lawmakers in the Democratic-dominated state legislature wanted to go further by offering health coverage to all adults living in California illegally. But Newsom opposed that, noting it would cost $3.4 billion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNewsom did not get everything he wanted in the deal. Advocates say more than 1 million people in California don\u0026#8217;t have access to safe drinking water. Newsom had proposed a 95-cent tax on most residential water bills as well as fees on dairies, animal farms and fertilizer sellers, to help water districts pay for improvements and boost supplies. Lawmakers rejected the tax, arguing it was too burdensome in a year when the state is projected to have a $21.5 billion surplus \u0026mdash; the largest in at least 20 years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, lawmakers decided to use $130 million in existing tax revenue to pay for the drinking water improvements. Most of that money \u0026mdash; about $100 million \u0026mdash; would come from the state\u0026#8217;s sale of carbon credits as part of its \u0026#8220;cap and trade\u0026#8221; program. The move means the state\u0026#8217;s agricultural industry, whose pollution is often blamed for the drinking water problems, would have ab out $100 million less than it normally gets from the program for various projects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNewsom also wanted to expand spend $800 million to boost the annual tax refunds for low-income people who have at least one child under the age of 6. But to pay for it, he wanted to selectively adopt some of the changes to the federal tax code that Trump signed into law in 2017. The changes, which would mostly impact businesses, would have brought the state an extra $1 billion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the legislature did not include the tax changes in its version of the budget proposal.

However, gender equality is not guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution and it won\u0026rsquo;t be unless the \u003ca href=\"http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2025424_2025993_2026015,00.html\" \u003eEqual Rights Amendment\u003c/a\u003e passes.

That is happening now, with the Senate allowing the Violence Against Women Act to expire and doing away with Obama-era guidelines protecting against discrimination based on gender. \u0026ldquo;Constitutional amendments are safe from Donald Trump, unlike Melania\u0026rsquo;s hopes and dreams and any American flag he gets close to,\u0026rdquo; said Oliver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ERA passed the Senate and then the House of Representatives, and then in 1972, the proposed 27th Amendment to the Constitution was sent to the states for ratification. Thirty-seven states have ratified it so far, meaning just one more is needed to make the ERA law. However, momentum for ratification came to a halt, thanks in part to Phyllis Schlafly, described by Oliver as a \u0026ldquo;pre-internet internet troll.\u0026rdquo; Due to her efforts and vitriolic debate, the deadline for ratification came and went.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that the ERA is dead on arrival though. According to Oliver, legal scholars believe that Congress can simply change the deadline again or do away with the deadline entirely and allow the ERA to be ratified. To that point, Nevada and Illinois have ratified the ERA in the last few years and now just one more state is needed to make the ERA law. There are 13 states that Oliver points out could genuinely make history by making the ERA the law of the land. \u0026ldquo;None of this is that complicated,\u0026rdquo; said Oliver. \u0026ldquo;Equality for women should be a basic principle for our society. If you think it already is, great, all the more reason to write it down. And if you think it isn\u0026rsquo;t, then we badly need the ERA.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo do that Oliver beseeched the states to take a stand and ratify the ERA. The states that could make history, include Arizona, Georgia, Oklahoma, either Carolina, Utah, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, Alabama (\u0026ldquo;It definitely won\u0026rsquo;t be you,\u0026rdquo; said Oliver) or Virginia (\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re the birthplace of Chris Brown, Rick Santorum and Pat Robertson, so frankly you owe America this.\u0026rdquo;)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOliver just had one request: \u0026ldquo;Somebody please do it before Florida, because I do not want to give them credit for this.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/time/topstories/~4/KqCi7muIq-0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/KqCi7muIq-0/","published":"2019-06-10T08:52:49Z","guid":"https://time.com/?p=5603729"},{"title":"Internet Entrepreneur Kim Dotcom Fights U.S. Extradition in New Zealand Court","content":"\u003caside class=\"right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad\" id=\"right-rail__ad-5603802\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module video-2\" data-src=\"https://time.com/5603802/kim-dotcom-us-extradition-new-zealand/\" data-widget-id=\"SB_4\" data-ob-template=\"timemag\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(WELLINGTON, New Zealand) \u0026mdash; Internet entrepreneur Kim Dotcom and three of his former colleagues on Monday took their fight against being extradited to the U.S. to New Zealand\u0026#8217;s top court.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Supreme Court began hearing arguments in the seven-year-old case after Dotcom and the others lost several previous court rulings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut even if the men lose their latest appeal, they have legal options which could keep their case alive in the New Zealand court system and delay any extradition for several more years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eU.S. authorities in 2012 shut down Dotcom\u0026#8217;s file-sharing website Megaupload and filed charges of conspiracy, racketeering and money laundering.

Researchers tracked about 1,100 U.S. and U.K. adults, including 240 pairs of twins, for two weeks. They monitored participants\u0026#8217; blood sugar, insulin and fat levels after they ate pre-formulated meals like muffins and glucose drinks; tested the microbes living in their guts; and tracked their sleep and exercise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFoods that spiked one person\u0026#8217;s blood sugar or kept their fat levels elevated for hours didn\u0026#8217;t necessarily do the same for the person dining next to them\u0026mdash;even if they were twins. Individuals even had different responses to the same meals when they were eaten at different times of day. These results suggest that nutrition facts alone cannot predict how a certain food will affect health and weight, Spector says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;It doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean you throw [all nutrition advice] out,\u0026#8221; Spector says. \u0026#8220;There are some guidelines and recommendations around the world that near-everybody agrees on,\u0026#8221; including eating plenty of produce and fiber, and cutting back on calories and\u003ca href=\"https://time.com/5589702/processed-foods-weight-gain-diet/\" \u003e ultra-processed foods\u003c/a\u003e. But plenty of lingering nutrition questions\u0026mdash;\u003ca href=\"https://time.com/5516364/is-eating-breakfast-healthy/\" \u003eIs it okay to skip breakfast\u003c/a\u003e?\u003ca href=\"https://time.com/5354498/is-intermittent-fasting-healthy/\" \u003e Does fasting work\u003c/a\u003e?\u003ca href=\"https://time.com/4919448/low-fat-v-low-carb-diets/\" \u003e Is a low-carb or low-fat diet better for weight loss\u003c/a\u003e?\u0026mdash;may not have one single answer, Spector says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026#8217;s not a terribly surprising finding, especially for anyone whose scale has refused to budge even after careful dieting. That frustrating phenomenon is, in part, why Spector founded\u003ca href=\"https://joinzoe.com/\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003e ZOE\u003c/a\u003e, a company developing a personalized consumer nutrition test. (ZOE also funded the new study.) Spector says he can envision a world where a dieter could search for a food in a personalized database, and immediately get insights into how it would affect their health.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Deborah Good, an associate professor of human nutrition, foods, and exercise at Virginia Tech, says we\u0026#8217;re not there yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile genetic links to certain diet-related conditions, like lactose intolerance and celiac disease, are firmly established, Good says the scientific community doesn\u0026#8217;t fully understand the complicated matrix of genes, environment and biomarkers that influences an individual\u0026#8217;s reactions to a wide range of foods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;We don\u0026#8217;t know enough about all the different things that contribute to it,\u0026#8221; she says. \u0026#8220;Some time in our lifetime we may be able to, at least genetically, be given a set of information at the beginning of our lives [about our health needs]. But we\u0026#8217;re not there yet, and I don\u0026#8217;t know how long it would take.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven some research about gene-specific dieting has been disappointing.\u003ca href=\"https://time.com/5162731/low-fat-low-carb-diet-weight-loss/\" \u003e A major 2018 study\u003c/a\u003e, for example, found that just as many people succeed (or fail) to lose weight on low-carb versus low-fat diets, with no clear reason why. The genetic markers researchers thought would correlate with success on one plan or the other turned out not to, pushing off the prospect of gene-based diets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRather than genetics, Spector says the secret to personalized dieting may rely on the microbiome, or the colony of microbes living in your gut. There\u0026#8217;s still a lot scientists don\u0026#8217;t understand about the microbiome, but buzzy studies suggest it affects\u003ca href=\"https://time.com/5597688/microbiome-diabetes-premature-birth-prediction/\" \u003e many aspects of human health\u003c/a\u003e. The latest study presented at the American Society of Nutrition conference revealed that even identical twins only had about 37% overlap in gut microbes\u0026mdash;compared to 35% for unrelated individuals\u0026mdash;which may explain why they respond to foods differently, Spector says. In light of those differences, Spector says tailoring food choices around the microbiome, not just the genome, may unlock the full potential of personalized eating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScientists still don\u0026rsquo;t know enough about gut bacteria or diet-gene interactions to offer the type of personalized advice that would actually be helpful for dieters. For now, Spector says, all people can do is follow nutrition suggestions that do appear to be universal, like eating a diverse array of plants and cutting back on processed food, and take blanket nutrition guidelines with a grain of salt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/time/topstories/~4/dL4EASfH0Ko\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/dL4EASfH0Ko/","published":"2019-06-10T13:00:48Z","guid":"https://time.com/?p=5600706"}]},{"url":"https://rss.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml","items":[{"title":"Tony Awards 2019: Live Updates","content":"","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/09/theater/tony-awards.html?emc=rss\u0026partner=rss","published":"2019-06-10T00:00:22Z","guid":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/09/theater/tony-awards.html"},{"title":"Sudan Protesters, Devastated but Defiant, Regroup Underground After Crackdown","content":"","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/09/world/africa/sudan-protest-crackdown.html?emc=rss\u0026partner=rss","published":"2019-06-10T00:16:01Z","guid":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/09/world/africa/sudan-protest-crackdown.html"},{"title":"How NYC Taxi Drivers Bought Medallions and Became Victims of a Reckless Lending Scheme","content":"","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/07/the-weekly/nyc-taxi-medallion-suicides-the-weekly.html?emc=rss\u0026partner=rss","published":"2019-06-10T00:20:21Z","guid":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/07/the-weekly/nyc-taxi-medallion-suicides-the-weekly.html"},{"title":"‘Help Us!’ The Panic at D.C.

It also would increase\ntravel and tourism and deepen the connection between our countries. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe\nVisa Waiver Program allows the citizens of the current 38 member states to\ntravel to participating countries for up to 90 days without having to obtain a\nvisa. Extensive vetting and background searches still occur through the Electronic\nSystem for Travel Authorization. If approved, individuals are authorized to\ntravel within a two-year period for up to 90 days at a time. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe\nVisa Waiver Program has a number of \u003ca href=\"https://fas.org/sgp/crs/homesec/RL32221.pdf\"\u003erequirements\u003c/a\u003e that must be met for a country to\nparticipate, such as maintaining a non-immigrant visa refusal rate of less than\n3 percent, providing reciprocal travel privileges to U.S. citizens, and sharing\nintelligence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Visa\nWaiver Program generates a great deal of travel to the U.S. According to the Department\nof Homeland Security, non-immigrant admissions from member countries totaled\nroughly \u003ca href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Nonimmigrant_Admissions_2017.pdf\"\u003e23.6 million\u003c/a\u003e in 2017, or 31 percent of the total—a\ndefinitive boost for tourism in the U.S.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe\nprogram is a boon for \u003ca href=\"https://www.gao.gov/assets/680/676948.pdf\"\u003esecurity\u003c/a\u003e as well, as shared information from Visa Waiver Program participants\nhas aided criminal investigations and counterterrorism vetting in the U.S.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn\ntune with Duda’s upcoming state visit, it is time to recognize that Poland deserves\nVisa Waiver Program membership, even though it would require \u0026nbsp;re-evaluating the policy of requiring a visa\nrefusal rate of less than 3 percent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePreviously,\ncountries with a visa refusal rate of 10 percent or less could join the program,\nbut Congress has since lowered the requirement to 3 percent. This means nations\nlooking to join today sometimes have lower rates than member countries did when\nthey first joined. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut a\nbetter metric to focus on is the visa overstay rate, which more accurately measures\nthe risk of individuals overstaying their visas. Thus, the best solution would\nbe to return to the previous 10 percent visa refusal rate standard, and to add in\na requirement that a low visa overstay rate must be maintained as well. This\nwould protect the integrity of the program and allow for growth. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAn\nalternate method for joining the program also could be made available to NATO\nmembers. Countries that meet their military spending obligations under NATO—2\npercent of GDP— and have a low overstay rate should be allowed to join the Visa\nWaiver Program. Considering the proximity to Russia of countries such as Poland,\nRomania, Bulgaria, and Croatia, which are members of NATO but not the Visa\nWaiver Program, and the increasing influence of China in the region, it would\nbe prudent for the U.S. to grant them entry into the Visa Waiver Program if they\nmeet such alternative requirements. \n\nTrump should be prepared to discuss paths\nforward on the program with Duda. Doing so would advance the U.S.’s economic,\nforeign policy, and security interests. \n\n\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe post \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.dailysignal.com/2019/06/10/its-time-for-poland-to-join-the-visa-waiver-program/\"\u003eIt’s Time for Poland to Join the Visa Waiver Program\u003c/a\u003e appeared first on \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.dailysignal.com/\"\u003eThe Daily Signal\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://www.dailysignal.com/2019/06/10/its-time-for-poland-to-join-the-visa-waiver-program/","published":"2019-06-10T06:01:39Z","guid":"https://www.dailysignal.com/?p=527433"}]},{"url":"https://thinkprogress.org/feed","items":[{"title":"BREAKING: Supreme Court will hear a major attack on anti-discrimination law","content":"\u003cp\u003eThe Supreme Court announced on Monday that it would hear \u003ca href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/comcast-corp-v-national-association-of-african-american-owned-media/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eComcast Corp. v.

Some executives, for example, may be driven by racist motives, while others may act for legitimate business reasons. For this reason, the law permits what are known as \u0026#8220;mixed-motive\u0026#8221; suits, which allow civil rights plaintiffs to prevail in some cases where they face discrimination for a combination of both legitimate and illegal reasons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003cem\u003eComcast\u003c/em\u003e case asks the Supreme Court to hold that claims under the Reconstruction-era ban on contract discrimination must show \u0026#8220;but-for causation.\u0026#8221; That is, for a plaintiff to prevail, they must show that, in the absence of racist motivations, they would have been treated differently. That is often very difficult to prove, as it essentially requires plaintiffs to prove that events would have been different had everyone been living in an alternative reality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnder current law, if a plaintiff shows that the defendant had mixed motives, the burden of proof shifts to the defendant to show that they would have made the same decisions in the absence of invidious motives. If the defendant cannot meet this burden of proof, they may be held liable for their actions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven before the Supreme Court took a hard right turn under President Donald Trump, its Republican majority was \u003ca href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/18-1185-opinion-below.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003every hostile to mixed-motive suits\u003c/a\u003e.

In particular, Microsoft finally began paying forward its investment in various acquisitions over the past couple of years to make a huge Xbox Game Studios statement in the form of legitimate gameplay variety.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven with that in mind, nobody in the room was surprised to see one game elicit the loudest response: \u003cem\u003eHalo Infinite\u003c/em\u003e, now confirmed for \"holiday 2020\" as a launch title for \u003ca href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/06/microsoft-reveals-first-details-on-project-scarlett-game-console-for-2020/\"\u003ethe code-named Xbox Scarlett console\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\"We lost.

That may not sound like much, but when it comes to increasing streaming quality and reducing apparent latency, every little bit helps. Average bandwidth usage in a 10-minute gameplay test reportedly dropped from 23.43 Mbps to 13.67 Mbps at the demo, while GPU utilization on the server side dropped from a high of 64 percent to a low

Consumers are overwhelming, picking these quasi-SUVs over sedans or sport utility vehicles. There\u0026#8217;s a good reason, too. Crossovers often provide the supple ride quality of a sedan with the utility of an SUV. I\u0026#8217;m sorry to report the Q8 does the opposite. It has the rough ride of an SUV and the limited utility of a sedan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Q8 has a puzzling powertrain. It doesn\u0026#8217;t like to go forward. Several times throughout my time with the Q8, I nearly got into an accident because of the timing of the transmission. It often left me hanging in the middle of the road while it took its time to translate the engine\u0026#8217;s instructions to the tires. I was honked at constantly while in NYC.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA turbocharged 3.0-liter V6 rests under the hood, and Audi says it\u0026#8217;s good for 335 HP and 369 pound-foot of torque. The Q8 is not underpowered, and it sports a version of ZF\u0026#8217;s ubiquitous 8-speed transmission. The Audi Q8 is one of the first internal combustion vehicles to be paired with a 48-volt mild hybrid system. This is said to help improve fuel economy by relegating acceleration to a mild hybrid setup, and this could prove to be the cause of my frustration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhoever\u0026#8217;s to blame, in real life, the transmission feels like it doesn\u0026#8217;t use the first and second gear. There\u0026#8217;s a second or two hesitation between the time the pedal is engaged until the car decides to move forward. Once underway, the Q8 is a lovely expressway cruiser with plenty of power to overtake meandering sedans. At speed, it\u0026#8217;s comfortable and confident. At a standstill, it\u0026#8217;s hesitant and frustrating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026#8217;m not alone in this frustration. \u003ca href=\"https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a21786823/2019-audi-q8-first-drive-review/\"\u003eCar and Driver says\u003c/a\u003e the Q8 is \u0026#8220;it felt hesitant around town unless we crushed the gas pedal.\u0026#8221; \u003ca href=\"https://www.motor1.com/reviews/353167/2019-audi-q8-review/\"\u003eMotor1 says\u003c/a\u003e, \u0026#8220;At times [the transmission is] clunky, particularly when accelerating…\u0026#8221; \u003ca href=\"https://www.motortrend.com/news/2019-audi-q8-first-drive-review/\"\u003eMotor Trend stated\u003c/a\u003e, \u0026#8220;We noted, however, a longish delay in the delivery of torque after you give it some beans.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAudi built the Q8 as a multipurpose utility vehicle and equipped it with several driving modes, including Dynamic, which lowers the vehicle and supposedly changes the transmission response. Select Off Road or All Road, and the Q8 raises a few inches, providing better ground clearance. This is handy on Michigan roads where post-winter potholes are the size of bathtubs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese driving modes give the Q8 added utility and foreshadow a future where cars better adapt to their driver\u0026#8217;s needs. Audi has offered similar features for years but not to this extreme. The Sport mode drops the Q8 to the ground while the Off-Road mode raises the Q8 to a level where it could tackle serious terrain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSadly, the adjustable modes did not address the lackluster powertrain. Even in Sport mode, the Q8\u0026#8217;s transmission was sluggish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least the Q8 is comfortable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe interior of the Q8 is lovely and features Audi\u0026#8217;s new dual-touchscreen infotainment center. I love it. Audi long had the best user interface in the industry. This one is entirely different and even better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"embed breakout\"\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"DMHpMfC73m\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/07/audi-proves-two-little-screens-are-better-than-one-big-screen/\"\u003eAudi proves two little screens are better than one big screen\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ciframe title=\"\u0026#8220;Audi proves two little screens are better than one big screen\u0026#8221; \u0026#8212; TechCrunch\" class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/07/audi-proves-two-little-screens-are-better-than-one-big-screen/embed/#?secret=DMHpMfC73m\" data-secret=\"DMHpMfC73m\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are two touchscreens in the middle of the Q8. The one on the top handles media, mapping, and vehicle settings. The one on the bottom is for climate control. Both feature fantastic haptic feedback. Hit a button on the screen, and a slight vibration makes it feel like you touched a real button.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo me, this dual screen setup is a better solution than a giant screen like Tesla or Ram uses in their vehicles. In Audi\u0026#8217;s solution, both are tilted to provide easy access, and there\u0026#8217;s less of a learning curve. The setup follows the general button placement found in cars for the last few decades. Climate is always on and always on the bottom. The radio and mapping screen is on the top and can be turned off to reduce distractions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA screen lives behind the steering wheel, too, and sports a similar layout to Audi\u0026#8217;s current system. The driver can easily switch between information screens with the speedo and tach on either side. Hit a button on the steering wheel, and the gauges reduce in size while the map increases. It\u0026#8217;s a handy feature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Q8\u0026#8217;s seats are fantastic and nearly make up for the lackluster driving capabilities. They\u0026#8217;re firm yet forgiving with endless adjustments. The seats, with their built-in massagers, made the boring Ohio turnpike a bearable experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Q8\u0026#8217;s interior space is not as ample as I expected and I think it has to do with the naming scheme. The Q8 joins the small Q5 and seven-seater Q7 in Audi\u0026#8217;s lineup. The name suggests the Q8 is larger than the Q7 in the same way that the Audi sedan A8 is larger than the A7. But it\u0026#8217;s not. The Q8 is a five-passenger vehicle with less cargo room available than the Q7.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was able to get three suitcases and a couple of backpacks in the back. The lack of storage space is evident throughout the cabin. The center console is only two smartphone\u0026#8217;s deep. There isn\u0026#8217;t a spot for sunglasses. Two adults could sit in the backseat, but I would fight for the front.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, the Q8 is comfortable, and a nice size, but the name suggests a larger vehicle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike it or not, the Q8 is the shape of the future. Its sheet metal conveys a sense of on or off-road sportiness. The Q8 is designed around the driver, too, and the Q8 could be a fantastic package. It looks beautiful inside and out; I love the shape and form of the Q8. It\u0026#8217;s stunning and comfortable to sit in. I don\u0026#8217;t like how the Q8 drives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"feedflare\"\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=ykukj8J62kc:k78dIIlp7MM:2mJPEYqXBVI\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=ykukj8J62kc:k78dIIlp7MM:7Q72WNTAKBA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=ykukj8J62kc:k78dIIlp7MM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=ykukj8J62kc:k78dIIlp7MM:-BTjWOF_DHI\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=ykukj8J62kc:k78dIIlp7MM:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=ykukj8J62kc:k78dIIlp7MM:D7DqB2pKExk\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=ykukj8J62kc:k78dIIlp7MM:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=ykukj8J62kc:k78dIIlp7MM:qj6IDK7rITs\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/ykukj8J62kc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/ykukj8J62kc/","published":"2019-06-10T13:36:13Z","guid":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=1839612"}]},{"url":"https://www.theverge.com/rss/full.xml","items":[{"title":"The 9 biggest announcements from Bethesda’s E3 2019 keynote","content":"\u003cimg alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gpZZCzszJJW-EOZHe7UnVMXeVmo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/63976702/acastro_199529_1777_bethesda_0002.0.0.jpg\" /\u003e\n\n\n\n  \u003cp id=\"MhNvw6\"\u003eWhile we didn’t learn any more about \u003cem\u003eStarfield\u003c/em\u003e or \u003cem\u003eThe Elder Scrolls VI\u003c/em\u003e — both of which were teased last year — Bethesda’s E3 keynote today still had some great reveals. \u003cem\u003eFallout 76\u003c/em\u003e is getting a massive update, \u003cem\u003eDoom Eternal\u003c/em\u003e has a release date, and Shinji Mikami has a new horror game.

The system, called Orion, could be added to a wide variety of games across different game streaming services. Bethesda promises that it will give players a higher-quality experience that’s accessible on slower internet speeds, and it’s opening a limited beta test later this year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"cWnzVb\"\u003eBethesda announced the news at the 2019 E3 show in Los Angeles, where cloud gaming hype is intense. Among other services, Google recently revealed the pricing and release date for its \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/6/18654632/google-stadia-price-release-date-games-bethesda-ea-doom-ubisoft-e3-2019\"\u003eStadia game streaming system\u003c/a\u003e, and Microsoft announced details about its \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/24/18638728/microsoft-xcloud-game-streaming-service-details\"\u003exCloud platform\u003c/a\u003e earlier today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-float-right\"\u003e\u003caside id=\"mHJOkI\"\u003e\u003cq\u003eOrion complements other game streaming platforms\u003c/q\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"FIrnr2\"\u003eOrion is supposed to complement, not compete with, these kinds of services. “This can be put into any game engine, it can be used with any streaming platform to provide a better experience for any consumer playing that game on that platform and to deliver it at a lower cost for whoever’s serving the data,” promises Bethesda director of publishing James Altman. Essentially, it works by delegating some processing tasks to the game engine locally, rather than performing them as they’re transmitted to the player over the internet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"H7VaRP\"\u003eBethesda says that turning on just one of several Orion features cuts the  bandwidth that’s required for a high-quality streaming experience by 40 percent. It also supposedly reduces the time it takes to encode a frame of video (which is then streamed to the player) by 30 percent and trims the compute work that’s required by 20 percent. The company didn’t say how much turning on all Orion features would improve a stream, although Altman says that various kinds of games will benefit more from different features.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-float-right\"\u003e\u003caside id=\"HAgQ9n\"\u003e\u003cq\u003ePlayers can stream Doom in the preview\u003c/q\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"t1Uwq8\"\u003eTheoretically, Orion mitigates some of the biggest problems facing cloud gaming. It could lower the minimum internet speed for a platform like Stadia, which currently suggests a 25Mbps connection. It could make your physical distance from a server less important, so services could run fewer data centers; that’s good news for companies that don’t have the massive resources of Google or Sony. And since we don’t know how well most of these services perform yet, anything that cuts latency and improves image quality could turn a mediocre experience into a good one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"jHb1Mf\"\u003eStreaming platforms will need to enable Orion, but Altman says it won’t be an onerous process; developers will be primarily responsible for integrating it into their games. He wouldn’t confirm whether any specific companies were on board, but he suggested that Bethesda was in talks with studios and platforms. Bethesda already committed to bringing its titles to streaming services, including the \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/19/18272797/google-stadia-doom-eternal-games-cloud-service-announcement-gdc-2019\"\u003eupcoming \u003cem\u003eDoom Eternal\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, which will run on Stadia.

The edited speech also doesn’t seem like it can differ too much from the source material, and in their best quality fakes, the researchers asked the subjects to record new audio to match the changes, using AI to generate the video. (This is because audio fakes are sometimes subpar, though the quality is certainly \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/17/18629024/joe-rogan-ai-fake-voice-clone-deepfake-dessa\"\u003egetting much better\u003c/a\u003e.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Ob3tua\"\u003eThe researchers also note that they can’t yet change the mood or tone of the speaker’s voice as doing so would lead to “uncanny results.” And that any occlusions of the face — e.g. if someone waves their hands while speaking — throw off the algorithm completely. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Ta5CIx\"\u003eSo, the technology is not perfect, but these sorts of limitations always feature in early-stage research and it’s almost guaranteed they’ll be overcome in time.

We acknowledge that bad actors might use such technologies to falsify personal statements and slander prominent individuals.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"SBdYT8\"\u003eBut the remedy they suggest is hardly comforting. They say to prevent confusion, AI-edited video should be clearly presented as such, either through the use of watermarking or through context (e.g. an audience understanding that they’re watching a fictional film). \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"E2UqBo\"\u003eBut watermarks are easily removed and a loss of context is one of the hallmarks of online media. Fakes don’t need to be flawless to have an impact either.

It’s compatible with all of the Moto Mod accessories dating back to 2016, and the unlocked model comes with the 360 camera Mod in the box. Verizon is the only carrier that will sell the Z4 directly in the US, but you can buy the unlocked version and use it on other carriers. I’ve been testing an unlocked model on T-Mobile’s network.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"E6YhJ5\"\u003eWhat’s good about it?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"rvMugv\"\u003eThe most impressive thing about the Z4 is its battery life. Motorola put a 3,600mAh battery — the largest of any Moto Z phone — a power-efficient processor, and a 1080p display in the Z4, which combined together result in a device that can easily last a couple of days between charges with normal usage, without the need for aggressive power-saving features or notification policing. I haven’t been this impressed with a phone’s stamina since the original \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/10/15236138/moto-z-play-battery-life\"\u003eMoto Z Play from 2016\u003c/a\u003e. As an experiment, I tested how long the battery would last away from the charger with one of Motorola’s battery pack Mods and the Z4 was able to last from Saturday to Tuesday under normal usage and without needing to plug in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"RO0W4p\"\u003eThe Z4’s display is also very good, despite it having a lower resolution than other phones. It has excellent color reproduction, great viewing angles, gets bright enough to read outdoors on a sunny day, and has those deep, rich blacks we’ve come to expect from OLED screens. It does have a small notch cut out of the top for the front-facing camera, but it’s one of the smallest display cutouts I’ve seen and doesn’t get in the way of any video watching or other screen functionality. This is the kind of screen I expect to see on phones much more expensive than the Z4.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"c-image-grid\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-image-grid__item\"\u003e  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Sdzr7Qky-NT7gdhDy0iOYeQwqIU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16320168/akrales_190604_3465_0039.jpg\"\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-image-grid__item\"\u003e  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EveUMEAD68phqoy0m2zWRbXudq4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16320163/akrales_190604_3465_0045.jpg\"\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"1nODrb\"\u003eMotorola phones are usually very well put together, with recent models embracing the trend of a sandwich of glass front and backs with a metal frame in between. The Z4 is no different, the back of the phone has a smooth, matte glass finish and all of its seams and tolerances are very tight. It feels like a much more expensive phone when I hold it. Additionally, Motorola has actually added a 3.5mm headphone jack to the Z4, something that wasn’t on any prior flagship Moto Z device. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ptsMel\"\u003eFinally, the Moto Z4 has good software. It’s launching with Android 9 Pie out of the box and it includes Motorola’s customizations, such as an improved gesture navigation interface and the ability to control various functions of the phone by shaking or flipping it. The actual software interface is clean and uncluttered, and the phone is free of bloatware and other preloads that nobody ever really asks for (at least on the unlocked model I’ve been using). Motorola doesn’t have a great track record of updating its phones when new versions of Android come out, but even if it never gets an update, the Z4’s software provides a good experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"WENpoG\"\u003eWhat’s fine about it?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"mzw3up\"\u003eThe Z4’s mid-range price means that Motorola had to cut some corners compared to the much more expensive flagship phones on the market. The first thing you’ll notice is the Z4 isn’t as fast or snappy as a \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/14/18618382/oneplus-7-pro-review-android-camera-screen-phone-price\"\u003eOnePlus 7 Pro\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/12/18260351/samsung-galaxy-s10-review-specs-price-features\"\u003eSamsung Galaxy S10\u003c/a\u003e. That’s because its mid-range Qualcomm Snapdragon 675 processor, while very good for battery life,  is nowhere near as high-end as the Snapdragon 855 found in many flagships this year.  The Z4 isn’t as fast or smooth as other phones, and it certainly won’t win any speed races. That isn’t to say its performance is bad by any means and I didn’t really see any glitches or hiccups in my time testing the phone. But if you’re the kind of person that wants the ultimate performance from your phone, the OnePlus 7 Pro or Samsung Galaxy S10 will scratch that itch better than the Z4.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"EgFxOU\"\u003eThe Moto Z4’s main camera uses just one lens and sensor, as opposed to the multiple lenses we see on most phones at this point. Fortunately, that single sensor is good – it’s the same 48-megapixel camera found on the \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/5/29/18642345/oneplus7-review-price-release-date\"\u003eOnePlus 7\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/17/18383562/xiaomi-mi-9-review-price-specs-features\"\u003eXiaomi Mi 9\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/1/18204980/honor-view-20-review-oneplus-competition\"\u003eHonor View 20\u003c/a\u003e – and it can take bright detailed images in most lighting.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YxmMw8p4iGWrfOGI2EGd7rd6J8U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16320165/akrales_190604_3465_0020.jpg\"\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Tu2tzW\"\u003eSurprisingly, Motorola has a night mode that actually works well to pull more details out of low light scenarios, much like how \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/14/18092660/google-night-sight-review-pixel-2-3-camera-photos-image-quality\"\u003eNight Sight works on Google’s Pixel phones\u003c/a\u003e. But Motorola’s night mode isn’t quite to the level of Google’s, and it often produces exaggerated colors with an abundance of saturation. Still, it’s better than the night mode options on many other phones in this price range.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"w8HVC7\"\u003eThe Moto Z4 has a single speaker on the top of the phone’s frame, as opposed to the bottom where most phone speakers are located. It gets fairly loud and mostly sounds fine, but it doesn’t compare to the stereo speakers available on many other devices. You could improve the Z4’s sound quality with a JBL Soundboost 2 Mod, but that will cost you $79.99 and adds a lot of bulk and weight to the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"WGcOdj\"\u003eWhat’s not good about it?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"cFMLv6\"\u003eThe biggest issue with the Moto Z4 is the same thing that’s been plaguing many other phones this year: its fancy under-display fingerprint scanner just isn’t very good. Motorola’s using an optical sensor here – same as OnePlus and Xiaomi – and it’s slower and less accurate than side or rear-mounted scanners. It often takes more than a beat for the phone to recognize my finger and unlock, and many times it will take multiple attempts to unlock. Motorola does offer a face-unlock feature that relies on the front camera, but it’s not a 3D mapping system, so it’s far less secure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"c-image-grid\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-image-grid__item\"\u003e  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xVTeP9LImJQIamKi4_EBkyBJLAo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16320161/akrales_190604_3465_0076.jpg\"\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-image-grid__item\"\u003e  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4yKaWK6RqVFaE3fVIDc_0LogA9Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16320162/akrales_190604_3465_0059.jpg\"\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ySuSGT\"\u003eLike every other Moto Z phone before it, the Moto Z4 supports Motorola’s Moto Mod system of modular accessories that attach to the back of the phone via magnets. Popular Mods include battery packs and speakers, which help extend the life away from a wall outlet or improve the sound quality of the phone. If you’re a Verizon customer, there’s even a 5G Mod that will add 5G capabilities to the Z4.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"2vvpxm\"\u003eFunctionally, all the mods I tested with the Z4, including the 360-degree camera Mod that comes in the box with the unlocked model, work just the same as they do on other Moto Z phones. But since Motorola slightly changed the design of the Z4’s frame – it now has a small chamfered finish that adds a slight curve to the back – none of the mods available actually sit flush with the phone. There’s a roughly 1mm lip around the entire edge when a Mod is attached that makes the accessory feel less like a cohesive part of the whole phone and more like the bolt-on piece that it is. The redesigned frame does make the Z4 more comfortable to hold when you don’t have a Mod attached, but it’s strange that Motorola would commit to continue supporting the Mods on the Z4 and then compromise the experience with them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"0RHahO\"\u003eWho should consider it?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"adNRfA\"\u003eThe Moto Z4 is really only worth considering if you get it for an amazing deal, like Verizon’s launch offer if you open a new line of service. At that price, it’s an excellent phone, and a better option than Motorola’s G7 lineup, which are typically priced in that range. And if you’re really curious about how Verizon’s 5G network stacks up, you can pick up the 5G Moto Mod to add next-generation network capability to the phone. (I have a sneaking suspicion that the whole reason the Moto Z4 exists is because Verizon wanted an inexpensive 5G phone to sell to its customers.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"c-end-para\" id=\"qByFvg\"\u003eAt full price, the Moto Z4 is a tougher sell. Sure, the battery life is great, and the display is surprisingly good, but I’d be more inclined to buy last year’s \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/29/18037414/oneplus-6t-review-price-specs-battery-life-camera-display-fingerprint-sensor\"\u003eOnePlus 6T\u003c/a\u003e for a similar price and get faster performance, even better software, and better software support. If you own one of the older Z models and have a stack of Moto Mods looking for a home, the Z4 is the most modern option for you, but the rest of us are better off elsewhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"lKeiGV\"\u003e\u003csmall\u003e\u003cem\u003eVox Media has affiliate partnerships.

Sony recently hinted that the \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/21/18633791/sony-playstation-5-demo-load-times-cloud-gaming\"\u003efuture of PlayStation is the cloud\u003c/a\u003e, and Microsoft is making it clear that Project Scarlett will now form part of its own cloud future.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nKYgPGiFrXAY0mUkquEy7zx9pPo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16328793/XGP_Ultimate_InsiderAnnounce_Hero_940x528_RGB_hero.jpg\"\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-float-left\"\u003e\u003caside id=\"iRupeo\"\u003e\u003cq\u003eExclusive games will be a key part of xCloud\u003c/q\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"LaGWsQ\"\u003eMicrosoft’s lack of xCloud details makes it clear that the company is taking a very careful approach at how it transitions games and its platform to the cloud. Game streaming still has massive hurdles to overcome, both in latency and bandwidth requirements, and Microsoft, Sony, and Google can’t fix those alone. Stadia’s 4K streaming will \u003ca href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/stadia-4k-streaming-will-use-up-1tb-of-data-in-65-hours/\"\u003euse up 1TB of data in around 65 hours\u003c/a\u003e, which would blow past most data caps that exist today. We’ll need better internet connectivity across the US, fewer data caps, and data centers that are closer to players to really see the benefits of cloud streaming. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"MUUSaP\"\u003eInstead, Microsoft is focusing heavily on games and subscription services. \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/9/18658682/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-pc-games-xbox-live-pricing-features-e3-2019\"\u003eXbox Game Pass Ultimate\u003c/a\u003e now combines Xbox Game Pass for consoles and PC with Xbox Live Gold access all for $14.99 per month. If Microsoft can transition this service over to xCloud eventually then it will be a step ahead of Google’s approach that is more like renting a console in the cloud and buying the games on top. Google will have some titles bundled, but the vast majority of launch games will have to be purchased separately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"cmumal\"\u003eMicrosoft has acquired \u003cem\u003ePsychonauts \u003c/em\u003edeveloper Double Fine to help with the effort of getting content for xCloud and Xbox Game Pass.

If Microsoft truly wants to create a “Netflix for video games,” then these new Xbox Game Studios members will have to create exclusive games that really convince people to subscribe to Xbox Game Pass. Google also knows how important games will be to Stadia, and it has \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/19/18272996/google-stadia-studio-games-entertainment-exclusives-gdc-2019\"\u003eformed its own studio for Stadia-exclusives\u003c/a\u003e.

Since then, Waze features have \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/5/18297146/google-maps-incident-reporting-traffic-slowdowns-waze-new-feature-android\"\u003ecrept\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/6/18655362/google-maps-speedometer-live-speed-limits-waze-features\"\u003etheir way\u003c/a\u003e into Google Maps from time to time, and vice versa.

For Waze, Google is keeping the feature Android-only for now. It’s also only launching in the US for English-speakers — and Waze-specific commands may not work in Android Auto.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"h3IVPq\"\u003eThe main differentiator is that Google is touting that you can make your traffic reports with your voice instead of tapping buttons on the screen.

Art of Gold Making in Yazd","content":"\u003cp\u003eThe innovative and sophisticated way of making these jewelry has almost made it impossible to copy them. Some samples of them, which have been around for about 500 years, are not available anywhere except Yazd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaking jewels is one of the traditional arts of the historical city of Yazd, and it is known in Iran and around the world as “Yazdi Zargari”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gold that is generally made in Iran has a fineness of 18 karats, but the gold traditionally made in Yazd by the goldsmiths always has a fineness of 20 karats. This is one of the reasons for the reputation of traditional jewelry of Yazd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn official with the Cultural Heritage and Handicraft Department of Yazd province says in the works excavated in the historic region of Mehriz, there were some jewelries from the Parthian era dating back to about 2,000 years ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, the chains known as \u0026#8220;Chin-Abi\u0026#8221; are the traditional brands of Yazd. The name of this chain is taken from its type and the style of its manufacturing. The softness of this chain should be like water. In other words, it should be made as soft as water. These types of chains are made up of golden filaments, rods, a chain with 20-karat gold rings, which just belong to Yazd, as well as copper and silver alloys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe method of making chains called \u0026#8220;Hel Malileh Yazdi\u0026#8221;, \u0026#8220;Toop Malileh Yazdi\u0026#8221;, \u0026#8220;Hel va Gol-e Yazd\u0026#8221;, etc., are the techniques belonging to Yazdi Zargari which has been registered as an intangible cultural heritage of the country.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition to the sophisticated creation of Yazdi jewelry, measuring the purity of gold in Yazd is a special and traditional method registered as a national heritage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Yazd, the purity of gold is measured using the karat millesimal system. Yazdi goldsmiths of the past have been using this method. By this method of measurement, Yazdi goldsmiths measured their products precisely and without any shortcomings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e78 cultural and historical works have been listed as intangible cultural heritage of the province so far.
