In the middle of the lounge sat a towering blue sculpture by conceptual artist Ryan Gander, the inaugural winner of the Pommery Prize for large-scale sculpture. Guests could grab a glass and ponder the piece, sit and chat on cozy couches, or wander through the wares of dozens of galleries set up at Manhattan's Piers 92 and 94 in March of this year. In the VIP lounge, magnums of the brand's 2002 vintage Champagne were available.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePartnering with the fair and establishing an artistic prize was the brainchild of Pommery's CEO Nathalie Vranken.

This has been amended many times over the generations and was most recently renegotiated in 2011.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt works like this: The Royals hand over all of the profits from their vast Crown Estate property portfolio, which is one of the U.K.\u0026#8217;s largest, and includes assets such as Windsor Great Park, Ascot racecourse, and a mixture of residential and commercial properties stretching from London to the farthest ends of Scotland and Northern Ireland.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe U.K. government then returns to the family a fixed payment of around 15% of this total income through a 'Sovereign Grant.'

Of that, the Royal Family spent ?67 million.

E. \u0026amp; J.

As they aged into adulthood, wine seemed fancy, especially compared with low-calorie beers and the cheap stuff liquor makers were selling.

On a per-serving basis, wine is more expensive than beer and spirits. That makes it tough for millennials to stomach a $30 bottle of wine with roughly five servings (and oxidizes), while a similarly priced bottle of Maker's Mark serves 25 and has a long shelf life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLately, wine has been hurt by stiffer competition from craft brewers and new threats like cannabis and nonalcoholic beverages.

But in recent years, producers are finding a new way to tell the story of sherry wine through their \u003cem\u003een rama \u003c/em\u003ebottlings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnlike the low-intervention, almost laissez-faire styles of wine that have captured oenophiles' attention over the past decade, winemaking in the \"\u003ca href=\"https://www.lonelyplanet.com/spain/andalucia/the-sherry-triangle\"\u003eSherry Triangle\u003c/a\u003e\" of southwestern Spain is a carefully calculated and orchestrated dance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn sherry production, wines move through a system called \u003cem\u003esolera\u003c/em\u003e, in which several rows of barrels are stacked on top of one another, almost like a pyramid. The youngest wines, after being fortified, enter the \u003cem\u003esolera\u003c/em\u003e on the top row. As a portion of finished wines are removed for bottling from the bottom, younger wines are fractionally moved down into barrels containing older wines, and a continual blending process occurs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome styles of sherry are aged--either partially or fully during its time in the \u003cem\u003esolera\u003c/em\u003e--under a blanket of yeast known as \u003cem\u003eflor\u003c/em\u003e. This layer protects the sherry from air and oxidation. Wines labeled as \"fino\" or \"manzanilla\" (the term for a fino wine specifically from the town of Sanl?car de Barrameda) spend their time completely under \u003cem\u003eflor\u003c/em\u003e --a process known as \"biological aging\"--for a minimum of two years, but most producers opt for at least four. These are the freshest, most lively styles of sherry and exhibit a salty and nutty quality. Amontillados and palo cortado sherries see both \u003cem\u003eflor\u003c/em\u003e and oxidative aging. Oloroso sherry, on the other hand, is aged completely oxidatively and doesn't spend time under \u003cem\u003eflor\u003c/em\u003e. Also considered to be dry sherries, these last three exhibit varying levels of richness, nuttiness, and complexity. Sweet styles made with Pedro Xim?nez wine grapes round out a bodega's offerings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"inline-image-default-width alignnone\"  \u003e\u003ca href=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/dsc8962-como-objeto-inteligente-1-copia-1-e1561489149206.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg data-attachment-id=\"2657984\" data-permalink=\"http://fortune.com/longform/what-is-sherry-winemaking/_dsc8962-como-objeto-inteligente-1-copia-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/dsc8962-como-objeto-inteligente-1-copia-1-e1561489149206.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"3000,1996\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{\u0026quot;aperture\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;8\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;credit\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;camera\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;NIKON D700\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;created_timestamp\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;1384428079\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;copyright\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;Emilio Lustau S.A\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;focal_length\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;17\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;iso\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;200\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;shutter_speed\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;1.3\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;title\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;orientation\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;1\u0026quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Lustau\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/dsc8962-como-objeto-inteligente-1-copia-1-e1561489149206.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/dsc8962-como-objeto-inteligente-1-copia-1-e1561489149206.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-2657984\" src=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/dsc8962-como-objeto-inteligente-1-copia-1-e1561489149206.jpg?w=1024\u0026#038;h=681\" alt=\"Lustau\" width=\"1024\" height=\"681\" srcset=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/dsc8962-como-objeto-inteligente-1-copia-1-e1561489149206.jpg?w=1024\u0026amp;h=681 1024w, https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/dsc8962-como-objeto-inteligente-1-copia-1-e1561489149206.jpg?w=2048\u0026amp;h=1362 2048w, https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/dsc8962-como-objeto-inteligente-1-copia-1-e1561489149206.jpg?w=150\u0026amp;h=100 150w, https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/dsc8962-como-objeto-inteligente-1-copia-1-e1561489149206.jpg?w=300\u0026amp;h=200 300w, https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/dsc8962-como-objeto-inteligente-1-copia-1-e1561489149206.jpg?w=768\u0026amp;h=511 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"image-caption\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"credit\"\u003eEmilio Lustau S.A\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSherry's identity, for the most part, relies heavily on the aging process, unlike most regions where the concept of terroir is the message winemakers want to convey.

Back in the 1990s, the market demanded sherries that were very plain and essentially devoid of color, according to the winery's director Armando Guerra. Although these heavily filtered styles were in vogue, Barbadillo felt they weren't the true expression of manzanilla. Using some of the oldest wines in their bodegas, winemaker and director of production Montserrat Molina bottled the first \u003cem\u003een rama\u003c/em\u003e sherries in 1999 as a way to capture what she considered the truest expression of the wine.

Much of the fish comes from Ensenada, up north on the Baja Peninsula, and just south of L?pez's hometown: It arrives unmarred, immaculate, and fresh, ready to be coddled by the chefs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the sushi bar and tables in the main room, the ? la carte menu offers classic izakaya-style starters like gyoza, Japanese fried chicken, and tempura. The difference is in the ingredients and execution: The Pacific shrimp encased in the tempura remain ebullient with brightness through the frying; and the fresh baby corn--a far cry from the canned version seen in the U.S.--alludes to Mexico's most sacred ingredient. \u003cem\u003eDonburi,\u003c/em\u003e or rice bowls, are the most affordable options, starting at about $17 for a tempura bowl, with a \u003cem\u003echirashi\u003c/em\u003e (assorted fish over rice) coming in at about $30.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"inline-image-default-width aligncenter\"  \u003e\u003ca href=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/794bd982-0260-4264-89db-277fbe049a46-e1561586374137.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg data-attachment-id=\"2659039\" data-permalink=\"http://fortune.com/2019/06/29/mexico-city-cabo-restaurants-japanese/processed-with-vsco-with-a6-preset-7/\" data-orig-file=\"https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/794bd982-0260-4264-89db-277fbe049a46-e1561586374137.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"2425,3000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{\u0026quot;aperture\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;1.8\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;credit\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;camera\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;iPhone XR\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;Processed with VSCO with a6 preset\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;created_timestamp\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;1560001177\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;copyright\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;Copyright 2019.

Rolls start at $3, \u003cem\u003enigiri\u003c/em\u003e at $5. But the true treat comes from indulging in the luxury of the full omakase menu, available only in the six-seat back room. Running from $120 to $150 per person, depending on what the chef's whims are that night and which fish is fresh, it sticks close to the classic \u003cem\u003eedo\u003c/em\u003e-style of sushi, offering a parade of unique, pristine pieces of \u003cem\u003enigiri,\u003c/em\u003e subtly nudged with flavor and handed directly over the counter by the chef.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind the sushi bar, the chef uses circular motions to grate sushi's own sacred ingredient: wasabi. The traditional sharkskin grater makes quick work of the Japanese root--the result milder, sweeter, and more complex than the paste seen at lesser shops; there's no burning or nostril-clearing feeling. Served alongside sea bass with \u003cem\u003eyuzu kosho \u003c/em\u003e(a mix of Japanese citrus and peppers) or accompanying a bit of \u003cem\u003eakami\u003c/em\u003e brushed with a soy-sauce-ginger-garlic mix, it provides a tiny boost of heat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fish served are mostly familiar to sushi fanatics, with a few exceptions, most notably totoaba. After it was nearly fished into extinction in the late 20th century (prized in Mexico for the flavor of its meat and in China for its swim bladder), the large drum fish endemic to the region has since been successfully farmed. Served with a touch of white soy sauce and salt, it is vaguely reminiscent of the sea bass served just before it, but is more tender, subtle, and complex--a treat for seasoned sushi eaters looking for a new taste.

Now, before anyone goes over-thinking this, it doesn\u0026#8217;t necessarily mean our Game of the Week pick is the highest scoring game in a review, the game with the best graphics, or really any other quantifiable \u0026#8220;best\" thing. Instead, it\u0026#8217;s more just us picking out the single game out of the week\u0026#8217;s releases that we think is the most noteworthy, surprising, interesting, or really any other hard to describe quality that makes it worth having if you were just going to pick up \u003cem\u003eone\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese picks might be controversial, and that\u0026#8217;s OK.

And not just because a bunch of indie powerhouses were involved in its creation, but because \u003cem\u003eMinit\u003c/em\u003e was built around an incredibly unique concept, and it\u0026#8217;s one that I think actually translates best to the mobile platform now that a port has arrived on iOS this week. Why is that? Well, mobile gaming lends itself to filling in those tiny gaps of free time you may have throughout the day, and \u003cem\u003eMinit\u003c/em\u003e is by definition a game that you play one minute at a time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/626x0w-29.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/626x0w-29.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"462\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-254980\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/626x0w-29.jpg 1000w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/626x0w-29-300x139.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/626x0w-29-768x355.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat might sound pretty mundane as there\u0026#8217;s no shortage of mobile games that are designed to be played in one minute chunks, but they\u0026#8217;re typically arcade or high-scoring games, and \u003cem\u003eMinit\u003c/em\u003e here is a full-blown action RPG in the vein of the original \u003cem\u003eThe Legend of Zelda\u003c/em\u003e (with a dash of \u003cem\u003eMajora\u0026#8217;s Mask\u003c/em\u003e thrown in for good measure). The game starts with you picking up a cursed sword which causes you to die every 60 seconds. As those seconds tick down in the corner of the screen, you rush to explore your environment and talk to the various characters in the world completing tasks and learning more about how to lift this awful curse. Once the time is up you instantly die right where you\u0026#8217;re standing at that time, and resurrect at your most recent home base.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe reason this works is because you\u0026#8217;ll get to keep any items you come across in your minute-long adventures, and the game is very cleverly structured like a Metroidvania or perhaps like an old-school point-and-click adventure game, and each new item you find will allow you to gain entry to a new area and make just a bit more progress than the last time. It\u0026#8217;s also really surprising just how darn long a minute can feel sometimes. You can get a lot done in just sixty seconds! And sometimes you\u0026#8217;ll get what you need to do done before the time has run out, in which case there\u0026#8217;s an instant kill type of button that lets you end it all early and immediately start on your next life. I\u0026#8217;ve died literally hundreds if not thousands of times in \u003cem\u003eMinit\u003c/em\u003e, but I still get a tiny panic attack as the final seconds of each minute tick out, and I also get a twinge of guilt every time I instantly kill my little hero just because I\u0026#8217;m too impatient to wait out a few extra seconds. There\u0026#8217;s a lesson here, I think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"clear:both;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"video-responsive\"\u003e\n\t\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/svUtAAFaokM\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe actually \u003ca href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2019/06/27/minit-review/\"\u003ereviewed \u003cem\u003eMinit\u003c/em\u003e earlier this week\u003c/a\u003e, and aside from some sort of half-baked MFi controller support and some occasionally awkward moments using the virtual controls, we loved every bit of it. Even those issues feel like extreme nitpicking in the face of such a brilliant little experience. The entire game probably won\u0026#8217;t take you more than a few hours to complete, even with the many instances of trial and error and many MANY unnecessary deaths as you figure things out, but it\u0026#8217;s an experience that will stick with you for a long time.

possible, those against such things have probably been able to sell a lot more of them than CCP would have otherwise manage on their own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCCP dropped this Starter Pack update on their DLC page right after EVE North and without any fanfare and a group of angry capsuleers went and did the marketing for them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the arguments for the Starter Pack has been that a million skill points isn\u0026#8217;t all that much in the grand scheme of things.  For any but the youngest character a million skill points isn\u0026#8217;t going to change the world, and for a crusty old vet like me, with over 200 million skill points on my main, the Starter Pack barely moves the needle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that is the wrong way to look at this.  That ignores what will be the motivation for many, which is value.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blurb on the Starter Pack says \u0026#8220;Worth $10,\u0026#8221; but that is wrong\u0026#8230; very wrong for some people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA million skill points is two large skill injectors worth.  A large skill injector was selling for around 1 billion ISK when I last checked.  (EVE Market Data \u003ca href=\"https://eve-marketdata.com/price_check.php?type_name_header=Large+Skill+Injector\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003econfirms that\u003c/a\u003e for the moment.)  With PLEX past the $4 million mark each, you need to buy about 500 PLEX in cash to end up with enough ISK to buy two fill skill injectors.  So a million skill points is roughly worth 2 billion ISK, which even at the current end-of-quarter sale prices, comes out to more than double that \u0026#8220;Worth $10\u0026#8221; statement, if you buy the 1,100 PLEX pack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that assumes that you have a character who can get the full benefit of a skill injector, which have diminishing returns the more skill points you have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u0026lt; 5 million total skill points = 500,000 skill points per injector\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e5 million – 50 million total skill points = 400,000 skill points per injector\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e50 million – 80 million total skill points = 300,000 skill points per injector\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u0026gt; 80 million skill points = 150,000 skill points per injector\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo for a vet like me, a large skill injector is worth just 150,000 skill points.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv

actually worth almost SEVEN large skill injectors to somebody over 80 million skill points, or 7 billion ISK or 3,500 PLEX or somewhere past $100 even at the current PLEX sale prices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBasically, a lot of people read this deal and see \u0026#8220;Seven Large Skill Injectors for $5!\u0026#8221;  Why wouldn\u0026#8217;t you throw a bit of change at that, even if you can only buy it once?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, with their promise to \u003ca href=\"https://www.eveonline.com/article/ptrtk0/skillpoints-cash-and-new-players-an-update\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003echange the Start Pack\u003c/a\u003e, presumably in the near future, CCP has put a time pressure on getting the deal, so people think they have to buy it now or miss out!  I mean, CCP could have yanked it from the buying options immediately.  They have that power.  Instead, they let it linger.  It is still there as I write this.  I doubt it will be gone before Monday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHilmar was on Twitter discounting the idea that this Start Pack was going to sell enough units to have any real impact on the financial numbers, but I suspect that whatever modest goals they had for it have been exceeded in less than a week, all thanks for player rage.  Talk about having your cake and eating it.  They get the money, the attention, and the good will for walking back their change, but only after it has had time to sell even more units.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell played CCP, well

possible, those against such things have probably been able to sell a lot more of them than CCP would have otherwise manage on their own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCCP dropped this Starter Pack update on their DLC page right after EVE North and without any fanfare and a group of angry capsuleers went and did the marketing for them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the arguments for the Starter Pack has been that a million skill points isn\u0026#8217;t all that much in the grand scheme of things.  For any but the youngest character a million skill points isn\u0026#8217;t going to change the world, and for a crusty old vet like me, with over 200 million skill points on my main, the Starter Pack barely moves the needle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that is the wrong way to look at this.  That ignores what will be the motivation for many, which is value.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blurb on the Starter Pack says \u0026#8220;Worth $10,\u0026#8221; but that is wrong\u0026#8230; very wrong for some people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA million skill points is two large skill injectors worth.  A large skill injector was selling for around 1 billion ISK when I last checked.  (EVE Market Data \u003ca href=\"https://eve-marketdata.com/price_check.php?type_name_header=Large+Skill+Injector\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003econfirms that\u003c/a\u003e for the moment.)  With PLEX past the $4 million mark each, you need to buy about 500 PLEX in cash to end up with enough ISK to buy two fill skill injectors.  So a million skill points is roughly worth 2 billion ISK, which even at the current end-of-quarter sale prices, comes out to more than double that \u0026#8220;Worth $10\u0026#8221; statement, if you buy the 1,100 PLEX pack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that assumes that you have a character who can get the full benefit of a skill injector, which have diminishing returns the more skill points you have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u0026lt; 5 million total skill points = 500,000 skill points per injector\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e5 million – 50 million total skill points = 400,000 skill points per injector\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e50 million – 80 million total skill points = 300,000 skill points per injector\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u0026gt; 80 million skill points = 150,000 skill points per injector\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo for a vet like me, a large skill injector is worth just 150,000 skill points.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv

Moderators Don’t Know Anything About National Security","content":"\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eViewers of the Democratic presidential debates learned quite a bit this week—from Joe Biden’s views of school busing to Marianne Williamson’s plan to defeat President Donald Trump with love. But I’d bet the next president will be consumed by an issue not a single person mentioned: cyber threats.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eSure, the moderators asked a few candidates what they thought the biggest foreign-policy threat was. There was a question about Iran, lots of talk about climate change, and some China-bashing. But in four hours, with enough presidential candidates to play two basketball games and so many moderators they had to take turns sitting in chairs, the foreign policy parts of the debate seemed truncated at best.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWorse still was the mismatch between the challenges the next president will actually face and the foreign policy topics the candidates were asked to discuss. Unfortunately, this is the norm for presidential debates, not the exception.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIt doesn’t take a wonk with a Ph.D. to know which foreign policy challenges should worry us most. It just takes a reader. Every year, the U.S. intelligence community issues a public threat assessment of the top dangers confronting the nation. Intelligence officials talk about their analyses in open congressional hearings, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence publishes an unclassified version of the assessment. You can get it on the Internet. This year, cyber \u003ca href=\"https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/2019-ATA-SFR---SSCI.pdf\"\u003etopped the threat list\u003c/a\u003e. It’s literally the first word, in all caps, under the first heading, which reads “Global Threats.” Intelligence agencies are often criticized for wishy-washy language, as in: We assess with moderate confidence that Country X may have weapon Z but cannot rule out the possibility that it doesn’t. But their warnings about cyberthreats couldn’t possibly be clearer.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eTypically, the moderators of presidential debates are prominent TV journalists. But a review of past debates finds that—perhaps not surprisingly—intelligence officials are much, much better at identifying the foreign policy issues that end up giving presidents long days and sleepless nights than debate moderators are.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIn the 2000 presidential debates between Al Gore and George W. Bush, the big missing issue was terrorism. Not a single question asked about it even though terrorism was a huge concern for U.S. intelligence officials, and they had explicitly said so. The CIA warned in both its 1999 and 2000 unclassified threat assessments that terrorism \u003ca href=\"https://www.cia.gov/news-information/speeches-testimony/2000/dci_speech_032100.html\"\u003eranked second\u003c/a\u003e on the list of threats to U.S. national security, just behind the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. In March of 2000, six months before the first Bush-Gore debate, CIA Director George Tenet came before Congress and publicly warned that “there is not the slightest doubt” that Osama bin Laden and his allies were planning attacks, including against American targets. The FBI declared counterterrorism its number one priority in its 1998 strategic plan, three years before 9/11. But moderator Jim Lehrer did not ask about the terrorist threat. And so the candidates never had to explain what they might do about it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe 2004 foreign policy debates between John Kerry and George W. Bush focused, understandably, on terrorism, homeland security, and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. But the candidates also spent time responding to questions about Canadian drug imports and the draft. What was left out? A small country called China, despite its breakneck economic growth, military modernization, and increasing aggression in the Asia-Pacific region. Once again, the CIA was on to the threat, flagging China’s rise in its 2004 \u003ca href=\"https://www.cia.gov/news-information/speeches-testimony/2004/tenet_testimony_03092004.html\"\u003eannual threat assessment\u003c/a\u003e several months before the debates began. How to handle China’s rise became a major focus of President Bush’s second term and now seems to be one of the few foreign policy areas in which Democrats and Republicans actually agree.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIn 2008, 2012, 2016, and again in the Democratic primary debates this week, the big miss has been cybersecurity. Intelligence officials have been sounding the alarm for years, but debate moderators still don’t seem to hear it. The 2008 intelligence \u003ca href=\"http://intelligence.senate.gov/080205/mcconnell.pdf\"\u003ethreat assessment\u003c/a\u003e noted that the threat from cyberattackers — which included states like Russia and China, non-state organizations like criminal syndicates and terrorist groups, and lone Cheeto-eating hackers — was large, serious, and growing fast. Yet in the three 2008 debates, John McCain and Barack Obama were never asked what they would do to protect America’s military from cyberespionage or sabotage; how they would defend America’s critical infrastructure like dams, financial systems, and power grids from cyberattack; or how they would work with the private sector to stop billions of dollars of intellectual property theft that threatened to erode America’s competitive advantage in the global economy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIn 2012, cybersecurity made a cameo appearance, but only because Barack Obama mentioned it in passing. Moderator Bob Schieffer never asked a question about the issue even though cyberthreats that year vaulted to number three on \u003ca href=\"http://www.openbriefing.org/regionaldesks/americas/usicstatement2012/\"\u003eintelligence threat assessment\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eLester Holt asked one question about cyber threats in 2016. But the three debates between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump spent more time on the crisis in Aleppo and “extreme vetting” of Syrian refugees than how to defend the nation from nefarious cyber activities waged by foreign powers and non-state actors. Meanwhile, those debates featured no questions about North Korea, even though the \u003ca href=\"https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/SASC_Unclassified_2016_ATA_SFR_FINAL.pdf\"\u003e2016 intelligence threat assessment\u003c/a\u003e prominently features a section on “Weapons of Mass Destruction and Proliferation” that leads with the Hermit Kingdom. The assessment noted: “North Korea’s nuclear weapons and missile programs will continue to pose a serious threat to U.S. interests and to the security environment in East Asia in 2016.” The only mention of North Korea in the debates was an offhand comment from Trump: “China should solve that problem for us. China should go into North Korea. China is totally powerful as it relates to North Korea.” When candidate Trump became President Trump, the danger that North Korea’s nuclear weapons program posed to American allies and the U.S. homeland quickly consumed his attention and has become one of the most important and enduring issues of his tenure so far.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWhy are presidential debate moderators so bad at picking the foreign policy issues presidents will actually confront? Because journalists are trained to think about the present, not the future. Presidential campaigns, in which horse-race coverage dominates, only exacerbate that tendency. In the campaign world, the far future is day one of the next administration. Candidates love to declare exactly what they intend to do as the moving vans pull up to the White House. And debate moderators love to ask them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eForeign policy often operates on much longer timelines. Containing the Soviet Union took decades. So did democratization in countries from Latin America to Asia.  Even a “sudden” crisis is usually years in the making—whether it’s Brexit, the civil war in Syria, or North Korea’s nuclear program. In foreign policy, dangers gather and threats evolve. Today’s ally could be tomorrow’s adversary. That’s why intelligence threat assessments are designed to gaze over the horizon, assessing how current threats are likely to play out over time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eFor better or worse, presidential debates are the voting public’s best opportunity to hear how a candidate thinks about the threats facing the country.

They deserve a better-informed discussion.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eModerators can do better.

There was no heated tussle over jobs plans. No argument over how to set the national debt on a better path, and no proposals to balance the budget or change the country’s entitlement structure. There was less discussion of getting work to America’s forgotten communities than in the last election cycle.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe debate on The Economy has become a debate on the economy: not so much about taxes and jobs and growth and debt, but about corporate power, student loans, the wage structure, industrial policy, the cost of living, the relative tax burden, and so on.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eConsider when Senator Kamala Harris of California took on President Donald Trump’s handling of the country’s growth. “This president walks around talking about and flouting his great economy, right? \u003cem\u003eMy great economy\u003c/em\u003e,” she said. “You ask him how are you measuring the greatness of this economy of yours and they point to the jobless numbers and the unemployment numbers. Well, yeah, people in America are working. They’re working two and three jobs.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHarris’ desire to drill down, to go to the yes-buts and the sure-but-stills, was not surprising: The economy is as good as it has been since the late 1990s, and is arguably better than it was back then. The unemployment rate has not been this low since \u003ca href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE\"\u003ethe late 1960s\u003c/a\u003e. Wage inequality continues to be a defining quality of the American economy, but even so median wages \u003ca href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LES1252881600Q\"\u003eare rising\u003c/a\u003e, and the bottom half of the income distribution is \u003ca href=\"https://www.epi.org/blog/average-wage-growth-continues-to-flatline-in-2018-while-low-wage-workers-and-those-with-relatively-lower-levels-of-educational-attainment-see-stronger-gains/\"\u003edoing better\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat candidate could criticize the White House for overseeing those kinds of numbers?

That is the lowest level in at least two decades.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat has left space for other concerns, with the national attention fracturing and diversifying as the unemployment rate has drifted down. According \u003ca href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/1675/most-important-problem.aspx\"\u003eto Gallup\u003c/a\u003e, Americans are now ten times more likely to cite immigration as the most important problem than they are to cite the gap between the rich and the poor. They are six times as likely to cite race and racism as they are to cite wage issues. They are six times more likely to say that bad leadership is the central problem, versus jobs and unemployment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe good economy  has also allowed for a tremendous amount of progressive policy-making and idea generation on the left: There’s oxygen in the room for big, wild proposals on prisoner re-entry and student loans and child poverty and universal basic incomes, not just on healthcare and taxes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe national debt has quite simply vanished as a topic—\u003cem\u003evanished\u003c/em\u003e! On the first night of the debates, it came up only in passing, when Senator Amy Klobuchar mentioned an immigration bill that would draw it down. On the second night, it came up only in passing again, whereas the student loan crisis came up a dozen times.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut as soon as Democrats come back into power, expect a lot of dialogue about how today’s citizens are bankrupting their grandchildren. And, of course, expect a lot of campaigning on how to fix the economy if it softens even a little bit, let alone if it softens a lot.

It looks like another storefront, opening onto a sidewalk with overhead construction scaffolding, like so many buildings in New York City these days.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI have visited many, many public libraries around the U.S., but I had never visited a braille library. So when Jim, my husband, and I happened to be in New York City in early June, I grabbed the chance and took Jim with me. We saw sighted and blind people entering—moms pushing strollers, younger people who looked like students, older people coming to bide their time. And we learned about \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2019/05/when-libraries-are-second-responders/590098/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eyet another way\u003c/a\u003e in which modern libraries are serving their communities.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen you take the elevator to the second floor, you quickly see that this library has something very special. For starters, the library holds what is among the largest physical, browsable collections of braille books in the country, about 14,000 titles. Front and center, as is the case at most every other library I’ve visited, there is a children’s section. Braille books for children look just like the counterparts for sighted children, except the text is reproduced in braille, and sometimes the books include tactile features, like the furry fluff we all know from Pat the Bunny.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"left\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" height=\"351\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/06/IMG_20190611_170308/88557acfb.jpg\" width=\"248\"\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"caption\"\u003eCourtesy of Deborah Fallows\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are other ways to access books besides browsing and borrowing from the shelves at Heiskell. Through its membership in the National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped (\u003ca href=\"https://www.loc.gov/nls/\"\u003eNLS\u003c/a\u003e), this library and its eligible users have access to additional physical braille books, downloadable digital braille books, books to listen to, plus subscriptions to many, many magazines from \u003cem\u003eThe Atlantic\u003c/em\u003e to \u003cem\u003ePlayboy\u003c/em\u003e. The NLS was established by an act of Congress in 1931, and operates under the Library of Congress.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs for physical braille books, the Heiskell currently mails them, with free returns via a mailing card that reads “free matter for the blind,” to over 10,000 patrons who live in the five boroughs of New York City plus Long Island. For its most voracious readers who would like a constant supply of books at the ready, there’s an easy answer. Readers can identify personal preferences—like thrillers, or books set in Italy, or historical fiction, and the library will send out huge stacks, as many as 40 books, whenever they are available.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd then there are books for listening. \u003ca href=\"https://www.loc.gov/nls/\"\u003eTalking Books\u003c/a\u003e is a program of the NLS, which records and distributes their collection of about 200,000 recorded books—also for free—to people with certified visual impairment. This includes not only blind people, but those visually impaired who find it hard to read; people with other disabilities, like Parkinson’s or MS, who have difficulty holding and manipulating books; or those with reading disorders like dyslexia.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eListeners can download the talking books through an app onto mobile devices or computers, or use a memory card that plugs into a special talking book player, which the Heiskell library also lends. The listening technology has come a long way in the last 90 years—starting with the 33 1/3 RPM records of the 1930s, followed by cassette tapes, then flash memory devices, and then apps to download content.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAltogether, the Heiskell circulates about 500,000 titles as braille books, Talking Books, and digital downloads annually.\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr class=\"c-section-divider\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Heiskell, along with the NYPL system, is pushing beyond today’s opportunities—and limits—to develop new assistive technology and programming for the blind. \u003ca href=\"https://www.libraryjournal.com/?detailStory=chancey-fleet-movers-shakers-2017-advocates\"\u003eChancey Fleet\u003c/a\u003e, who is blind, coordinates the assistive technology program at the library. She talked to us with a combination of passion and reflection about her self-described role as catalyst, and as connector and amplifier. “I could go through life accepting the limits that inaccessible technologies create, but I’d rather go through life trying to help create solutions,” she told us when we visited with her; Jill Rothstein, the chief librarian of the Heiskell; and Bobby Sherwood, who works for the NYPL.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eChancey said she is using the privileges of her past (meaning mentors, training, and support in college and work) and the advantages of her current position (meaning accessibility to those with skills, expertise, creativity, and authority to make things happen) to help create and put new and useful technology into the hands of as many people as possible. And the goal of it all?  What she said struck me as both the soaring and grounded purpose of the human experience: to offer people opportunity to express themselves and to explore the world.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eChancey demonstrated some of the technology for us. To convert text from a computer monitor to braille, she uses a small digital display unit, which has tiny pins that pop up and down to create the braille characters on the one-line, refreshable display. The unit can either read from a memory card, downloading books for example, or it can connect directly to a computer, smart phone, or tablet to enable real-time actions, like using email. She creates  braille on the unit’s keyboard. The library has just announced a pilot program to loan similar \u003ca href=\"http://www.nbp.org/ic/nbp/BRAILLE-ME.html\"\u003e“Braille Me”\u003c/a\u003e units to its patrons. Chancey also listens to talking books, often speeding up the delivery to 500 or 600 words per minute, compared with the normal talking speed on podcasts of about 150 or 160 words per minute.\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr class=\"c-section-divider\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs for programming, the ambitions of Chancey and her collaborators started small with their community of visually-impaired people, offering workshops to familiarize them with screen-reading tools and various apps. Then they went bigger by helping them to more easily access the visually-oriented world of coding. Then even bigger toward using tools to make spatial and tactile learning more accessible. The Dimensions project at the Heiskell offers training to use the hardware and software to design and create tactile maps, images, graphs, diagrams, actual objects, and other spatial information. Everything is free and it is available to both visually-impaired and sighted people.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese technologies bring a perspective and experience to the blind that may be difficult for sighted people to appreciate. An embosser can print out a map of the five boroughs of the New York area, for example, where many Heiskell patrons live, showing in raised form the shapes of the boroughs and their relation to each other and the waterways around them. A 3D printer can replicate an object, maybe a dinosaur, that is scaled-down to a size that makes sense when you can newly feel the entire object at once.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn the lower-tech end, there are many additional programs and experiences provided by the library: origami therapy, a knitting club, tech coaching for Spanish speakers, video games, beep ball (baseball with a beeping ball), ice climbing, boulder climbing, art classes, movie discussion groups with narrated descriptions, and workshops for high schoolers for prep for college tests and college class work. When their annual fair on community, culture, and technology outgrew the space at the Heiskell, they moved uptown to the bigger, grander main flagship library.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile much of what I learned about the Heiskell library is extraordinary, other aspects are exactly the same as at every other library. Everywhere, library users approach librarians with their important or sensitive questions. They trust librarians and the information they will impart. Those questions can tell a lot about a community. In Bend, Oregon, a few years ago, librarians told me that the most frequent questions from users were about how to meet house payments or  their rent. In Charleston, West Virginia, people would frequently consider librarians as proxies for doctors, asking for example about suspicious moles. At the Heiskell library, different and sometimes poignant questions are posed: “Where can I buy a white cane?” and “How can I learn to type again?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align: right;\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/ourtowns?utm_source=feed\"\u003eMore from this series\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/7_PP-5AIZRc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/7_PP-5AIZRc/","published":"2019-06-29T10:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:374-592969"},{"title":"The Right Way to Complain","content":"\u003cp\u003eThe words \u003cem\u003event\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003ecomplain\u003c/em\u003e are often used interchangeably, but really, they refer to two different forms of expression, each with its own aims. Venting is about seeking validation and sympathy, whereas complaining comes with a concrete end goal—in many cases, getting someone else to do something differently.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGenerally speaking, the psychologist Guy Winch says, people do a lot of venting, but “we are afraid to voice complaints, and for good reason: It often doesn’t go well.” Because of how people typically present complaints, Winch says, they put their loved ones, friends, and co-workers on the defensive—and as a result they often don’t get what they want. Winch has a better way—one that he laid out in his book, \u003ca href=\"https://www.guywinch.com/the-squeaky-wheel-book\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Squeaky Wheel\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, and to a crowd earlier this week at the Aspen Ideas Festival, which is co-hosted by the Aspen Institute and \u003cem\u003eThe Atlantic\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWinch recommends a formula called “the complaint sandwich”—a series of three statements calibrated to make people more receptive to changing their ways. The first “slice of bread” in the sandwich is a positive statement that will hopefully make the listener less defensive when the complaint itself arrives. For instance, in the case of a significant other who leaves dirty dishes in the sink, the complaint might start with something like, “You know, you are such a considerate partner in so many ways, and I love living with you.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/03/no-wifi-uuuugggh-the-important-art-of-complaining/359681/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead more: The art of complaining\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“The meat of the sandwich is the complaint itself,” Winch said. “And here’s the trick: The meat has to be lean. In other words, all you need is the one incident to make your point.” Don’t present a compendium of every offense; just stick to the specifics of the present situation. In the case of the dish-leaver, that might sound like this: “I saw that your cereal bowl is in the sink from this morning.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJust as it’s important not to include a list of frustrating incidents at this stage, it’s also important not to include a generalization about someone’s basic nature. The complaint \u003cem\u003eYou didn’t clean up after yourself\u003c/em\u003e veers unproductively into criticism when the clause \u003cem\u003ebecause you’re so lazy\u003c/em\u003e is tacked onto the end of it. So focus strictly on what happened, Winch advised.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe final component of the sandwich is another positive statement, this time one that might motivate the other party to do things differently. This inducement could be something like, “If you could make an effort to put your dirty dishes into the dishwasher, it would make me so happy.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese statements might be set up differently if complaining to a stranger rather than a loved one (a stranger might be less interested in making you happy), but the format remains the same. And in all cases, Winch says, it’s important not to yell or be sarcastic. “However angry or frustrated you are, if your tone is too sharp, you’re distracting from the message,” he noted. Then, down the line: “The minute you see any hint of an effort, you reinforce it like crazy”—that’s the best way to encourage more of the hoped-for behavior in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese principles are not just useful in the interpersonal realm—Winch says that well-framed complaints can also bring about better results in customer-service scenarios. Applying the aforementioned tactics to corporate grievances requires a few twists.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirst, specificity is especially important when dealing with companies. Winch says that many customer-service representatives use systems that have them choose from preset categories of complaints, so it can be harder to get a favorable result if you mention a bunch of different issues. For instance, if you’re trying to get a rental-car company to reverse an unexpected charge, don’t also go on about how uncomfortable the car’s seats were—it muddles the real reason you’re calling (and makes you sound as if you aren’t discriminating in what you choose to complain about).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSecond, expressing empathy for a customer-service representative can help a lot. “They are usually a low-salary employee and their job is horrific. They really get cursed at all the time, every day,” Winch said. He added that when he calls a customer-service line, he often opens with something like, “I’m going to apologize ahead of time for sounding annoyed. I’m annoyed with this situation, not with you personally—so please forgive me if I sound frustrated.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThird, unlike in the dirty-dishes scenario, the first person you reach at a company might not be able to do what you’re asking of them. If it becomes clear that they don’t have the authority to remedy the situation, you can ask to speak to a supervisor. But if the supervisor isn’t helpful either, Winch said, “I wouldn’t go slowly up the chain.” A strategy that he’s used “innumerable times” with great success is going straight to an executive—many email addresses are Google-able—with his complaint sandwich.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSometimes, though, complaints—whether directed to people or companies—don’t get results. “There are some very difficult people that there are no right ways to address them,” Winch noted. There might well be situations where continuing to complain just isn’t worth it.

President Donald Trump and his most ardent supporters may in time come to feel this way about the agreement the administration reached with the Mexican government earlier this month.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe June 7 deal may seem to amount to a big victory for Trump, the result of a \u003cem\u003eTweetzkrieg\u003c/em\u003e threatening to impose tariffs on Mexican imports unless Mexico agreed to accomplish within 45 days what the U.S. has failed to do for years: “to sufficiently achieve results in addressing the flow of immigrants from Central America to the southern border.” Perhaps even Trump was surprised by Mexico’s readiness to give in to his demands, and mobilize forces to slam the door shut on Central Americans seeking to make their way up to the United States. He still hasn’t gotten Mexico to pay for a border wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, but Trump can plausibly say that he is forcing Mexico itself to become the wall. Moreover, as the analyst Carlos Bravo Regidor \u003ca href=\"https://noticieros.televisa.com/videos/hora-opinar-leo-zuckermann-programa-11-junio-2019/\"\u003enoted on an influential Mexican cable-news show\u003c/a\u003e, the Mexican government’s submission to Trump’s tantrum sets Mexico up to be the U.S. president’s piñata during his long reelection campaign.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut both sides could be missing the real significance of the accord: Trump has in effect ended the traditional cordoning off of immigration issues from the U.S.-Mexico economic relationship. He has, perhaps unwittingly, opened the door to recognition that the North American trading bloc is as much about people as it is about goods and services.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"dropcap\"\u003eAs ratified during the Clinton administration, the original NAFTA created a trilateral trade bloc removing most tariffs and obstacles to commerce within North America, and set rules concerning the rights of foreign investors in each country. Issues of intellectual property, the environment, and labor standards within each country were touched upon in the original treaty and expanded upon in last year’s renegotiation—the so-called USMCA—currently under consideration by the Congress. But other than some minor provisions for high-end professional and investor visas, both agreements were silent on the question of immigration. Protectionist and nativist skeptics of NAFTA feared the I-word (\u003cem\u003eintegration\u003c/em\u003e, across borders) and zealously guarded against it; business interests figured that, because they already had no problem attracting workers to cross the border unlawfully for work, they had best not to go there.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNAFTA didn’t necessarily have to create unfettered freedom of labor movement, as the European Union did, but it should and could have done two things, reflecting the close, symbiotic nature of the relationship between the three societies and economies.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirst, the United States should have adjusted upward the number of visas made available to Mexicans. Because it did not, Mexicans who came to the U.S. in pursuit of work had little choice but to live in the shadows. And remember, Mexicans weren’t crossing the borders in such large numbers during the 1990s in pursuit of public welfare or colder weather. They were lured over (many recruited at home) with jobs by employers all too happy to rely on undocumented labor, \u003ca href=\"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/undocumented-deportation-agriculture-dairy-meat-iowa-wisconsin.html\"\u003eentire industries that would collapse\u003c/a\u003e if the U.S. deported them all overnight.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSecond, the three North American partners should have jointly created policies for addressing immigration from the rest of the world. The number of Mexicans crossing the border without authorization \u003ca href=\"https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/mexican-immigrants-united-states\"\u003epeaked more than a decade ago\u003c/a\u003e, and the overall number of unauthorized Mexicans has been decreasing during the period Trump has been ratcheting up his rhetoric about all those “bad hombres.” But the surge in Central Americans seeking asylum in North America does pose a shared, regional challenge that points to the need for an EU-like coordinated approach. Migration has stressed Europe’s union as well, of course, but the concept underlying the Continent’s \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/17/world/europe/europe-refugees-migrants-rules.html\"\u003eSchengen\u003c/a\u003e (establishing the notion of one border between signatory states) and \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/17/world/europe/europe-refugees-migrants-rules.html\"\u003eDublin\u003c/a\u003e Agreements (stipulating that asylum seekers must request asylum in the first EU member state they arrive in) makes a great deal of sense.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNorth America today is criminally unprepared to handle the hundreds of thousands of Central Americans fleeing their countries. Both Mexicans and Americans have been shocked in recent months by the recurring stories of families separated at the border, the conditions immigrant kids face in detention centers (with U.S. officials quibbling over whether they deserve soap and toothpaste), and the scenes of large caravans of Central Americans making their way north to seek asylum in the United States. This week shock turned to utter horror as newspapers featured heart-wrenching front-page photos of an El Salvadoran father and his 2-year-old daughter who drowned in the Rio Grande, and an equally poignant shot of a Haitian immigrant and her small child begging for help in Tapachula, Chiapas.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis awful state of affairs could have been avoided, or at least minimized, if North America had earlier adopted a coherent regional approach to migration. A North American variant of the European approach—humor me for a minute by pretending we had visionary, internationalist leaders in Ottawa, Washington, and Mexico City—would entail having an agreed-upon apportionment of outside asylum seekers among the three partners; a blended corps of Mexican, U.S., and Canadian customs officials along Mexico’s southern border and at other sensitive North American ports of entry; a realistic adjustment of the levels of legal migration within North America; and finally, a comprehensive development package for Central America. Regardless of your views on what the appropriate level of migration is for the United States, or how expansively you want to think of asylum, there is no argument for forcing people to run an unsafe gantlet across Mexico in search of a right they might not be afforded.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDespite the widespread outrage, we will have to await another administration for a more coherent approach to these regional migration challenges. But in his own bullying manner, pursuing an ostensibly radically different outcome, it is Trump who may have taken the first step in irrevocably linking U.S. and Mexican immigration policies, as they pertain to the rest of the world.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe “supplementary agreement” to the June 7 deal established that Mexico will consider a “safe third country” arrangement if the situation doesn’t improve during this 45-day probationary period. Long resisted by Mexican governments, such an arrangement would require those seeking asylum to request it in the first “safe” country they cross. Mexico, that is, would become the destination, not a transit corridor, for all Guatemalans fleeing across their border.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut the supplementary deal also uses language even an ardent cross-border integrationist in Brussels would recognize. It contains a call to negotiate a binding agreement that would address “burden sharing” and “assignment of responsibility for processing refugee status claims of migrants,” and a call for “a regional approach” to dealing with third-nation immigrants. A seed, perhaps, for more fruitful days ahead, if one inadvertently planted.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/Ks_sa2QnoxM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/Ks_sa2QnoxM/","published":"2019-06-29T10:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-592828"},{"title":"Thom Yorke’s Beautiful New Nightmare","content":"\u003cp\u003eThom Yorke’s new album is inspired by Carl Jung’s theories of the unconsciousness and by the way the brain processes the world in sleep, which is to say, simply, it’s about dreaming.

It swings from brash and terrifying to delicate and gutting without ever becoming boring (this can’t be taken for granted\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eafter the insularity of Radiohead’s previous two albums).

Server-farm hum and Morse-code crackle set a dreary, minimalist scene, but then the machinery starts to party. The dry, reverberating drums of \u003ca href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/may/16/the-best-uk-garage-tracks-ranked\"\u003eU.K. garage\u003c/a\u003e smash in; a \u003cem\u003ewub-wub-wub\u003c/em\u003e noise scans like a prison-yard floodlight; there’s a sense of reckless acceleration and accumulating chaos. It’s a glorious start to a DJ set, and the song has barely arrived. When Yorke finally sings, it’s a fraidy-cat whimper about being trapped. Then he squeals, “But you’re free!” The arrangement shudders, as if disturbed by his outburst. Paralysis versus escape, individual versus landscape—we’ve all had this dream, and now we may dance to it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA lead singer in a popular band might be assumed to have, first, a melodic knack, but Yorke’s solo work has proved his worth as a sound sculptor, mastering texture and layers. “Last I Heard (… He Was Circling the Drain)” evokes some purple-green luminescent swamp, with keyboard chords blooming and dying and blooming again at a lazy pace. As he repeats one queasy phrase—“I woke up with a feeling that I just could not take”—the music pans across the ears, and the sensation really is like that of circling a drain. He switches to spoken word later in the song, at which point he might as well be breathing against your neck. “Humans the size of rats,” he says. Sleep well!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThose two opening songs delineate the offerings of the album: clamorous, unrelenting dance contraptions, and deeply affecting ASMR games. It’s best when both styles occur in the same song. “Twist” stutters at a shaking-Quaker pace as Yorke praises some loved one, and it’s actually sweet, if ephemeral-feeling. But then the song thickens up in its fourth minute with bleary, magisterial piano, and Yorke switches his vocal approach. The result is heavy, gorgeous psychedelia, and it could be described that way even if the refrain Yorke yowled didn’t turn out to be this: “It’s like wee—eee—eee—eeeeed!”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe hallowed end to that song feeds into “Dawn Chorus,” a stunner of spoken word and aching keyboard. The lyrics sent me back to the narrative shaping 2016’s utterly \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/05/radiohead-moon-shaped-pool-review-sculpture-strange-leap/482076/?utm_source=feed\"\u003edisconsolate\u003c/a\u003e \u003ci\u003eA Moon Shaped Pool\u003c/i\u003e: the end of Yorke’s marriage followed by the death of the woman he’d been married to, Rachel Owen. Yorke’s poetry in “Dawn Chorus” heaves with regret, the hope for time travel, the futility of life, and the possibility of grace. “If you could do it all again / yeah without a second thought,” he says. Yet also: “If you could do it all again / big deal so what.” Even if speculating about Yorke’s own personal meanings is inevitable, the true intention of the words is incidental. A song this heartrending will be repurposed by each listener. (“Dawn Chorus” provides the sorta-happy ending to Paul Thomas Anderson’s 15-minute Netflix music video for the album, a hypnotic spectacle of modern dance in which phalanxes of sleepy folks on a commuter train nod and lurch in synchronization.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe four songs discussed above make up the front half of the album, and the back portion doesn’t, so far in my listenings, match the opening sensory rush. But the the video-game bustle of “Not the News” does stand out for a string section that purrs like God’s own chainsaw. And on the last song, “Runwayaway,” Yorke’s dreamy approach gets its most aptly baffling treatment. A fan of Radiohead’s might hear the band’s weirdest work echoed: desolate “Hunting Bears” guitars, helium “Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors” vocal effects, the “Kid A” shuffle beat. Others will hear Led Zeppelin blurring into a possessed child’s lullaby that’s been given a club remix, stretching past six minutes, without the semblance of a verse-chorus structure. “This is when you know / Who your real friends are,” goes Yorke’s mantra, a prophecy for dreamtime, and for any artist’s uncompromising exploration of the great human mysteries.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/B1KqDYS5jL0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/B1KqDYS5jL0/","published":"2019-06-29T10:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-592750"},{"title":"Reparations Are Not the Answer","content":"\u003cp\u003eJuneteenth—the annual celebration of when enslaved people in Texas learned of their freedom—brought two hearings this year on Capitol Hill.

In that hearing, the economic disadvantages facing African Americans was only part of the story—because less than one-quarter of Americans living in poverty are black.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSlavery, and the systemic racism that has disadvantaged blacks in its aftermath, cannot be forgiven or forgotten. But reparations are not the answer. We cannot fix these injustices by emulating the my-race-first policies that birthed it. While the suffering of blacks hits close to home for me, it also pains me to see someone of another race or ethnicity degraded by the way our country forces poor people to live.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen blacks demand that our poverty be alleviated, it’s simply a matter of one race prioritizing its path to living well, when we should be fighting for everyone to live well.

The struggle against poverty needs to be a collective fight.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“We are tired of the racialization of poverty, the partisanism of poverty,” William Barber II, a Protestant minister who is a co-leader of the \u003ca href=\"https://www.poorpeoplescampaign.org/\"\u003ePoor People’s Campaign\u003c/a\u003e, told the members of the Budget Committee.

But the prevailing system in the United States isn’t white supremacy, but rather, economic oligarchy. And too much of the discussion of racism adopts the language of oligarchy, offering economic ascension as an antidote.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile racial inequality is sometimes quantified in other ways—by the composition of the prison population, levels of education, or health—it is most often quantified by dollars, and how many one has. In 2018, the Equality of Opportunity Project released the results of a multiyear study of economic mobility. Most of its findings were about economic opportunity. People homed in on its \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/03/19/upshot/race-class-white-and-black-men.html?mtrref=www.google.com\"\u003estatistics about black boys\u003c/a\u003e, who had much less of a chance of rising to a different economic tier than the one into which they were born, or of staying rich, than white boys. Less was said about Native Americans, who, the study’s statistics showed, were about as poor as blacks, or about Asian Americans, who had a better chance to rise economically than whites.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eReparations are often presented in terms that are meaningful within an oligarchic system: A long history of racist practices has created economic inequality between blacks and whites. Of this, there is no doubt. But this is not \u003cem\u003ethe \u003c/em\u003eracial wealth gap; it is merely \u003cem\u003ea \u003c/em\u003eracial wealth gap. One goal of reparations is to close this gap. But that adopts the logic of oligarchy, instead of challenging it. More black people reaching higher wealth tiers, and then living in the cocoon those tiers provide? That’s not something I am willing to fight for.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDuring the hearing on poverty, numerous committee members recounted their humble origins. Representative Bill Johnson of Ohio told of going to 13 different schools in 12 years while his mother worked three jobs—picking cotton and tobacco, and doing anything she could. Jason Smith of Missouri talked about his grandparents’ home, a farm on which he worked that never acquired indoor plumbing. It was hard not to hear in these rags-to-Congress narratives an implicit critique—that, with hard work, any poor person could rise as they had done. But if escaping poverty’s degradations is linked to desire and ability, what does it mean for those who don’t possess the capacity to acquire the skills to obtain well-paid work? How should they have to live?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBarber and Liz Theoharis, the other co-leader of the Poor People’s Campaign, presented a “\u003ca href=\"https://www.poorpeoplescampaign.org/budget/\"\u003emoral budget\u003c/a\u003e” to the committee. It aimed to show that the alleviation of poverty and its degradations are not only a moral demand, but that these goals make good economic sense.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTheoharis and Barber resurrected Martin Luther King Jr.’s Poor People’s Campaign in 2018, on the 50th anniversary of the march of the multiracial movement that King was gathering to lead to Washington. He was assassinated first, and Ralph Abernathy stepped in to take his place. Without King, the Poor People’s Campaign never really took off, and eventually faded away.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBarber and Theoharis relaunched it because \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/02/a-new-poor-peoples-campaign/552503/?utm_source=feed\"\u003ethe situation King sought to address persists\u003c/a\u003e: Poor people are still systematically degraded. With the Poor People’s Campaign, King aimed less at white supremacy than at the oligarchy. The principle behind the movement remains the same as it was in 1968. People of all races who oppose this system of inequality and suffering, and the demonization of the poor, must act as a single force.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTheoharis and Barber often remind their listeners that King was moving toward a more expansive multiracial movement when he died. King was focused on the oligarchic class—or “Bourbon class,” as he called it—and its promotion of a strategic form of divide and conquer, pitting poor blacks against poor whites. Howard University’s E. Franklin Frazier had written about this strategy in his popular book, \u003cem\u003eBlack Bourgeoisie\u003c/em\u003e,\u003cem\u003e \u003c/em\u003ea decade earlier, in 1957. Other scholars before and since have pointed to the post-slavery origins of voter suppression in service of what the wealthy, white, land-owning class publicly called white supremacy. But they had a dual aim, ensuring that poor whites were not part of the supreme.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is not to argue for an equivalence of historical suffering between whites and blacks, but to emphasize that white supremacy in the U.S. is a strategy, not a system. The system is an economic oligarchy, and racism is an extremely effective tactic for perpetuating it. And the debate over reparations confuses the system with just one of the tactics that sustains it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWould we be speaking of reparations if people of all incomes could live decent, healthy lives, and if we moved away from quantifying success primarily by income? Reparations would address the financial ramifications of the racism that stymies blacks from “winning,” and knocks those blacks who have won back down. But they would not right the wrong of a supremacist society that is designed to create a class of winners and a mass of losers, and to do so, in part, by isolating aspirants from those they leave behind.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI switched away from the H.R. 40 hearings to focus on the debate over the more encompassing wrong.

Tensions rose in recent weeks after negotiations collapsed last month and the two sides levied intensifying eye-for-an-eye punishments.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent\"\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"ad_brightcove\" class=\"ad_brightcove_video-wrapper\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;We\u0026#8217;ve had an excellent relationship,\u0026#8221; Trump told Xi as the meeting opened, \u0026#8220;but we want to do something that will even it up with respect to trade.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeated across a wide table flanked by top aides, both leaders struck a cautiously optimistic tone after greeting each other and posing for photographs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;I think this can be a very productive meeting and I think we can go on to do something that will be truly monumental and great for both countries,\u0026#8221; Trump said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXi, for his part, recounted the era of \u0026#8220;ping-pong diplomacy\u0026#8221; which helped jump-start U.S.-China relations two generations ago. He said that, since then, \u0026#8220;One basic fact remains unchanged: China and the United States both benefit from cooperation and lose in confrontation.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;Cooperation and dialogue are better than friction and confrontation,\u0026#8221; he added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe meeting with Xi is one of three Trump lined up Saturday with world leaders displaying authoritarian tendencies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrump had his first face-to-face sit-down with Saudi Arabia\u0026#8217;s Mohammed Bin Salman since the U.S. intelligence community concluded that the crown prince directed the grisly murder of Washington Post columnist, and American resident, Jamal Khashoggi last year. And he will meet with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, an ostensible NATO ally whom the U.S. sees as drifting dangerously toward Russia\u0026#8217;s sphere of influence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeeting with the Saudi crown prince, Trump praised his \u0026#8220;friend\u0026#8221; for taking steps to open up the kingdom and extend freedoms to Saudi women.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrump, however, ignored reporters\u0026#8217; questions about Mohammed\u0026#8217;s alleged role in Khashoggi\u0026#8217;s death. A U.N. expert has called for an investigation into Mohammed\u0026#8217;s alleged involvement in the killing at the Saudi consulate in Turkey last year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth of those meetings come the day after Trump, with a smirk and a finger point, dryly told another authoritarian leader, Russia\u0026#8217;s Vladimir Putin, \u0026#8220;Don\u0026#8217;t meddle with the election\u0026#8221; in their first meeting since the special counsel concluded that Russia extensively interfered with the 2016 campaign.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe diplomacy plays out as Trump\u0026#8217;s re-election campaign battle is beginning to heat up, a contest that could be partially defined by whether a resolution to the trade war with China can be found before more economic pain is inflicted on Americans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe president has threatened to impose tariffs on an additional $300 billion in Chinese imports \u0026mdash; on top of the $250 billion in goods he\u0026#8217;s already taxed \u0026mdash; extending his import taxes to virtually everything China ships to the United States. He has said the new tariffs, which are paid by U.S. importers and usually passed onto consumers, might start at 10%. Earlier, the administration had said additional tariffs might reach 25%.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two countries are sparring over the Trump administration\u0026#8217;s allegations that Beijing steals technology and coerces foreign companies into handing over trade secrets. China denies it engages in such practices. The U.S. has also tried to rally other nations to block Chinese telecom firm Huawei from their upcoming 5G systems, branding the company a national security threat and barring it from buying American technology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeijing has retaliated by levying its own tariffs on goods from the United States. On Friday, it criticized what it calls \u0026#8220;negative content\u0026#8221; about China in legislation before the U.S. Congress, saying it would further damage relations already roiled by disputes over trade and technology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChinese Foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said cooperation in important areas would be disrupted if the draft National Defense Authorization Act passes. The bill blocks transfer of sensitive technology to China and prevents Chinese state companies from receiving U.S. federal funds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut if history repeats itself \u0026mdash; and most analysts are betting it will \u0026mdash; Trump and Xi will agree to some kind of cease-fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIndeed, a senior administration official sought to downplay expectations last week by suggesting that the primary goal for the Trump-Xi meeting is simply an agreement to restart negotiations. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe White House thinking, said the hard work of finalizing the complex details of any broad new accord would come later, when negotiating teams for the two sides meet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnder the cease-fire scenario, existing tariffs and counter-tariffs on many of each other\u0026#8217;s goods would remain in place. But no additional import taxes would take effect. This would buy time for U.S. and Chinese officials to restart talks that stalled last month after 11 rounds of negotiations. Trump said Friday he had not agreed to a cease-fire with Xi as a precondition for their meeting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last time Trump and Xi met \u0026mdash; in early December at a G-20 gathering in Buenos Aires, Argentina \u0026mdash; they called a truce. That arrangement injected some new momentum into talks between the world\u0026#8217;s two biggest economies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for Saudi Arabia, Trump has long sought to minimize the crown prince\u0026#8217;s role in Khashoggi\u0026#8217;s murder, and has been reluctant to criticize the killing of the royal critic. His administration views the kingdom as the lynchpin of its Middle East strategy to counter Iran. The meeting Saturday comes a week after Trump came to the brink of ordering a military strike on that Iran in retaliation for it downing an American unmanned spy-plane. Trump is also relying on the Saudi government to support his administration\u0026#8217;s elusive Israel-Palestinian peace plan, which is being developed by his son-in-law, Jared Kushner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith Erodogan, Trump will find himself trying to paper over differences over Turkey\u0026#8217;s planned purchase of the Russian-made S-400 surface-to-air missile system. U.S. officials have threatened that purchase would halt the sale of the U.S.-made F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, though Erdogan\u0026#8217;s government has called it a done deal. The pair will also be called to continue difficult discussions about Syria, as Trump\u0026#8217;s ordered withdrawal has been slowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/time/topstories/~4/9Sgi4dVQrkE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/9Sgi4dVQrkE/","published":"2019-06-29T03:32:05Z","guid":"http://time.com/?p=5617697"},{"title":"Here’s What’s New on Netflix in July 2019 (and What’s Leaving)","content":"\u003caside class=\"right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad\" id=\"right-rail__ad-5613826\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module\" data-src=\"https://time.com/5613826/new-on-netflix-july-2019/\" data-widget-id=\"SB_2\" data-ob-template=\"timemag\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat do \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://time.com/5351084/orange-is-the-new-black-season-six-review/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eOrange Is the New Black\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://time.com/5543714/antoni-porowski-pete-davidson-meme/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eQueer Eye\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://time.com/5609957/netflix-prank-encounters-stranger-things/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eStranger Things\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/em\u003eand \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://time.com/5600490/25-coffees-a-day/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eComedians in Cars Getting Coffee\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/em\u003eall have in common?

And that could be an issue for many of the black voters Biden \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/6/27/18760279/joe-biden-black-voters-polling-democratic-debates\"\u003eis counting on for support\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"IGLFCq\"\u003eIn reality, though, things are more complicated.

Many busing orders were mandated in the late 1960s and early 1970s after civil rights groups like the NAACP filed — and later won — school desegregation lawsuits. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"cJZhHD\"\u003eBusing was often used as a last resort for cities and districts that clearly showed little interest in desegregation. It was used to immediately integrate schools in the hopes of not only ending state-sanctioned segregation of blacks and whites, but to also give black and white students equal access to resources and opportunities. Many of these opportunities had been isolated to white schools in white communities. Predominantly black and Latino schools, meanwhile, struggled with overcrowding, outdated materials, and dilapidated buildings. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"zF3SCv\"\u003eBut busing — one of many tools used to secure black students’ constitutional right to equal education — was often \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/03/the-boston-busing-crisis-was-never-intended-to-work/474264/\"\u003estrongly opposed by white parents\u003c/a\u003e, many of whom did not want their children in integrated schools. Some parents and lawmakers stated that outright, others used different anti-busing arguments: saying that long bus rides to different schools were burdensome, and that their children were being placed in lower-quality schools (ignoring that schools in predominantly black neighborhoods had fewer resources and that per capita spending on black students was smaller). \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"4QdW2t\"\u003eParents also claimed that “forced busing” wouldn’t work to bring about racial equality and would merely function as quotas. (To be fair, some black people also opposed busing on the grounds that it was inconvenient, but their opposition was usually not as intense — or as invested in resisting integration — as that of white Americans.) \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"YZoFbK\"\u003eBusing programs weren’t opposed just in Southern states. In fact, they were often \u003ca href=\"https://www.wbur.org/news/2014/09/05/boston-busing-anniversary\"\u003emet with even more resistance in the North\u003c/a\u003e due to the region’s avoidance of civil rights issues and efforts to claim moral superiority over the South. Busing was \u003ca href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2013/11/19/245970277/how-courts-bus-ruling-sealed-differences-in-detroit-schools\"\u003eheavily criticized in Detroit\u003c/a\u003e, for example, where white families boycotted it in 1960 and continued to oppose it in the years after. In Boston, politicians campaigned and won on anti-busing platforms, arguing that black students’ struggles to access a quality education and succeed in schools were not affected by segregation, but were instead the result of pathology. The city also saw a \u003ca href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2016/10/05/495504360/looking-back-on-50-years-of-busing-in-boston\"\u003eseries of violent riots in the 1970s\u003c/a\u003e after schools were ordered to desegregate by a court. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"k9OtKq\"\u003eAs opposition continued, anti-busing proponents argued that their criticism of busing was not opposition to school desegregation as a whole. But it was also true that in districts that had been the most resistant to integration, the absence of busing programs would leave many schools segregated.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"cLAFSx\"\u003eCritics of busing were assisted by lawmakers and legislators who argued that Northern states weren’t segregated intentionally but were rather just “racially imbalanced,” a framing that ignored how policy in many of these states was used to keep white people separated from African Americans. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"83adHj\"\u003eHere’s how Matthew Delmont, a Dartmouth historian and author of \u003ca href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1516588\u0026amp;xs=1\u0026amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FWhy-Busing-Failed-Resistance-Desegregation%2Fdp%2F0520284259%2Fref%3Dsr_1_1%3Fie%3DUTF8%26qid%3D1458084443%26sr%3D8-1%26keywords%3Dwhy%2Bbusing%2Bfailed\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhy Busing Failed: Race, Media, and the National Resistance to School Desegregation\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e \u003c/em\u003eexplained things in a \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/03/the-boston-busing-crisis-was-never-intended-to-work/474264/\"\u003e2016 Atlantic article\u003c/a\u003e on the history of opposition to busing in Boston: \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp id=\"kIn93F\"\u003eWith busing, Northerners had found a palatable way to oppose desegregation without appealing to the explicitly racist sentiments they preferred to associate with Southerners. “I have probably talked before 500 or 600 groups over the last years about busing,” Los Angeles Assemblyman Floyd Wakefield said in 1970. “Almost every time, someone has gotten up and called me a ‘racist’ or a ‘bigot.’ But now, all of the sudden, I am no longer a ‘bigot.’ Now I am called ‘the leader of the antibusing effort.’” White parents and politicians framed their resistance to school desegregation in terms like “busing” and “neighborhood schools,” and this rhetorical shift allowed them to support white schools and neighborhoods without using explicitly racist language.           \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"NQaKxE\"\u003e“Describing opposition to busing as something other than resistance to school desegregation was a move that obscured the histories of racial discrimination and legal contexts for desegregation orders,” Delmont added. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Xsi74Y\"\u003eStill, even as cities like Boston protested busing, lawsuits led to Northern cities being subjected to busing programs in the late ’60s and 1970s. And in the mid-1970s, roughly halfway through Biden’s first term as a US senator, a part of Delaware soon found itself facing the prospect of such an order.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"d9wxE5\"\u003eBusing was one of the first issues to define Joe Biden’s early political career\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Bu6Lqp\"\u003eIn 1974, a federal court panel \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1974/07/13/archives/wilmington-integration-order-poses-the-possibility-of-busing.html\"\u003eruled\u003c/a\u003e that state housing and education policies had been used to keep the school systems of the city of Wilmington, Delaware (which was predominantly black), and its predominantly-white suburbs segregated.

But in 1973 and 1974, Biden had begun to vote for anti-busing measures after feeling pressure from his constituents. However, in two key exceptions, he voted to table two anti-busing measures, killing their chances of moving forward in the Senate by one vote. \u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZjNoud8US-FjgrtwGmW5IKzcW-k=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16685017/AP_7502240117.jpg\"\u003e\n      \u003ccite\u003eHenry Griffin/AP\u003c/cite\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003eSen.

Biden did so, going on to vote for eliminating policies that would provide federal oversight of busing. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"0q7VVw\"\u003eIn 1975, shortly after Boston residents protested and rioted over the city’s desegregation order, Biden came out in favor of an amendment \u003ca href=\"https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-CRECB-1975-pt22/pdf/GPO-CRECB-1975-pt22-6-2.pdf#page=122\"\u003eintroduced by North Carolina Sen. Jesse Helms\u003c/a\u003e, an ardent segregationist and white supremacist. Helms’s amendment would bar the then-active Department of Health, Education, and Welfare from collecting data about the race of students or teachers, and also prevented the department from requiring schools “to classify teachers or students by race.” Helms proudly announced that the measure would effectively end any federal oversight or enforcement of busing. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"zmmYOh\"\u003e“I have become convinced that busing is a bankrupt concept,” Biden said as he stood to support Helms’s amendment.

In his first term, Donald Trump’s newest appointee voted \u003ca href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/statistics/\"\u003emost often\u003c/a\u003e with Chief Justice Roberts (94 percent) and the Court’s most orthodox party-line conservative, Samuel Alito (91 percent).

United States\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, the Court in an opinion by Obama nominee Elena Kagan ruled as constitutional a Department of Justice rule that Congress had authorized it to create requiring some sex offenders to register as such after a designated date.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"9CtotZ\"\u003eWhat made the case potentially important was that three justices — including Chief Justice Roberts — dissented, arguing that the rule should have been struck down as an unconstitutional delegation by Congress to the executive branch. Justice Kavanaugh, however, did not participate in the case (which was argued before he joined the Court), and Justice Alito filed a concurrence indicating that he would “support [the] effort” if “a majority of this Court were willing to reconsider the approach we have taken for the past 84 years.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"hYJCr2\"\u003eAll in all, it added up to an ominous sign that an assault on the regulatory state may be in the offing. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"U8ecUm\"\u003eAlito was referring to two 1935 cases, \u003ca href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/1900-1940/293us388\"\u003e\u003cem\u003ePanama Refining v.

Legislative delegation — \u003ca href=\"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/neil-gorsuch-supreme-court-conservatives-gundy-sex-offender.html\"\u003eoften involving\u003c/a\u003e less specific policy choices than the one under review in \u003cem\u003eGundy\u003c/em\u003e — is such a ubiquitous part of the regulatory state established by the New Deal that reviving non-delegation doctrine would wreak havoc on critical government agencies like the EPA. Statutes like the Clean Air Act set broad goals and rely on the expertise of executive agencies to determine the details. Reviving non-delegation doctrine would put many of these regulations at risk of being voided by the courts. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"1etsPV\"\u003eWhile the idea of the Court forcing elected officials to make clearer choices might sound superficially attractive, in practice non-delegation doctrine \u003ca href=\"https://scholarship.law.umn.edu/concomm/371/\"\u003erepresents\u003c/a\u003e unsophisticated assumptions about how the legislative process functions, and judicial intervention is enormously unlikely to generate a coherent rule or produce a better process. But the libertarian push for the revival of non-delegation isn’t so much to improve the legislative process as to hamstring the executive branch, and the Roberts Court now seems poised to advance that goal. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"bYPhmI\"\u003e4) The 2020 Census may or may not include a citizenship question \u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"hCOEaN\"\u003eOn the last day of the term, the Court issued a very fractured ruling in \u003cem\u003eDepartment of Commerce v. New York\u003c/em\u003e. The case concerned the attempts by the Trump administration to add a \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/6/27/18761016/supreme-court-census-citizenship-opinion-decision\"\u003equestion about citizenship to the 2020 census\u003c/a\u003e — which critics say is a political move designed to marginalize people of color by giving them less federal representation. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"9K1O59\"\u003eAfter oral argument, it seemed \u003ca href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/2019/04/argument-analysis-divided-court-seems-ready-to-uphold-citizenship-question-on-2020-census/\"\u003ehighly likely\u003c/a\u003e that the Trump administration would prevail, despite multiple lower courts having held the addition of the question illegal. However, the Court did not allow the question to go forward as of now. The Court’s four Democratic nominees sided with the lower courts that the addition of the question was arbitrary and capricious (and hence illegal under the Administrative Procedures Act), while four of the Republican nominees would have allowed the question to immediately go forward. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"bciCT2\"\u003eRoberts sided with the Trump administration on most of the questions but held that the reason offered for the change by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross — that the Trump administration added the question to better enforce the Voting Rights Act — was clearly a pretext. (Given that the Trump administration has \u003ca href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/civil-rights-division-has-not-filed-a-single-voting-rights-act-case-under-trump-792914a2689a/\"\u003eliterally never\u003c/a\u003e sued to enforce the VRA, this shouldn’t have been hard to determine.) “Accepting contrived reasons,” Roberts argued, “would defeat the purpose of the enterprise.” So the Court sent the issue back to the lower courts and invited the Commerce Department to offer a more plausible justification.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"f9kNvK\"\u003eGiven that the evidence \u003ca href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/census-citizenship-question-was-designed-discriminate-until-incompetence-doomed-it-ncna959486\"\u003eindicates\u003c/a\u003e that asking about citizenship will cause racial minorities to fill out the census at lower rates — reducing their federal representation and share of federal funds — whether the question ends up on the census is not a trivial matter. But it remains unclear whether it will. Particularly in light of the recently revealed \u003ca href=\"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/census-case-john-roberts-bush-v-gore-tragedy.html\"\u003esmoking gun evidence\u003c/a\u003e that the question was designed precisely to underrepresent minorities, the lower courts might issue a ruling against the question that will hold up.

The popular film Inception references this technique with a spinning top, which would normally eventually stop rotating but continues eternally when dreaming. If you don’t fancy keeping a spinning top in your pocket, you can hold your nose and perform the normally impossible task of breathing through it. Repeated checks throughout the day make you more likely to do the same checks while dreaming, and thus become lucid to the freer dreamworld in which you can breathe through a blocked nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003ciframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hhavsmsi_5M?wmode=transparent\u0026amp;start=0\" width=\"440\" height=\"260\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the \u003ca href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810012001614\"\u003eMnemonic Induction Lucid Dream (MILD)\u003c/a\u003e technique, one rehearses a dream and visualizes becoming lucid while repeating a mantra expressing the same intention, such as: “Next time I’m dreaming I want to remember that I am dreaming.” For best results, it should be performed while returning to slumber during the \u003ca href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810012001614\"\u003eWake-Back-To-Bed (WBTB)\u003c/a\u003e technique, whereby one sets their alarm clock to one or two hours before their normal waking time, gets up for a few minutes, and then goes back to sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis brief awakening is thought to \u003ca href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2015-53854-001\"\u003eincrease cortical activation\u003c/a\u003e in the key brain areas implicated in lucid dreaming when one slips back into rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, the stage during which vivid dreaming occurs.

The collaboration with Zimmer, however, shows it\u0026#8217;s making a bigger push into cooler, more distinctive sounds. The infinitely modifiable nature of the sounds are a unique feature for electric cars that gives automakers another way to distinguish themselves, both among drivers and the pedestrians who hear the vehicles whir by.

That could happen again. Also, the current agreement doesn\u0026#8217;t roll back any of the tariffs that are already in place. Given the highs of the US stock market—a metric important to Trump—there\u0026#8217;s less pressure on the US administration to ease off of China. In all, large uncertainty still remains about US trade policy, which will be enough for many investors to cling to their bets that a rate cut is still coming, if not in July then in September, which could keep markets buoyant for longer.

The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe White House thinking, said the hard work of finalizing the complex details of any broad new accord would come later, when negotiating teams for the two sides meet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnder the cease-fire scenario, existing tariffs and counter-tariffs on many of each other\u0026#8217;s goods would remain in place. But no additional import taxes would take effect. This would buy time for U.S. and Chinese officials to restart talks that stalled last month after 11 rounds of negotiations. Trump said Friday he had not agreed to a cease-fire with Xi as a precondition for their meeting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last time Trump and Xi met \u0026mdash; in early December at a G-20 gathering in Buenos Aires, Argentina \u0026mdash; they called a truce. That arrangement injected some new momentum into talks between the world\u0026#8217;s two biggest economies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for Saudi Arabia, Trump has long sought to minimize the crown prince\u0026#8217;s role in Khashoggi\u0026#8217;s murder, and has been reluctant to criticize the killing of the royal critic. His administration views the kingdom as the lynchpin of its Middle East strategy to counter Iran. The meeting Saturday comes a week after Trump came to the brink of ordering a military strike on that Iran in retaliation for it downing an American unmanned spy-plane. Trump is also relying on the Saudi government to support his administration\u0026#8217;s elusive Israel-Palestinian peace plan, which is being developed by his son-in-law, Jared Kushner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith Erodogan, Trump will find himself trying to paper over differences over Turkey\u0026#8217;s planned purchase of the Russian-made S-400 surface-to-air missile system. U.S. officials have threatened that purchase would halt the sale of the U.S.-made F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, though Erdogan\u0026#8217;s government has called it a done deal. The pair will also be called to continue difficult discussions about Syria, as Trump\u0026#8217;s ordered withdrawal has been slowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/time/topstories/~4/9Sgi4dVQrkE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/9Sgi4dVQrkE/","published":"2019-06-29T03:32:05Z","guid":"http://time.com/?p=5617697"},{"title":"Here’s What’s New on Netflix in July 2019 (and What’s Leaving)","content":"\u003caside class=\"right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad\" id=\"right-rail__ad-5613826\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module\" data-src=\"https://time.com/5613826/new-on-netflix-july-2019/\" data-widget-id=\"SB_2\" data-ob-template=\"timemag\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat do \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://time.com/5351084/orange-is-the-new-black-season-six-review/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eOrange Is the New Black\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://time.com/5543714/antoni-porowski-pete-davidson-meme/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eQueer Eye\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://time.com/5609957/netflix-prank-encounters-stranger-things/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eStranger Things\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/em\u003eand \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://time.com/5600490/25-coffees-a-day/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eComedians in Cars Getting Coffee\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/em\u003eall have in common?

Last year, for example, UBS wrote a note to its clients titled \u0026#8220;\u003ca href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/ubs-the-kitchen-is-dead-2018-6\"\u003eIs the kitchen dead\u003c/a\u003e?\u0026#8221; wherein it suggested the rise of food delivery apps like Deliveroo and Uber Eats could well prove ruinous for home cooks and as well as fresh food providers, including restaurants and supermarkets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe economics are just too alluring, suggested the bank. Food is already inexpensive to have delivered because of cheap labor, and that will cost center will disappear entirely if delivery drones every take off. Meanwhile, food is becoming cheaper to make because of central kitchens, the kind that Deliveroo is opening and Uber is reportedly beginning move into, as well. (In March, Bloomberg reported that Uber is \u003ca href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-11/uber-and-travis-kalanick-are-in-business-again-this-time-as-competitors\"\u003etesting out a program in Paris\u003c/a\u003e where it\u0026#8217;s renting out fully equipped, commercial-grade kitchens to serve businesses that selling food on delivery apps like Uber Eats.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe favorable case for cloud kitchens argues that businesses using the spaces are paying less than they would for traditional restaurant real estate, but the reality is also that most of the businesses moving into them right now aren\u0026#8217;t small restaurateurs but quick service brands that already have a following and aren\u0026#8217;t particular known for emphasis on food quality but instead for churning out affordable food, fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Eric Greenspan, an L.A.-based chef who has appeared on many Food Network shows and has opened and closed numerous restaurants over the course of his career, explains in a new, \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVZq21xC3fM\"\u003eindependent documentary about cloud kitchens\u003c/a\u003e: \u0026#8220;Delivery is the fastest growing market in restaurants. What started out as 10 percent of your sales is now 30 percent of your sales, and [the industry predicts] it will be 50 to 60 percent of a quick-serve restaurant\u0026#8217;s sales within the next three to five years. So you take that, plus the fact that quick-serve brands are kind of the key to getting a fat payout at the end of the day . . .\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring an age when fewer people frequent them traditional restaurants \u0026#8212;  with their overhead and turnover and razor-thin margins \u0026#8212; running one simply makes less and less sense, Greenspan continues. \u0026#8220;[Opening] up a brick-and-mortar restaurant these days is just like giving yourself a job. Now [with centralized kitchens], as long as the product is coming out strong, I don\u0026#8217;t need to be there as a presence. I can quality control remotely now. I can go online and [sign out of a marketplace like Postmates or UberEats or Deliveroo] and not piss off any customers, because if I just decided to close the restaurant one day, and you drove over and it was closed, you\u0026#8217;d be pissed. But if you\u0026#8217;re looking for [one of my restaurants] in Uber Eats and you can\u0026#8217;t find it because I turned it off, well, you\u0026#8217;re not pissed. You just order something else.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBig players only need apply . . .\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe model works for now for Greenspan, who is running numerous restaurant \u0026#8220;concepts\u0026#8221; from one cloud kitchen in L.A. Perhaps unsurprisingly, that facility belongs in part to Uber cofounder Travis Kalanick, who was quicker than some to grok the opportunity that shared kitchens present. In fact, it was early last year that he announced he was investing \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/3/20/17145032/travis-kalanick-uber-new-job-ceo-real-estate-startup-city-storage-systems\"\u003e$150 million\u003c/a\u003e in a startup called City Storage Systems that focused on repurposing distressed real estate assets and turning them into spaces for new industries, like food delivery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat company owns \u003ca href=\"https://www.cloudkitchens.com/\"\u003eCloudKitchens\u003c/a\u003e, which invites chains, as well as independent restaurant and food truck owners, to lease space in one of their facilities for a monthly fee, along with additional fees for data analytics meant to help the entrepreneurs boost their sales.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pitch to restaurateurs is that CloudKitchens can reduce their overhead, but of course, the company is also amassing all kinds of data about its tenants and their customer preferences in the process that one could them seeing using over time.

Still, the kitchens, which make all the sense in the world from an investment standpoint, should not be embraced so readily as a panacea, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost obviously, they rely on the same people who drive Ubers and handle food deliveries \u0026#8212; people who aren\u0026#8217;t afforded health benefits and whose financial picture is forever precarious as a result. As with Uber drivers, Deliveroo employees tried to gain status as \u0026#8220;workers\u0026#8221; last year with better pay and paid but they were \u003ca href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2018/12/05/blow-gig-economy-deliveroo-riders-lose-landmark-legal-appeal/\"\u003edenied these rights\u003c/a\u003e because they have the option of asking other riders to take their deliveries.

Though most restaurant kitchens are chaotic scenes, Newberg said that as \u0026#8220;someone who loves food and sustainability\u0026#8221; the easy-to-miss warehouse didn\u0026#8217;t feel \u0026#8220;very humane\u0026#8221; to him when he walked through it. It\u0026#8217;s windowless for one thing (it\u0026#8217;s a warehouse). Newberg says that he also counted 27 kitchens packed into what are \u0026#8220;maybe 250-square-feet to 300 square-foot spaces,\u0026#8221; and a lot of people who appeared to be in panic mode. \u0026#8220;Imagine lots of screaming, lots of sirens triggered when an order gets backed up, tablets everywhere.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdds Newberg, \u0026#8220;When i walked in, I was like, holy shit, no one even knows this exists in L.A.

Still, Moritz, the venture capitalist, warns that they will benefit some far more than others. \u003ca href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5c104e5e-7aea-11e9-8b5c-33d0560f039c\"\u003eWriting in the FT\u003c/a\u003e, he says that in the early 2000s, his firm, Sequoia, invested in a chain of kebab restaurants called Faasos that planned to delivery meals to customers\u0026#8217; homes but was getting crushed by high rents and turnover among other things, so opened a centralized kitchen to sell kebobs. Now, he says, Fassos produces a wide variety of foods, including other Indian specialities but also Chinese and Italian dishes under separate brand names.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#8217;s the same playbook that Eric Greenspan is using, telling Food \u0026amp; WIne magazine last year that his goal was ultimately to have \u003ca href=\"https://www.foodandwine.com/news/eric-greenspan-goes-delivery-only\"\u003esix delivery-only concepts\u003c/a\u003e running simultaneously, with two menus each for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreenberg, who is obviously media savvy, can probably pull it off, too, as has Fassos. But for restaurants that are not known franchises or have the star appeal of celebrity chef, the future might not look so bright.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWrites Moritz: \u0026#8220;In some markets there is still an opportunity for hardened restaurant and kitchen operators — particularly if they are gifted in the use of social media to build a following and refashion themselves. But they need to move quickly before it becomes too expensive to compete with the larger, faster-moving companies. The mere prospect of Amazon using cloud kitchens to provide cuisine catering to every taste — and delivering these meals through services such as Deliveroo — should be enough to give any restaurateur heartburn.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt should also worry people who care about their neighborhoods.

Constant puffing and growling echoed around me as heavily-tattooed fighters threw forceful punches into the heavy bags. This was the scene I encountered when I stepped into \u003ca href=\"http://www.academyfivepoints.com/\"\u003eFive Points Academy\u003c/a\u003e, a martial arts fighting gym in New York, for the first time a few years ago. Having grown up in a sheltered environment — the last time I had gotten into a fight was in kindergarten — I wasn’t sure I would fit in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily, one of the instructors, immediately introduced herself and showed me some basic Muay Thai movements. The class focused on pad work, so students paired up and held Thai pads for each other to practice their moves. Emily rotated me through different partners during the class, offering me a taste of what it was like to hit pads, and I was hooked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA year ago, my friend, Diane Wu, \u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@dianewu/inclusion-not-diversity-bf3fbb5bda9f\"\u003ewrote a wonderful post\u003c/a\u003e arguing that “inclusion is the cause, and diversity is the effect. When an inclusive mindset is in place, diversity naturally follows.” My experience at Five Points reflects this sentiment. Despite being in a traditionally male-dominant field, roughly 40% of our instructors, half of our fighters, and half of our members are women. It’s not a coincidence that they are also widely regarded as one of the most inclusive and least “bro-y” fighting gyms in New York.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTech has only been male-dominant in the last few decades — \u003ca href=\"https://www.history.com/news/coding-used-to-be-a-womans-job-so-it-was-paid-less-and-undervalued\"\u003ethe first coders in the 1940s were women\u003c/a\u003e — while martial arts has been male-dominant for the last few millennia. If a martial arts gym can overcome systemic obstacles, we, in tech, can do better. After interviewing the owners, coaches, fighters, and members of the gym, here is what I learned about how they created an inclusive community.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eCulture starts from the top\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.lri.com/resources/useletter/change-culture/\"\u003eStudies have shown\u003c/a\u003e that culture stems from leadership, and this is demonstrated by the three owners of Five Points, Steve, Simon, and Kevin. Multiple members noted that Steve’s laid-back demeanor, Simon’s British humor, and Kevin’s always-friendly attitude were a big part of what made Five Points feel like family. As Steve explained, “People learn better if you’re encouraging as opposed to intimidating.” This welcoming culture from the top certainly encouraged a wider range of people to join and prosper, especially among more recreational fighters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCompanies are no different when it comes to establishing cultures from the top. If inclusivity is a priority, executives have to demonstrate that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve seen cases where the CEO created a committee to collaborate on establishing core values for the company, only to scrap that conversation and send out a survey asking employees to rate cultural values the CEO personally came up with. Over time, people with different viewpoints left the company, and the ones who stayed were predominantly from the same backgrounds in terms of work experience, gender, and ethnicity. Ultimately, building a culture of inclusion requires both executive buy-in and genuine follow-through actions, or else it will be hard to sustain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e“Inclusion” includes everyone\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive Points didn’t start out aiming to achieve gender parity or market to certain demographics. Instead, they focused on creating a community where everyone was welcomed. Simon summarized it well, “An inclusive culture includes everyone. By not having the right culture, you might turn away a person — not just women, but also other men — that can potentially help improve your gym directly.” He further elaborated, “We don’t want an asshole culture not just because women might be turned off—but men would, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is an important distinction. For example, it is tempting to generalize that a frat-house gym culture could keep women away. However, many men dislike such a culture as well. Instead of lumping people into groups, we can look at each individual and ask ourselves, “what environment would be welcoming for him or her?” For instance, Kevin always makes sure to take time to understand each prospective new member, give them a tour of the facilities, and discuss how the academy could cater to their needs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe can extend this idea further: surface-level characteristics are often times just a proxy for deeper attributes, so why not go straight to the root? When I took Muay Thai classes at other gyms, the instructor would often remind everyone, “Guys, if you are paired with a girl, please go lighter.” This gender-based generalization is just a proxy for the root attribute: size. At Five Points, the instructor would instead say, “Guys (and gals), if you are paired with someone a lot smaller than you, please adjust your power to keep your partner safe.” Safety is a concern for anyone facing a bigger opponent, regardless of the gender they identify themselves with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn tech, there has been a lot of discussion around creating a more inclusive environment for underrepresented demographics. I believe we can be more effective by augmenting this effort. In addition to asking “how can we make women feel comfortable contributing to meetings?”, we can also ask “how can we help all employees feel comfortable contributing to meetings?”[1] In addition to discussing “how can we provide support mechanisms for minorities?”, we can also discuss “how can we provide support mechanisms for employees who are not well-versed in mainstream corporate America culture?” I believe this hybrid approach can cover more ground and ensure that help is delivered to the people who need it most [2].\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eTreat everyone equally\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA common theme among the female coaches and members I interviewed was that they felt that gender was something that did not cross their minds during class. Multiple members have commented that the instructors treated everyone equally. For example, if you were late, independent of what demographic or skill level you were, you had to do 30 pushups [3]. Giving everyone the same standards ensured that people couldn’t pick on others or make snide comments such as “Amy got off easier because she was a girl.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the rules during Muay Thai drills class is to lower the power level and focus on technique. One time, Steve took Emily’s Muay Thai drills class and hit his partner a bit too hard. Emily immediately reminded Steve, “that was probably a bit too hard.” It didn’t matter that Steve was an owner and Emily was an employee — as the instructor of the class she made sure everyone followed the same rules.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLikewise, treating everyone equally starts from the beginning: the candidate experience. A common question I get is “how do we improve diversity without lowering the bar?” What I propose is to define a set of capabilities that all candidates need to demonstrate. For example, if a productive software engineer needs to be good at algorithms, system design, communication, teamwork, and breaking problems down, we should evaluate each of the five areas fairly during recruiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, many companies only look at the first two, which not only results in a non-diverse group of employees, but also those with skillsets that don’t fully map to their jobs. By communicating the standards transparently, we ensure that all employees understand that they belong, and are equally a part of the community.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003ePay attention to details\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDetails often reflect the thoughtfulness put in to creating a culture. Ting, a Kali (a weapons-based martial art) instructor and former fighter, explained, “Many martial arts gym are dirty and smell like sweat. Five Points pays attention to details: there are hair ties and multiple hair dryers for women’s locker rooms. The mats are mopped every hour in between classes. This removes one extra stress for a lot of women who want to try out martial arts.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeedless to say, the attention to detail applies to classes as well. A new member shared the following story with me: “Once I was getting ready to do a private session with Steve after Emily’s Muay Thai class. Emily went to Steve and said ‘she needs more work on her left roundhouse kick.’ Of course Steve then made me do left roundhouses for 30 minutes straight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the member was cursing inside, she was also grateful for the attention Emily paid to her. Sonya, a long-time Kali student, also recalled that Simon would often notice when she’s flustered with a particular drill. With his classic British humor, he would remark “too much water in the bucket?” before proceeding to break down the drill further to ensure she could absorb the information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are many zero-cost things companies can do that could make the employees feel taken care of. For example, in the early days, Palantir, my former employer, would proactively offer employees the option to early-exercise their stock options. They also brought in tax accountants to explain how to handle the alternative minimum tax (AMT). However, I’ve also seen companies with 60+ employees where no one was given the option to early-exercise, even though it financially costs the company practically nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eBe adaptive to change and proactively improve\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Five Points first started, they followed the Western boxing mindset where members sparred hard. The mentality was to identify fighters who were tough and wanted it so bad they’d return after getting beaten up. Over time, as Steve and Simon traveled to Thailand, they witnessed a different style of sparring, where fighters sparred lightly and focused on technique and timing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey revamped their sparring classes to “Thai Style Technical Sparring,” and had a few designated “hard sparring” classes. Although a few fighters were upset, Steve and Simon were convinced that this was the right approach. As Steve explained, “the old style can help you find tough people but not necessarily the best people.” Furthermore, the best fighter can come in all shapes, sizes, genders, and backgrounds, not necessarily the “tough person” who comes in day one wanting to fight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis open mindset certainly uncovered many great fighters they wouldn’t have found otherwise, increasing the diversity of the community. One of their fighters, a former model and actress, came to Five Points never thinking she would fight. The welcoming environment and emphasis on technique during sparring made her feel safe as she leveled up her skills. Three years in, Steve asked her if she wanted to do a fight. She ended up getting hooked and went on to win multiple US Kickboxing Association International Championships.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis adaptive mindset is applicable to other areas as well. When I interviewed at Google, one of my interviewers told me that for a long time Google focused heavily on brain-teasers and algorithmic puzzles. As a result, during lunch with his team, the predominantly white and Asian male engineers with backgrounds in coding would discuss brain teasers and algorithmic puzzles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver time, \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/20/business/in-head-hunting-big-data-may-not-be-such-a-big-deal.html?pagewanted=all\u0026amp;_r=2\u0026amp;\"\u003eGoogle’s leadership realized that brain teasers and algorithmic puzzles have little correlation with one’s performance\u003c/a\u003e. They then restructured their interview process, and the diversity of the team improved. Obviously there are still areas for improvement, but being able to recognize issues and adapt to new findings is critical to fostering an inclusive culture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eEnforce the rules fairly when needed\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe journey to building a diverse and inclusive martial arts community is not without the occasional bumps. As a community grows bigger, there will inevitably be bad actors, and how a leader responds to them will set the tone for how the culture develops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily has kicked students out of her class a few times when a bigger or more experienced fighter beat up on a smaller or less-experienced student. It did not matter if the bully was highly skilled or fought for the gym — she enforced the rules fairly with everyone. Similarly, after a 200+ lbs experienced man repeatedly beat up others during Muay Thai sparring and refused to let go on locks during Brazilian Jiu Jitsu classes, Steve asked him to leave the gym.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the contrary, in a work environment, I have witnessed situations where someone would repeatedly yell at colleagues in front of everyone — including executives — during meetings. It got so toxic that four people from various departments requested to switch projects because they did not want to work with the person anymore. However, because the employee was deemed important by executives, they continued to let him yell at others during meetings with no repercussions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCulture is not just slogans hung on the walls of your conference rooms. UCSF Psychiatry professor Cameron Sepah says, “\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/s/company-culture/your-companys-culture-is-who-you-hire-fire-and-promote-c69f84902983\"\u003eYour Company Culture is Who You Hire, Fire, and Promote\u003c/a\u003e.” One of the triggers for a recent employee walk-out at Google was because the company paid ex-executives tens of millions of dollars after discovering allegations of sexual misconduct. Ensuring improper behavior is dealt with immediately and fairly is vital to fostering an inclusive culture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eSuccess breeds success\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen an initiative has early traction, it is much easier to continue the momentum. Culture is the same way. When Five Points first started in 2002, they already had three high-level female fighters—one of them, Emily, even went on to win the Muay Thai World Championships. Having diversity early on helped provide role models for members from underrepresented backgrounds who were interested in fighting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce an inclusive culture is established, the community members will continue to be inclusive and others will want to join. One of the coaches and fighters, Gianna, explained, “Nobody made me feel like sh*t when I was new, so I want to make sure other noobs don’t feel that way either.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother Kali student, Sonya, who describes herself as a “girly girl,” had to work extra hard honing her skills because she did not come from an athletic background like most of the other members. However, Simon was always patient with her, continually breaking down techniques until she grasped them. Looking back, she is extremely appreciative that Simon tried very hard to make her feel comfortable, and now she recommends all her female friends to try out Kali. Her motivation? “I want girly girls to know that they’re welcome here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe same applies to the tech industry. I have seen series A companies with 50 employees struggle to hire women due to their gender imbalance (15% female), only to see the ratio further decrease as the company grows (10%). On the other hand, Flatiron Health, also a former employer, focused on diversity \u0026amp; inclusion from the get-go, including hiring senior female leaders across all functions early on. When I was there, they had roughly 50% female employees and 50% female managers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eFrom inclusion to diversity\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive Points Academy never started with the intent of building a gym with 50% women and members from all different ethnic and socio-economic backgrounds. Instead, the owners simply wanted to build a gym where anyone can belong, and anyone can enjoy being part of the community. By starting with inclusion, diversity followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am not at all advocating for halting initiatives on diversity. It is important that we focus on diversity, and many companies are doing just that. However, just like Five Points Academy, we also need to invest in building an inclusive culture to help people thrive and grow at the company, which will further attract more diverse employees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eFootnotes\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[1] Studies have shown that a man’s ideas are often taken more seriously than a woman’s. As a result, many women choose not to participate in meetings but ask a male colleague of theirs to present their ideas.\u003cbr /\u003e\n[2] For example, according to Ascend Research, Asians score the lowest in executive parity index, doing worse than Blacks and Hispanics. However, they are not considered an “underrepresented minority,” so relatively little has been done to mentor young Asian professionals on career progression.\u003cbr /\u003e\n[3] If you had physical limitations, you could substitute them with pushups on knees or another exercise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"feedflare\"\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=_Rd8zvJggRk:e1VrLqPsh1k:2mJPEYqXBVI\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=_Rd8zvJggRk:e1VrLqPsh1k:7Q72WNTAKBA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=_Rd8zvJggRk:e1VrLqPsh1k:yIl2AUoC8zA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=_Rd8zvJggRk:e1VrLqPsh1k:-BTjWOF_DHI\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=_Rd8zvJggRk:e1VrLqPsh1k:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=_Rd8zvJggRk:e1VrLqPsh1k:D7DqB2pKExk\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=_Rd8zvJggRk:e1VrLqPsh1k:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=_Rd8zvJggRk:e1VrLqPsh1k:qj6IDK7rITs\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/_Rd8zvJggRk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/_Rd8zvJggRk/","published":"2019-06-29T16:19:35Z","guid":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=1850492"},{"title":"Softbank and Toyota-backed mobility venture gains five more automakers","content":"\u003cp id=\"speakable-summary\"\u003eMONET Technologies, a joint venture launched by Softbank and Toyota to provide on-demand mobility services eventually with an autonomous module bus, has five new partners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive Japanese automakers including Isuzu Motors, Suzuki Motor Corp., \u003ca class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/subaru-isuzu\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"subaru-isuzu\"\u003eSubaru, \u003cspan class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/daihatsu\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"daihatsu\"\u003eDaihatsu \u003cspan class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e and Mazda will each invest 2% in the venture.

Now as a full-fledged console title, it’s easily one of the most stylish and aesthetically distinctive games I’ve played in quite a while. Even as a $20 indie game meant to be played over just a few sittings, what makes the game truly shine is both its replay value and how it pushes you to engage with its perfection-demanding higher difficulties. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Jp7tsK\"\u003eThe core conceit is simple, particularly if you’ve ever played \u003cem\u003eHotline Miami \u003c/em\u003eor any of the titles it inspired. You’re a masked killer with a penchant for gunning down bad guys, and this time around, there’s a surreal talking banana to tell you where to go and what to do. Oh, there’s also a pulsing synthwave soundtrack, naturally, and tons of gory violence. What makes \u003cem\u003eMy Friend Pedro \u003c/em\u003estand apart is how, like \u003cem\u003eHotline Miami\u003c/em\u003e, it can turn even the most casual of players into score-chasing obsessives and speed runners bent on earning a coveted A or S rank in every one of its 40 levels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-float-right\"\u003e\u003caside id=\"XaORgM\"\u003e\u003cq\u003e\u003cem\u003eMy Friend Pedro \u003c/em\u003eshares a lot of its DNA with another recent indie game called \u003cem\u003eKatana Zero\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/q\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"AWqj3E\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eMy Friend Pedro \u003c/em\u003eshares a lot of its DNA with another recently released indie game called \u003cem\u003eKatana Zero\u003c/em\u003e, both of which take a few well-established game ideas and stitch them together in a stylish package\u003cem\u003e. \u003c/em\u003eThe two titles are Devolver-published games from tiny teams and revolve around a signature slow-mo feature, and both are targeting console gamers solely on the Nintendo Switch, with Steam releases to reach the PC crowd. In \u003cem\u003eKatana Zero\u003c/em\u003e, you can slow down time to deflect or dodge bullets with a samurai sword. In \u003cem\u003eMy Friend Pedro\u003c/em\u003e, you’re slowing down time to make gun shots more precise and yourself more acrobatic. You’ll also look badass while you’re doing it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"7KSeRK\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eMy Friend Pedro\u003c/em\u003e has a few truly spectacular touches that make it different from your standard bullet time shoot ‘em up. For one, there’s a unique, albeit rather convoluted, set of aerial maneuvers you can pull off to earn extra points and look even cooler while you clear a room of bad guys. Those include flips midair that require that you slow down time, flips off of walls and ledges, shooting in two directions simultaneously, and spinning while grounded or while flipping to dodge bullets.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eORC0apgt_BhNWHbNS55isbhVmY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16685045/my_friend_pedro_5.png\"\u003e\n      \u003ccite\u003eImage: DeadToast Entertainment / Devolver Digital\u003c/cite\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"wNXFdv\"\u003eDo all of these at once — a feat that is not all that easy given the sometimes cumbersome console control scheme — and you can shower an entire room with bullets in pretty much all directions, while dodging enemy fire as you spin and somersault. At the advice of a friend, I remapped the slow-mo feature from the L3 position to the right bumper button on Switch, and I started playing almost exclusively on the Switch Pro controller when I wanted to be more precise with my aiming. That helped a lot. Once you get the hang of it, you’ll feel appropriately like a Keanu Reeves character, equal parts \u003cem\u003eThe Matrix \u003c/em\u003eand \u003cem\u003eJohn Wick\u003c/em\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"yCa1F3\"\u003eThe other nice touches are environmental items and vehicles that mix up the standard breach formula, which can feel overused after the first few dozen times you’re forced to break through a closed door or jump through a pane of glass into a room full of enemies. For instance, toss a frying pan into the air and you can shoot it with bullets from the other side of a sliver of open window to deflect and rain down bullets in a room you’re not even standing in. There are also motorcycle and skateboarding sections that take the standard mix of frenetic action and slowed-down acrobatics and put them on fast-moving rails.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yIVL7NzHs5oFhIumYaZEpBhNrJI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16685021/my_friend_pedro_4.png\"\u003e\n      \u003ccite\u003eImage: Dead Toast Entertainment / Devolver Digital\u003c/cite\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"0LQb0M\"\u003eBut beyond the relatively thin story and the initial gleam of the slow-mo shooting, what’s going to make \u003cem\u003eMy Friend Pedro \u003c/em\u003eclick for you, or not, is whether you’re really interested in score chasing. That’s where the true depth of the game comes in, and it’s not going to be for everyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"wc9O10\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eMy Friend Pedro\u003c/em\u003e has a steep learning curve for players intent on trying it at its higher difficulties, which is required for those shooting for high scores on the leaderboards. You can achieve A and even S ranking on normal and hard, but you’ll have to toggle on “bananas” mode for the extra score boost to come anywhere near a top 10 score. And I imagine the players who do go deep with \u003cem\u003eMy Friend Pedro \u003c/em\u003ewill predominantly be gunning for the highest scores possible, as there’s not really a reason to replay levels otherwise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"pilfcV\"\u003eThat said, the game never thoroughly communicates central concepts — like the fact that getting hit by an enemy bullet will drastically lower the time you have to continue chaining the combo, or that chaining combos requires you carefully time when you down your last enemy to give you enough buffer to reach the next. Or that you can adjust aim assist if you find yourself needing more precise, manual aiming to avoid taking damage and potentially spoiling a combo, which in turn spoils an entire run if you’re going for a high score. You’re left to figure out those tricks on your own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-float-left\"\u003e\u003caside id=\"3CFSjV\"\u003e\u003cq\u003e\u003cem\u003eMy Friend Pedro\u003c/em\u003e has a steep learning curve for players intent on trying it at its higher difficulties\u003c/q\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"XWOXEb\"\u003eThat’s not necessarily a bad thing. In the first stage, I discovered that chaining a combo for every single one of the 21 enemies was possible, and about 45 minutes later, I had actually achieved it through a mix of trial-and-error problem-solving and speed-running prowess. I saw my high score skyrocket, earning me an S ranking and a spot at number five on the global Switch leaderboards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"klwZAt\"\u003eGranted, it was day one, and my performance has since been eviscerated, but it was a stunning revelation to figure out the secret to the upper echelon scores and I was given a rather satisfying reward as a result. Chaining every enemy in a single combo becomes much, much harder in later stages, so I haven’t been able to come close to the top 10 on those levels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"KPIJn2\"\u003eKeep in mind that this is a game that’s designed around these kinds of obsessive replay sessions. At $20, you’ll still get your money’s worth if you do just play through the main story and perhaps try a few of the levels on harder difficulty settings, but there’s not a whole lot to spend your time on unless you really want to dig deep and plan those perfected runs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"rHJnv2\"\u003eThat said, the magic of a devilishly simple game like \u003cem\u003eMy Friend Pedro \u003c/em\u003eis in pulling you in with its flashy appearance and keeping you around with its depth.

As a child, I broke my dad’s Braun electric razor playing with the dial that raised and lowered the blades because the action was so cool and “clicky.” At school, I dreamed of being either a product designer or an architect. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"gMWt9V\"\u003eThose dreams were dashed when I flunked technical drawing (I was off by over 4cm and the tolerance of the test was less than 0.5cm) and failed my physics and maths exams, both of which are somewhat vital to designing beautiful buildings that don’t fall down. So for the past 30 years my inner industrial designer has lived vicariously through the career of my contemporary (he’s only a few years younger than me) and fellow Brit, Sir Jony Ive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"AnXWRQ\"\u003eIve made being an industrial product designer “cool”. Stop anyone in the street and ask them to name a famous industrial designer and I would hazard a guess that, if they have an answer at all, it would be Jony Ive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"zTeKOg\"\u003eYes, there are many other influential industrial designers. Yves Béhar and Dieter Rams — who was much admired by Steve Jobs and was the visionary behind so many of Braun’s products (including my dad’s broken electric razor) — both come to mind. So does Marc Newson, a contemporary of Jony’s and a partner in his new company \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/27/18761736/jony-ive-apple-leave-iphone-chief-design-officer-lovefrom-company-quit\"\u003eLoveForm\u003c/a\u003e. All are legendary in the design community but none have either the name recognition or influence on the level of Ive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-float-left\"\u003e\u003caside id=\"IgI4cu\"\u003e\u003cq\u003eIf they’ve heard of Ive, most people could tell you what his design aesthetic looks like\u003c/q\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ugxDfR\"\u003eNot only has Ive designed some of the most iconic Apple products created over the past 30 years — the iMac, the iPod and the iPhone to name just a few — the success of these products has directly affected the lives of millions of people and changed how they view the importance of great industrial design as a result. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"OC871v\"\u003eIf you were to simply pose the question “if Jony Ive designed a [insert product here],” most people would be able to visualize exactly what that product would look like: minimal design, clean form, functional utility and a copious use of aluminum. That’s remarkable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Gm8hiD\"\u003eFurthermore, this appreciation of great product design has led to it becoming a core tenet of the commercial success of any tech product in today’s marketplace. I would argue that Microsoft’s remarkable resurgence with the Surface under Satya Nadella is at least partially a result of his willingness to embrace the importance of design over pure utility as a defining brand value of the company.

At least he was trying something different and new. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"EHnjVr\"\u003eBut while the wider and real adoption of good industrial design practices has unquestionably benefited both consumers and design fans, perhaps rather ironically the one company that has suffered the most as a result has been Apple (though not financially). This may explain Ive’s departure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"45dILr\"\u003eAs Buddy Pine says in the film \u003cem\u003eThe Incredibles\u003c/em\u003e, “if everyone is super, then no one is.” Thirty years ago, Jony Ive’s design aesthetic and partnership with Steve Jobs made Apple’s products stand head and shoulders above almost anything else available. They were truly revolutionary. The iMac was a joyous translucent blue, orange or magenta PC when every other computer manufacturer’s offering was a beige box; the iPod was gorgeously chunky with a practical, childlike simplicity of operation that put “a thousand songs in your pocket.” And as for that first iPhone. Well let me just say that in terms of it’s design, I believe it is still the best iPhone by far. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-float-right\"\u003e\u003caside id=\"9xR11s\"\u003e\u003cq\u003eBecause everybody is focused on better design, it’s harder for Apple to distinguish its products \u003c/q\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"JRogx7\"\u003eBut in 2019, it is extremely difficult to continually maintain that level of game changing impact. It is very hard to lead from the front. Apple has found it challenging to encourage their user base to update to the relatively iterative new design of the iPhone X and XS. I’m not surprised it’s cautious of introducing something too revolutionary. Apple is caught in a trap of its own making: critics demand that Apple be the bold, brave brand we’ve come to expect but its users are only fine with that as long as everything works just the same. We are moving into a post hardware world where seamless functionality across multiple devices is vital and great design is regarded as a given.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"WxtbfE\"\u003eFor me personally, Apple’s products no longer define milestone moments in my life like they once did. Over the past few years those spots have been taken by products made by Google, Nintendo, and Sony. I have no doubt that the designers of all of them were influenced by Ive in one way shape or form, but that doesn’t alter the fact that the only Apple products I own today are an old Apple TV and the laptop I was provided by \u003cem\u003eThe Verge\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"HRGar2\"\u003eI have moved on from Apple and I am looking to new brands for design inspiration. Maybe Jony decided to do the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"HTnyBR\"\u003e\u003cem\u003ePhotography by James Bareham / The Verge\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/29/19203188/jony-ive-influence-tech-design","published":"2019-06-29T17:00:00Z","guid":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/29/19203188/jony-ive-influence-tech-design"},{"title":"Former Equifax executive sentenced to prison for insider trading prior to data breach","content":"\u003cimg alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lhjh-Pikw6w9eVNoeg4nJv5XzYI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/64272933/acastro_170621_1777_0006_v4.0.jpg\" /\u003e\n\n\n  \u003cp id=\"o5MoR3\"\u003eThe \u003ca href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndga/pr/former-equifax-employee-sentenced-insider-trading\"\u003eJustice Department announced this week\u003c/a\u003e that former Equifax CIO Jun Ying has been sentenced to four months in prison for insider trading. He pled guilty earlier this year for for selling his stock in the company prior to the announcement that it had been hit with a \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/7/16270808/equifax-data-breach-us-identity-theft\"\u003emassive data breach in 2017\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"VjZdx7\"\u003eThe Security and Exchanges Commission \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/14/17119538/equifax-insider-trading-data-breach-charges\"\u003echarged Ying with insider trading last year\u003c/a\u003e. The Department of Justice says that in August 2017, after learning about the breach, he began researching the impact that a similar breach had on another company’s stock price. Later that morning, he promptly exercised and sold all of his stock options, earning nearly a million dollars from the sale. In doing so, he avoided a loss of $117,000 that he otherwise would have incurred when the company’s stock price dropped after the disclosure. More than 150 million people had their personal information leaked in the incident. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"zrGR6q\"\u003e“Ying thought of his own financial gain before the millions of people exposed in this data breach even knew they were victims,” U.S. Attorney Byung J. Pak said in the announcement. “He abused the trust placed in him and the senior position he held to profit from inside information.” The DOJ says that Ying is the second person found guilty for

depois, os procuradores do grupo \u003cstrong\u003eBD\u003c/strong\u003e começaram a se preocupar em como a nomeação de Moro serviria de munição para o PT contra a Lava Jato. “Acho que o PT deve estar em festa agora, para justificar todo o discurso deles”, escreveu Alan Mansur. Peterson de Paula Pereira, procurador da República no Distrito Federal, disse que a decisão de Moro mostrava como ele atuava contra o ex-presidente Lula: “Fica claro que ele tinha Lula como troféu”.

But James did have two positions from which he might try to influence Fox: as a board member of the parent companies of the network, and as his father’s son and possible successor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Times article implies that James was frustrated with Fox. The donations he has made with his wife appear to be a quiet rebuke of nearly everything Fox stands for — as the Times puts it, an effort to “neutralize” the political weapon that Fox had become. But that gets back to the heart of the critique of their philanthropy: Do they owe more than a sliver of their fortune to the public that has been damaged by the company that enriched them? Do they owe a fuller accounting of what they have done or failed to do?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChiara Cordelli, a professor of political science at the University of Chicago who has written about the ethics of philanthropy, believes that giving away tainted money should not necessarily be a silent act. “If my money comes from Fox News, and I want to use the money to promote causes that Fox News undermines, then I should at least publicly explain my rationale for doing that, and I should disavow Fox News’s views on those matters,” Cordelli said in an interview. “Otherwise it seems the donation is nothing else but a way to clean up a reputation.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoger Berkowitz, the academic director of the Hannah Arendt Center at Bard College, noted in an interview with The Intercept that Arendt offered, in her philosophical examinations of Germans under Hitler, a sharp critique of people who excused themselves as cogs in an evil system whose excesses they tried to quietly lessen from the inside. In an essay titled “\u003ca href=\"https://grattoncourses.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/responsibility-under-a-dictatorship-arendt.pdf\"\u003ePersonal Responsibility Under Dictatorship\u003c/a\u003e,” Arendt wrote that people who believed a system was evil yet decided to work for it should be asked, “[W]hy \u0026#8230; did you become a cog or continue to be a cog?” She added that unless they were actively conspiring to overturn the system, their participation was indefensible. Without the acquiescence of its cogs, Arendt observed, the system would not have been able to survive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe post \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\"

I rarely see videogames in Spanish. It\u0026rsquo;s understandable: English-speaking countries make up a significant portion of marketing demographics and sales for big-budget games. But even in the indie-sphere, where I do most of my trawling, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t finding much. I knew that this was an oversight on my part \u0026mdash; I live in a majority English-speaking country and the development circles I operate in are majority English-speaking, too. If I wasn\u0026rsquo;t finding Spanish language games, it\u0026rsquo;s because I wasn\u0026rsquo;t looking hard enough. So I set off on a week-long journey to find some stellar, free, Spanish indie games. They\u0026rsquo;re from several different countries, continents, and backgrounds. I hope you enjoy what I found.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/06/29/priceless-play-29-june-2019/#more-699465\" class=\"more-link\"\u003e\u003cspan aria-label=\"Continue reading Priceless Play \u0026ndash; 29 June 2019\"\u003e(more\u0026hellip;)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe post \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cloutwork.com/2019/06/29/priceless-play-29-june-2019/\"\u003ePriceless Play – 29 June 2019\u003c/a\u003e appeared first on \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cloutwork.com\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://cloutwork.com/2019/06/29/priceless-play-29-june-2019/","published":"2019-06-29T11:00:17Z","guid":"https://cloutwork.com/2019/06/29/priceless-play-29-june-2019/"},{"title":"How to shrink your carbon footprint when you travel","content":"\u003cimg width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://cloutwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/uploads252Fcard252Fimage252F1007954252F504562a2-400d-4c88-87a5-b4bf379b9375.jpg252F575x323__filters253Aquality2528802529-150x150.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" /\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" src=\"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1007954%252F504562a2-400d-4c88-87a5-b4bf379b9375.jpg%252F575x323__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=paZFLyAMNU3Km6okrShqKXDKaKk=\u0026amp;source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/share?via=Mashable\u0026amp;text=How+to+shrink+your+carbon+footprint+when+you+travel\u0026amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Farticle%2Fsustainable-travel\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Twitter\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://a.amz.mshcdn.com/assets/feed-tw-e71baf64f2ec58d01cd28f4e9ef6b2ce0370b42fbd965068e9e7b58be198fb13.jpg\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Farticle%2Fsustainable-travel\u0026amp;src=sp\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Facebook\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://a.amz.mshcdn.com/assets/feed-fb-8e3bd31e201ea65385a524ef67519d031e6851071807055648790d6a4ca77139.jpg\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I fly from New York City to Denver for the Fourth of July, I will be able to spend my time at cruising altitude reflecting on the fact that I\u0026#8217;ll be \u003ca href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/03/180319124258.htm\"\u003ehelping melt\u003c/a\u003e nearly 14,000 pounds of glacier ice, courtesy of the \u003ca href=\"https://www.icao.int/environmental-protection/CarbonOffset/Pages/default.aspx\"\u003e430 kilograms of carbon dioxide\u003c/a\u003e my trip will emit.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther than feel guilty or stay home,\u0026nbsp;what\u0026#8217;s a prospective traveler to do?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClearly staying home isn\u0026#8217;t good advice: In \u003ca href=\"https://www.wttc.org/\"\u003e2018, the tourism industry grew by 3.9 percent\u003c/a\u003e, and the sector is also responsible for \u003ca href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/tourism-responsible-for-8-of-global-greenhouse-gas-emissions-study-finds\"\u003e8 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions\u003c/a\u003e.
