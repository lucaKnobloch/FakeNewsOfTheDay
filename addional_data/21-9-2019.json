They say it would have taken Summit 3—an IBM-built machine that is the world\u0026#8217;s most powerful commercially-available conventional computer—about 10,000 years to perform the same task.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow do quantum computers work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eQuantum computers work by harnessing the properties of quantum mechanics. Classical computers process information in a binary format, called bits, which can represent either a 0 or 1. Quantum computers, in contrast, use logical units called quantum bits, or qubits for short, that can be put into a quantum state where they can simultaneously represent both 0 and 1.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhat\u0026#8217;s more, while the bits in a classical computer all operate independently from one another, in a quantum computer, the status of one qubit effects the status of all the other qubits in the system, so they can all work together to achieve a solution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThese two properties are what give quantum computers so much more potential power than conventional computers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut while a conventional computer outputs the same answer to a problem every time you run a calculation, the outputs of a quantum computer are probabilistic. That means it does not always produce the same answer. So to use a quantum computer, you have to run a calculation through the system thousands or even millions of times, and the array of outputs converge around the answer that is most likely to be correct.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the case of Google\u0026#8217;s research, the company used a new quantum processor, which it named Sycamore, that has 54 qubits (although one did not function properly, the researchers said, so only 53 were actually used in the experiment) which sampled the random number generating circuit it was testing some 1 million times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat\u0026#8217;s so special about Sycamore?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSycamore is not the world\u0026#8217;s largest quantum processor. Google itself had produced a 72 qubit system last year. And Rigetti, a California startup working on quantum computers, has said it plans to have a 128 qubit system ready soon.

Interestingly enough, most states in the middle of the country are actually not regulated at all. “At least half the states are silent on it, they don’t have a law,” Nealis says. “Usually, it gets worked out between the cleaner and the customer. Very few customers have the kind of nerve to come in after three years and ask about a dry cleaning order. That’s just a lot of chutzpah!” \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eCrystal Cleaning Center in San Mateo, Calif., has witnessed a whole lot of that chutzpah. Lynnette Watterson has been at the helm of the 56-year-old family business since 2005 (her mother owned and operated the space before that) and admits to being “very reluctant to get rid of people’s clothes. I have this false illusion that, eventually, they’ll show up.” So certain is she about a customer’s eventual return that she claims to not even be familiar with California’s laws concerning the matter. (Shops are required to print a notice on each invoice, explaining they won’t be responsible for any items left unclaimed after 30 days.) \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat modus operandi has led to some fabulous tales, becoming myths of a sort, at \u003ca href=\"https://www.crystalcleaningcenter.com/\"\u003eCrystal Cleaning Center\u003c/a\u003e, offering a glimpse into the human psyche and showcasing the ways individuals interact with and feel about their personal property.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTake the man who recently dropped off a $70 dry cleaning order and, after multiple calls, voicemails, emails, and text messages, finally called Watterson back to let her know that he had no plans on ever picking up his items. Irritated, the owner demanded to be paid. “I’m not usually that stern,” she says. “But he did give me a credit card number, and I’m donating his clothes [to charity].”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWatterson’s policies are not entirely about money. “I’m a really sentimental person,” she says before diving into the story of a middle-aged couple who walked into her shop roughly five years ago. They were “on a mission to find his mother’s wedding gown,” she recalls, describing the “distinctive” dress from the 1940s that she had been holding on to for eight years. The man’s mother had dropped off the gown but landed in assisted living before eventually passing and never claiming her dress. “They had been going from cleaner to cleaner all the way up the peninsula, and we had it,” Watterson says. “It was beautiful.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWatterson’s sentimentality becomes even more apparent when she forwards a poem that she had penned herself to send to customers as a pickup reminder: \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cpre class=\"wp-block-verse\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eI’ve been around the conveyor so many times, to say nothing of how often I’ve heard the door chimes.\u003cbr\u003eSo please come and get me as soon as you can, you can even drop off more cleaning: How’s that for a plan?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eYet dry cleaning is a business and, as such, financial matters do take center stage. “It’s a labor-intensive [job], and there is no upside to a cleaner having a whole lot of unclaimed garments,” says Nealis. What’s more: Abandoned items take up space that can’t be filled with other clothes. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eRobert Shapiro, general manager at \u003ca href=\"https://www.miltandediesdrycleaners.com/\"\u003eMilt \u0026amp; Edie’s Drycleaners \u0026amp; Tailoring Center\u003c/a\u003e in Burbank Calif.—a business that caters to “hundreds of celebrities” and is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week—reveals that the shop’s owners have invested in a warehouse space to store all their unclaimed items. “We keep it in the [shop] for three months and then in the warehouse for a year,” he explains. “If something looks expensive, we keep it indefinitely.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Photo-by-Celia-Michon-on-Unsplash.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2698362\" srcset=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Photo-by-Celia-Michon-on-Unsplash.jpg 5184w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Photo-by-Celia-Michon-on-Unsplash.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Photo-by-Celia-Michon-on-Unsplash.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Photo-by-Celia-Michon-on-Unsplash.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Photo-by-Celia-Michon-on-Unsplash.jpg?resize=1024,683 1024w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Photo-by-Celia-Michon-on-Unsplash.jpg?resize=281,187 281w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Photo-by-Celia-Michon-on-Unsplash.jpg?resize=755,503 755w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Photo-by-Celia-Michon-on-Unsplash.jpg?resize=100,67 100w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Photo-by-Celia-Michon-on-Unsplash.jpg?resize=60,40 60w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Photo-by-Celia-Michon-on-Unsplash.jpg?resize=154,103 154w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Photo-by-Celia-Michon-on-Unsplash.jpg?resize=591,394 591w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Photo-by-Celia-Michon-on-Unsplash.jpg?resize=392,261 392w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Photo-by-Celia-Michon-on-Unsplash.jpg?resize=252,168 252w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Photo-by-Celia-Michon-on-Unsplash.jpg?resize=697,465 697w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Photo-by-Celia-Michon-on-Unsplash.jpg?resize=234,156 234w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Photo-by-Celia-Michon-on-Unsplash.jpg?resize=500,333 500w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Photo-by-Celia-Michon-on-Unsplash.jpg?resize=578,385 578w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Photo-by-Celia-Michon-on-Unsplash.jpg?resize=600,400 600w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Photo-by-Celia-Michon-on-Unsplash.jpg?resize=90,60 90w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Photo-by-Celia-Michon-on-Unsplash.jpg?resize=185,123 185w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Photo-by-Celia-Michon-on-Unsplash.jpg?resize=115,77 115w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Photo-by-Celia-Michon-on-Unsplash.jpg?resize=738,492 738w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Photo-by-Celia-Michon-on-Unsplash.jpg?resize=777,518 777w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 5184px) 100vw, 5184px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eSome say a wedding gown is the most important garment a person will ever buy or wear.

Hennessy sources locally for its cognac, while for their Scotch, Bruichladdich and Kilchoman use Islay barley located not far from their distilleries. Gin makers are especially savvy about leaning on local: Germany’s Woodland Sauerland Gin features locally sourced spruce and dandelion root while Method and Madness Irish Gin incorporates local Irish gorse flower. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBeer, which is often mass-produced, lacks a similar reputation. But that’s changing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt Nashville-based Yazoo Brewing, Jones makes a beer called the Abeille, a saison that’s oak-aged for one year and then goes through a secondary fermentation with honey from beehives that Yazoo owns. Besides honey, the beer has notes of black pepper, wildflower, and pear. Each year, the taste varies a bit depending on the honey harvest. And Yazoo thinks that’s perfectly fine. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“You can taste the differences,” Jones says. “And you can create more nuance, complexity, and fun flavors.

First, cows are famously gassy and the methane they emit is a particularly potent greenhouse gas. Second, raising cows is by its very nature land-, food-, and water-intensive, because of what the cows themselves consume, and because it uses land that could otherwise grow plants or be reforested, creating the \u0026#8220;carbon sink\u0026#8221; necessary to offset emissions. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"wp-block-image\"\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"aligncenter\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1167369150.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2698893\" srcset=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1167369150.jpg 1024w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1167369150.jpg?resize=150,94 150w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1167369150.jpg?resize=300,188 300w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1167369150.jpg?resize=768,482 768w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1167369150.jpg?resize=281,176 281w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1167369150.jpg?resize=802,503 802w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1167369150.jpg?resize=100,63 100w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1167369150.jpg?resize=60,38 60w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1167369150.jpg?resize=154,97 154w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1167369150.jpg?resize=628,394 628w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1167369150.jpg?resize=392,246 392w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1167369150.jpg?resize=252,158 252w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1167369150.jpg?resize=697,437 697w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1167369150.jpg?resize=234,147 234w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1167369150.jpg?resize=500,313 500w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1167369150.jpg?resize=578,362 578w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1167369150.jpg?resize=600,376 600w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1167369150.jpg?resize=90,56 90w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1167369150.jpg?resize=96,60 96w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1167369150.jpg?resize=196,123 196w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1167369150.jpg?resize=115,72 115w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1167369150.jpg?resize=785,492 785w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1167369150.jpg?resize=826,518 826w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eA traditional \u0026#8220;cattle drive\u0026#8221; in southern Germany.

For example, sensors that track panting by cows individually—and as a herd—can manage barn ventilation and water cooling systems, Nestlé says.

And You Could Be Too","content":"\n\u003cp\u003eIn January 2019, Beyoncé Knowles’ company, Parkwood Entertainment, became the \u003ca href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/beyonces-parkwood-entertainment-sued-1172909\"\u003edefendant in a class-action lawsuit\u003c/a\u003e alleging that it violated the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The suit, filed by a blind woman from New York, claimed that the company’s website, Beyonce.com, did not provide accommodation for people with significant vision impairments, leaving an estimated 2 million blind people and others with vision impairments unable to access the primary portal for news about all things Bey.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eParkwood is far from alone. The ADA has been law for decades—it turns 30 in 2020—but it’s spurring a new wave of digital-era lawsuits. The civil rights law applies to businesses with 15 or more employees, including state and local governments,\u0026nbsp;and also applies to places of public accommodation. According to\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href=\"https://www.adatitleiii.com/2019/07/federal-ada-title-iii-lawsuit-numbers-continue-to-climb-in-2019/\"\u003ecalculations by the Chicago-based law firm Seyfarth Shaw\u003c/a\u003e, the first half of 2019 saw a 12% increase in ADA Title III lawsuits filed in federal court over the same time period in 2018 (5,592 vs. 4,965). The reason: Digital assets, primarily websites that are meant to serve the public, don\u0026#8217;t always offer accessibility features for people with disabilities.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e“Quite frankly, it’s become a cottage industry among\u0026nbsp;plaintiffs\u0026#8217; attorneys,\u0026#8221; says\u0026nbsp;Thomas Barton, an employment attorney at law firm Drinker Biddle \u0026amp; Reath LLP’s Philadelphia office. \u0026#8220;They will send out demand letters based on a publicly available website where they can run a pretty rudimentary test. It\u0026#8217;s almost never 100% compliant, even if the business makes attempts to make it compliant,” And the risk extends beyond websites to possibly include all digital assets—everything from email correspondence and social media to internal portals and even video games.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCompliance confusion\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBusinesses may not even realize their website bumps up against the ADA. “Until you’re exposed to this, you don\u0026#8217;t know what the challenges are,” says\u0026nbsp;Simon Dermer, CEO and co-Founder of eSSENTIAL Accessibility. Dermer\u0026#8217;s Toronto-based consulting firm helps businesses make their digital assets accessible to people with disabilities ranging from vision to hearing impairments, and provides adaptive technologies that can help people with physical disabilities navigate websites through webcams and other accommodations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“Compliance” may have different meanings, depending on whom you ask. Ideally, websites would meet Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), which is a set of technical specifications that improve the accessibility of web content, websites, and web applications on a variety of devices. The guidelines were developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3G), a global community of accessibility experts.\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/\"\u003eWCAG 2.1\u003c/a\u003e, the latest version of the guidelines, suggests enhancements that address the needs of people with a variety of disabilities, including vision, hearing, mobility, learning and cognition, and others.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut adhering to the in-depth accessibility guidelines WCAG recommends can be daunting, especially for small to midsized businesses (SMBs), says Philip Voluck, co-managing partner of the Pennsylvania offices of law firm Kaufman Dolowich \u0026amp; Voluck. “While the WCAG guidelines are very specific, you don’t know which should apply to a small company and which should apply to a Fortune 500 company,” he adds. “So, it becomes a reasonable accommodation analysis. What’s reasonable for this company to bring its website into compliance?”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eRecent presidential administrations don\u0026#8217;t agree on the issue. Under the Obama administration in 2010, the\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href=\"https://www.ada.gov/anprm2010/web%20anprm_2010.htm\"\u003eDepartment of Justice\u003c/a\u003e indicated that it would use its rule-making ability to amend the ADA to include websites and other digital assets. However, in 2017, the\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/12/26/2017-27510/nondiscrimination-on-the-basis-of-disability-notice-of-withdrawal-of-four-previously-announced\"\u003eTrump administration announced\u003c/a\u003e it was suspending previous guidance on the matter, as it reviewed whether such accommodation was necessary. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn June 2019, Domino’s—which is being sued by Guillarmo Robles, a blind man who says the website and the company’s mobile app are not accessible to people with vision impairments—\u003ca href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/18/18-1539/102950/20190613153319483_DominosPetition.pdf\"\u003epetitioned the U.S. Supreme Court\u003c/a\u003e to overturn a lower court decision that ruled the website was essentially a place of public accommodation under Title III of the ADA and required to be accessible to people with disabilities. Overhauling the digital assets of its website would be costly and Domino\u0026#8217;s petition argues that the government has not issued definitive guidance to determine what would need to be done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eProtecting your business\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo, what is a well-intentioned business to do? There are some basics that are widely accepted. Websites need text and audio options, such as screen readers. Images should be coupled with text descriptions of their contents that can be read by the user or a screen reader. Contrast should be sharp so content can be read easily and flashing features, which can trigger seizures, should be avoided. Users should be able to navigate the website with peripheral tools such as a keyboard or webcam.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eLlike so many thorny issues of today, solutions may come courtesy of artificial intelligence and A.I.-powered tools. \u003ca href=\"https://intercom.help/ava/en/articles/1586885-ava-helps-you-be-ada-compliant\"\u003eAva\u003c/a\u003e, which builds accessibility tools including live subtitles for conversations, claims their solutions help make websites ADA compliant. Other companies, including \u003ca href=\"https://accessibe.com/\"\u003eAccessibe \u003c/a\u003eand\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href=\"https://www.equalweb.com/\"\u003eEqualweb \u003c/a\u003esay they also help bring businesses in compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA level standards and the European Union Standard EN 301549, which outlines access requirements for people with disabilities in the EU. \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/fortune500/microsoft-25/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMicrosoft\u003c/a\u003e also has an accessibility\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/ai-for-accessibility\"\u003egrant program\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut true accessibility goes much deeper than basic design or supplementary apps, says consultant Edward Wald. “You cannot simply address accessibility on top of existing application code and expect the issues to be fixed,” he says. It starts with the wireframe and extends to how the site or app is coded. Accessibility incorporates everything from how the copy is written and the site designed to how it is tested for various users’ experiences, he says.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor now, businesses are largely on their own in figuring out how best to proceed and where to invest. Consultants like Dermer and legal experts like Voluck and Barton agree that it’s usually a good idea to err on the side of inclusiveness to the extent possible. By making your digital properties more accessible, you may protect your website from litigation and make it easier for the\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2018/p0816-disability.html\"\u003eroughly one in four U.S. adults\u003c/a\u003e who live with a disability to do business with you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“Basically, every other visitor to your website either has a disability or they\u0026#8217;re close to someone, have an emotional connection to someone that they know, with a disability.

However, depending on your budget and sartorial demands (for work, weddings, black-tie events, etc.), it is very possible that Rent the Runway could actually save you money in the long run. The company cites internal statistics that 89% of its members report shopping less with a subscription to fashion.

At that rate, subscribers can select up to four items (and more at additional cost) to rent at a time, with the freedom to send back and swap any or all items at their leisure throughout the following four weeks. That includes access to inventory from more than 600 designers, including Jason Wu, Diane von Furstenberg (one of the first investors in the company), Tory Burch, and Theory. That also means say goodbye to the constrictions of the four-day or eight-day rental periods. You also don’t have to worry about the rental price tag on each individual item. The $159 payment is all-inclusive for your rentals, shipping \u0026amp; handling, taxes, and dry cleaning. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;Unlimited launched 2016 out of direct feedback from our customers that they wanted more ways to wear and engage with RTR,\u0026#8221; a Rent the Runway spokesperson says. \u0026#8220;We launched by offering something special to wear for one occasion and have moved to every occasion: work, weekend, vacation and everything in between. In fact, casual items like skirts, pants, and denim have had the highest year-over-year growth in rentals (+136%), driven by denim (representing over 30% of bottoms across all shapes).\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAside from Unlimited, there is also the RTR “\u003ca href=\"https://www.renttherunway.com/update?action=click_unlimitedlp\"\u003eUpdate\u003c/a\u003e” plan for $89 per month, which is similar to Unlimited except subscribers get four items per month and can’t swap until the next month.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t run into trouble until my last round of swapping items after trying out both the Unlimited and Update plans. Roughly 72 hours after I placed my order for the Update trial, I received a brief email message—near midnight ET, so well after business hours—from a customer service agent saying that one of my items wouldn’t be shipping after all, without any explanation given. I was instructed to pick out a new item, which I did immediately as I was planning to travel within a few days and was expecting to have the clothes I picked out ready to take with me. Eventually, I did end up with my order in the nick of time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAfter I filed a report with customer service over the incident—and several subsequent rounds of emails back and forth, trying to go over what had happened—I was offered a complimentary additional month of service to make up for the first month.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“Rent the Runway also has a number of issues with shipments—you have a limited window to make the shipment back, and it’s difficult to plan last-minute or if you’re on a tight schedule,” Kodali notes. “It’s quite a bit of work and stress.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1147850630.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2699074\" srcset=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1147850630.jpg 1024w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1147850630.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1147850630.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1147850630.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1147850630.jpg?resize=281,187 281w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1147850630.jpg?resize=754,503 754w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1147850630.jpg?resize=100,67 100w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1147850630.jpg?resize=60,40 60w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1147850630.jpg?resize=154,103 154w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1147850630.jpg?resize=591,394 591w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1147850630.jpg?resize=392,261 392w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1147850630.jpg?resize=252,168 252w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1147850630.jpg?resize=697,465 697w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1147850630.jpg?resize=234,156 234w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1147850630.jpg?resize=500,333 500w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1147850630.jpg?resize=578,385 578w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1147850630.jpg?resize=600,400 600w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1147850630.jpg?resize=90,60 90w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1147850630.jpg?resize=184,123 184w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1147850630.jpg?resize=115,77 115w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1147850630.jpg?resize=738,492 738w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1147850630.jpg?resize=777,518 777w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eShoppers look through racks during the launch of Rent the Runway’s West Coast flagship store on May 8, 2019, in San Francisco.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"image-credit\"\u003eKelly Sullivan/Getty Images for Rent the Runway\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s also questionable how long such a business model can last.

But unless there is an exit for Rent the Runway, the more that others understand the economics of the model, the less good it is for a DTC [direct-to-consumer] company in the space.

After all, there’s no time limit on Unlimited items as long as you’re an active, paying subscriber. (You can pause your subscription from month to month, at no charge, for months when you might not want to participate.

Meanwhile, in a world where they don’t obsess over breathless news reports minute-by-minute, consumer confidence from the Conference Board in August came in at 131, close to matching the previous month’s 135.7, and not too far off last October’s 137.9, an 18-year high. And last Friday, the University of Michigan’s measure on consumer sentiment rose to 92, from 89.8 in August. And even as the Fed was lowering interest rates by 25 basis points, housing starts in August (released this week) were hitting a 12-year high.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“At least for the time being consumers seem to be shrugging off some of the negative news we’ve been seeing,” says Lynn Franco, Sr. Director of Economic Indicators at the Conference Board. “Fundamentals are supporting job growth and income growth, which is their first-hand experience.” In fact, consumer spending was the economy’s primary source of fuel in the second quarter. At 4.7%, it was the fastest pace in four years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut, of course, things could change in the coming months, especially if the global economy continues to slow. “If headlines continue to predict a recession by citing yield curve inversion and other indicators, eventually it could become a self-fulfilling prophecy,” says David Kudla, CEO \u0026amp; Chief Investment Officer at Mainstay Capital Management. “U.S. manufacturing is already in recession,” says Kudla, “with the risk that the weakness may become more widespread. It’s also very likely that the impact of \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/09/11/is-recession-coming-us-manufacturing-trump-country/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"the tariffs will finally bleed over into Main Street (opens in a new tab)\"\u003ethe tariffs will finally bleed over into Main Street\u003c/a\u003e and cause a change in consumer spending habits.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eA change in spending habits could affect the very fundamentals that drive the economy. “When you see the stock market volatility or the stock market selling off, you see individuals get more concerned,” says James Russo, President and Chief Market Strategist at Altrius Capital Management. “They might not go out and buy that boat or new house, and small businesses may not hire those new workers when they are concerned about the future.” That could lead to a slowing economy, followed by layoffs, followed by less spending, and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnother concern on Wall Street is that after ten years, this expansion is getting a bit long in the tooth. But Robert Shiller, Sterling Professor of Economics at Yale, says you can\u0026#8217;t just look at a calendar. “Business fluctuations are more irregular than this thinking would suggest. I like to think of economic fluctuations as something rather more like random epidemics that break out from time to time.” Shiller does believe, however, that the stories we tell ourselves can have economic consequences. He talks about the phenomenon in his new book, \u003cem\u003eNarrative Economics: How Stories Go Viral and Drive Major Economic Events\u003c/em\u003e. But that doesn\u0026#8217;t mean recession is imminent. “There is a question whether the current expansion is overdue to end. In my view, this view predicts an end of the expansion soon only if the narrative about the business cycle of fixed length is currently active. I don\u0026#8217;t see much evidence that the broad public is fixated on such a narrative now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Conference Board’s Franco agrees. “We would start to see consumers pull back in the big-ticket item purchases, but we’re not seeing that right now. And\u0026nbsp;consumers are very good at forecasting recessions\u0026nbsp;” In fact, better than Wall Street. “Wall Street always has a different perspective. With our CEO survey, they’re much more pessimistic than consumers.\u0026#8221; Perhaps the crucial point from Franco is that consumer confidence measures consumers’ \u003cem\u003ewillingness\u003c/em\u003e to spend, but not necessarily their \u003cem\u003eability\u003c/em\u003e to spend. That comes from wages and income. \u0026#8220;Right now there is a high willingness to spend. That will probably change when there’s a hit to their ability to spend.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo as the yield curve inverts, the manufacturing sector weakens, and \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/08/28/understanding-recent-stock-market-volatility/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"the stock market fluctuates (opens in a new tab)\"\u003ethe stock market fluctuates\u003c/a\u003e between “head for the hills” and “we’re going to hit new highs,” consumer confidence continues to move sideways at historically high levels. If the business media are talking us into a recession, so far the consumer isn’t listening.

The manipulated photo was shared widely in posts on Facebook and Twitter last week with captions implying that the women were proud to wear the shirts in support of President Donald Trump. Gerri McDaniel, who is pictured, told the AP the photo was taken at a hotel on July 17 before the women went to a Trump rally in Greenville, North Carolina. McDaniel said she and the other women often wear their Trump girl T-shirts when they attend events in support of the president.

Some of the inaccurate posts also blame Somali gangs for an increase in downtown robberies. Elder said that accusation is also untrue. Police said a total of 18 people have been charged in connection with two violent attacks in downtown Minneapolis, including the one on Aug. 3. In the second case, a man told police that on Aug. 17 he was surrounded by a group who kicked and punched him in an attempt to take his wallet. \u0026#8220;There is no indication that any of the suspects were of Somali descent,\u0026#8221; Elder told the AP.

The photo with the false caption circulated on social media after President Donald Trump nominated Haspel as CIA director in 2018 and re-emerged on Facebook last week. The photo has been used with articles, including a 2008 story in The New Yorker, where Harman was named as the source. The photo is similar to ones the AP obtained of Harman posing next to inmates at Abu Ghraib. In one of those, Harman wears a beanie as she smiles and gives a thumbs-up next to a bleeding detainee. The photos of Harman and other soldiers were leaked in 2004 during President George W. Bush\u0026#8217;s re-election campaign. They sparked international outcry over human rights abuses faced by the inmates. Harman was convicted in 2005 on several counts of mistreating detainees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eMore must-read stories from \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—\u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/09/20/new-york-statute-of-limitations-rape/\"\u003eNew York’s rape laws\u003c/a\u003e are now some of the toughest in the nation.

For Driscoll’s and other farm-related businesses that rely on the H-2A visa program for temporary agricultural workers, a last-minute delay of a few weeks means significant losses. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“The rules are not very flexible, it’s cumbersome, it’s kind of expensive, and it doesn’t reflect the reality of what happens on a farm,” Bjorn said of the H-2A, arguing it needs to be more malleable to meet the needs of both workers and employers.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“So the workforce shows up for harvest, but they have nothing to do. You still have to pay them if you brought them in from outside the country, and that quickly becomes not affordable … The growers we have today that have taken the step to do H-2As are at a significant economic disadvantage.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eImmigration reform proposals have sprouted from the hopeful mouths of presidents and legislators for more than a decade only to wither and die on Capitol Hill. Meanwhile, U.S. corporations have watched troubling indicators for the immigrant workforce continue unabated. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn early September, following a 2019 trend of corporations taking a more public stance on political issues, numerous companies organized by the National Immigration Forum signed on to a “New American Workforce” public letter promoting immigrant integration, including citizenship drives and English courses, policy support, and community services. Additionally, a half dozen—Driscoll’s, \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/fortune500/walmart-1/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWalmart\u003c/a\u003e, Chobani, Lyft, Uber, and Ben and Jerry’s—have formed an immigration corporate roundtable advocating for a joint platform. The roundtable is made up of a broad group of large U.S. corporations by design. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“The diversity of industry and diversity of skill levels included is a powerful representation of the value of the immigrant workforce,” said Jennie Murray, director of integration programs at the National Immigration Forum. “The topline message is when the immigrant workforce has the skills, status, and opportunity to reach their fullest potential, we all thrive.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2018, there were more than 28 million foreign-born workers in the United States, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, constituting 17% of the U.S. labor force. In industries such as agriculture, service, maintenance, and construction, foreign-born labor makes up anywhere from a quarter to half of the workers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“This is a topic where you need allies—you need a lot of people to accomplish something. It is politically highly complex and not that easy to solve,” Bjorn said.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“The foreign born [agricultural] workforce is shrinking in size and there aren’t so many clear solutions on the table today for where that workforce is going to come from in the future. This is a significant threat to our business, and any U.S. company in the fresh fruit and vegetable business.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt has already been a significant year for corporations taking stock of the political climate and wading into issues once kept at a distance. Walmart introduced new policies on ammunition sales and open carry in its stores, as did several other retailers, after the mid-summer string of mass shootings.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn August, the Business Roundtable, a lobbying group of CEOs, redefined its mission to include balancing the needs of employees, suppliers and communities with the formerly singular drive to maximize profits for shareholders. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“Corporate America is seeing that congress is unable to act, and the administration is heading in a direction they are not comfortable with when it comes to immigration,” Murray said, pointing to several programs on the administration chopping block such as refugee resettlement, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, and Temporary Protected Status, being met with few proposals for strengthening the pipeline of immigrant talent. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBjorn emphasized Driscoll’s had been considering taking a more proactive stance on immigration for years, and joining the roundtable was not a response to President Donald Trump. Taking a more public stance, they hope to avoid policies myopically focused on enforcement and one time solutions that avoid addressing the underlying issues.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“We can’t start with E-verify, eliminate the workforce, and then start working on other pieces,” Bjorn said. “We need it to be comprehensive. We need a workforce that is legal and documented. The small business farmer growing a crop would much prefer his workforce be fully documented”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBjorn, himself a native of Denmark currently in the process of getting his U.S. citizenship, said Driscoll’s will be working on a consensus agenda with the other roundtable members, several of which have executives who are intimately familiar with the U.S. immigration system. Roundtable co-chair Chobani’s CEO Hamid Ulukaya, for example, emigrated from Turkey. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“We know that our business, as well as our communities and our country, are stronger when people of all identities are given opportunity and access.

I think it’s pretty clear that if we want a thriving economy in this country we need the immigrant workforce to be a significant participant.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eMore must-read stories from \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—\u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/09/20/new-york-statute-of-limitations-rape/\"\u003eNew York’s rape laws\u003c/a\u003e are now some of the toughest in the nation.

I’ve followed their retail offerings, including Cotton Citizen, which was on-site for six months. Later, I connected with a real estate broker in our Nolita store who represents the ownership at 11 Howard, and we discussed the spaces he had to offer.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe retail space at 11 Howard proved to be an ideal fit. With its lobby and on-street location, there is lots of exposure to hotel guests and passersby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s a small space and easy to grow into and manage with a team of five employees,” he said. “The best thing is the door to the street and double doors that enter the lobby. We are the only thing seen in the lobby. The hotel experience starts on the second floor. With 240 guestrooms and a great customer demographic, it’s a great location. We’re right in between some of the best consumer brands in the area. In terms of longevity, we’re here for a three-year booking and we hope to expand past that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Naked experience is collaborative. According to Kerzner, it’s the company’s bread and butter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We really focus on curation. In our opinion, getting a brand to pay a lot of money to be in the space is not the end goal. We can handle a little bit of financing in the short term to grow our business,” he said. “We seek out unique brands and initiatives that our consumer and general consumer would like to discover. In terms of discovery, we’re good at curating big and small brands. We’ve got Bang and Olufsen in our Nolita space coupled with newer cannabidiol (CBD) brands and a medispa for a facial. It’s a good mix.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKerzner is also aware of competitors and strive to ensure consumers can understand and appreciate an individual brand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Our sweet spot is not putting too many brands in the collaborative space. Other concepts are packing in a lot of brands into one section,” he said. “You’ll walk into a 2,000 sq. ft. space and see eight brands while competitors might have 50 brands. We’re all about brand, product and concept education. When consumers walk into our store, they appreciate the knowledge our associates have; it’s very different from a general retail setting, which is missing out on brand education and storytelling.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the hospitality sector, Kerzner and the team plan to expand to other hotels. “We’re interested in boutique properties or potentially going to a larger chain to help us grow and scale,” he said. “With the expansion, we don’t want to sacrifice quality or cheapen the retail experience.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe post \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.hotelbusiness.com/inside-11-howard-retail-is-an-innovative-experience/\"\u003eInside 11 Howard, Retail is an Innovative Experience\u003c/a\u003e appeared first on \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.hotelbusiness.com\"\u003eHotel Business\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://www.hotelbusiness.com/inside-11-howard-retail-is-an-innovative-experience/","published":"2019-09-21T13:00:25Z","guid":"https://www.hotelbusiness.com/?p=188340"},{"title":"When Purpose \u0026 Culture Are in Alignment","content":"\u003cp\u003eThis is our annual owners and developers issue. And, as always, we ranked the top owners and developers based on the surveys submitted to \u003cem\u003eHotel Business\u003c/em\u003e. If you missed your chance to be on this list, you have another one: Go to \u003ca href=\"https://www.hotelbusiness.com/surveys/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ehotelbusiness.com\u003c/a\u003e and fill out a survey for our annual Green Book, which publishes in December. We’ll send out e-blasts and post on social media to remind you, as we always do, as the time draws closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition to this issue’s ranked list, we also profile five of the companies who place on our list: Atma Hotel Group (p. 16), True North Hotel Group (p. 18), AWH Partners (p. 27) and Sandpiper Hospitality (p. 28), as well as our cover story, Strand Hospitality Services (p. 32), which is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year. Hey, Strand is in good company with Woodstock and a man on the moon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the focus of our survey and, in part, our profiles speaks to the numbers we’re all interested in—how many rooms, how many properties, how much is in the pipeline, etc.—it’s the stories of the companies, their origins, philosophies, cultures that speak to their success and give some color to the black-and-white chart we run in this issue, and the many we print in the Green Book. The hotel industry is one very much focused on data—as it should be—but, at the same time, is one focused on people because, after all, it is the hospitality industry. How many times have you heard that? Said that? And “people” doesn’t just translate to guests or coworkers. No, in hospitality, it goes beyond the front door and beyond the boardroom, and into the community at large. In fact, here’s the first definition that popped up when I Googled the word: the friendly and generous reception and entertainment of guests, visitors or strangers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"embed-vimeo\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003ciframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/361130400\" width=\"702\" height=\"395\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eHotel Business\u003c/em\u003e recently held a roundtable in Columbus, OH, hosted and sponsored by one of the companies on our annual list: Rockbridge. The roundtable was held in conjunction with Rockbridge RTRX, an annual event with the tagline “Inspire curiosity. Ignite conversation. Enable meaningful action.” Impactful words, for sure. And ones that promote purpose. The annual event attracts business leaders and visionaries from across various industries and disciplines who convene to connect with each other, advance optimism and accelerate funding for innovative cancer research. And Rockbridge has raised more than $4 million since 2011.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut rather than discuss topics that are important, yes, but more typical at \u003cem\u003eHotel Business\u003c/em\u003e roundtable events—economic climate, brand segmentation, market health—Rockbridge chose for this roundtable to focus on social enterprise and philanthropy, a topic that aligns with its RTRX initiative.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn impressive group of industry leaders, including Rockbridge’s CEO Jim Merkel, Vesta’s Rick Takach, Davidson’s John Belden and HVMG’s Robert Cole, among other executives from Hilton, Aimbridge, Interstate, Hyatt and Wells Fargo, gathered to share insight and stories about hospitality—helpfulness, generosity, warmth—and how it is critical to the very fabric of their respective organizations and to the people who staff them. And these days, it goes beyond raising money and writing a check. That’s old-school “giving back.” The evolution of social conscience, so to speak, has changed the way companies do business. It’s not just business, it’s responsible business. And that means getting involved. And better yet, the roundtable participants all agree: Working together on a social cause not only helps that cause and those people, it helps define your company and its culture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ll sum it up by ending with what I think is, perhaps, my favorite quote from the executive roundtable. And the credit goes to Jon Witter at Hilton: “We have talked about purpose. We have talked about culture. All of those things are critical to building an engaged workforce that is willing to bring their whole selves to work every day to deliver more than just a product, but to deliver the types of experiences we all talk about.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe post \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.hotelbusiness.com/when-purpose-culture-are-in-alignment/\"\u003eWhen Purpose \u0026#038; Culture Are in Alignment\u003c/a\u003e appeared first on \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.hotelbusiness.com\"\u003eHotel Business\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://www.hotelbusiness.com/when-purpose-culture-are-in-alignment/","published":"2019-09-21T13:00:02Z","guid":"https://www.hotelbusiness.com/?p=188415"},{"title":"Graduate Hotels, Scholly Team Up to Tackle Student, Alumni Debt","content":"\u003cp\u003eNATIONAL REPORT—Graduate Hotels has partnered with scholarship search app Scholly to give back to the college towns in which its properties reside with the intent to provide $150,000 of student and alumni debt relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is an incredibly important cause that our team has been eager to support since the founding of Graduate. This marks the beginning of an ongoing effort on behalf of the Graduate Hotels brand to provide student loan relief,” said Julie Saunders, chief marketing officer, Graduate Hotels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDebt relief is a hot-button topic and it’s an issue that hits close to home for the team at Graduate Hotels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“At Graduate Hotels our motto is ‘We are all students.’ We are thrilled to team up with Scholly and offer guests and visitors the opportunity to give back to students and alumni in need of aid,” said Saunders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScholly started as an easy way to find scholarships for college and has evolved into much more. A Scholly membership includes access to its platform of tools designed to help support the student before, during and after college. Parents and other academic professionals can use Scholly to help support their students, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Scholly received the nation’s attention and adoration when it was featured on the ABC television show \u003cem\u003eShark Tank\u003c/em\u003e, landing a deal with entrepreneurs Daymond John and Lori Greiner while sparking the biggest fight in Shark Tank history,” said Scholly CEO Christopher Gray. “Shortly thereafter, Scholly grew to be the number-one overall app in both the iOS App Store and the Google Play Store for more than three weeks. As of September, the app reached more than three million registered users and helped countless students and families to raise more than $100 million in scholarship money to go to the colleges of their dreams.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmericans owed about $1.5 trillion in student loans at the end of March, more than two times what they owed a decade earlier, according to Scholly. “The increase has come as historically high shares of young adults in the United States go to college and the cost of higher education increases,” said Gray.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe team at Graduate Hotels is tapping local university communities to help fundraise for this effort, and they’re using creative ways to reach their goal of supporting students and alumni in need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Our hotels are located in dynamic, university-anchored communities across the country,” said Saunders. “We are tapping each of our markets and asking for their help as we aim to provide relief. From workout classes to offering guests the chance to donate upon checkout, we have created simple and accessible ways for everyone, from students to hotel guests, to give back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The bottom line is that paying for college is hard. There is free money for college out there waiting to be won, and Scholly helps that money find you,” said Gray.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a Scholly member, students will gain access to all of Scholly’s products. Scholly Search, Editor and Math work together to help students thrive at every stage of their academic journey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The app\u0026#8217;s adaptive scholarship matching engine, Scholly Search, will connect students with scholarships tailored just for them,” said Gray. “Scholly Search turns the process of finding money for college from months into minutes. Scholly Editor, an artificial intelligence-powered personal writing assistant, will instantly proofread and improve any piece of writing, including the student scholarship essays, resumes, homework and more. Scholly Math, a powerful AI math solver, instantly interprets and solves any math problem, providing clear, step-by-step instructions for how to get the answer.”\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray believes more can be done to provide financial relief to students and alumni dealing with educational loan debt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Graduate Hotels showed its enthusiasm and commitment to students and alumni, raising awareness to a major problem the United States is facing: student debts,” said Gray. “We are confident that we can achieve more and would love to partner with other hospitality leaders to continue changing lives, and start a social-impact movement where capital can be allocated for good.

Now, before anyone goes over-thinking this, it doesn\u0026#8217;t necessarily mean our Game of the Week pick is the highest scoring game in a review, the game with the best graphics, or really any other quantifiable \u0026#8220;best\" thing. Instead, it\u0026#8217;s more just us picking out the single game out of the week\u0026#8217;s releases that we think is the most noteworthy, surprising, interesting, or really any other hard to describe quality that makes it worth having if you were just going to pick up \u003cem\u003eone\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese picks might be controversial, and that\u0026#8217;s OK.

It\u0026#8217;s a game that\u0026#8217;s actually been available on desktop and Android for a couple of years already, and has developed a fan base with those versions, but this week it\u0026#8217;s iOS users who finally get a chance to see what it\u0026#8217;s all about. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/626x0w-33.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"462\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-258680\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/626x0w-33.jpg 1000w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/626x0w-33-300x139.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/626x0w-33-768x355.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eUndervault\u003c/em\u003e is a pretty standard roguelike dungeon crawler, but with a pretty nonstandard board game-style layout. This means you\u0026#8217;re moving from room to room as if they\u0026#8217;re cards laid out on a table, and in each type of room you\u0026#8217;ll explore to find items or fight with some enemies. Occasionally you\u0026#8217;ll come across an unknown room and here you\u0026#8217;ll actually spin a wheel to see what type of room materializes there. You can find cards that can guarantee certain types of rooms, and what type of room you\u0026#8217;re able to create in these unknown spaces is actually very key to doing well as you move deeper and deeper into the dungeon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"clear:both;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"video-responsive\"\u003e\n\t\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/M531mEVI8_U\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026#8217;re the type of person that enjoys traditional roguelike games where it\u0026#8217;s all about finding random items and making the best of whatever hand you\u0026#8217;re dealt each time you play, I think you\u0026#8217;ll enjoy the unique spin on the formula that \u003cem\u003eUndervault\u003c/em\u003e presents. It\u0026#8217;s not much to look at but it does have a certain kind of charm and it\u0026#8217;s got the gameplay chops where it counts.

Now in the Hot Zone for Impeachment","content":"\u003cp\u003eFew Democratic leaders have seemed less eager to impeach President Donald Trump than House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. She’s warned that the public doesn’t want it and the Senate would never go for it. But a rolling series of disclosures may force her to recalculate the politics. A \u003ca href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-defends-conversation-with-ukraine-leader-11568993176\"\u003ereport in \u003cem\u003eThe\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-defends-conversation-with-ukraine-leader-11568993176\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e Wall Street Journal\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e today, quickly confirmed by other major outlets, introduced an explosive new twist to a story that already had the trappings of one of the biggest threats yet to Trump’s presidency. The fresh details about Trump’s apparent effort to strong-arm Ukraine into investigating his political rival Joe Biden may have irreversibly pushed the president into the impeachment hot zone.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAccording to the \u003cem\u003eJournal\u003c/em\u003e, in a phone call in July, Trump pressed Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to investigate Biden’s son Hunter. Over and over, Trump urged Zelensky to work in tandem with his lawyer and confidant Rudy Giuliani, who has publicly accused Joe Biden of trying to interfere in the investigation of a Ukrainian gas company, on whose board Hunter Biden sat. (A Ukrainian official said there was no wrongdoing, the \u003cem\u003eJournal\u003c/em\u003e reported.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLittle Trump says has the power to shock anymore, but his alleged behavior in this instance is head-spinning. It suggests that whatever the fallout for America’s standing in the world, he is willing to use his office as a weapon to damage the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, the man he could well face in a 2020 general election. It shows that, at some fundamental level, he may not grasp his responsibilities as head of state and the innate patriotism the role requires. The nation’s interests and Trump’s immediate political needs are supposed to be separate. In his mind, they may seem one and the same.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll this could reinvigorate an impeachment drive that has appeared to be sputtering. A good chunk of Pelosi’s caucus was already chafing at her reluctance to push forward. The Ukraine episode will inevitably create a new front in the oversight wars, with Congress demanding to see transcripts of exactly what Trump has been saying in these calls. This wasn’t an incident from two or three years ago that Congress has obsessed over; this was in \u003cem\u003eJuly\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTalking to reporters in the Oval Office today, Trump didn’t dispute that he had spoken to his Ukrainian counterpart about Biden. Indeed, in reference to Biden’s attempts as vice president to get Ukraine’s chief prosecutor fired, Trump said, “Somebody ought to look into that.” (Biden wanted the prosecutor, who had at one time investigated the gas company, dismissed from his office as part of a broader push against corruption in Ukraine.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf Trump’s call for Ukraine’s assistance sounds familiar, it should. During the 2016 election, he called on Russia to unearth emails missing from his rival Hillary Clinton’s computer server. He made that plea in public, during a press conference, but it now seems an eerie foreshadow of the Ukraine request. “Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you find the 30,000 emails that are missing,” Trump said.

The Mueller Report revealed despicably unpatriotic behavior by Trump and his minions, but it did not trigger a political judgment with a majority of Americans that it warranted impeachment. The Democrats, for their part, remained unwilling to risk their new majority in Congress on a move destined to fail in a Republican-controlled Senate.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow, however, we face an entirely new situation. In a call to the new president of Ukraine, Trump reportedly attempted to pressure the leader of a sovereign state into conducting an investigation – a witch hunt, one might call it – of a U.S. citizen, former Vice President Joe Biden, and his son, Hunter Biden.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs \u003ca href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/ukraine-is-ready-to-investigate-bidens-sonbut-only-if-theres-an-official-us-request\"\u003eUkrainian Interior Ministry official Anton Geraschenko told\u003c/a\u003e \u003cem\u003eThe Daily Beast \u003c/em\u003ewhen asked about the president’s apparent requests: “Clearly, Trump is now looking for \u003cem\u003ekompromat\u003c/em\u003e to discredit his opponent Biden, to take revenge for his friend Paul Manafort, who is serving seven years in prison.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eClearly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf this, in itself, is not impeachable, then the concept has no meaning. Trump’s grubby commandeering of the presidency’s fearsome and nearly uncheckable powers in foreign policy for his own ends is a gross abuse of power and an affront both to our constitutional order and to the integrity of our elections.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe story may even be worse than we know. If Trump tried to use military aid to Ukraine as leverage, as reporters are now investigating, then he held Ukrainian and American security hostage to his political vendettas. It means nothing to say that no such deal was reached; the important point is that Trump abused his position in the Oval Office.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn this matter, we need not rely on a newspaper account, nor even on the complaint, so far unseen, of a whistleblower. Instead, we have a sweaty, panicked admission on national television by Trump’s bizarre homunculus, Rudy Giuliani, that he did in fact seek such an investigation on Trump’s behalf. Giuliani later again confirmed Trump’s role, tweeting that a “President telling a Pres-elect of a well known corrupt country he better investigate corruption that affects US is doing his job.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLet us try, as we always find ourselves doing in the age of Trump, to think about how Americans might react if this happened in any other administration. Imagine, for example, if Bill Clinton had called his friend, Russian President Boris Yeltsin, in 1996, and asked him to investigate Bob Dole. Or if George W. Bush had called, say, President Vincente Fox of Mexico in 2004 and asked him – indeed, asked him \u003cem\u003eeight times\u003c/em\u003e, according to the \u003cem\u003eWall Street Journal \u003c/em\u003e- to open a case against John Kerry. Clinton, of course, was eventually impeached for far less than that. Is there any doubt that either man would have been put on trial in the Senate, and likely chased from office?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Republicans, predictably, have decided to choose their party over their country, and the damage control and lying have begun. \u003ca href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/09/20/trump-allies-jolt-into-action-to-deflect-ukraine-whistleblower-scandal-1506882\"\u003eSenator Josh Hawley of Missouri, for one\u003c/a\u003e, has already floated the reliable “deep state attack” nonsense that will play well on Fox and other conservative outlets. And while Giuliani did Trump no favors with his incoherent ranting on CNN, he did manage to hammer away at the idea that Biden, and not Trump, tried to shake down the Ukrainians while he was vice president.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe problem for Giuliani, the Republicans, and the president himself, however, is that Biden and his actions are now irrelevant to the offenses committed by Trump. The \u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/05/23/fact-checking-president-trumps-wild-jabs-joe-biden/\"\u003eaccusations against Biden are false\u003c/a\u003e, as we know from multiple fact checks and from the Ukrainians themselves (which is why I won’t deign to repeat them here). But even to argue over this fable about Biden is to miss the point, because it changes nothing about Trump’s attempts to enmesh Biden in a foreign investigation for Trump’s own purposes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere is no spin, no deflection, no alternate theory of the case that can get around the central fact that President Trump attempted to use his office for his own gain, and that he put the foreign policy and the national security of the United States at risk while doing so. He ignored his duty as the commander in chief by intentionally trying to place an American citizen in jeopardy with a foreign government. He abandoned his obligations to the Constitution by elevating his own interests over the national interest. By comparison, Watergate was a complicated judgment call.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn a better time and in a better country, Republicans would now join with Democrats and press for Trump’s impeachment. This won’t happen, of course; even many of Biden’s competitors for the presidency seem to be keeping their distance from this mess, perhaps in the hope that Biden and Trump will engage in a kind of mutually assured political destruction. (Elizabeth Warren, for one, \u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trumps-ukraine-scandal-may-also-hurt-bidens-campaign/2019/09/20/772aaba0-dbe6-11e9-ac63-3016711543fe_story.html\"\u003erenewed her call for impeachment – but without mentioning Biden\u003c/a\u003e.) This is to their shame. The Democratic candidates should now unite around a call for an impeachment investigation, not for Biden’s sake, but to protect the sanctity of our elections from a predatory president who has made it clear he will stop at nothing to stay in the White House.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI am speaking only for myself as an American citizen. I believe in our Constitution, and therefore I must accept that Donald Trump is the president and the commander in chief until the Congress or the people of the United States say otherwise. But if this kind of dangerous, unhinged hijacking of the powers of the presidency is not enough for either the citizens or their elected leaders to demand Trump’s removal, then we no longer have an accountable executive branch, and we might as well just admit that we have chosen to elect a monarch and be done with the illusion of constitutional order in the United States.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/j9qDDuCnAoA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/j9qDDuCnAoA/","published":"2019-09-21T12:10:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-598570"},{"title":"The Mysterious Bubbles at the Center of the Milky Way","content":"\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eFarhad Yusef-Zadeh was observing the center of the Milky Way galaxy in radio waves, looking for the presence of faint stars, when he saw it: a spindly structure giving off its own radio emissions.

At the time, Spain’s Jewish community was one of the largest in the world, though their numbers had diminished due to a series of massacres and mass conversions 100 years earlier. Jews had lived on the Iberian Peninsula for more than 1,700 years, producing philosophers, poets, diplomats, physicians, scholars, translators, and merchants.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eHistorians still debate the number of Jews expelled; some estimate 40,000, others 100,000 or more. Those who fled sought exile in places that would have them—Italy, North Africa, the Netherlands, and eventually the Ottoman empire. Many continued to speak Ladino, a variant of 15th-century Spanish, and treasure elements of Spanish culture. Tens of thousands stayed, but converted, and remained vulnerable to the perils of the Inquisition. How many Jews were killed remains unclear, but a widely accepted estimate is 2,000 people during the first two decades of the Inquisition, with thousands more tortured and killed throughout its full course.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIn 2015, the Spanish Parliament sought to make amends. Without a dissenting vote, it enacted a law inviting the Sephardim—Jews who trace their roots to Spain—to return. (Sepharad is the Hebrew word for the Iberian Peninsula) The law declared that after “centuries of estrangement,” Spain now welcomed “Sephardic communities to reencounter their origins, opening forever the doors of their homeland of old.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/12/dna-reveals-the-hidden-jewish-ancestry-of-latin-americans/578509/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: The genetic legacy of the Spanish Inquisition\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eSpain’s offer of citizenship to Sephardic Jews is a powerful gesture of atonement. The country today has one of the smallest Jewish populations in Europe: about 15,000 to 45,000 in a country of more than 46 million people. Yet, like so much of Spain’s complicated history with the Sephardim, the citizenship offer raises a host of questions. How many Sephardim would apply? What would be their reasons? And, if the law’s intent is to open “forever the doors of their homeland,” why does it have an expiration date? The offer ends this October.\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr class=\"c-section-divider\"\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eFor me, these questions are central to the story of my family. My father, Albert Adatto, descends from Sephardic Jews who trace their roots to Seville. After their expulsion, his ancestors lived for hundreds of years in what is now Turkey. He immigrated to the United States as a baby with his family. Growing up in the Sephardic community of Seattle, he did not speak English until he entered public school. Like other Sephardim, he spoke Ladino at home.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eHis mother, Anna Perahia Adatto, impressed on him the importance of keeping alive the memory of Spain. She kept as a prized possession the key to the family home in Seville. The key, once displayed with pride in a glassed-in bookcase, had been passed down from generation to generation. Yet it now appears to be lost, and I don’t know whether the house in Seville is still standing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWhen my grandmother approached the end of her life, she moved to Jerusalem. She wanted to be buried on the Mount of Olives, to be poised in prime real estate for when the resurrection came. But she told my father to pursue a different dream: Take his children, and his children’s children, and return to Spain.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eAnd so he did. My father had made regular trips to Spain in the 1970s and ’80s, but in the summer of 1992, the 500th anniversary of the expulsion, my parents gathered their children, along with their spouses and children, and returned to Spain. We based ourselves in Seville and visited the towns that figured prominently in our history—Toledo, Cordoba, and Granada.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eMy husband, an Ashkenazi Jew, regarded my father’s celebration of 1492 with puzzlement. “What exactly are we celebrating?” he asked. “After all, they kicked you out.” I gave him the answer I had heard so often as a child. “The expulsion was a mistake. Of course we should return.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eStill, I saw my father’s many trips to Spain as quixotic quests. He called them “peace and friendship missions.” He wanted to remember the moments of \u003cem\u003econvivencia\u003c/em\u003e the times of mutual respect and cooperation among Christians, Muslims, and Jews—which, for my father, burned brightly. The violence, suffering, and terror receded from memory like ashes that had forgotten the fire.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eMy father died in 1996. When Spain offered citizenship to the Sephardim almost 20 years later, I, along with my two sons and other members of my family, decided to apply. As we embarked on the application process, no simple matter, I began to wonder what Spain’s reencounter with the Sephardim would amount to.\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr class=\"c-section-divider\"\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWhen the 2015 law was approved, Spain’s justice minister, Rafael Catalá, \u003ca href=\"https://www.mjusticia.gob.es/cs/Satellite/Portal/va/gabinete-comunicacion/noticias-ministerio/congreso-diputados-aprueba\"\u003edeclared\u003c/a\u003e, “Today we have approved a law that reopens the door for all descendants of those who were unjustly expelled.

I could not imagine wanting to apply for citizenship during the rule of the dictator Francisco Franco. But I soon learned that the “reopened” door was not easy to walk through.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eHopes were high when the citizenship law was enacted. Members of the Spanish government and representatives of Jewish organizations in Spain predicted that 100,000 to 200,000 Sephardic Jews would apply. (Around the same time, Portugal enacted \u003ca href=\"http://www.embassyportugal-us.org/portuguese-sephardic-jews-descendants/\"\u003eits own law\u003c/a\u003e welcoming the Sephardim to become citizens.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe actual number approved for citizenship by the Spanish Ministry of Justice under the 2015 law has been surprisingly small—only 5,937 as of this month, according to the ministry. The total is still climbing as thousands of applications, including ours, are in the pipeline. But even optimistic predictions suggest the approval figure is unlikely to exceed 20,000.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWhy so few?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eOne reason is that Sephardic Jews around the world have recreated Sepharad in their own communities. A diverse and polyglot people united by a common heritage and religious liturgy, the Sephardim have made new homes during their hundreds of years of “exile.” More than guardians of precious aspects of 15th-century Spanish language and culture, the Sephardim have been involved in a long process of cultural creation and adaptation. Ladino has incorporated many languages, including Hebrew, Arabic, Turkish, French, and Greek. Following Arabic, for example, when something good happens, Sephardim say \u003cem\u003emashallah\u003c/em\u003e instead of \u003cem\u003emazel tov\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eToday, there is a worldwide revival of Sephardic culture and studies.

A yawning gap exists between the spirit of the Spanish citizenship law and its bureaucratic and civil administration.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe application process is daunting and difficult. The law does not require the Sephardim to give up their existing citizenship or reside in Spain. However, requirements include proof of Sephardic lineage (one need not be a practicing Jew); a rigorous, four-hour Spanish-language test; and a citizenship test. Every document—from birth certificates to criminal-background checks—must be translated, notarized, and certified with an apostille seal. Applicants are required to travel to Spain to sign with a Spanish notary, and many people, including our family, hire a Spanish lawyer to help navigate the citizenship process.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThese hurdles did not go unnoticed when the citizenship law was being debated in the Spanish Parliament. Jordi Jané i Guasch, a representative from Catalonia, \u003ca href=\"http://www.congreso.es/public_oficiales/L10/CONG/DS/PL/DSCD-10-PL-287.PDF#page=15\"\u003eobserved\u003c/a\u003e that as a form of historical reparations, the law had “grave deficiencies” and was an “obstacle course” that discouraged people from applying.

I have spoken with many, and what emerges is a mosaic of motives. In places like Venezuela and Turkey, Sephardim want to escape harsh economic or political conditions. Other countries with relatively high numbers of applicants include Israel, Mexico, Argentina, Colombia, Brazil, and the United States. Many of these applicants, especially those in their 20s and 30s, like the idea of obtaining a European Union passport, which not only eases travel around the world, but offers the right to live and work across the bloc without requiring a visa.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eFor applicants young and old, Spanish citizenship is a symbolic bridge that connects past and present, a way to connect to their Sephardic roots.

Now we are the generation to transmit it.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIsaac Querub, the head of the Federation of  Jewish Communities of Spain, told me the story of Annette Cabelli, a French woman in her early 90s who is one of the oldest Sephardim to be granted Spanish citizenship.

Tourism at Jewish historical sites in Spain is booming, but the sites are magnificent relics of the past, not markers of a thriving Jewish community. In Toledo, for example, the famous El Tránsito synagogue, the last synagogue built in Spain before the expulsion, has been restored beautifully but stands empty. It has no active congregation. The surrounding streets are filled with stores selling Jewish religious objects—mezuzahs, menorahs, Stars of David—but these successful businesses, including several kosher restaurants, are owned by Christians and cater to tourists from abroad, such as Israel, the U.S., and China.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Two tourists walk in the courtyard of the Synagogue of El Tránsito.\" height=\"448\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/09/AP_01082101425/668f3dbd3.jpg\" width=\"672\"\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"caption\"\u003eThe exterior of El Tránsito synagogue in Toledo, Spain.

When the Second World War broke out, Spain declared neutrality, but supported the Nazis in the early stages. In his Christmas message of 1939, Franco made a thinly veiled reference to the Jews as a “race” that was a “disturbance” and a “danger,” noting that “we, by the grace of God and clear vision of the Catholic Kings, have for centuries been free of this heavy burden.” Spain, however, did not deport Jews—indeed, thousands of Jews fleeing the Nazis crossed safely through Spain en route to other countries. In the post-War period, Franco attempted to rehabilitate his reputation and whitewash the anti-Semitism that was rife among his party and supporters.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe Spanish public still harbors many anti-Semitic stereotypes, more than other Western European countries according to surveys by \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20140107021940/http://archive.adl.org/anti_semitism/european_attitudes_may_2005.pdf\"\u003ethe Anti-Defamation League\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://www.pewforum.org/2018/05/29/nationalism-immigration-and-minorities/pf_05-29-18_religion-western-europe-01-20/\"\u003ethe Pew Research Center\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/04/pedro-sanchez-won-spain-election-but-right-remains/588298/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: Spain’s past is lost\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eAnti-Semitic beliefs in Spain have been especially widespread among the educated.

Some Spanish anti-Semitism reflects a tendency to conflate Jews with Israelis and to view both through the lens of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

In 2018, the Federation of  Jewish Communities of Spain signed an agreement with the Spanish Ministry of Education for “the eradication of anti-Semitism in Spain.” Spanish public schools now teach about the Holocaust. Jewish cultural institutions are thriving, many with government support.

Over the show’s first four seasons, the onetime patrician, played by Catherine O’Hara, lost her friends, her acting prestige, and a handful of her beloved wigs. Still, it was a misunderstanding in Season 5 that most emphatically propelled Moira’s anxiety: Upon returning from a film shoot, she discovered a stack of love letters addressed to her husband, John (played by Eugene Levy). As a distraught Moira insisted there was “a perfectly logical explanation” for the letters, the news spread through town, eventually prompting John to reveal the truth. “\u003cem\u003eYou\u003c/em\u003e wrote those letters!” he told his wife. “That week on Sunrise Bay ... you were in a body cast, they wouldn’t let you take it off.

The series is a delight not just because of its comedic timing, but also because of the tenderness with which its primary couple approaches their relationship. Moira and Johnny Rose face constant, often hilarious hurdles, but their irritation is rarely directed at one another. As John, Levy is confused and sometimes bumbling—a familiar archetype for straight husbands on TV—but he never regards his wife as an object of contempt, even when her sleep deprivation and separation anxiety leads her to do silly things like forget she’d once written him steamy love letters. The reason he’d revisited them, after all, was that he’d missed her while she was away.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eSchitt’s Creek\u003c/em\u003e, like \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/03/amazon-catastrophe-show-season-4-finale-review/585322/?utm_source=feed\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eCatastrophe\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e,\u003c/em\u003e is the rare family sitcom that doesn’t rely on tired gendered tropes to portray conflict within its central heterosexual partnership. The husbands on older series such as \u003cem\u003eMarried... with Children, The King of Queens\u003c/em\u003e, and even \u003cem\u003eEverybody Loves Raymond\u003c/em\u003e seemed to crackle with one-sided resentment toward their beautiful-but-annoying wives.

(And some of the most compelling family-oriented series of recent years, such as \u003cem\u003eOne Day at a Time\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eBetter Things\u003c/em\u003e, are anchored by single mothers.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut \u003cem\u003eSchitt’s Creek\u003c/em\u003e’s Johnny Rose showers Moira in adoration. He gathers their children around the telephone to wish her well on her first of day shooting; he admonishes them not to touch her wigs because he knows the hairpieces matter to her. Even in moments of suspicion, Moira regards him with nearly unwavering amusement and affection. They laugh loudly and often. They are far more committed to one another than to their (adult) children, far more content to luxuriate in their romance than to see themselves as parents first. (In this, they diverge markedly from \u003cem\u003eCatastrophe\u003c/em\u003e’s Rob and Sharon, who were consumed by the task of raising young children for much of the show’s four seasons.) Johnny and Moira’s refreshing dynamic pays off for viewers, especially given how rare it is for shows to depict an older couple facing life troubles that aren’t, as O’Hara recently noted to the \u003cem\u003eLos Angeles Times\u003c/em\u003e, “just about death, divorce, and disease.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMuch of the actors’ onscreen rapport can be traced to their long history of collaboration. O’Hara and Levy first performed together in 1974, and they credit their shared artistic sensibility to Second City, the comedy theater where they first met. (O’Hara, then a waitress, later went on to replace Gilda Radner.) Though their own brief romance didn’t last, the pair played a couple in the 2000 comedy \u003cem\u003eBest in Show\u003c/em\u003e, and ex-lovers in the 2003 mockumentary \u003cem\u003eA Mighty Wind\u003c/em\u003e. When Levy and his son, Dan (who plays David, one of Moira and Johnny’s children), initially conceived of \u003cem\u003eSchitt’s Creek\u003c/em\u003e, they knew O’Hara was their Moira. “She was our first choice. yes. She’s always our first choice,” Eugene Levy \u003ca href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2015/02/schitts-creek-catherine-ohara-eugene-levy.html\"\u003etold \u003cem\u003eVulture\u003c/em\u003e in 2015\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Levys’ trust in O’Hara—and the latter’s admiration for Eugene—shaped the process of writing and fine-tuning Moira both before and during filming. In a \u003ca href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/jarettwieselman/eugene-levy-and-catherine-ohara-look-back-on-their-40-year-f\"\u003e2014 joint conversation with \u003cem\u003eBuzzFeed News\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e ahead of the show’s release, O’Hara spoke glowingly about “working with a friend who you love and respect.” This sense of trust also animates the characters’ marriage: Moira and Johnny are clearly a team who choose each day to face down their struggles together—even when the place where they’ve woken up that morning is itself the struggle. To the extent that they express frustration toward one another, the root cause is usually one partner’s failure to inform the other of their burdens so that they can be shared.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLate in Season 5, for example, Johnny pulls a muscle in his back. The episode gives Levy the chance to play around with physical comedy, and O’Hara dramatizes Moira’s concern for her injured husband. “John, how was I to know you were in peril?” she asks, upon learning of his pain. “You keep everything inside, like a bashful clam!” Moira Rose isn’t written as a natural caretaker, and yet her protective instincts shift into overdrive whenever she perceives Johnny to be in danger. \u003cem\u003eSchitt’s Creek \u003c/em\u003ereveals this facet of her love in the same way it tells its broader story: with depth and riotous humor.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/boNwLvkEdBI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/boNwLvkEdBI/","published":"2019-09-21T13:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-598540"}]},{"url":"https://feeds.feedburner.com/time/topstories?format=xml","items":[{"title":"‘Everything Was Broken.’ The Photographer Who Captured the Most Haunting Photographs of Dorian and Its Aftermath","content":"\u003caside class=\"right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad\" id=\"right-rail__ad-5679829\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module\" data-src=\"https://time.com/5679829/bahamas-hurricane-dorian-destruction-photos/\" data-widget-id=\"SB_2\" data-ob-template=\"timemag\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\n\u003cdiv align=\"left\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv dir=\"auto\"\u003eAssociated Press staff photographer Ramon Espinosa is no stranger to covering hurricanes.

But more frequent droughts and increasingly violent storms put the region\u0026rsquo;s woodlands at risk. \u0026ldquo;Trees used to have hundreds of years to adapt, but they don\u0026rsquo;t have that time anymore,\u0026rdquo; said Xavier Bartet, an officer in France\u0026rsquo;s National Forestry Agency. \u0026ldquo;And in nature, if you can\u0026rsquo;t adapt, you die.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"inline-portrait_small_2x aligncenter \"\u003e\u003cimg data-attachment-id=\"5683061\" data-permalink=\"https://time.com/5682965/climate-change-versailles-palace-gardens/antique-illustration-of-grand-trianon/\" data-orig-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/trianon-versailles-climate-change.jpg?quality=85\" data-orig-size=\"2506,1197\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"ilbusca\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Antique illustration of Grand Trianon\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"Getty Images\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"Antique illustration of Grand Trianon\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Antique illustration of Grand Trianon\" data-image-description=\"pAn antique illustration of the Grand Trianon/p\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/trianon-versailles-climate-change.jpg?quality=85\u0026w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/trianon-versailles-climate-change.jpg?quality=85\u0026w=600\" src=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/trianon-versailles-climate-change.jpg?w=560\u0026#038;quality=85\u0026#038;h=267\" alt=\"Antique illustration of Grand Trianon\" height=\"267\"\u003e\n\u003cfigcaption class=\"image-caption\" \u003e\u003cspan class=\"credit\" \u003eGetty Images\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"caption\" \u003eAn antique illustration of the Grand Trianon\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe effects are being felt across Europe. About 50 million spruce trees are believed to have perished, with extensive damage to larch, oak, beech and pine varieties, according to Gert-Jan Nabuurs, forestry expert at Wageningen University in the Netherlands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn eastern Germany, pine canopies have been bleached a sickly brown with ground water the lowest since records began in 1961, according to the country\u0026rsquo;s DWD weather service. Charred stumps point to a disturbing new trend of wildfires. The BDF forestry association estimates 100 million German trees have died in droughts and storms since 2018.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEurope is particularly exposed to climate change, because its weather is dominated by the jet stream. The flow of moist winds from the Atlantic typically brings in ample precipitation to maintain the region\u0026rsquo;s ecosystem, but kinks have developed as arctic ice melts, causing air to blow in from the Sahara with increasing regularity. Warmer temperatures are changing growing patterns, with chestnut trees in Portugal struggling in lower altitudes, where they once thrived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStorms fueled by warmer temperatures are also a problem. The risks were evident last October, when the Italian peninsula was pounded by storm gusts exceeding 200 kilometers an hour (124 mph), damaging 42,500 hectares of forest. The Comelico Dam near the Austrian border was covered with trees battered into the Piave river. For centuries, such timber was brought to Venice on rafts to be used for foundations of the lagoon city\u0026rsquo;s historic \u0026ldquo;palazzi.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo be sure, it\u0026rsquo;s not bad everywhere. Sweden has planted more trees than it cuts down since the 1920s, and today there is almost twice as much wood supply than at the start of 20th century, but then there\u0026rsquo;s the new problem of wildfires. In Finland, climate change is speeding up tree growth, but the Nordic country \u0026mdash; wary of extreme weather and the spread of pests such as bark beetle \u0026mdash; is more actively managing its timber resources including using selectively bred seedlings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDying woodlands could mean that greenhouse gases build up even faster. Concerns have led to mounting public pressure. A Danish broadcaster held a telethon last weekend, raising 2.4 million euros ($2.6 million) from viewers to plant more than 900,000 trees, and an artist created a mock forest inside a football stadium in Austria to raise awareness. Ursula von der Leyen, the incoming European Commission president, called protecting the environment the bloc\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;most pressing challenge.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile European leaders have vowed to act, the situation is complicated by an economic slowdown and concerns about financing. In Germany \u0026mdash; where a summer heatwave threatened to buckle highways and the receding Rhine river risked halting shipping for the second straight year \u0026mdash; Chancellor Angela Merkel\u0026rsquo;s government on Friday is due to decide on measures to get its climate goals back on track.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s no easy fix. Efforts to make forests more robust include replanting Turkish oak trees in France and testing seeds from drier areas in the central Loire valley for future wine barrels. But the measures are a crapshoot. At Versailles, about 50% of new saplings die in the first year, and messing with local ecosystems can have damaging effects on native varieties, with groups like Ireland\u0026rsquo;s Woodland League seeking to halt the introduction of new species.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;All we do is still experimental, and it\u0026rsquo;s risky,\u0026rdquo; said Brigitte Musch, chief of climate-change research for the French forestry agency. \u0026ldquo;We are under pressure to work fast, for things that will matter for the generations to come.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"inline-portrait_small_2x aligncenter \"\u003e\u003cimg data-attachment-id=\"5683063\" data-permalink=\"https://time.com/5682965/climate-change-versailles-palace-gardens/putti-statue-in-the-versailles-gardens/\" data-orig-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/versailles-gardens-climate-change-1.jpg?quality=85\" data-orig-size=\"5122,3415\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"DE AGOSTINI PICTURE LIBRARY\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Putti, statue in the Versailles gardens (UNESCO World Heritage List, 1979), France, 17th century.

The wider reality can be seen behind a rusty fence at the end of the grounds at the Arboretum de Chevreloup. The conservation park has a budget less than 5% of the palace\u0026rsquo;s, and the effects of low rainfall and record heat were evident in the balding canopies and shriveling Patagonia trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo avoid such a fate, France\u0026rsquo;s forestry agency is teaming up with counterparts in Europe and Turkey to develop software to determine what varieties will have to be planted in the years to come. The software, which is working with a worst-case scenario of summer temperatures rising as much as 5.3 degrees Celsius (below the latest forecast), will be translated in English to be usable by peers worldwide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt Versailles, future-proofing the grounds is being meticulously orchestrated. The estate is building a database of all its vegetation, insects and animals. The trees will be given more space to capture the water in the soil and retain humidity.

Several candidates fumbled it, or awkwardly spit out “transgender” like Marianne Williamson did in her opening statement; former Vice President Joe Biden seemed to get gender identity and sexual orientation mixed up when talking about incarceration. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"oCSWfp\"\u003eBut the evening also produced some quality moments.

Harris has continuously made excuses over why her office pushed the case, first saying that she was just upholding the current law and then saying that her staffers handled the case without her involvement. Lenz also brought up Warren’s former position against gender-affirming surgeries for trans inmates that she has since reversed. But unlike her exchange with Biden, Lenz’s time with Harris and Warren didn’t end with a defensive remark about the journalist’s character. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"BrkeKb\"\u003eLoser: Sex work\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"uQj0RP\"\u003eWhile nearly every candidate noted the ongoing epidemic of violence against transgender women of color, none of them were willing to get into the systemic roots of much of the problem: sex work. Many of the trans women who have been murdered were sex workers, and none of candidates were asked how they would reform the current system to make life as a sex worker safer.

Poems on Instagram get shared, viewed, and saved as images, rather than text files, so their visual presentation matters. But instead of exploring the innovative textual styles that computers make possible, such as animated text or unusual fonts, most Insta-poets deploy nostalgic visual tokens of literary refinement. They write in ornate scripts, use old manual typewriters, present their work on richly textured paper, or include little illustrations. Such techniques ironically use Instagram to reassert the traditional notion that genuine poetic expression looks inky and papery — that a poet’s work appears most authentic not on an ephemeral, impersonal screen but on the scribbly, insistently material paper she has physically inscribed. The fact that the visual rhetoric of ink and paper now arrives to us through smartphone screens should indicate how deeply such rhetoric continues to inform our reading habits.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli id=\"WfLAz4\"\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/heathersenison/2019/09/17/author-philip-roths-sprawling-connecticut-estate-listed-for-2925-million/#1c3627a41402\"\u003ePhilip Roth’s estate is for sale\u003c/a\u003e!

Markey is a well-liked progressive senator who was elected to the upper chamber in 2013 after serving in the House since 1976. Kennedy is also a well-liked, relatively progressive Congress member, who was first elected in 2012. Both are white men and both have deep ties to Massachusetts politics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Tqyfgg\"\u003eThere are a few notable differences between the two, however, including age. Markey is 73; Kennedy is 38. And Kennedy, as he’s previously hinted, is arguing that he’s a better fit for the job in a moment when the party is facing immense pressure to do more to stand up to Republicans and confront political divides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"pubz1Q\"\u003eKennedy’s decision to mull a Senate run comes amid a couple of different trends in Massachusetts where recently there’s been a spate of younger candidates upsetting older incumbents, \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/11/6/18048286/house-midterm-results-massachusetts-seventh-ayanna-pressley-winner\"\u003eincluding Rep.

Taking on Markey might just be Kennedy’s best bet at securing a seat in the near future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"8MjTJU\"\u003e“I don’t think it’s about Ed Markey. It’s about who’s coming after Ed Markey,” UMass Boston political science professor Erin O’Brien tells Vox.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"eqmVQU\"\u003eJoe Kennedy and Ed Markey aren’t that different ideologically\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"XJ1Pca\"\u003eWhile a number of Democratic primary challenges in 2018 were driven by differences in ideology, that’s not quite the case with Kennedy and Markey. If anything, Markey is seen as the lawmaker with the more liberal voting record between the two, though Kennedy has also established himself as a progressive in the House.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"qLjmWr\"\u003eOn issues including climate change and net neutrality, Markey has been at the forefront of fights waged by the left. He was a co-sponsor of the Green New Deal resolution and was integral to advancing a cap-and-trade proposal while he was in the House. He has a consistent voting record on a range of issues including health care and Cabinet nominees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"8vpvHq\"\u003e“On policy, if you’re a progressive Democrat in Massachusetts, you like them both. Markey has a longer legislative history,” O’Brien says. “He’s known as a specialist in areas like the environment.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"pYjSlf\"\u003eKennedy, meanwhile, has a similarly solid voting record in the House and is known for his work on LGBTQ rights and mental health. In speaking with Vox, Dewey Square political analyst Mary Anne Marsh specifically cited Kennedy’s efforts on a statewide ballot initiative focused on transgender rights as an example of how engaged he’s been in Massachusetts politics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ulay8Q\"\u003eBetween the two, Kennedy could face some pushback from progressives once a full challenge is underway. Already, several regional lawmakers, including Sen.

Noted progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) is among those supporting Markey, while the more centrist Sen. Kyrsten Sinema has vocalized her endorsement for Kennedy. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"IYUljT\"\u003eUltimately, however, the two lawmakers are nearly in lockstep with one another. “This is less about ideology and more about effectiveness,” says Marsh. “Only in Massachusetts could you split those hairs.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"NIXkDV\"\u003eThis question of effectiveness is one that Kennedy seems determined to probe as part of a potential run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"74XwwW\"\u003e“Our system has been letting down a lot of people for a long time, and we can’t fix it if we don’t challenge it,” he wrote on Facebook. It’s an issue that’s become more urgent since Trump took office, says Marsh, and it’s one that takes direct aim at Markey, \u003ca href=\"https://morningconsult.com/senator-rankings-q2-19-2/\"\u003ewho has decent approval ratings\u003c/a\u003e but lukewarm voter support.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"CoUVyh\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2019/06/10/biden-leading-warren-among-democratic-voters-mass-poll-finds/GUVxw1pzDjA9Nau9cMAlCP/story.html\"\u003eAccording to a Boston Globe and Suffolk University poll\u003c/a\u003e that was conducted in June, 44 percent of likely Democratic voters say they’ll back Markey in a primary while another 45 percent are undecided about whom they would pick.

In both the Senate and the House, for example, lawmakers are expected to put in the time before they are able to advance to a more senior position on a committee or in leadership. Similarly, Markey is seen as someone who waited his turn before making the jump from the House to the Senate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"fUHMry\"\u003eKennedy is arguing that he’s done waiting, a statement that’s very much in line with younger candidates taking on incumbents in Massachusetts.

They are taking on established incumbents and being successful,” says Marsh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"7pNRSO\"\u003eKennedy could well position himself as part of this wave, a movement that’s taken hold nationwide as voters call for fresh voices in politics. “I hear the folks who say I should wait my turn, but with due respect — I’m not sure this is a moment for waiting,” Kennedy writes. (It’s of course worth noting that Kennedy’s family ties set him apart from other candidates who’ve made similar arguments.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"tMoZai\"\u003e“Kennedy’s lane is, really, generational change,” O’Brien tells Vox.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"XMLkYT\"\u003e“I think I’ve got new ideas and a new approach.

Experts say that he’s well liked in the state and is not seen as having coasted off his last name. \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/1/30/16953910/kennedy-speech-sotu-response\"\u003eHis rebuttal to Trump’s 2018 State of the Union address\u003c/a\u003e, which took on the “false choices” the administration was pushing on everything from immigration to gun control, was well received by many Democrats on the national stage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"uAAP68\"\u003eAnd being a Kennedy in a state where Sen.

With Kennedy’s entry, Markey could be facing the “toughest race he’s ever [encountered],” says Marsh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ZKCx30\"\u003eA major reason for Kennedy’s decision to mount a challenge now could be driven by the fact that Markey would be his most accessible opponent in the near future. Both O’Brien and Jenkins note that there’s a pretty deep bench of Massachusetts lawmakers who could vie for another Senate seat down the line if Warren’s were to open up, for example. Those younger, similarly progressive lawmakers might prove to be tougher opponents than Markey currently is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"vGzqnI\"\u003e“Kennedy is doing this now because there’s a total logjam of talent in Massachusetts,” O’Brien told Vox, citing other lawmakers like Pressley, Rep.

Bernie Sanders (I-VT), one of the leading progressives in the 2020 presidential race, says he wants to eliminate all Americans’ medical debt. Sanders released a plan on Saturday to pay off $81 billion in existing medical debt, reform the 2005 bankruptcy reform bill, and set up a public credit registry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"pM9ayX\"\u003e“I am sick and tired of seeing over 500,000 Americans declare bankruptcy each year because they cannot pay off the outrageous cost of a medical emergency or a hospital stay,” Sanders said recently, teasing the plan he has now formally laid out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"XYU0Rb\"\u003eUnder the Sanders plan, the federal government would negotiate and pay off unpaid medical obligations that have already been put out to debt collection agencies. He would also place restrictions on how aggressive health care providers and debt collectors could be in collecting payments from patients. Through a proposed public credit registry, which would replace credit reporting agencies like Equifax, Sanders would prohibit debts from medical care from counting against a person’s credit score.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"oGA3Wq\"\u003eIt’s another big health care promise from Sanders, who campaigns on Medicare-for-all, a national health insurance program that would cover every American. He has also, because he regularly cites the 500,000 medical bankruptcies figure, reignited a longstanding debate about the actual scale of the medical bankruptcy problem. The \u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/08/28/sanderss-flawed-statistic-medical-bankruptcies-year/\"\u003eWashington Post’s in-house fact-checkers\u003c/a\u003e dinged him for saying 500,000 people go bankrupt because of medical debt every year, stirring up an old scholarly fight that originated with a 2005 paper co-authored, in a fun twist, by Sanders’s now-rival Elizabeth Warren. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"rzqdwd\"\u003eAcademics have been debating since that 2005 paper’s publication how many people actually go bankrupt in the United States because of medical bills. It is a debate about causation and study design that frankly won’t matter to most people. It also risks losing sight of the underlying problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"fmfdot\"\u003eThere is no denying that thousands of Americans go bankrupt entirely or partly because of medical debt. And even if they don’t go bankrupt, millions more people struggle with this type of debt on their personal ledgers, making it harder for them to borrow money and stay financially stable. Millions of Americans still lack health insurance, and they’re fully liable for their medical bills if they get sick or have an accident. But even health insurance does not always provide security against financial stress because poor health takes its toll in other ways, such as lost wages. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"d30JgQ\"\u003eBernie Sanders has put out a plan to eliminate $81 billion in medical debt\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"twNVUY\"\u003eThere is certainly some level of agreement that medical debt is a problem unusually endemic in the United States and our safety net should be better structured to address it. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"UGCtX4\"\u003e“Health insurance still leaves Americans exposed to much more economic risk from poor health,” Amy Finkelstein, an economics professor at MIT who has studied medical debt, told me, especially compared to other countries with social insurance that better protect their citizens from the economic loss in the event of sickness or injury. “Even people with health insurance are not insured against the economic consequences of poor health.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"v4orSE\"\u003eAnd this is part of what Sanders is targeting with his forthcoming proposal.

Not only is the United States the only developed economy with such a high number of uninsured people (still over 10 percent), but the government does not provide the same level of financial protection to people who get sick or hurt and lose income because they can’t work that other countries do. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ERc0uw\"\u003eThe Finkelstein et al. paper used the notable example of Denmark, a socialist boogeyman for conservatives. They cited a Danish study showing that Danes who have nonfatal heart attacks and strokes lose about the same amount of income as Americans, but that 50 percent of their losses were then covered by government disability or sick leave programs. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"3171IS\"\u003eThe US doesn’t have such programs, and Americans only saw about 10 percent of their losses covered if they were not eligible for Social Security’s retirement benefits. The researchers also found that the drop in income for people in America is not offset by an increase in earnings by their spouse or partner. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"mVhBPN\"\u003eIn other words, medical bankruptcy is a problem uniquely pervasive in the United States. As T.R. Reid wrote in his tour of international health care systems from last decade:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp id=\"0T4nZt\"\u003eI asked the health ministry of each country how many citizens had declared bankruptcy in the past year because of medical bills.

A seminal attempt came in 2005 by Elizabeth Warren and, among others, Dr. David Himmelstein, now a professor in the CUNY School of Public Health.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"huIpN1\"\u003eHimmelstein led an updated version of the survey and used a similar methodology as the studies in 2005 and 2009. The researchers sent questionnaires to people who had filed for bankruptcy, and two-thirds said they had medical debt or had lost income because of injury or illness. Take two-thirds of the 750,000 people who file for bankruptcy every year and you get 500,000, which is Sanders’s number. It’s this number that the Washington Post saw fit to give three out of four Pinocchios for lacking a strong enough empirical foundation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"23IhqR\"\u003eSome economists have long been skeptical of the methodology and study design deployed by Himmelstein and Warren in their previous studies. Part of it is they don’t consider the survey model reliable; they also question what the proper context should be when most Americans who have medical debt don’t file bankruptcy in a given year. (Himmelstein, for his part, says some of his critics have gotten industry support and that there is a difference in philosophy between doctors and economists on trusting subject responses about issues like bankruptcy.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"smC7Tb\"\u003eCritics will actually cite Finkelstein’s 2018 paper in contrast to the previous iterations. Those researchers also sought to estimate how many people go bankrupt because of a medical crisis — specifically, a hospitalization. They found just 4 percent of bankruptcies could be traced back to an acute event that put somebody in the hospital. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"c64FLy\"\u003eThat is obviously a much lower number than the 60-some percent Himmelstein found.

While that may not be a problem with his base, it could be a problem with voters he hopes to win over like members of the audience at Friday’s forum that \u003ca href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-biden/bidens-lgbtq-record-draws-scrutiny-at-iowa-presidential-forum-idUSKBN1W603A\"\u003eReuters\u003c/a\u003e spoke with, who were less than impressed with the candidate’s answers and behavior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"NGUVhL\"\u003e“I think that he thinks he doesn’t need to [change], but he does,” college student Emmett Cory told Reuters. “He can’t just ride [his record] without having to get with the times.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"Y7nzwo\"\u003eCriticism over Biden’s language has done little to damage his frontrunner status \u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"uRiuz6\"\u003eEven while serving as a \u003ca href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/247388/biden-liked-americans.aspx\"\u003ewell-liked vice president\u003c/a\u003e in an administration that enjoyed \u003ca href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/197495/obama-job-approval-jumps-four-year-high.aspx\"\u003epretty decent approval ratings\u003c/a\u003e, Biden was known for sticking his foot in his mouth. These gaffes were often treated with fondness, earning him the moniker “Uncle Joe” and inspiring \u003ca href=\"https://www.npr.org/2016/11/15/502019361/-memeoftheweek-the-best-of-the-obama-biden-brotus\"\u003ea thousand memes\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"my5pLx\"\u003eBut some of those so-called gaffes revealed more serious blind spots, especially on issues of race. When running for president in 2008, Biden famously referred to Obama as “articulate and bright and clean” — implying that this was unusual for a black politician. In 2012, when supporting the now-President Obama’s reelection bid, he told an audience of black voters that the Republican Party would “put y’all back in chains.” In August of this year, Biden made a similar misstep, \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/8/9/20798473/joe-biden-poor-kid-gaffe-iowa-trump\"\u003ewhen he put “poor kids” in opposition to “white kids,”\u003c/a\u003e implying an inherent link between whiteness and wealth (and between poverty and children of color).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"3arpYz\"\u003eThese gaffes are increasingly being seen through the lenses of his age (he is nearly 80) and his record, leaving some voters concerned as to whether there’s any willingness on Biden’s part to evolve on issues of race, identity, and class, as \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/8/28/20833288/joe-biden-gaffes-narrative-explained\"\u003eVox’s Tara Golshan and Ella Nilsen have written\u003c/a\u003e:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"pxkE2X\"\u003eFrequent news about Biden’s gaffes has fueled these fears among voters in the key early states of Iowa and New Hampshire, especially as voters consider a potential general election matchup between the former vice president and Trump, who has already bestowed Biden with the nickname “Sleepy Joe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"76291K\"\u003eOthers concerned with Biden’s age said it had less to do with gaffes than with the perception that Biden is out of touch with the current Democratic Party because he is staunchly moderate and has some controversial past votes on racial issues.

He is, in many ways, a throw-back politician, a lifelong public servant whose work has spanned generations. His critics would argue that is precisely Biden’s problem, and that persona will keep him from winning over voters who are not yet onboard with his candidacy. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"zq68av\"\u003eAnd in a crowded field that has seen support for certain rivals — \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/9/18/20872216/warren-biden-yang-democratic-presidential-polls\"\u003emost noticeably Elizabeth Warren\u003c/a\u003e — rising, Biden will need to ensure he wins a broad base of support that includes voters who take seriously how candidates position themselves on issues of race, class, gender and sexual identity, and more.

The oil and gas company has been injecting carbon dioxide underground for decades in the pursuit of extracting more oil. Pressurized carbon dioxide is able to push out hard to extract oil from underground. Crucially, in this process, much of the carbon dioxide gets trapped in the geological formations. Occidental is one of the first oil companies to comply with the US Environmental Protection Agency regulations set up to ensure the stated amount of injected carbon dioxide remains there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Carbon Engineering plant is expected to begin operations in 2022.

What works? What is less convincing to you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA:\u003c/strong\u003e A lot of people have asked me this, thinking that it was a wild departure from what you would see, but I actually don\u0026#8217;t think so. I\u0026#8217;ve seen a lot of families do succession planning very well, very thoughtfully, very intentionally, and they would bear no resemblance to this family. But I think what you\u0026#8217;re looking at is an amplification of dynamics that a family with this kind of power, and these kinds of players, would really be vulnerable to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou have an aging CEO struggling to let go of power. His value and meaning are all tied up in that. His mortality, his work—everything. Letting go of this is effectively letting go of who he is and how he knows himself and his worth, and none of us give that up very easily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis kids have no doubt grown up in an environment where affection and attention were unreliably provided at best, and routinely withdrawn. The expectation for loyalty lived side-by-side with explosiveness and carelessness in communication—painful, abusive, verbal communication. All of that could easily generate the type of sibling dynamics you see, and the type of parent-child dynamics. And you have three marriages. You have all of the ingredients for something quite combustible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIs the deep reluctance to let go even more intense with founder-CEOs? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbsolutely. For founder-CEOs, in many ways this is their kid, their baby. They feel like they care about it and get it in a way that nobody else possibly could. And they have a very hard time trusting anybody to take it over. It\u0026#8217;s not an unusual pattern, actually, for a succession to be initiated and then the founder-CEO struggles quite a bit to to let go and move on. It\u0026#8217;s poignant actually.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLogan dangles the possibility of winning the succession game like a carrot.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, especially with the kids, to sort of get them to prove themselves. And in this case, you have to prove yourself to be quite awful in order to impress Logan, and of course there are ramifications for that, too. You really can\u0026#8217;t win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf this family came to you as clients and you had to rank the issues that you would deal with in order of urgency, what would that look like?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would work with them as a subsystem to start. I wouldn\u0026#8217;t see them all together at once. I would be really interested in starting with Logan and his wife [Marcy.] I think she is an influencer behind the scenes. And I’m not 100% sure yet for good or ill. I suspect for ill, because it wouldn\u0026#8217;t be that interesting if it was for good. And I would want to get at: How can we influence Logan to reframe this transition in a way that he would feel elevated rather than diminished? The challenge is to find a way for him to feel honored and respected in this transition, and his wife potentially could play a role in that. I don\u0026#8217;t pretend with somebody like Logan, who is highly unlikely to submit to a therapy context, that it would be easy or even viable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other possibility would be to ask the siblings about the trade-offs that they are making, continuing to involve themselves and vying for power. What are their other options? I assume that they have access to considerable wealth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou would want to know: Does Logan have some interest in the family having more peace with one another? And if he does, you could leverage that. I think that would be challenging. And so you might have to just talk to the siblings about their relationship with each other and what they want it to look like, and what they could be doing to work more effectively as a group of siblings. Because Logan is going to be gone, and they\u0026#8217;re going to be left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLogan\u0026#8217;s rarely seen brother, Ewan Roy, acts as an unseen force, driving Logan’s mania for acquiring PGM, the reputable, Pulitzer prize-winning company owned by the Pierce family and Ewan\u0026#8217;s preferred news outlet. What do you see in that sibling pair?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat relationship sort of hints that the pattern of sibling rivalry we see precedes this generation. Often we see that there are trans-generational patterns that play out in the business context or the family context, and this no exception.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would hypothesize that there were family of origin dynamics between the brothers that long preceded current history, but likely also there was vying for power and credibility as young men, and sort of dividing and conquering various positions in order to distinguish themselves. It\u0026#8217;s a keyhole into a longer-standing pattern that probably is part of what drives Logan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFrom a psychologist\u0026#8217;s perspective, what else we might learn about Logan\u0026#8217;s family of origin?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wouldn\u0026#8217;t be surprised if Logan was shamed somehow in his family of origin, in the way that Kendall somehow experiences shame now—because Logan seems to identify with his son, not only because he\u0026#8217;s the oldest, but somehow he also identifies with his vulnerabilities, as much as they disgust him. I wouldn\u0026#8217;t be surprised if there were some history of abuse or rejection or abandonment, or if he was the adopted one, I really don\u0026#8217;t know. But I’d be more surprised if Logan didn\u0026#8217;t have some sort of painful family history that would contribute to how driven he is, and how intense he is, and how desperate he really is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eIn the latest episode (Ep. 6; \u0026#8220;Argestes\u0026#8221;), Logan hits Roman in front of the family and other company executives.

It\u0026#8217;s consistent with his verbal behavior. It\u0026#8217;s consistent with tha t appalling scene where we saw with him \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYqqW3c2mBU\u0026amp;list=PLO79iP69FaZNQcwBHO9rzccZfxbmRxaBA\u0026amp;index=14\"\u003ethrowing sausages at people\u003c/a\u003e at the business retreat. And Kendall\u0026#8217;s reflexive, immediate response to protect his brother seemed familiar. It didn\u0026#8217;t seem like there was a moment of shock where anybody stood there like \u0026#8220;I can\u0026#8217;t believe that just happened.\u0026#8221; There was a sense of, \u0026#8220;Well, we\u0026#8217;re back here.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eYet, in reality, wouldn\u0026#8217;t a family that runs a business together be able to disguise or hide such dysfunction?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe siblings are, across contexts, very unable to contain and manage their distress and their competitiveness with one another. That is great for drama. In real life, people do a much better job of managing what shows up in public settings. For example, at the joint dinner they had with the Pierces [the family that owns PGM], it seemed unlikely that they wouldn\u0026#8217;t, with all of their socialization, have been able to manage that better than they did. Through the script, and the choices of what to show, they\u0026#8217;re demonstrating something that probably would be just a hair under the surface. Again, this is a troubled family; this isn\u0026#8217;t every family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eShiv, who plays a political spin master and is only now being invited to join the company, lost it at that dinner, blurting out that her father had promised she\u0026#8217;d be his successor. That was not supposed to go public. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShiv is interesting, because in a patriarchal system, she\u0026#8217;s been sidelined from access to power and influence, although she\u0026#8217;s as smart and savvy as anybody else in the room. And so in some ways she shows up as very sophisticated, and in some way she shows up as very dumb. She first wanted to hide her investment in being part of things by going in another direction, and even going in the direction of liberal politics and doing what what kids in families do, which is divide and conquer. If somebody is a great musician, [the other says] \u0026#8220;I\u0026#8217;m going to be an athlete.\u0026#8221; Kids divide and conquer who can be good at what. But she had to hide an underlying desperation really to be part of it. That scene at the dinner table was a part of her breaking through [and essentially saying], \u0026#8220;You\u0026#8217;re not going to take this away from me again. No, I\u0026#8217;m going to serve myself here. You can\u0026#8217;t offer it to me, and then let me not have a seat at the table. I don\u0026#8217;t want to be here as an ornament.\u0026#8221; But she would have managed it better in real life given all of her training in politics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"inline-video\" itemprop=\"video\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/VideoObject\"\u003e\u003ciframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/GigZeL6r0CM?version=3\u0026#038;rel=1\u0026#038;fs=1\u0026#038;autohide=2\u0026#038;showsearch=0\u0026#038;showinfo=1\u0026#038;iv_load_policy=1\u0026#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIs there a difference usually with the way men and women as adult siblings are treated when it comes to power in a family business?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt depends on the family. I know many families who have been very intentional about including and passing power and authority to the women in the family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes what\u0026#8217;s tricky—in modern times more than historically, when we just assumed that the males would take over—is you could have somebody in a family who\u0026#8217;s an oldest son, for example, who\u0026#8217;s a talented musician or athlete or a historian or some other skillset that would be impressive, but not a good fit necessarily to take over a business. Families struggle sometimes when the heir apparent doesn\u0026#8217;t have a skill set that fits what\u0026#8217;s needed, and they have to be really thoughtful, intentional about dividing money, dividing power so that people don\u0026#8217;t feel marginalized. It\u0026#8217;s very delicate. I feel for families in these positions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow are we to understand Kendall and Logan\u0026#8217;s relationship right now, in your view?  \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKendall is heartbreaking to me. He is probably the most likable of the bunch because of his vulnerability, although they\u0026#8217;re all vulnerable in various ways. But for starters, he\u0026#8217;s being blackmailed by Logan because they have his secrets about the accident and the death of the man that he was procuring drugs from. But also Kendall carries a lot of shame. He is ashamed of and horrified by that event. He\u0026#8217;s ashamed of his substance abuse. He no doubt has been shamed by his father in ways that are obvious on the show and likely long proceeding this period; he is unable to live up to his father\u0026#8217;s unreasonable expectations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKendall can\u0026#8217;t win, even if he\u0026#8217;s doing everything right, his father can\u0026#8217;t afford for him to be good enough to take over because then it would mean that he\u0026#8217;s not needed anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIs that a common conflict in family businesses, that potential successors don\u0026#8217;t know if a boss and parent is on their side?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are family dynamics where that is the case. But I\u0026#8217;m very familiar personally and professionally with parents who would like nothing more than to have one or more of their children succeed in taking over the business—or wouldn\u0026#8217;t have a problem with them deciding they \u003cem\u003edidn\u0026#8217;t\u003c/em\u003e want to have anything to do with it.

And that\u0026#8217;s healthy, if it\u0026#8217;s understood and respected that they are different sub-systems and they\u0026#8217;re also a family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe relationship with Connor makes sense. He\u0026#8217;s more on the outside relative to the others, and he had a different experience and a different mom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI would be remiss if I didn’t ask about Roman’s sexual hangup, his need to be humiliated, even if it doesn’t directly affect the family business and knowing you\u0026#8217;re not a sex therapist.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026#8217;m a clinical psychologist. I have 30 years of experience. I\u0026#8217;ve seen lots and lots of families and couples, but I would be reluctant to comment with great authority about Roman’s sexuality—except to say that someone\u0026#8217;s sexuality is influenced by many things, and it could be influenced by abuse, but I wouldn\u0026#8217;t want to assume that anybody who had those sexual preferences had that history. There are many paths to the same outcome. In this case it seems like Roman has been humiliated on a regular basis so that is part of his sexual expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHe has also found a mother figure in \u003ca href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2019/09/succession-j-smith-cameron-gerri-roman.html\"\u003eGerri\u003c/a\u003e, as their sexual relationship continues. Does that happen with family businesses, where outsiders take on familiar roles?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSure. In any number of contexts, a person can step into the role of a mentor-slash-surrogate-parent, whether that\u0026#8217;s a school situation with a teacher, or a work situation with a boss, or a situation with a more senior co-worker. There are lots of people with pockets of need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026#8217;s nothing that’s inherently problematic with people finding other people in their environment who meet that need, especially if someone is doing that intentionally. I always say I hope my kids have many mothers because one mother can\u0026#8217;t cover it all. What can be problematic is the intensity of the need, when boundaries are violated in the pursuit of that need. People in power can sometimes exploit that need for their own good, so a professor or therapist that sleeps with their student or client, for example.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhat do in-laws like Shiv\u0026#8217;s husband, Tom, experience working within a family-run business?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think it\u0026#8217;s hard to ever be anything but in-but-out. Different families have a stronger or looser boundaries around the nuclear family system and it can be more or less difficult for in-laws to penetrate that. Some families are very inclusive and welcoming, while others not so much. With Tom, because he is male and Shiv’s husband, it seems like giving him an in was a way to indirectly throw Shiv a bone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSounds like you would also ask Tom about the trade-offs he\u0026#8217;s making, too?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026#8217;s such a basic and important question in therapy generally. In life, generally, it\u0026#8217;s like we\u0026#8217;re always getting something and losing something and nobody wants to lose something, but you end up losing the most when you don\u0026#8217;t choose your losses.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://qz.com/work/1711650/what-succession-gets-right-about-power-and-family/","published":"2019-09-21T12:01:51Z","guid":"https://qz.com/1711650/auto-draft/"},{"title":"The small library in Sicily that helps Italians understand African migration to Europe","content":"\u003cimg width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Library_courtesy-Pistone-e1569059181334.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;w=1024\" class=\"attachment-medium_10 size-medium_10 wp-post-image\" alt=\"Library_courtesy Pistone\" srcset=\"https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Library_courtesy-Pistone-e1569059181334.jpg 1024w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Library_courtesy-Pistone-e1569059181334.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Library_courtesy-Pistone-e1569059181334.jpg?resize=50,28 50w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Library_courtesy-Pistone-e1569059181334.jpg?resize=160,90 160w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Library_courtesy-Pistone-e1569059181334.jpg?resize=320,180 320w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Library_courtesy-Pistone-e1569059181334.jpg?resize=640,360 640w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Library_courtesy-Pistone-e1569059181334.jpg?resize=940,529 940w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe months that followed the establishment of a far-right government in June 2018 have been the toughest for immigrants in Italy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003ca href=\"https://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations/mediterranean/location/5205\"\u003emajority\u003c/a\u003e coming from the African continent, migrants have faced an increasing crackdown on their asylum rights, peaking last December with the approval of \u003ca href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-italy-politics-immigration-security/italys-salvini-gets-win-with-new-asylum-and-security-rules-idUSKCN1NY1JN\"\u003ea law \u003c/a\u003eproposed by Matteo Salvini, former interior minister and leader of anti-migrant party ‘The League’.

HBO hopes the fantasy drama can win some big awards—namely its fourth best drama series trophy—to wash away the bad aftertaste from the show\u0026#8217;s divisive finale. Just as likely, \u003cem\u003eThrones \u003c/em\u003ewinning best drama again could make viewers even angrier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmmy voters like to honor shows in their final years of eligibility, so don\u0026#8217;t be surprised if \u003cem\u003eGame of Thrones \u003c/em\u003eis the night\u0026#8217;s big winner even if it doesn\u0026#8217;t win the ultimate prize. Other series with several nominations include the Netflix miniseries \u003cem\u003eWhen They See Us\u003c/em\u003e, HBO comedy \u003cem\u003eBarry\u003c/em\u003e, FX miniseries \u003cem\u003eFosse/Verdon\u003c/em\u003e, and Amazon comedy \u003cem\u003eThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike the Oscars in February, Sunday\u0026#8217;s Emmys won\u0026#8217;t officially have a host.

Awards handicappers are unanimously predicting a fourth victory in the category this year, for the show\u0026#8217;s final season—critical reception be damned. As the most popular show in the world in its last hurrah, \u003cem\u003eGame of Thrones \u003c/em\u003eis in a great position to win the night\u0026#8217;s biggest award, even though it doesn\u0026#8217;t deserve it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf \u003cem\u003eThrones \u003c/em\u003edoesn\u0026#8217;t deserve it, then what does? For starters, HBO has another show in the running, one that\u0026#8217;s caught fire with critics in its second season (currently airing): \u003cem\u003eSuccession\u003c/em\u003e, the comedic drama about a dysfunctional American media dynasty. \u003cem\u003eSuccession \u003c/em\u003eis probably the best drama on TV right now, but it\u0026#8217;s not exactly a hit with audiences. (It averages about 500,000 US viewers per episode, which is about 5% of a \u003cem\u003eGame of Thrones\u003c/em\u003e episode.) \u003cem\u003eSuccession\u003c/em\u003e has won over critics, but Emmy voters like to vote for the buzzy show, and it may not have quite enough in the buzz department. Maybe next year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome dark horses in the drama category include BBC America\u0026#8217;s \u003cem\u003eKilling Eve\u003c/em\u003e and FX\u0026#8217;s \u003cem\u003ePose\u003c/em\u003e. They\u0026#8217;re unlikely to win, but if it shockingly doesn\u0026#8217;t go to \u003cem\u003eGame of Thrones\u003c/em\u003e or \u003cem\u003eSuccession\u003c/em\u003e, we think it\u0026#8217;ll be one of those two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eHBO vs. Netflix vs. everyone else\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast year, Netflix briefly stole HBO\u0026#8217;s long-running spot as the most-nominated network. But HBO won the title back this year with a whopping 137 total nominations (20 more than Netflix)—mostly thanks to \u003cem\u003eGame of Thrones\u003c/em\u003e, which wasn\u0026#8217;t eligible in 2018. NBC placed a distant third in the nominations rankings this year with 58.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter last weekend\u0026#8217;s Creative Arts Emmys (the section of the Emmys that honors behind-the-scenes categories like editing, costumes, production design, etc.), HBO narrowly leads Netflix in wins, 25 to 23—again, thanks to \u003cem\u003eThrones\u003c/em\u003e, which won 10 on its own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNetflix\u0026#8217;s best chance of surpassing HBO\u0026#8217;s number of total wins will be if its miniseries \u003cem\u003eWhen They See Us\u003c/em\u003e cleans up in the 11 categories it\u0026#8217;s nominated for. The streaming service could also use strong showings from the comedy \u003cem\u003eRussian Doll\u003c/em\u003e and drama \u003cem\u003eOzark\u003c/em\u003e, though, to be honest, does anyone remember what happened on the last season of \u003cem\u003eOzark\u003c/em\u003e?

It has won the award three times already (2015-2017), and Emmy voters might relish the opportunity to give it one more trophy on its way out the door.

These prompts tell you how many times the app has used your location in the background—meaning, asked your iPhone where you were, when you weren\u0026#8217;t using the app—and show you what that looks like on a map. The map essentially recreates the app\u0026#8217;s view of your activity and can help reveal if you\u0026#8217;re being tracked constantly or just every once in a while. This can give you a better sense of what\u0026#8217;s going on, if it seems appropriate for the app\u0026#8217;s purpose, and whether you feel comfortable with that activity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"attachment_1713618\" style=\"width: 330px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"\u003e\u003cimg aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1713618\" class=\"wp-image-1713618 size-hero-s\" src=\"https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_1020.png?w=320\" alt=\"Notification showing that the app Citizen used the author's location in the background 32 times over the prior 3 days\" width=\"320\" height=\"406\" srcset=\"https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_1020.png 828w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_1020.png?resize=768,974 768w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_1020.png?resize=50,63 50w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_1020.png?resize=160,203 160w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_1020.png?resize=320,406 320w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_1020.png?resize=640,812 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" /\u003e\u003cp id=\"caption-attachment-1713618\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"\u003eYikes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor instance, while testing iOS 13 this summer, I noticed that \u003ca href=\"https://citizen.com\"\u003eCitizen\u003c/a\u003e, which crowdsources crime reports, was accessing my location far more frequently than other apps, like Google Maps, that I trust more.

But that kind of data collection is largely invisible to most people, which makes it difficult to make decisions about what tracking is acceptable and what crosses the line. Even with the new types of permissions and alerts in iOS 13, it\u0026#8217;s still hard to know what an app is doing with the knowledge of where you are at all times. If you give an app permission to access your location, you should assume that data will be recorded for posterity, shared with other companies, and used in ways you didn\u0026#8217;t expect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShould you change your mind about any of these permissions, you can do that in the Settings app under Privacy and Location Services.

The stately elms, chestnuts and birches that were favored by French royalty are being selectively replaced by species that stand better chances of resisting higher temperatures, new parasites and more volatile precipitation patterns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe urgency to act was underscored when France\u0026rsquo;s National Center for Scientific Research on Tuesday released a \u003ca href=\"https://time.com/5669022/climate-change-2050/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eclimate model\u003c/a\u003e that showed the world becoming even hotter than previously expected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrees are one of nature\u0026rsquo;s biggest forms of carbon storage. The European Environment Agency estimates forests absorb 13% of all of the European Union\u0026rsquo;s carbon-dioxide emissions. But more frequent droughts and increasingly violent storms put the region\u0026rsquo;s woodlands at risk. \u0026ldquo;Trees used to have hundreds of years to adapt, but they don\u0026rsquo;t have that time anymore,\u0026rdquo; said Xavier Bartet, an officer in France\u0026rsquo;s National Forestry Agency. \u0026ldquo;And in nature, if you can\u0026rsquo;t adapt, you die.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"inline-portrait_small_2x aligncenter \"\u003e\u003cimg data-attachment-id=\"5683061\" data-permalink=\"https://time.com/5682965/climate-change-versailles-palace-gardens/antique-illustration-of-grand-trianon/\" data-orig-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/trianon-versailles-climate-change.jpg?quality=85\" data-orig-size=\"2506,1197\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"ilbusca\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Antique illustration of Grand Trianon\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"Getty Images\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"Antique illustration of Grand Trianon\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Antique illustration of Grand Trianon\" data-image-description=\"pAn antique illustration of the Grand Trianon/p\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/trianon-versailles-climate-change.jpg?quality=85\u0026w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/trianon-versailles-climate-change.jpg?quality=85\u0026w=600\" src=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/trianon-versailles-climate-change.jpg?w=560\u0026#038;quality=85\u0026#038;h=267\" alt=\"Antique illustration of Grand Trianon\" height=\"267\"\u003e\n\u003cfigcaption class=\"image-caption\" \u003e\u003cspan class=\"credit\" \u003eGetty Images\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"caption\" \u003eAn antique illustration of the Grand Trianon\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe effects are being felt across Europe. About 50 million spruce trees are believed to have perished, with extensive damage to larch, oak, beech and pine varieties, according to Gert-Jan Nabuurs, forestry expert at Wageningen University in the Netherlands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn eastern Germany, pine canopies have been bleached a sickly brown with ground water the lowest since records began in 1961, according to the country\u0026rsquo;s DWD weather service. Charred stumps point to a disturbing new trend of wildfires. The BDF forestry association estimates 100 million German trees have died in droughts and storms since 2018.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEurope is particularly exposed to climate change, because its weather is dominated by the jet stream. The flow of moist winds from the Atlantic typically brings in ample precipitation to maintain the region\u0026rsquo;s ecosystem, but kinks have developed as arctic ice melts, causing air to blow in from the Sahara with increasing regularity. Warmer temperatures are changing growing patterns, with chestnut trees in Portugal struggling in lower altitudes, where they once thrived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStorms fueled by warmer temperatures are also a problem. The risks were evident last October, when the Italian peninsula was pounded by storm gusts exceeding 200 kilometers an hour (124 mph), damaging 42,500 hectares of forest. The Comelico Dam near the Austrian border was covered with trees battered into the Piave river. For centuries, such timber was brought to Venice on rafts to be used for foundations of the lagoon city\u0026rsquo;s historic \u0026ldquo;palazzi.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo be sure, it\u0026rsquo;s not bad everywhere. Sweden has planted more trees than it cuts down since the 1920s, and today there is almost twice as much wood supply than at the start of 20th century, but then there\u0026rsquo;s the new problem of wildfires. In Finland, climate change is speeding up tree growth, but the Nordic country \u0026mdash; wary of extreme weather and the spread of pests such as bark beetle \u0026mdash; is more actively managing its timber resources including using selectively bred seedlings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDying woodlands could mean that greenhouse gases build up even faster. Concerns have led to mounting public pressure. A Danish broadcaster held a telethon last weekend, raising 2.4 million euros ($2.6 million) from viewers to plant more than 900,000 trees, and an artist created a mock forest inside a football stadium in Austria to raise awareness. Ursula von der Leyen, the incoming European Commission president, called protecting the environment the bloc\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;most pressing challenge.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile European leaders have vowed to act, the situation is complicated by an economic slowdown and concerns about financing. In Germany \u0026mdash; where a summer heatwave threatened to buckle highways and the receding Rhine river risked halting shipping for the second straight year \u0026mdash; Chancellor Angela Merkel\u0026rsquo;s government on Friday is due to decide on measures to get its climate goals back on track.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s no easy fix. Efforts to make forests more robust include replanting Turkish oak trees in France and testing seeds from drier areas in the central Loire valley for future wine barrels. But the measures are a crapshoot. At Versailles, about 50% of new saplings die in the first year, and messing with local ecosystems can have damaging effects on native varieties, with groups like Ireland\u0026rsquo;s Woodland League seeking to halt the introduction of new species.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;All we do is still experimental, and it\u0026rsquo;s risky,\u0026rdquo; said Brigitte Musch, chief of climate-change research for the French forestry agency. \u0026ldquo;We are under pressure to work fast, for things that will matter for the generations to come.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"inline-portrait_small_2x aligncenter \"\u003e\u003cimg data-attachment-id=\"5683063\" data-permalink=\"https://time.com/5682965/climate-change-versailles-palace-gardens/putti-statue-in-the-versailles-gardens/\" data-orig-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/versailles-gardens-climate-change-1.jpg?quality=85\" data-orig-size=\"5122,3415\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"DE AGOSTINI PICTURE LIBRARY\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Putti, statue in the Versailles gardens (UNESCO World Heritage List, 1979), France, 17th century.

The wider reality can be seen behind a rusty fence at the end of the grounds at the Arboretum de Chevreloup. The conservation park has a budget less than 5% of the palace\u0026rsquo;s, and the effects of low rainfall and record heat were evident in the balding canopies and shriveling Patagonia trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo avoid such a fate, France\u0026rsquo;s forestry agency is teaming up with counterparts in Europe and Turkey to develop software to determine what varieties will have to be planted in the years to come. The software, which is working with a worst-case scenario of summer temperatures rising as much as 5.3 degrees Celsius (below the latest forecast), will be translated in English to be usable by peers worldwide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt Versailles, future-proofing the grounds is being meticulously orchestrated. The estate is building a database of all its vegetation, insects and animals. The trees will be given more space to capture the water in the soil and retain humidity.

This was the ideal that guided Snowden into the NSA.

There are, generally speaking, three levels of security clearance in the American Intelligence Community, or IC: from low to high, confidential, secret, and top secret. The last of these can be further extended with a Sensitive Compartmented Information qualifier, creating the coveted TS/SCI access required by positions with the top-tier agencies — CIA and NSA. The TS/SCI was by far the hardest access to get, but also opened the most doors, and so I went back to Anne Arundel Community College while I searched for jobs that would sponsor my application for the grueling background investigation the clearance required. The approval process for a TS/SCI can take a year or more. All it involves is filling out some paperwork, then sitting around with your feet up and trying not to commit too many crimes while the federal government renders its verdict.

I was a kid from a service family, nearly every adult member of which had some level of clearance; I’d tried to enlist and fight for my country until an unfortunate accident had laid me low.

My only financial debt was the student loan for my Microsoft certification, and I hadn’t yet missed a payment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNone of this stopped me, of course, from being nervous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drove to and from classes at community college as the National Background Investigations Bureau rummaged through nearly every aspect of my life and interviewed almost everyone I knew: my parents, my extended family, my classmates and friends. They went through my spotty school transcripts and, I’m sure, spoke to a few of my teachers. I got the impression that they even spoke to a guy I’d worked with one summer at a snow cone stand at Six Flags America. The goal of all this background checking was not only to find out what I’d done wrong, but also to find out how I might be compromised or blackmailed. The most important thing to the IC is not that you’re 100 percent perfectly clean, because if that were the case, they wouldn’t hire anybody. Instead, it’s that you’re robotically honest — that there’s no dirty secret out there that you’re hiding that could be used against you, and thus against the agency, by an enemy power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[1](%7B%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22right%22%7D) --\u003e\u003cblockquote class=\"stylized pull-right\" data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"right\"\u003e\u003c!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[1] --\u003eI didn’t want to live in a world where everyone had to pretend that they were perfect, because that was a world that had no place for me or my friends.\u003c!-- END-CONTENT(pullquote)[1] --\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c!-- END-BLOCK(pullquote)[1] --\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis, of course, set me thinking — sitting stuck in traffic as all the moments of my life that I regretted went spinning around in a loop inside my head. Nothing I could come up with would have raised even an iota of eyebrow from investigators who are used to finding out that the middle-aged analyst at a think tank likes to wear diapers and get spanked by grandmothers in leather. Still, there was a paranoia that the process created, because you don’t have to be a closet fetishist to have done things that embarrass you and to fear that strangers might misunderstand you if those things were exposed. I mean, I grew up on the Internet, for Christ’s sake. If you haven’t entered something shameful or gross into that search box, then you haven’t been online very long — though I wasn’t worried about the pornography. Everybody looks at porn, and for those of you who are shaking your heads, don’t worry: Your secret is safe with me. My worries were more personal, or felt more personal: the endless conveyor belt of stupid jingoistic things I’d said, and the even stupider misanthropic opinions I’d abandoned, in the process of growing up online. Specifically, I was worried about my chat logs and forum posts, all the supremely moronic commentary that I’d sprayed across a score of gaming and hacker sites. Writing pseudonymously had meant writing freely, but often thoughtlessly. And since a major aspect of early Internet culture was competing with others to say the most inflammatory thing, I’d never hesitate to advocate, say, bombing a country that taxed video games, or corralling people who didn’t like anime into reeducation camps. Nobody on those sites took any of it seriously, least of all myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I went back and reread the posts, I cringed. Half the things I’d said I hadn’t even meant at the time — I’d just wanted attention — but I didn’t fancy my odds of explaining that to a gray-haired man in horn-rimmed glasses peering over a giant folder labeled PERMANENT RECORD. The other half, the things I think I had meant at the time, were even worse, because I wasn’t that kid anymore. I’d grown up. It wasn’t simply that I didn’t recognize the voice as my own — it was that I now actively opposed its overheated, hormonal opinions. I found that I wanted to argue with a ghost. I wanted to fight with that dumb, puerile, and casually cruel self of mine who no longer existed. I couldn’t stand the idea of being haunted by him forever, but I didn’t know the best way how to express my remorse and put some distance between him and me, or whether I should even try to do that. It was heinous, to be so inextricably, technologically bound to a past that I fully regretted but barely remembered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis might be the most familiar problem of my generation, the first to grow up online. We were able to discover and explore our identities almost totally unsupervised, with hardly a thought spared for the fact that our rash remarks and profane banter were being preserved for perpetuity, and that one day we might be expected to account for them. I’m sure everyone who had an Internet connection before they had a job can sympathize with this — surely everyone has that one post that embarrasses them, or that text or email that could get them fired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy situation was somewhat different, however, in that most of the message boards of my day would let you delete your old posts. I could put together one tiny little script — not even a real program — and all of my posts would be gone in under an hour. It would’ve been the easiest thing in the world to do. Trust me, I considered it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut ultimately, I couldn’t. Something kept preventing me. It just felt wrong. To blank my posts from the face of the earth wasn’t illegal, and it wouldn’t even have made me ineligible for a security clearance had anyone found out. But the prospect of doing so bothered me nonetheless. It would’ve only served to reinforce some of the most corrosive precepts of online life: that nobody is ever allowed to make a mistake, and anybody who does make a mistake must answer for it forever. What mattered to me wasn’t so much the integrity of the written record but that of my soul. I didn’t want to live in a world where everyone had to pretend that they were perfect, because that was a world that had no place for me or my friends. To erase those comments would have been to erase who I was, where I was from, and how far I’d come. To deny my younger self would have been to deny my present self’s validity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI decided to leave the comments up and figure out how to live with them. I even decided that true fidelity to this stance would require me to continue posting. In time, I’d outgrow these new opinions, too, but my initial impulse remains unshakable, if only because it was an important step in my own maturity. We can’t erase the things that shame us, or the ways we’ve shamed ourselves, online.

I suspect this is because I’d had to write them with the expectation that their words truly mattered — since the entire purpose of the enterprise was for somebody in Real Life to actually care about them, and, by extension, about me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’d joined a website called HotOrNot.com, which was the most popular of the rating sites of the early 2000s, like RateMyFace and AmIHot. (Their most effective features were combined by a young Mark Zuckerberg into a site called FaceMash, which later became Facebook.) HotOrNot was the most popular of these pre-Facebook rating sites for a simple reason: It was the best of the few that had a dating component.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBasically, how it worked was that users voted on each other’s photos: Hot or Not. An extra function for registered users such as myself was the ability to contact other registered users, if each had rated the other’s photos Hot and clicked “Meet Me.” This banal and crass process is how I met Lindsay Mills, my partner and the love of my life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking at the photos now, I’m amused to find that 19-year-old Lindsay was gawky, awkward, and endearingly shy. To me at the time, though, she was a smoldering blonde, absolutely volcanic. What’s more, the photos themselves were beautiful: They had a serious artistic quality, self-portraits more than selfies. They caught the eye and held it. They played coyly with light and shade. They even had a hint of meta fun: there was one taken inside the photo lab where she worked, and another where she wasn’t even facing the camera.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rated her Hot, a perfect 10. To my surprise, we matched (she rated me an eight, the angel), and in no time we were chatting. Lindsay was studying fine art photography. She had her own website, where she kept a journal and posted more shots: forests, flowers, abandoned factories, and — my favorite — more of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scoured the Web and used each new fact I found about her to create a fuller picture: the town she was born in (Laurel, Maryland), her school’s name (MICA, the Maryland Institute College of Art). Eventually, I admitted to cyberstalking her. I felt like a creep, but Lindsay cut me off. “I’ve been searching about you, too, mister,” she said, and rattled off a list of facts about me. She’d checked my email address against dozens of sites, figuring out which ones I’d registered on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[3](%7B%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22none%22%7D) --\u003e\u003cblockquote class=\"stylized pull-none\" data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"none\"\u003e\u003c!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[3] --\u003eI felt like a creep, but Lindsay cut me off. “I’ve been searching about you, too, mister.”\u003c!-- END-CONTENT(pullquote)[3] --\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c!-- END-BLOCK(pullquote)[3] --\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese were among the sweetest words I’d ever heard, yet I was reluctant to see her in person. We scheduled a date, and as the days ticked down my nervousness grew. It’s a scary proposition, to take an online relationship offline. It would be scary even in a world without ax murderers and scammers. In my experience, the more you’ve communicated with someone online, the more disappointed you’ll be by meeting them in person. Things that are the easiest to say on-screen become the most difficult to say face-to-face. Distance favors intimacy: No one talks more openly than when they’re alone in a room, chatting with an unseen someone alone in a different room. Meet that person, however, and you lose your latitude. Your talk becomes safer and tamer, a common conversation on neutral ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnline, Lindsay and I had become total confidants, and I was afraid of losing our connection in person. In other words, I was afraid of being rejected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shouldn’t have been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLindsay — who’d insisted on driving — told me that she’d pick me up at my mother’s condo. The appointed hour found me standing outside in the twilight cold, guiding her by phone through the similarly named, identical-looking streets of my mother’s development. I was keeping an eye out for a gold ’98 Chevy Cavalier, when suddenly I was blinded, struck in the face by a beam of light from the curb. Lindsay was flashing her brights at me across the snow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Buckle up.” Those were the first words that Lindsay said to me in person, as I got into her car. Then she said, “What’s the plan?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s then that I realized that despite all the thinking I had been doing about her, I’d done no thinking whatsoever about our destination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I’d been in this situation with any other woman, I’d have improvised, covering for myself. But with Lindsay, it was different. With Lindsay, it didn’t matter. She drove us down her favorite road — she had a favorite road — and we talked until we ran out of miles on Guilford and ended up in the parking lot of the Laurel Mall. We just sat in her car and talked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was perfection. Talking face-to-face turned out to be just an extension of all our phone calls, emails, and chats. Our first date was a continuation of our first contact online and the start of a conversation that will last as long as we will. We talked about our families, or what was left of them. Lindsay’s parents were also divorced: Her mother and father lived 20 minutes apart, and as a kid Lindsay had been shuttled back and forth between them. She’d lived out of a bag. Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays she slept in her room at her mother’s house. Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays she slept in her room at her father’s house. Sundays were the dramatic day, because she had to choose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe told me how bad my taste was and criticized my date apparel: a button-down shirt decorated with metallic flames over a wifebeater and jeans (I’m sorry). She told me about the two other guys she was dating, whom she’d already mentioned online, and Machiavelli would’ve blushed at the ways in which I set about undermining them (I’m not sorry). I told her everything, too, including the fact that I wouldn’t be able to talk to her about my work — the work I hadn’t even started. This was ludicrously pretentious, which she made obvious to me by nodding gravely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI told her I was worried about the upcoming polygraph required for my clearance, and she offered to practice with me — a goofy kind of foreplay. The philosophy she lived by was the perfect training: Say what you want, say who you are, never be ashamed. If they reject you, it’s their problem. I’d never been so comfortable around someone, and I’d never been so willing to be called out for my faults.

She reminded me of a teacher I once had — and I spent much of the test trying to remember the teacher’s name, or trying not to. She, the polygrapher, began asking questions. The first ones were no-brainers: Was my name Edward Snowden? Was 6/21/83 my date of birth? Then: Had I ever committed a serious crime? Had I ever had a problem with gambling? Had I ever had a problem with alcohol or taken illegal drugs? Had I ever been an agent of a foreign power? Had I ever advocated the violent overthrow of the United States government?

They have built platforms 100 feet in the air in the canopies of trees and lived on them for weeks, months, or even years at a time. They have erected tripods to block logging roads and sat atop them, so that if the tripods were dismantled, they would face injury or death.

Deixe-me refrescar suas memórias sobre algumas de suas linhas mais icônicas. Para os negociadores climáticos da ONU na Polônia em dezembro passado, ela disse: “Você não é maduro o suficiente para dizer como é. Até esse fardo que você deixa para nós, crianças.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePara os deputados britânicos que pediram que ela falasse, ela perguntou: “Meu inglês está bom? O microfone está ligado?

Quero que você sinta o medo que sinto todos os dias. Eu quero que você aja. Quero que você aja como faria em uma crise. Quero que você aja como se a casa estivesse pegando fogo, porque está.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEla também disse que nem todos são os culpados pela crise climática. Não, ela os olhou nos olhos e disse que eles eram os culpados. E sempre a amaremos por isso.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMas Greta não é só conversa. Tudo isso começou com a ação. Começou quando Greta percebeu, um ano e um mês atrás, que se ela queria que políticos poderosos se colocassem em pé de emergência para combater as mudanças climáticas, então ela precisava refletir esse estado de emergência em sua própria vida. E então ela parou de fazer a única coisa que todas as crianças deveriam fazer quando tudo estava normal: ir à escola para se preparar para o futuro quando adultas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEm vez disso, ela se posicionou fora do parlamento da Suécia com uma placa feita à mão que dizia simplesmente: \u0026#8220;Greve escolar pelo clima\u0026#8221;. Ela começou a fazer isso toda sexta-feira e logo atraiu uma pequena multidão. Então outros estudantes começaram a fazer isso em outras cidades também.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEstudantes como Alexandria Villaseñor, que se posiciona fora das Nações Unidas nesta cidade toda sexta-feira, semana após semana, faça chuva, neve ou faça sol. Às vezes, as greves climáticas estudantis eram apenas uma criança solitária. Às vezes, dezenas de milhares apareciam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eE então, em 15 de março, veio a primeira greve global pelas escolas pelo clima. Mais de 2.000 greves em 125 países, com 1,6 milhão de jovens participando em um único dia. 1,6 milhão de pessoas. Isso é uma conquista e tanto para um movimento que começou oito meses antes com uma única menina de 15 anos em Estocolmo, Suécia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eE agora esse movimento está se preparando para o maior desafio de todos os tempos: eles pediram que pessoas de todas as idades participem e entrem em greve, em todo o mundo, em 20 de setembro. Porque proteger o futuro não é um esporte para espectadores.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThunberg e os muitos outros jovens ativistas deixaram bem claro que não querem que os adultos deem tapinhas na cabeça e agradeçam pela infusão de esperança.

The stately elms, chestnuts and birches that were favored by French royalty are being selectively replaced by species that stand better chances of resisting higher temperatures, new parasites and more volatile precipitation patterns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe urgency to act was underscored when France\u0026rsquo;s National Center for Scientific Research on Tuesday released a \u003ca href=\"https://time.com/5669022/climate-change-2050/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eclimate model\u003c/a\u003e that showed the world becoming even hotter than previously expected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrees are one of nature\u0026rsquo;s biggest forms of carbon storage. The European Environment Agency estimates forests absorb 13% of all of the European Union\u0026rsquo;s carbon-dioxide emissions. But more frequent droughts and increasingly violent storms put the region\u0026rsquo;s woodlands at risk. \u0026ldquo;Trees used to have hundreds of years to adapt, but they don\u0026rsquo;t have that time anymore,\u0026rdquo; said Xavier Bartet, an officer in France\u0026rsquo;s National Forestry Agency. \u0026ldquo;And in nature, if you can\u0026rsquo;t adapt, you die.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"inline-portrait_small_2x aligncenter \"\u003e\u003cimg data-attachment-id=\"5683061\" data-permalink=\"https://time.com/5682965/climate-change-versailles-palace-gardens/antique-illustration-of-grand-trianon/\" data-orig-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/trianon-versailles-climate-change.jpg?quality=85\" data-orig-size=\"2506,1197\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"ilbusca\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Antique illustration of Grand Trianon\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"Getty Images\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"Antique illustration of Grand Trianon\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Antique illustration of Grand Trianon\" data-image-description=\"pAn antique illustration of the Grand Trianon/p\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/trianon-versailles-climate-change.jpg?quality=85\u0026w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/trianon-versailles-climate-change.jpg?quality=85\u0026w=600\" src=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/trianon-versailles-climate-change.jpg?w=560\u0026#038;quality=85\u0026#038;h=267\" alt=\"Antique illustration of Grand Trianon\" height=\"267\"\u003e\n\u003cfigcaption class=\"image-caption\" \u003e\u003cspan class=\"credit\" \u003eGetty Images\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"caption\" \u003eAn antique illustration of the Grand Trianon\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe effects are being felt across Europe. About 50 million spruce trees are believed to have perished, with extensive damage to larch, oak, beech and pine varieties, according to Gert-Jan Nabuurs, forestry expert at Wageningen University in the Netherlands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn eastern Germany, pine canopies have been bleached a sickly brown with ground water the lowest since records began in 1961, according to the country\u0026rsquo;s DWD weather service. Charred stumps point to a disturbing new trend of wildfires. The BDF forestry association estimates 100 million German trees have died in droughts and storms since 2018.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEurope is particularly exposed to climate change, because its weather is dominated by the jet stream. The flow of moist winds from the Atlantic typically brings in ample precipitation to maintain the region\u0026rsquo;s ecosystem, but kinks have developed as arctic ice melts, causing air to blow in from the Sahara with increasing regularity. Warmer temperatures are changing growing patterns, with chestnut trees in Portugal struggling in lower altitudes, where they once thrived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStorms fueled by warmer temperatures are also a problem. The risks were evident last October, when the Italian peninsula was pounded by storm gusts exceeding 200 kilometers an hour (124 mph), damaging 42,500 hectares of forest. The Comelico Dam near the Austrian border was covered with trees battered into the Piave river. For centuries, such timber was brought to Venice on rafts to be used for foundations of the lagoon city\u0026rsquo;s historic \u0026ldquo;palazzi.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo be sure, it\u0026rsquo;s not bad everywhere. Sweden has planted more trees than it cuts down since the 1920s, and today there is almost twice as much wood supply than at the start of 20th century, but then there\u0026rsquo;s the new problem of wildfires. In Finland, climate change is speeding up tree growth, but the Nordic country \u0026mdash; wary of extreme weather and the spread of pests such as bark beetle \u0026mdash; is more actively managing its timber resources including using selectively bred seedlings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDying woodlands could mean that greenhouse gases build up even faster. Concerns have led to mounting public pressure. A Danish broadcaster held a telethon last weekend, raising 2.4 million euros ($2.6 million) from viewers to plant more than 900,000 trees, and an artist created a mock forest inside a football stadium in Austria to raise awareness. Ursula von der Leyen, the incoming European Commission president, called protecting the environment the bloc\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;most pressing challenge.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile European leaders have vowed to act, the situation is complicated by an economic slowdown and concerns about financing. In Germany \u0026mdash; where a summer heatwave threatened to buckle highways and the receding Rhine river risked halting shipping for the second straight year \u0026mdash; Chancellor Angela Merkel\u0026rsquo;s government on Friday is due to decide on measures to get its climate goals back on track.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s no easy fix. Efforts to make forests more robust include replanting Turkish oak trees in France and testing seeds from drier areas in the central Loire valley for future wine barrels. But the measures are a crapshoot. At Versailles, about 50% of new saplings die in the first year, and messing with local ecosystems can have damaging effects on native varieties, with groups like Ireland\u0026rsquo;s Woodland League seeking to halt the introduction of new species.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;All we do is still experimental, and it\u0026rsquo;s risky,\u0026rdquo; said Brigitte Musch, chief of climate-change research for the French forestry agency. \u0026ldquo;We are under pressure to work fast, for things that will matter for the generations to come.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"inline-portrait_small_2x aligncenter \"\u003e\u003cimg data-attachment-id=\"5683063\" data-permalink=\"https://time.com/5682965/climate-change-versailles-palace-gardens/putti-statue-in-the-versailles-gardens/\" data-orig-file=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/versailles-gardens-climate-change-1.jpg?quality=85\" data-orig-size=\"5122,3415\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"DE AGOSTINI PICTURE LIBRARY\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Putti, statue in the Versailles gardens (UNESCO World Heritage List, 1979), France, 17th century.

The wider reality can be seen behind a rusty fence at the end of the grounds at the Arboretum de Chevreloup. The conservation park has a budget less than 5% of the palace\u0026rsquo;s, and the effects of low rainfall and record heat were evident in the balding canopies and shriveling Patagonia trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo avoid such a fate, France\u0026rsquo;s forestry agency is teaming up with counterparts in Europe and Turkey to develop software to determine what varieties will have to be planted in the years to come. The software, which is working with a worst-case scenario of summer temperatures rising as much as 5.3 degrees Celsius (below the latest forecast), will be translated in English to be usable by peers worldwide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt Versailles, future-proofing the grounds is being meticulously orchestrated. The estate is building a database of all its vegetation, insects and animals. The trees will be given more space to capture the water in the soil and retain humidity. The goal is to keep the spirit of the Sun King\u0026rsquo;s grandeur alive into the next century.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Visually, the palace visitors won\u0026rsquo;t see any major changes,\u0026rdquo; said Baraton, the chief gardener. \u0026ldquo;But silently everything is changing.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/time/world/~4/6ywGpabE2ds\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/world/~3/6ywGpabE2ds/","published":"2019-09-21T00:36:30Z","guid":"http://time.com/?p=5682965"},{"title":"Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Says It’s Ready for ‘Any Scenario’ Amid U.S. Tensions","content":"\u003caside class=\"right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"right-rail__ad\" id=\"right-rail__ad-5683186\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module video-2\" data-src=\"https://time.com/5683186/iran-us-tensions-saudi-oil-attack/\" data-widget-id=\"SB_4\" data-ob-template=\"timemag\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(TEHRAN, Iran) \u0026mdash; Iran\u0026#8217;s powerful Revolutionary Guard is ready for combat and \u0026#8220;any scenario,\u0026#8221; its chief commander said Saturday, as the country\u0026#8217;s nuclear deal with world powers collapses and the U.S. alleged Iran was behind a weekend attack on major oil sites in Saudi Arabia that shook global energy markets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIran has denied involvement in the Sept. 14 attack that was initially claimed by Yemen\u0026#8217;s Iranian-backed Houthi rebels.

Rather, they fall outside of the purview or competence of the Security Council resolution and its annexes (S/2015/550).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe continue to firmly reject the desperate attempts by the United States for the arbitrary reinterpretation of paragraph 3 of annex B to resolution 2231 (2015), including through invoking the definition of the Missile Technology Control Regime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is no implicit or explicit reference in that paragraph either to the Missile Technology Control Regime itself or to its definitions and, thus, any reference thereto is totally misleading. Moreover, while the Missile Technology Control Regime criteria are not legally binding, even for its 35 members, any attempt to portray them as the universally agreed definition is definitively premature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs stated in the report of the Secretary-General (A/57/229), “there is no universally accepted norm or instrument specifically governing the development, testing, production, acquisition, transfer, deployment or use of missiles.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoreover, when the previous missile launches by Iran were discussed, “there was no consensus in the Security Council on how this particular launch related to resolution 2231 (2015)” (S/2017/515).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdditionally, while the United States, by its unlawful withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action and its subsequent policies and practices, has materially breached resolution 2231 (2015), its call for reimposing the restrictions contained in Security Council resolution 1929 (2010) \u0026#8212; which is a terminated and, in fact, dead resolution \u0026#8212; is ironic. Likewise, it is hypocritical that the United States, which arrogantly continues to threaten other States either to violate resolution 2231 (2015) or face punishment, is calling for the full implementation of that resolution. If the implementation of resolution 2231 (2015) matters for the United States, it should end violating it itself and also stop forcing other States to violate that resolution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdditionally, the reference by the United States to “existing sanctions on Iran” is misleading and legally void as there are only certain restrictions, not “sanctions” within the context of resolution 2231 (2015).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, when the United States, a permanent member of the Security Council, chooses to defy the Council’s resolutions repeatedly without consequence, it seriously undermines the fundamental credibility of the Council.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf unchecked, such policies and practices of the United States would further erode the credibility of the Security Council, which already faces a severe trust and confidence deficit due to such irresponsible policies of that country. Therefore, we once again call upon the international community to hold the United States accountable for its actions. In this context, we ask that the Secretary-General take actions of the United States as described in the present letter into account in his upcoming report on the implementation of resolution 2231 (2015).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would also like to reiterate that Iran has not conducted any activity inconsistent with paragraph 3 of annex B to resolution 2231 (2015), and accordingly, it is determined to resolutely continue its activities related to ballistic missiles and space launch vehicles, both of which are its inherent rights under international law and are necessary for securing its security as well as socioeconomic interests, respectively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, since Iran’s activities related to space launch vehicles and ballistic missiles fall outside the purview or competence of resolution 2231 (2015) and its annexes, the Secretary-General is therefore expected to seriously avoid reporting on Iran’s such activities in his next reports on the implementation of that resolution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeizing this opportunity, I would also like to categorically reject the allegations against Iran made by the Permanent Representative of the United States at the 8619th meeting of the Security Council on 16 September 2019 (S/PV.8619).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt has become a standard practice of certain officials of the United States who, following any incident \u0026#8212; no matter where and by whom – without exception, immediately and without any investigation and evidence, declare Iran as the culprit. This “maximum deception” campaign is in line with and a living example of the so-called “maximum pressure” policy of the United States against Iran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is evident that no amount of smear campaign, disinformation and deception against Iran can change the realities about the illegal practices and irresponsible policies of the United States or distract attention away from its destructive policies, malign behavior and destabilizing measures, in particular in the Middle East. Instead of such futile attempts and baseless allegations, the United States must stop exporting an unprecedented amount of sophisticated weaponry to the Middle East, which are used including for death and destruction in Yemen by the closest regional allies of the United States.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI should be grateful if you would have the present letter circulated as a document of the Security Council.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlease accept, Excellency, the assurances of my highest consideration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe post \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ifpnews.com/iran-rejects-us-claims-in-letter-to-un-chief-unsc\"\u003eIran Rejects US Claims in Letter to UN Chief, UNSC\u003c/a\u003e appeared first on \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ifpnews.com\"\u003eIran Front Page\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://ifpnews.com/iran-rejects-us-claims-in-letter-to-un-chief-unsc","published":"2019-09-21T05:57:06Z","guid":"https://ifpnews.com/?p=151942"},{"title":"No New Deal with US Given Trump’s Mixed Policy: Iran","content":"\u003cp\u003e“We are witnessing a state of confusion in America’s foreign policy toward the Islamic Republic of Iran.

blamed Iran for last Saturday\u0026#8217;s air raids on two major Saudi oil facilities, had retaliated against Hudaydah in violation of a UN-brokered ceasefire agreement signed in Stockholm in December 2018.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUS Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, without evidence, was also quick to blame Iran for the brazen attack. The claim drew ridicule from many social media users

2018.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn Saturday, Pompeo said Washington and its allies were seeking a “peaceful resolution” with Iran, marking a significant cooling of rhetoric after Donald Trump had
