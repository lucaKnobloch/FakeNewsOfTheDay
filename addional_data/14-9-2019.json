As group chief executive of BP from 1995 to 2007, he led the company through a period of major expansion. Browne studied physics at Cambridge, and received an MS from Stanford. He is chairman of the Francis Crick Institute on genetic research, and chairman of the Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering.

Boone Pickens Changed the Oil Business—and Every Business","content":"\n\u003cp\u003eThe Texas oil patch is reeling from the loss of one of its most colorful characters—T. Boone Pickens. The oilman and investor, known for his folksy character and razor-sharp wit, died Wednesday at the age of 91 at his home in Dallas. While he had recently closed his multi-billion dollar energy hedge fund, BP Capital, amid poor performance, Pickens continued his public crusade to end America\u0026#8217;s dependence on foreign oil through social media.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;I knew something was wrong when he didn\u0026#8217;t come into work on Monday,\u0026#8221; Jay Rosser, Boone\u0026#8217;s friend and longtime spokesman, told \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e. \u0026#8220;The man never missed a day of work—he was at the office every day.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePickens died around noon on Wednesday at his home in Dallas due to natural causes, Mr Rosser said. The once vibrant oil tycoon had suffered a number of strokes in recent years as well as what he said was a \u003ca href=\"http://linkedin.com/pulse/accepting-embracing-mortality-t-boone-pickens\"\u003e\u0026#8220;Texas-Sized\u0026#8221; fall \u003c/a\u003ein 2017, which required hospitalization. After that, Pickens started to wrap up his affairs, telling friends and family that he was now in the fourth-quarter of his life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eA business and political maverick, Pickens made both his name and fortune by challenging the establishment. He used his immense wealth to support a lavish lifestyle, which included mansions, private jets and a 65,000 acre ranch in the Texas panhandle. But after his fall, Pickens started to dismantle his empire, pledging to give away 90% of his wealth to causes and organizations dear to heart. He sold his Gulfstream G550 and put his beloved ranch up for sale—\u003ca href=\"https://www.texasmonthly.com/the-daily-post/t-boone-house/\"\u003efor $250 million\u003c/a\u003e (it is still on the market).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePickens personified the swashbuckling Texan oilman of folklore. He was loud, brash and uncompromising—part J.R. Ewing and part Carl Ichan. His Texas drawl and \u0026#8220;aw-shucks\u0026#8221; attitude lulled energy executives into a false sense of security. But make no mistake, Pickens understood both the science and the business of oil, making him a dangerous enemy in the boardroom.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eT. Boone Pickens\u0026#8217; early days\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eStarting out as a geologist at Phillips Petroleum, where his father worked as a lawyer, Pickens experienced first hand the waste and inefficiency that can plague a big oil company. Disillusioned and frustrated, he struck out on his own at 25, becoming a freelance consultant to wildcatters. Living out of his car, he would travel from wellhead to wellhead, charging $75 a day for his services. He eventually scraped together enough cash to form his own oil company, Mesa Petroleum, in 1956.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMesa was never a major player in the oil patch, it was simply too small to compete against the big boys, like Phillips. Furthermore, Pickens wasn\u0026#8217;t all that successful at drilling. The little money Mesa made was all too often sucked down by yet another dry hole.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eDrilling for oil in Texas proved too frustrating and expensive for Pickens, so in the early 1980s, the maverick oilman shifted his search to the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Instead of investing in new oil wells in the Permian Basin, Pickens would buy up shares in other oil companies. He would still be drilling for oil, but would now be doing it largely by proxy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNot much had changed at the large oil companies from the days when Pickens was a young buck at Philips. They were, in Pickens\u0026#8217; view, still bloated and inefficient bureaucracies. While they held the best acreage, most were barely profitable, which Pickens attributed to poor management.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“Chief executives, who themselves own few shares of their companies, have no more feeling for the average stockholder than they do for baboons in Africa,” Pickens told Time Magazine in 1985.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eDawn of the raiders\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePickens used his shares as leverage to force these managers to put the interests of shareholders first. Today, we call people like Pickens \u0026#8220;activist investors\u0026#8221; but back in the 1980s they were known as \u0026#8220;corporate raiders.\u0026#8221; Whatever the name, the tactic was revolutionary, forever changing the way companies interacted with their shareholders.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen a company ignored his requests, Pickens would often team up with other like-minded investors and attempt a hostile takeover of the company. While he never managed to acquire another company in this manner, he did force a few to seek refuge in the arms of an even bigger company, sending the value of his shares through the roof. His biggest payday came in 1985 with the acquisition of Gulf Oil by Standard Oil of California (SOCAL) in what was then the largest merger in US history. The deal netted Pickens and his investors $760 million, turning him from rich to super rich.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut in a cruel twist of fate, Pickens was himself ousted from Mesa in 1996 by shareholders who had lost faith in his ability to run the company. Pickens could have retired after such a humiliating defeat, but the wily oilman wasn\u0026#8217;t ready for the golf course just yet. Instead, he formed his own energy hedge fund, BP Capital, which made bets on energy prices. Here too, Pickens was a pioneer, as hedge funds were still in its infancy.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePickens rode the commodity supercycle in the early 2000s with aggressive and bullish bets, most of which paid off handsomely. He went from being a mere millionaire to a billionaire as oil and natural gas prices spiked. But BP capital suffered huge losses as energy prices collapsed during the financial crisis. The hedge fund survived, but returns shrank amid reduced volatility in the energy space.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eEnergy entrepreneur\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of retiring like many energy hedge fund managers did at the time, Pickens reinvented himself yet again, this time becoming an energy prophet. In 2008, as oil prices topped $147 a barrel, he launched the \u0026#8220;Pickens Plan,\u0026#8221; which was a call to action for Americans to take control of their energy future. At its heart, the Pickens Plan aimed to reduce America\u0026#8217;s dependence on foreign oil, namely oil coming from OPEC countries, such as Iran and Venezuela. One of its major tenets was to stop using gasoline and diesel as a transportation fuel and switch to natural gas, which the US has in abundance. The plan also called for major investments in wind power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, the Pickens Plan came at the wrong time—both oil and natural gas prices crashed soon after it was launched and today remains relatively weak thanks to the explosion in hydraulic fracturing that followed.

On a farm, cross-table conversation inevitably turns to the weather at some point, and as we discussed the recent stretch of heat, De Sutter gestured across the table to Guilloteau.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“Michelle started in the 1960s as a wine grower, and he has never seen this phenomena,” De Sutter says. From across the table, Guilloteau nodded in agreement.

Longer, hotter summers have in recent years forced growers to harvest their grapes earlier than in past decades, but the heat presents just one of an increasingly unpredictable range of threats to Cognac’s vast tracts of Ugni Blanc vineyards.

Some wines from cooler regions—like Germany’s Rieslings or Cabernet Francs from France’s Loire Valley—have benefitted, experiencing bumper crops from longer, warmer growing seasons. Elsewhere, growers and producers have begun taking unprecedented steps to mitigate the deleterious effects of what increasingly looks like a new normal. French winemakers haven’t experienced sustained heat and dry harvests like the ones they’re currently experiencing \u003ca href=\"https://www.clim-past.net/15/1485/2019/\"\u003esince\u003c/a\u003e the 16th century.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut it’s difficult to think of a region more susceptible to sustained changes in climate than Cognac, boxed in as it is by strict regulations, a requirement for consistency, and an overwhelming reliance on one singular grape varietal: Ugni Blanc. One extremely hot stretch of summer could ruin an entire vintage and put a serious dent in an industry whose retail sales grew 40 percent between 2013 and 2018, topping $5 billion according to figures from Euromonitor International. That potential has the entire Cognac region collaborating in search of ways to mitigate the risks, some of which may require it to change or abandon viticultural traditions reaching back centuries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eCognac is made by distilling a low-alcohol base wine made from Ugni Blanc into a high-alcohol grape spirit known as “eau de vie,” which is then aged in French oak barrels and blended by each producer into its own signature house cognac. Consistency is key; the quality of the product is so sacred to the region’s producers that over time they’ve crafted an extensive set of regulations governing its production. Not least of these regulations is geographic. Cognac and its ingredients must be produced in the Cognac region, meaning producers can’t relocate their operations or source their grapes from cooler regions and still label the resulting brandy as “cognac.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BNIC_1970.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2696910\" srcset=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BNIC_1970.jpg 3000w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BNIC_1970.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BNIC_1970.jpg?resize=300,168 300w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BNIC_1970.jpg?resize=768,429 768w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BNIC_1970.jpg?resize=1024,572 1024w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BNIC_1970.jpg?resize=281,157 281w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BNIC_1970.jpg?resize=900,503 900w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BNIC_1970.jpg?resize=100,56 100w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BNIC_1970.jpg?resize=60,34 60w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BNIC_1970.jpg?resize=154,86 154w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BNIC_1970.jpg?resize=701,392 701w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BNIC_1970.jpg?resize=392,219 392w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BNIC_1970.jpg?resize=252,141 252w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BNIC_1970.jpg?resize=697,390 697w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BNIC_1970.jpg?resize=234,131 234w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BNIC_1970.jpg?resize=500,280 500w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BNIC_1970.jpg?resize=578,323 578w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BNIC_1970.jpg?resize=600,335 600w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BNIC_1970.jpg?resize=90,50 90w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BNIC_1970.jpg?resize=107,60 107w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BNIC_1970.jpg?resize=220,123 220w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BNIC_1970.jpg?resize=115,64 115w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BNIC_1970.jpg?resize=880,492 880w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BNIC_1970.jpg?resize=892,499 892w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3000px) 100vw, 3000px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eVineyards in Juillac, a commune in Cognac, France.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"image-credit\"\u003eStéphane Charbeau\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eCognac’s regulations also restrict practices like the use of irrigation in fields or preservatives in the base wine, limiting the tools growers have to cope with drought and extreme summer heat. And while winemakers can roll with the seasonal punches climate change throws at them by playing up variations between vintages as unique expressions of each year’s growing season, cognac houses have no such luxury. Variations from one bottle to the next are viewed as flaws rather than desirable nuances, placing increased pressure on producers to somehow manage growing conditions to obtain an eau de vie with the right characteristics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“We need acidity and we need weather that’s not too hot,” says Patrice Pinet, Courvoisier’s master blender and president, who also heads the Syndicat des Maisons de Cognac, an industry body that coordinates between the region’s cognac producers. That high-acidity in the base wine is critical to making good cognac, and it’s why Ugni Blanc—a grape varietal uniquely suited to distillation—is planted almost exclusively across Cognac’s rolling hillsides.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut Ugni Blanc’s prized acidity declines in extreme heat, and longer summers only exacerbate the problem. In recent years growers have mitigated the issue by harvesting earlier, but further rises in average temperature would leave the industry in a precarious position. “Thirty years ago we were harvesting the grapes in the beginning of October,” Pinet says. “Now we are collecting the grapes mid-September. If it continues to go like this, and we have to advance [the harvest] by another three weeks in 30 years, we have to be prepared for these conditions.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThough competitive in the marketplace, the region’s big producers like Hennessy, Martell, Rémy Martin, Rémy Cointreau, and Courvosier (owned by LVMH, Pernod Ricard, Rémy Cointreau, and Beam Suntory, respectively) are remarkably cooperative when it comes to shared technical challenges. In collaboration with BNIC, another cognac trade group, Martell has devoted a section of its greenhouse space and vineyards to experimental grape varietals, some of which are new hybrid grapes that Martell and BNIC hope will not only boost the region’s efforts at sustainable viticulture, but also stand up better to warmer conditions while maintaining high acidity. Courvoisier has likewise dedicated part of its own vineyards to experimentation. Most research is funded jointly—predominantly by the larger producers—and results are shared openly within the industry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eVarietals like Monbadon—a grape long considered uninteresting to winemakers due to its low sugar and high acidity—are getting a second look in a warming world, Pinet says. If grapes have to be collected earlier and earlier, Monbadon’s potential to produce a high acid, low alcohol wine could prove ideal, provided it can produce an eau de vie that meets the region’s high threshold for quality. Courvoisier produced its first eau de vie from the grape this year, though it will take at least three years in the barrel (and probably more) before the company will know if it’s a viable candidate for a quality cognac.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“We are able to move things along as long as we are able to ensure quality,” says Martell Vice President Pierre Joncourt. “Everyone is aligned, but you can’t do it quickly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BNIC_2294.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2696913\" srcset=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BNIC_2294.jpg 3000w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BNIC_2294.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BNIC_2294.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BNIC_2294.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BNIC_2294.jpg?resize=1024,683 1024w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BNIC_2294.jpg?resize=281,188 281w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BNIC_2294.jpg?resize=754,503 754w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BNIC_2294.jpg?resize=100,67 100w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BNIC_2294.jpg?resize=60,40 60w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BNIC_2294.jpg?resize=154,103 154w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BNIC_2294.jpg?resize=590,394 590w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BNIC_2294.jpg?resize=392,262 392w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BNIC_2294.jpg?resize=252,168 252w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BNIC_2294.jpg?resize=697,465 697w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BNIC_2294.jpg?resize=234,156 234w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BNIC_2294.jpg?resize=500,333 500w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BNIC_2294.jpg?resize=578,385 578w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BNIC_2294.jpg?resize=600,400 600w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BNIC_2294.jpg?resize=90,60 90w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BNIC_2294.jpg?resize=184,123 184w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BNIC_2294.jpg?resize=115,77 115w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BNIC_2294.jpg?resize=737,492 737w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BNIC_2294.jpg?resize=776,518 776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3000px) 100vw, 3000px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eSpringtime in the vineyards of Cognac.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"image-credit\"\u003eFabrice Schack\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf temperatures continue trending upward that long-term research could prove prescient—though it may not be enough, says Spiros Malandrakis, an alcoholic beverage industry analyst at Euromonitor. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“Medium- and long-term, there is no doubt that these issues will try to be mitigated through alternative grape varieties that are more resistant, or tech that will to a degree protect this specific area for cognac,” Malandrakis says.

Smoky and spicy, with the hint of seawater sweetness, the prepared clams taste not unlike a taking a deep breath of saltwater air on the beach near the bonfire that cooked the clams. And it’s a flavor locals have likely been enjoying for thousands of years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;Who knows?\u0026#8221; says the third-generation proprietor of Loreto\u0026#8217;s \u003ca href=\"https://www.hoteloasis.com/en\"\u003eHotel Oasis\u003c/a\u003e, of whether the local Pericú tribe\u0026#8217;s middens (shell stacks) really show that they cooked the clams the same way she does now. It\u0026#8217;s a dish many visitors to Mexico\u0026#8217;s Baja Peninsula seek out, a famous culinary emblem of the region, and she is the guardian of the tradition, the keeper of the flame, so to speak. \u0026#8220;Why not be romantic, though?\u0026#8221; she asks, justifying her poetic license as she paints a picture of what a local museum director her told her about the possible long ago origins of the dish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe exact recipe that Benziger is cooking now, though, is one that goes back to at least her great-grandparents, who opened the Hotel Oasis in 1962. Families of Loreto would go to the beach and collect the clams as they played. Then they would bury them in the sand, mouth-side down, very close to each other, and top them with dried romerillo, which they lit on fire. “Any dry bush will cook them,” Benziger adds, but this one, which grows in the river nearby, also imparts flavor. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Solaz-Cabo-Tatemada-Clams-Fire.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Solaz Cabo Tatemada Clams Fire\" class=\"wp-image-2696799\" srcset=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Solaz-Cabo-Tatemada-Clams-Fire.jpg 2880w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Solaz-Cabo-Tatemada-Clams-Fire.jpg?resize=150,120 150w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Solaz-Cabo-Tatemada-Clams-Fire.jpg?resize=300,240 300w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Solaz-Cabo-Tatemada-Clams-Fire.jpg?resize=768,615 768w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Solaz-Cabo-Tatemada-Clams-Fire.jpg?resize=1024,820 1024w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Solaz-Cabo-Tatemada-Clams-Fire.jpg?resize=265,212 265w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Solaz-Cabo-Tatemada-Clams-Fire.jpg?resize=628,503 628w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Solaz-Cabo-Tatemada-Clams-Fire.jpg?resize=100,80 100w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Solaz-Cabo-Tatemada-Clams-Fire.jpg?resize=60,48 60w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Solaz-Cabo-Tatemada-Clams-Fire.jpg?resize=154,123 154w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Solaz-Cabo-Tatemada-Clams-Fire.jpg?resize=1349,1080 1349w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Solaz-Cabo-Tatemada-Clams-Fire.jpg?resize=492,394 492w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Solaz-Cabo-Tatemada-Clams-Fire.jpg?resize=392,314 392w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Solaz-Cabo-Tatemada-Clams-Fire.jpg?resize=210,168 210w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Solaz-Cabo-Tatemada-Clams-Fire.jpg?resize=581,465 581w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Solaz-Cabo-Tatemada-Clams-Fire.jpg?resize=195,156 195w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Solaz-Cabo-Tatemada-Clams-Fire.jpg?resize=416,333 416w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Solaz-Cabo-Tatemada-Clams-Fire.jpg?resize=481,385 481w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Solaz-Cabo-Tatemada-Clams-Fire.jpg?resize=600,480 600w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Solaz-Cabo-Tatemada-Clams-Fire.jpg?resize=90,72 90w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Solaz-Cabo-Tatemada-Clams-Fire.jpg?resize=75,60 75w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Solaz-Cabo-Tatemada-Clams-Fire.jpg?resize=115,92 115w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Solaz-Cabo-Tatemada-Clams-Fire.jpg?resize=615,492 615w, https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Solaz-Cabo-Tatemada-Clams-Fire.jpg?resize=647,518 647w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2880px) 100vw, 2880px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eFlames shoot skyward as the clams cook.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"image-credit\"\u003eCourtesy of Solaz Resorts\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the fire dies down, the clams are ready, and the picnicking families could drop the clams on hard rocks, causing them to fall open and letting people retrieve the meat from inside. As they didn’t necessarily have paper plates sitting around, they would eat them off flour tortillas, topped with mustard sauce. “The mustard sauce is what women from Loreto use to catch their husbands,” Benziger explains, particularly proud of her own, comprised of mayonnaise, mustard, jalapeño juice, salt, and pepper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTonight, the clams are buried in gravel on a large metal table, covered in \u003cem\u003eromerillo\u003c/em\u003e, and set alight.

Hard kombucha drinkers tend to be millennials, and according to many top brands, more women drink it than men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFlavor combinations often come in a duo aimed at two different audiences. Flavors like hibiscus, ginger, lavender, and goji are meant for the hard-core, nonalcoholic kombucha drinker who is willing to try an alcoholic variation. Lemon, lime, and berry, meanwhile, are more approachable and meant to lure in a broader group of drinkers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“We want to bring the strength of kombucha but make it less tip-of-the-spear wellness, because that’s scary to some people,” says Chelsea Phillips, vice president of marketing for Anheuser-Busch InBev’s Beyond Beer brands, which includes Kombrewcha. “We want to be the hard kombucha of the people.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe category remains tiny considering the total beer market is worth \u003ca href=\"https://www.brewersassociation.org/statistics-and-data/national-beer-stats/\"\u003e$114 billion\u003c/a\u003e, but with hard seltzers nearing the \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/05/31/hard-seltzer-drinks-rose/\"\u003e$1 billion mark\u003c/a\u003e, kombucha has a real chance to break out. Still, there should be a note of caution when ascertaining the trajectory of hard kombucha’s growth. Hard sodas proved to be a very quick fad. And in a tasting of several top hard-kombucha brands, this \u003cem\u003eFortune\u003c/em\u003e writer wasn’t convinced many consumers would want to drink more than one in a sitting. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“Hard soda was too sweet—it was gone as fast as it started,” says Phillips. Conversely, hard kombucha contains natural ingredients, lower sugar and calories, and probiotics.

With fuller flavors, AB InBev sees Kombrewcha as the perfect midweek, post-work drink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMany of the emerging kombucha brands are California-based, and thus far, most sales are focused in coastal states like California and New York. Brewers are starting to expand the category to other markets, with AB InBev adding \u003ca href=\"https://kombrewcha.com/\"\u003eKombrewcha\u003c/a\u003e to retail shelves in the Pacific Northwest and Colorado. Flying Embers started as a local Southern California brand but now is sold in 40 states and works with over 70 distributors. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd while three hard-seltzer brands—White Claw, Truly Hard Seltzer, and Bon \u0026amp; Viv Spiked Seltzer—have already gobbled up 90% of the market share, there is no corresponding dominance in hard kombucha.

Hard kombuchas are being sold as easy to drink during the day and as part of the lower-alcohol trend taking place across the beer, spirits, and wine categories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd while many brands have been aggressively marketing their alcoholic beverages as potential “wellness” drinks, some experts \u003ca href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2019/08/05/745729365/alcohol-wants-to-be-your-new-health-drink\"\u003earen’t buying it\u003c/a\u003e.

And, according to former\u0026nbsp;\u003ca rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2017/01/great-to-see-you-active-management-are-you-still-alive/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eVanguard CEO Bill McNabb\u003c/a\u003e, indexing in stocks and bonds globally represents less than 5% of global assets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eGiven that, it\u0026#8217;s not at all provocative to wonder: Why aren’t people more worried about active managers then? Surely, they\u0026#8217;re just as likely—if not more—to torpedo the markets. No?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eVanguard and iShares have experienced massive growth over the past two decades, seeing trillions of dollars worth of inflows. But this doesn’t mean indexing is a brand new phenomenon. It’s just being packaged in a cheaper wrapper now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eProfessional money managers have been closely tracking their benchmarks for decades now. The upshot? These index funds and ETFs are quickly becoming benchmarks of their own for active fund managers. Furthermore, very few actively managed funds deviate much from those benchmarks because being different eventually leads to under-performance. And that\u0026#8217;s what gets you fired in the asset management business. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eCareer risk may be one of the greatest market inefficiencies, one people seldom talk about. And because career risk is an enduring reality, closet indexing will be with us for some time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePensions and other large institutional investors add to the phenomenon. They have been creating their own index funds in-house for years. We’re just seeing a shift from the institutional practice of closet-indexing to a brimming marketplace for ETFs and other index funds as investors have wisened up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIsn’t it a good thing investors are shifting away from expensive closet index funds?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eActive funds literally own the market\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen you buy an index fund of the total stock market, you are literally buying the stock market in proportion to the shares held by all active investors. If you sum up the collective holdings of active managers, what you essentially get is a market-cap-weighted index. Index fund investors are simply buying what the active investors have laid out for them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePlus, we have to remember that not every cent flowing into index funds is going directly to the S\u0026amp;P 500 or a total market fund. Most of the money is going there but there are also index funds for small caps, mid caps, value, growth, sectors, themes, and everything in-between.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMany of the worries about indexing really boil down to career risk in the asset management space. By taking themselves out of the game through the direct purchase of index funds, there are now\u0026nbsp;\u003ca rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2015/12/fewer-suckers-at-the-poker-table/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003efewer suckers at the poker table\u003c/a\u003e\u0026nbsp;for the pros to take advantage of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIsn’t it a good thing then that most small investors have decided not to bother competing with the professional active managers who, it turns out, largely trade with one another?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePrice discovery is a cop-out\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0026#8217;t feel sorry for the active management community. It will never completely go out of business. It’s far too lucrative and tempting for type-A personalities to prove themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut people worry that as index funds continue to gain market share, the price-discovery mechanism could become fragile. This is nonsense. There’s plenty of price-discovery going on in the markets. In fact, you could probably make the case there’s too much of it these days. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFifty years ago or so, for example,  the entire trading volume of listed stocks on the New York Stock Exchange was 3 million shares. Today, \u003ca href=\"/fortune500/apple-3/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eApple\u003c/a\u003e has an average trading volume of roughly 26 million shares a day.

We don’t go to the grocery store to bid on prices of oranges against one another to set an equilibrium. The market does that for us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s also worth pointing out the success of indexing doesn’t mean all active management is inherently useless or bad. In fact, Vanguard itself still a ton of money in active funds. Here’s the breakdown of assets in index funds for the firm (also from Bogle’s book):\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"wp-block-image\"\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"aligncenter\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://awealthofcommonsense.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Annotation-2019-09-05-095559.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-27396\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe trend is easy to spot, but the firm still has more than $1 trillion in actively managed funds. They just happen to manage their active funds using strategies that employ low turnover, long holding periods, and lower than average fees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWouldn\u0026#8217;t it be a net positive then for the end investor should the surge in indexing force the asset management industry to adapt?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLiquidity is not a problem for index funds\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the big worries is what happens if everyone who has piled into these funds in recent years decides to reverse course and rush to the exits all at once? There will always be investors that panic when markets fall, regardless of the type of fund they\u0026#8217;re invested in. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen an index fund investor sells, they’re technically selling their holdings in direct proportion to their weighting in the index. So the market impact is muffled. It\u0026#8217;s worth repeating: index fund investors are simply owning stocks in the proportion that all active investors own stocks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePlus, index funds never lever up your holdings. They never receive a margin call. They don’t put 30% of your holdings in Valeant Pharmaceuticals. And no index fund has ever closed up shop to spend more time with the family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhy then would index funds or ETFs be any different than any other fund type or security in that respect?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePeople love attaching a narrative to ups and downs of the markets. Index funds have been the perfect scapegoat in a market that has gone up for 10 years, and pretty much outperformed every other strategy. This won’t last forever.

of BP","content":"\u003cdiv class=\"pf-content\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis week, we speak with Sir John Browne, executive chairman of L1 Energy and chairman of the supervisory board of Wintershall DEA. As group chief executive of BP from 1995 to 2007, he led the company through a period of major expansion. Browne studied physics at Cambridge, and received an MS from Stanford. He is chairman of the Francis Crick Institute on genetic research, and chairman of the Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering. Browne is the author of numerous books, most recently, \u003cem\u003e\u003ca class=\"gtrackexternal\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1643132121/thebigpictu09-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eMake, Think, Imagine: Engineering the Future of Civilisation\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrowne explains why engineering is responsible for so much of humanity\u0026#8217;s progress, it is the golden thread throughout everything: heath care, economics, defense, transportation, shelter and more.

You may be surprised to hear the CEO of a giant oil/energy company discussing the reality of global warming in a blunt frank way, including the impact of carbon on the climate, global temperatures, and ocean levels. He also notes the impact of fracking, which was invented at Amoco, now a part of the BP group of companies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe discusses why \u0026#8220;\u003cem\u003eComing out of the closet was good business\u003c/em\u003e.\u0026#8221; He discusses living a double life as a closeted gay man who was also a CEO of a major company. Noteworthy to Brown is the lack of role models and why there are only a handful of \u0026#8220;out\u0026#8221; CEOs at S\u0026amp;P500 companies, when statistically, there should be 25-50 CEOs. After he came out, one of his competitors had said to him \u0026#8220;\u003cem\u003eJohn, we all knew you were gay, only none of us were ever brave enough to discuss it with you\u003c/em\u003e.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis favorite \u003ca href=\"https://ritholtz.com/2019/09/mib-john-browne/#more-232266\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003ebooks are here\u003c/a\u003e; A transcript of our conversation will be \u003ca href=\"https://ritholtz.com/2019/09/transcript-john-browne/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eavailable here\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can stream/download the full conversation, including the podcast extras on \u003ca href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/lord-browne-discusses-the-equilibrium-of-engineering/id730188152?i=1000449671015\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eApple iTunes\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://overcast.fm/+JVs6weTGE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eOvercast\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/1jmnkOLZwFDZ5W0GRfrSDS\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eSpotify\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://podcasts.google.com/?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5ibG9vbWJlcmcuZm0vQkxNODg2NDQwMzI4OA%3D%3D\u0026amp;episode=OTE2NDBkYzQtZDY1My0xMWU5LWE0MmQtYjM0ZmIyYjMxMzc3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eGoogle Podcasts\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2019-09-13/lord-browne-discusses-the-equilibrium-of-engineering-podcast\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eBloomberg\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/masters-in-business/e/63890737?autoplay=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eStitcher\u003c/a\u003e. All of our earlier podcasts on your favorite pod hosts can be \u003ca class=\"gtrackexternal\" href=\"https://plnk.to/MIB?to=page\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003efound here\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext week, we speak with Sarah Ketterer, Chief executive officer and cofounder at Causeway, an international value manager with $52 billion under management.

I really should get around to watching it someday. However, what I have enjoyed from the Powerpuff Girls over the years has been some of their video game outings, here on mobile and other platforms, and their newest mobile game is no exception. It\u0026#8217;s called Powerpuff Girls: Monkey Mania, and it\u0026#8217;s by the talented folks at Juicy Beast, who you probably know from their Burrito Bison games.

That\u0026#8217;s probably not doing the game justice as there are a number of tweaks and improvements in this version, but the concept is the same. Launch your Powerpuff Girl, bounce across the heads of Mojo Jojo\u0026#8217;s \u0026#8220;army of manic monkeys\" and try to make it as far as possible. This is a launcher game through and through. But of course, just like Burrito Bison, there\u0026#8217;s a lot more to it than that in terms of crazy power-ups, upgrades, special characters, and more to make each launch just a wee bit better than the last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, that\u0026#8217;s the part that makes Powerpuff Girls: Monkey Mania get under your skin in the best way. There is SO MUCH stuff to unlock and upgrade that it has the same sort of compulsion loop of an idle game or a clicker, but it\u0026#8217;s all strung together with these really fun runs where you\u0026#8217;re trying to bounce as expertly as possible across everything in your path. And while there\u0026#8217;s a heavy dose of luck involved, there\u0026#8217;s also a surprising amount of strategy.

And like that game, Powerpuff Girls: Monkey Mania is also very free to play, but it actually works for this type of game where you\u0026#8217;re playing super quick games and the unlock and upgrade grind is actually the point. And if you REALLY wanted, there\u0026#8217;s several permanent IAP options here that will make the game more or less premium, though they\u0026#8217;re pretty pricey.

href=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/2019/07/12/null-sec-local-blackout-is-in-effect/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003etwo months back\u003c/a\u003e came with quite a bit of \u003ca href=\"https://tagn.wordpress.com/2019/07/05/local-to-be-blacked-out-in-null-sec-soon/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ewarning\u003c/a\u003e, discussion, and even a setup via the \u003ca href=\"https://community.eveonline.com/news/news-channels/world-news/galactic-hour-news-roundup-lights-going-out-across-new-eden-edition/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ein-game lore\u003c/a\u003e.  Has a new supply of Quantum-Entangled 4-Helium been secured?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe don\u0026#8217;t know.  Not yet anyway.  CCP did not say why they are bringing the blackout to an end, just that it is happening.  The announcement could charitably be called perfunctory.  \u003ca href=\"https://clips.twitch.tv/DependableGiftedPonyFUNgineer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eClip of the announcement\u003c/a\u003e, and I have seen several, run about 30 seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, there is quite a bit of speculation as to why it is happening.  You need only go over to cesspool of \u003ca href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/new/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003e/r/eve\u003c/a\u003e to see various theories.  But /r/eve has been at war with itself over the Chaos Era since it started. (At war with itself more so than usual at least, likely because the Chaos Era has been focused on nerfing null sec, which has led to the usual tribal division who see somebody else getting hit as good for them.)  A leading candidate is the dropping concurrent player numbers, something I mentioned on Monday.  The count fell off noticeably with the end of the Season of Skills event and has been slowly falling ever since.  I was concerned to log in on a week night to find the online count under 15K, but this week I was on when it was around 12K.  18K used to seem like the low bar for my usual evening play time on the west coast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is even a \u003ca href=\"https://massivelyop.com/2019/09/13/eve-evolved-eve-online-is-losing-players-and-no-one-can-agree-on-why/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003epost up over at Massively OP\u003c/a\u003e trying to sum up the various evidence and theories which, including the comments, range from summer vacations to \u003cem\u003eWoW Classic\u003c/em\u003e to the core player base getting old and dying off.  But back in the \u003cem\u003eEVE Online\u003c/em\u003e player base people are still denying there has been any decline at all.  So your mileage may vary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, we shall see if the removal of the blackout has an impact on those numbers.  I do expect that AFK cloaky campers will soon be back in null sec space to keep the ratters and miners on their toes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am sure there will be plenty of hot takes and summaries of the blackout.  I might have a few additional words myself.  But the end of the Chaos Era hasn\u0026#8217;t been announced, so expect humans to continue to \u003ca href=\"https://imperium.news/human-behavior-in-the-era-of-chaos/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ebehave like

But not Grizzly bears.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eI did not think much of this while on holiday from London when my wife and I escaped the city’s steaming, unbearable heat to look through the Memphis Grizzlies’ (gloriously air-conditioned) fan store. The Grizzlies are the city’s professional basketball team. Their mascot is Griz the Grizzly Bear. Their crest is a Grizzly bear. It’s all about the bear.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003ePuzzlingly, in one corner of the store were shirts and other merchandise for a team called the Vancouver Grizzlies—one whose name made much more sense. In fact, the two teams were the same franchise, which in 2001 relocated 1,900 miles, across an international border and three time zones. Vancouver had not been able to support a professional basketball team, so the Grizzlies left for Tennessee. This is not unique in American sports—even in Tennessee. In 1997, American football’s Houston Oilers moved to Nashville, where they played, incongruously, as the Tennessee Oilers before becoming the Tennessee Titans. The most absurd example remains the Jazz: a perfect name for a basketball team from New Orleans, where it was based; less so from Utah, where it now resides.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eAs we returned to Britain, the annual soccer-transfer frenzy was reaching its usual fever pitch. Would Neymar Jnr, the Brazilian superstar, move back to Barcelona from Paris Saint-Germain? How much would he cost—$200 million? More? At the same time, two small but famous clubs in England, Bury F.C. and Bolton Wanderers, were—like the Vancouver Grizzlies—facing the end of the road. They were losing money and could not find a buyer. Yet this did not mean relocating to a different city, but the prospect of bankruptcy and ejection. The contrast between American and European professional sports could not be more stark. In the United States, teams live on, just in a new location, and failure offers the opportunity for a reprieve. In the brutal world of European soccer, strength and success are rewarded, weakness punished.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIn sports, the U.S. and Europe are different worlds, each revealing wider truths about the societies in which they operate—though perhaps not the ones the casual observer might assume.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eEurope is oft-seen, and derided, across the Atlantic as America’s technocratic mother continent where collectivism and do-goodery reign. Yet it has developed a soccer model that is a form of hyper-capitalism, in which the strongest teams are businesses that live and die on their ability to win. Those at the top grab enormous amounts of prize money, allowing them to secure the best players on the best wages. The three \u003ca href=\"https://www.forbes.com/athletes/#88f5fe755ae5\"\u003ehighest-earning sports stars\u003c/a\u003e in the world this year are all soccer players: Lional Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, and Neymar, who each earn more than $100 million a year.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIn European soccer, there is no salary cap or overall spending cap; players are traded as commodities—literally forming a part of the business’s balance sheet. You “buy” players in Europe; you do not trade them. Those clubs that spend too much go bankrupt. Those that fail competitively, finishing in the bottom few positions in the league, are relegated, removed entirely from the top tier and forced to play with another, lower echelon before they prove themselves worthy of returning. (This holds true for Europe’s elite too. If they do not perform well enough, even for just one season, they cannot compete in the Continent’s preeminent competition: the Champions League, a contest open only to the teams that finish near the top of their domestic league.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe United States, by contrast, holds a reputation in large parts of Europe as the epitome of winner-takes-all capitalism, yet it operates variants of a proto-socialist model for all of its major sports. Success is hailed, yet curtailed, and failure rewarded: The worst-placed teams get the first pick in the following season’s draft of new players, allowing them to restock on talent, a form of redistribution rejected elsewhere in the American economy. There is no relegation for those who finish last. Salary caps ensure something of a level playing field each year, and rules are collectively agreed upon by the franchises. There is even, in some cases, a salary floor to ensure that clubs remain competitive.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIf American and European sports leagues were politicians, Europe would be Donald Trump, and the U.S. would be Bernie Sanders.\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr class=\"c-section-divider\"\u003e\u003cp class=\"dropcap\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003eAmerican sports are not so because they like socialism—they are simply taking the best path to making money.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e“In the U.S., they figured out earlier that a league is more profitable if people work together,” Gabriele Marcotti, a senior soccer writer at the sports broadcaster and news site ESPN, told me. “League owners are business partners.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWhile American sports are collectivist in structure—competition controlled, talent and money redistributed—they remain deeply, \u003cem\u003eexceptionally\u003c/em\u003e American.

They cater to American sensibilities—for television and commercial breaks, cheerleaders and half-time shows, and are designed to be consumed, competing not with other leagues offering the same product, but with Hollywood and prime-time TV.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThat they should want to make money is also less controversial in the United States.

It’s not just about entertainment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eA quick visit to any country in Europe illustrates the point.

The Rangers play in blue, and U.K. flags are flown at their games. To wear one jersey or the other in Belfast, across the Irish Sea in Northern Ireland, is almost to indicate which sectarian tribe you belong to. One Catholic friend of mine who grew up in Belfast ruefully recalls the day when, as a child, playing with a Protestant friend, he was punched in the face outside a cinema by a boy in a Celtic top because he was wearing a Rangers tracksuit. His friend’s dad had given the boys the outfits—they were crazy about soccer and too young to care about the team colors.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"u-block-center\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" height=\"442\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/09/RTS1ZRYT/7d30ffb13.jpg\" width=\"672\"\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"caption\"\u003eCeltics fans brandish the team colors.

Direct governance and a formalization of borders occurred under the Roman \u003ci\u003eprinceps\u003c/i\u003e (emperors).\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eSecond, while it’s convenient to date the “fall” of the western Roman empire, it’s not especially useful from an analytic perspective. The western empire had been decentralizing for quite some time, while “barbarians” had been effectively ruling parts of it, directly and indirectly.   \u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s critical to note these groups did not conceive of themselves as “invading” or seeking to “overthrow” Roman rule. By and large, they were forced to enter Roman territory by other attackers. Their rulers were also, by and large, Romanized. They largely ruled in cooperation with local Roman elites and using Roman techniques. Odoacer positioned himself as a local Roman ruler formally subservient to the emperor in Constantinople.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eWhat happened in the West was very different from what happened in the East, when the truly “foreign” armies of Islam invaded and conquered territory ….\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eThird, it’s a bit of a stretch to say decentralization that happened in the 4th and 5th centuries was necessary for developments that came into their own 1,000 years later. There were guild-like groups in 1st century Rome. The Romans appear to have developed fairly sophisticated credit systems and engaged in long-range trade. Monasteries flourished in the eastern empire, which remained quite centralized and even more heavily militarized. And so on.   \u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eCould all of this had developed in something like the direction it took if the Roman state had not succumbed, over many years, to internal and external pressures?

The Pax Romana was also real (or was it?), and the end of Pax Americana may prove very dangerous.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003e7. Environmental pressure—rising seas, desertification, natural disasters—is probably already driving and will continue driving government dysfunction, while government dysfunction accelerates environmental degradation.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003chr class=\"c-section-divider\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eI am not entirely despairing. It’s always hard to tell what ills are cyclical and which ones are one-way streets. No one in the 1980s would have dreamed that crime in the U.S. would go into major remission; maybe mysterious forces will dissipate extreme polarization—and we’ll build new defenses against fake news/brainwashing in free societies.

That’s turned out to be true, sort of, but the 27-year-old Charli is influential less as a pioneering celeb than as a behind-the-scenes writer. She co-created hits including Icona Pop’s trembling-ball-of-energy “I Love It,” Selena Gomez’s see-sawing “Same Old Love,” and Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello’s current tabloid-tease ballad “Señorita.” There’s a bleating, rat-a-tat quality to her hooks, which allows performers to convey personality in vocal inflection rather than range. Of course this style, such as it can be identified, builds on long-established hitmakers like Max Martin, who she’s a fan of.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen people talk about Charli as futuristic, though, they’re not talking about her workaday writing. They’re talking about her brand in relation to the marketplace: like Madonna if she’d never left CGBG, or like someone playing \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmfG1yyvIIk\"\u003ePitchfork Fest\u003c/a\u003e but also \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNVjAsOvMOc\"\u003eGood Morning America\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e. They’re also talking about her production choices. Her new album, \u003ci\u003eCharli\u003c/i\u003e, builds on the style of her 2017 mixtapes \u003ci\u003eNumber 1 Angel\u003c/i\u003e and \u003ci\u003ePop 2\u003c/i\u003e, which took all the buzz about her as a visionary and converted it into an explicitly “futuristic” aesthetic—chipperly artificial, digital, distorted.

The sardonic Charli XCX makes for a better team member; she’s game for her pouty voice to be treated less as an instrument than a sample.

It features the signature Charli/Cook ingredients—video-poker synths over a simple beat with warbly and watery vocals—but every knob is turned so high that what’s conjured is the after-party migraine rather than the pre-party adrenaline rush. Luckily, Charli follows with “Gone,” an agreeably swirling anthem about that very \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/1857/11/justin-bieber-ed-sheeran-i-dont-care-song-review/589204/?preview=57hi93P-1MVtoYnIIl_SsTvVn4g\u0026amp;utm_source=feed\"\u003e2019 sentiment\u003c/a\u003e of hating the party you’re at.

Neither the normcore nor the hardcore fare has a monopoly on the album’s highlights or lowlights. One commercial play, the cartoonish nostalgia binge “1999,” is too crass and jingly to tolerate, though Troye Sivan’s bridge about Jonathan Taylor Thomas is inspired. Another centrist single, the Lizzo-featuring “Blame It On Your Love,” reworks a \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj6dwEBmBJA\"\u003e2017 experimental ballad\u003c/a\u003e using dancehall rhythms and warm chords likely drawn up by super-producer Stargate. It deserves prime party placement.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe weirder songs deliver the thrill of dropping the listener in an odd neighborhood that, despite initial appearances, actually turns out to be welcoming. In “Shake It,” a quartet of femme rappers provide an overdue answer to the Ying Yang Twins’ “Wait (The Whisper Song).” Between choruses, Charli comes off like a poltergeist with an ASMR podcast.\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eWhat’s not to love? Other standouts like “Thoughts” and “February 2017” place moving narratives and sticky melodies into an ever-melting, up-becomes-down-becomes-up production context.

Governance is about unifying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou do criticize the Obama Administration, though, particularly the decision to withdraw from Iraq. You also criticize former Vice President Joe Biden, the leading Democratic candidate for President. So how do you square that?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the Obama Administration I talked about the policy. I don\u0026rsquo;t criticize President Obama politically, I criticize a policy decision that was taken in contravention of the advice of the intelligence community that said if we pull everyone out [of Iraq], if we back [former Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri] al-Malaki who did not, whose party did not have the majority of the votes, then we were going to end of having to go back in. And sure enough, that\u0026rsquo;s what happened. And the Vice President at that time [when we pulled out of Iraq] was Biden. Remember, the book came out, we finally got it done last April I think, I think the first of May was my deadline at that Random House laid on me. And we turned it in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere was Biden at that point as a nominee? I don\u0026rsquo;t even remember. And so I\u0026rsquo;m writing about history here. And I think that\u0026rsquo;s a legitimate policy and strategy point that an officer can make.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow do you feel about the peace negotiations taking place with the Taliban? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know no more about these negotiations than you. What I\u0026rsquo;ve learned is that in any war political will is every bit as important as the troops on the battlefield, as the military activity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no doubt after one of the World War II conferences that we were going to go for the unconditional surrender of Germany. It was going to be over. When we finished this, it would be over, we would occupy their ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat they had done was such a crime, what they were doing right then, concentration camps, occupying other territories, viciously, we were going to take them. And when Eisenhower landed at Normandy he said, \u0026ldquo;Now what did I come here for? It completely escapes me.\u0026rdquo; He\u0026rsquo;s going to Berlin, he\u0026rsquo;s going to kill Hitler. It\u0026rsquo;s that simple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat political will armed the troops on the front line, it armed the workers in the factories, it armed the ships at sea, it armed other countries that were considering. It shows the power of political will. And your question cuts to the heart of this frankly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIt sounds you think you believe the Administration\u0026rsquo;s will is nebulous.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, I can\u0026rsquo;t make the assessment. And if I had all the information, if I was still in government and I could make the assessment, I would, certainly to my boss. But right now anyone who talks about knowing what are the details is giving you more their impressions or their political vision than the reality of what\u0026rsquo;s going on. I just don\u0026rsquo;t know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI want to shift gears a bit. When you look back at your tenure as Defense Secretary, why did you roll back the policy regarding transgender military service?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell it\u0026rsquo;s an issue that\u0026rsquo;s right now in the courts and I have to be very careful about saying things that would then be taken into the courts when I\u0026rsquo;m no longer in a responsible position. It was not a roll back; it was a study.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was absolutely a study because when I came in and I asked the Joint Chiefs to bring up their concerns about anything that I needed to work on. These are the decisions that are pending and one of the points was where to start bringing in transgender [service members] to our basic training. And we\u0026rsquo;re not ready. I said, \u0026ldquo;What do you mean you\u0026rsquo;re not ready? Do you have any guidance on what the expectations are? Well, where was your input?\u0026rdquo; They said we didn\u0026rsquo;t have input. I put together a study group that was composed of everything from combat veterans to medical officers and others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am not going to lose any military efficiency or effectiveness. And that\u0026rsquo;s why I called for a study. And then I just need to leave it there because it\u0026rsquo;s in courts right now and I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be addressing things when I\u0026rsquo;m no longer privy to the ongoing discussions or where the policy is at.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSince you\u0026rsquo;ve left the Defense Department, the Administration has tapped into $6.1 billion in Pentagon funding to build the border wall.

Have we defined the problem well enough between the governors and the President, the executive branch and the legislative branch that we all agree on what is the problem?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so I\u0026rsquo;m not going to comment on the specifics of this issue, again, I don\u0026rsquo;t believe I should be getting into political discussions, having been in the military and the Secretary of Defense. But if we don\u0026rsquo;t spend more time agreeing on what is the specific problem we\u0026rsquo;re trying to solve, I found in my time in leadership positions then the solution never satisfies people because they never agreed on what the problem was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy did you include your resignation letter as Defense Secretary in the book?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought that the publisher made a good point. You can\u0026rsquo;t simply put the book out at this point in time as if the last two years didn\u0026rsquo;t happen. It was never written to be a political book.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWould you consider being in the government again? Would you consider being Defense Secretary again?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBanish the thought. I think I\u0026rsquo;ve done with four and a half decades of service I think I\u0026rsquo;ve done about what I can do.

I\u0026rsquo;ve decided I am changing my pronouns to THEY/THEM \u0026#10084; after a lifetime of being at war with my gender I\u0026rsquo;ve decided to embrace myself for who I am, inside and out. I\u0026rsquo;m so excited and privileged to be surrounded by people that support me in this decision but I\u0026rsquo;ve been very nervous about announcing this because I care too much about what people think but fuck it! I understand there will be many mistakes and mis gendering but all I ask is you please please try. I hope you can see me like I see myself now. Thank you.  P.s. I am at no stage just yet to eloquently speak at length about what it means to be non binary but I can\u0026rsquo;t wait for the day that I am. So for now I just want to be VISIBLE and open. If you have questions and are wondering what this all means I\u0026rsquo;ll try my best to explain but I have also tagged below the human beings who are fighting the good fight everyday. These are activists and leaders of the non binary/trans community that have helped me and given me so much clarity and understanding. @tomglitter @munroebergdorf @transnormativity @alokvmenon @katemoross @glamrou @travisalabanza @twyrent @chellaman @jvn @lavernecox @stonewalluk @glaad @humanrightscampaign @mermaidsgender Love you all.

The reference to Yang revolves around a callback to a moment earlier in the episode, around 46 minutes and 30 seconds in. In that segment, Gomez riffs about a candy he describes as a small wax bottle containing an unsatisfying amount of sweet liquid (he appears to be describing the \u003ca href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nik-L-Nip\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eNik-L-Lip\u003c/a\u003e). \"What a fuckin' scam that was,\" he says. He starts to say, \"whoever came up with that is the—\" when Gillis jumps in and says \"c----s.\" The entire group—Gomez, Amico, Gillis, and comic Mike Figs—appears to erupt in laughter, and one of the comics sings \"ch-ch-ch-chi-ch-c----s\" over a drum sting. \"Shane Gillis crushing it with a one-word racist punchline,\" Gomez says. \"One of my favorites.\"\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eGillis's subsequent use of the slur occurs around one hour and six minutes into the episode. The comics are riffing about Bernie Sanders, whom Gillis describes as Mario to Dick Cheney's Wario. The riff descends into awkwardness, and Gillis says his Wario joke was the best joke of the episode. Gomez responds, \"your c---k line was 40 times better.\" Some cross-talk ensues in which Gillis remarks on his frequent use of that slur, before directing it to Sanders: \"That Jew c---k? Commie Jew c---k? Next, please, next. Gimme your next candidate, Dems. Jew c---k, next. Actually, they are running a Jew c---k—Chang, dude.\" Then the conversation turns to author and life coach Tony Robbins. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThese were not the only instances of hateful language directed toward Asian people in the episode. About an hour in, the group prepares for a segment in which they watch a random podcast; in this case, their producer has chosen the video podcast \"Make Money Travel Blogging Featuring Jacob Fu.\" Upon learning the name, the group, led by Gillis, breaks out into exaggerated Chinese accents. When the video starts playing, Gillis exclaims, \"I was making fun of these guys for being Asian—they're so hot. Look at these hot guys, dude… he speaks so much better than all of us.\" He chides one of his fellow comics to stop speaking in a mocking accent. \"Now it's very racist. These guys speak great, they're handsome… Those are nice handsome boys having fun.\" \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThen Gillis appears to start describing the group. \"Fat ugly idiots promoting hate, that's what this is,\" he says. \"That's what this is?\" Gomez responds. \"Yeah, look at all of us,\" Gillis says. \"We're all shitty people.

That was never my point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou\u0026rsquo;ve been criticized a fair amount for not talking about President Trump in the book. How do you feel about that?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, my response would be that when you leave an administration over a policy issue, when I write a letter to the President that is released to the press that basically sums up the policy issue, at that point when you walk out, you owe what the French call a devoir de reserve, \u0026ldquo;a duty of quiet.\u0026rdquo; And the reason is, the threats to the Western democracy, the democratic tradition haven\u0026rsquo;t gone away. Now the Constitution that I swore an oath to uphold when I went in as Secretary of Defense, the same one I swore when I was enlisted in the Marines at age 18.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow I understand those who say, who want to see Mr. Trump out of office. O.K., in a democracy you can always do that. But when the election is over, after you\u0026rsquo;ve done dividing the country into different blocks in order to gain votes, then you go into governance. Governance isn\u0026rsquo;t about dividing. Governance is about unifying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou do criticize the Obama Administration, though, particularly the decision to withdraw from Iraq. You also criticize former Vice President Joe Biden, the leading Democratic candidate for President. So how do you square that?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the Obama Administration I talked about the policy. I don\u0026rsquo;t criticize President Obama politically, I criticize a policy decision that was taken in contravention of the advice of the intelligence community that said if we pull everyone out [of Iraq], if we back [former Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri] al-Malaki who did not, whose party did not have the majority of the votes, then we were going to end of having to go back in. And sure enough, that\u0026rsquo;s what happened. And the Vice President at that time [when we pulled out of Iraq] was Biden. Remember, the book came out, we finally got it done last April I think, I think the first of May was my deadline at that Random House laid on me. And we turned it in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere was Biden at that point as a nominee? I don\u0026rsquo;t even remember. And so I\u0026rsquo;m writing about history here. And I think that\u0026rsquo;s a legitimate policy and strategy point that an officer can make.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow do you feel about the peace negotiations taking place with the Taliban? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know no more about these negotiations than you. What I\u0026rsquo;ve learned is that in any war political will is every bit as important as the troops on the battlefield, as the military activity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no doubt after one of the World War II conferences that we were going to go for the unconditional surrender of Germany. It was going to be over. When we finished this, it would be over, we would occupy their ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat they had done was such a crime, what they were doing right then, concentration camps, occupying other territories, viciously, we were going to take them. And when Eisenhower landed at Normandy he said, \u0026ldquo;Now what did I come here for? It completely escapes me.\u0026rdquo; He\u0026rsquo;s going to Berlin, he\u0026rsquo;s going to kill Hitler. It\u0026rsquo;s that simple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat political will armed the troops on the front line, it armed the workers in the factories, it armed the ships at sea, it armed other countries that were considering. It shows the power of political will. And your question cuts to the heart of this frankly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIt sounds you think you believe the Administration\u0026rsquo;s will is nebulous.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, I can\u0026rsquo;t make the assessment. And if I had all the information, if I was still in government and I could make the assessment, I would, certainly to my boss. But right now anyone who talks about knowing what are the details is giving you more their impressions or their political vision than the reality of what\u0026rsquo;s going on. I just don\u0026rsquo;t know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI want to shift gears a bit. When you look back at your tenure as Defense Secretary, why did you roll back the policy regarding transgender military service?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell it\u0026rsquo;s an issue that\u0026rsquo;s right now in the courts and I have to be very careful about saying things that would then be taken into the courts when I\u0026rsquo;m no longer in a responsible position. It was not a roll back; it was a study.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was absolutely a study because when I came in and I asked the Joint Chiefs to bring up their concerns about anything that I needed to work on. These are the decisions that are pending and one of the points was where to start bringing in transgender [service members] to our basic training. And we\u0026rsquo;re not ready. I said, \u0026ldquo;What do you mean you\u0026rsquo;re not ready? Do you have any guidance on what the expectations are? Well, where was your input?\u0026rdquo; They said we didn\u0026rsquo;t have input. I put together a study group that was composed of everything from combat veterans to medical officers and others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am not going to lose any military efficiency or effectiveness. And that\u0026rsquo;s why I called for a study. And then I just need to leave it there because it\u0026rsquo;s in courts right now and I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be addressing things when I\u0026rsquo;m no longer privy to the ongoing discussions or where the policy is at.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSince you\u0026rsquo;ve left the Defense Department, the Administration has tapped into $6.1 billion in Pentagon funding to build the border wall. Given that you\u0026rsquo;ve consistently maintain that the military should stay out of politics on this book tour, do you have reservations about money being funneled into this entire process?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think I\u0026rsquo;m paraphrasing Einstein who said, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;d spend 55 minutes defining the problem, and five minutes coming up with a solution.\u0026rdquo; Now think of that. Have we defined the problem well enough between the governors and the President, the executive branch and the legislative branch that we all agree on what is the problem?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so I\u0026rsquo;m not going to comment on the specifics of this issue, again, I don\u0026rsquo;t believe I should be getting into political discussions, having been in the military and the Secretary of Defense. But if we don\u0026rsquo;t spend more time agreeing on what is the specific problem we\u0026rsquo;re trying to solve, I found in my time in leadership positions then the solution never satisfies people because they never agreed on what the problem was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy did you include your resignation letter as Defense Secretary in the book?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought that the publisher made a good point. You can\u0026rsquo;t simply put the book out at this point in time as if the last two years didn\u0026rsquo;t happen. It was never written to be a political book.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWould you consider being in the government again? Would you consider being Defense Secretary again?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBanish the thought. I think I\u0026rsquo;ve done with four and a half decades of service I think I\u0026rsquo;ve done about what I can do. I\u0026rsquo;m more than willing to talk to young people, I hope to continue lecturing at colleges and talking with young people and encouraging them to recognize the nobility, but also the privilege of serving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/time/topstories/~4/SWxRGlerQOs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/SWxRGlerQOs/","published":"2019-09-14T14:16:38Z","guid":"http://time.com/?p=5677440"},{"title":"3 Teens Shot at a Virginia High School Football Game, Police Say.

I\u0026rsquo;ve decided I am changing my pronouns to THEY/THEM \u0026#10084; after a lifetime of being at war with my gender I\u0026rsquo;ve decided to embrace myself for who I am, inside and out. I\u0026rsquo;m so excited and privileged to be surrounded by people that support me in this decision but I\u0026rsquo;ve been very nervous about announcing this because I care too much about what people think but fuck it! I understand there will be many mistakes and mis gendering but all I ask is you please please try. I hope you can see me like I see myself now. Thank you.  P.s. I am at no stage just yet to eloquently speak at length about what it means to be non binary but I can\u0026rsquo;t wait for the day that I am. So for now I just want to be VISIBLE and open. If you have questions and are wondering what this all means I\u0026rsquo;ll try my best to explain but I have also tagged below the human beings who are fighting the good fight everyday. These are activists and leaders of the non binary/trans community that have helped me and given me so much clarity and understanding. @tomglitter @munroebergdorf @transnormativity @alokvmenon @katemoross @glamrou @travisalabanza @twyrent @chellaman @jvn @lavernecox @stonewalluk @glaad @humanrightscampaign @mermaidsgender Love you all.

He then lied about it when questioned, including under oath to the inspector general, Horowitz’s report said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to the inspector general’s report, “law enforcement sensitive information” about the Clinton investigation was disclosed in an Oct. 20, 2016, Wall Street Journal article. Until that article was published, the FBI – as is its normal procedure – had refused to confirm whether there was an ongoing investigation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMcCabe disclosed a communication he had received from an Obama Justice Department official expressing his concerns over the FBI investigation into the Clinton Foundation during the election, the inspector general’s report found.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe IG report said that when McCabe was asked by Comey about the article, he told Comey that he had had not authorized the disclosure and didn’t know who did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMcCabe repeated that lie to agents from the FBI’s Inspection Division and to the Office of the Inspector General when questioned about it. Only in a second round of questioning by the inspector general did McCabe finally admit that he was responsible for the disclosure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt isn’t just that McCabe lied to investigators, including when he was under oath. The IG also says that McCabe engaged in “misconduct” because the disclosure was “designed to advance his personal interest at the expense of department leadership.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut the real point is this: lying to a federal agent is a felony under\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1001\"\u003e18 U.S.C. §1001\u003c/a\u003e.

McCabe was under oath when he was questioned by the IG and, moreover, he held the second-highest post in the most powerful law enforcement agency in the federal government.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMcCabe, more than an ordinary citizen, knew the importance of this law and the fact that he had a duty to tell the truth when he was being questioned about unauthorized leaks that could compromise an open law enforcement investigation. To believe he misremembered or temporarily forgot is not credible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHolding McCabe to account sends a loud and clear message: no one is above the law. If he wasn’t prosecuted, the message would be that the laws that are applied to citizens, politicians and military officers don’t apply to high-ranking FBI agents and the Justice Department.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNot only would that be legally indefensible, but providing that kind of immunity to law enforcement officials would be dangerous.

At least that is what a \u003ci\u003eDaily Mail\u003c/i\u003e headline might read. Lasers can now reach power in the petawatt range. And, when you focus a laser beam that powerful, nothing survives: all matter is shredded, leaving only electrons and nuclei.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut laser physicists haven’t stopped there. Under good experimental conditions, the very fabric of space and time are torn asunder, testing quantum electrodynamics to destruction.

A petawatt is 1,000 times larger than a terawatt. The baddest laser on the planet (currently) produces somewhere between 5 and 10 petawatts, and there are plans on the drawing board to reach 100 petawatts in the near future. The trick is that the power is not available all the time. Each of these lasers produces somewhere between 5-5000 J of energy for a very very short time (between a picosecond—10\u003csup\u003e-12\u003c/sup\u003es—and a few femtoseconds—10\u003csup\u003e-15\u003c/sup\u003es).

Two days before Christmas that year, Russian hackers planted a unique specimen of malware in the network of Ukraine's national grid operator, Ukrenergo. Just before midnight, they used it to \u003ca href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/crash-override-malware/\"\u003eopen every circuit breaker in a transmission station north of Kyiv\u003c/a\u003e. The result was one of the most dramatic attacks in Russia's \u003ca class=\"external-link\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/0385544405/?tag=arstech20-20\"\u003eyears-long cyberwar against its western neighbor\u003c/a\u003e, an unprecedented, automated blackout across a broad swath of Ukraine's capital.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut an hour later, Ukrenergo's operators were able to simply switch the power back on again. Which raised the question: Why would Russia's hackers build a sophisticated cyberweapon and plant it in the heart of a nation's power grid only to trigger a one-hour blackout?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA new theory offers a potential answer. Researchers at the industrial-control system cybersecurity firm Dragos have \u003ca class=\"external-link\" href=\"https://dragos.com/wp-content/uploads/CRASHOVERRIDE.pdf\"\u003ereconstructed a timeline of the 2016 blackout attack\u003c/a\u003e [PDF] based on a reexamination of the malware’s code and network logs pulled from Ukrenergo’s systems. They say that hackers intended not merely to cause a short-lived disruption of the Ukrainian grid but to inflict lasting damage that could have led to power outages for weeks or even months. That distinction would make the blackout malware one of only three pieces of code ever spotted in the wild aimed at not just disrupting physical equipment but destroying it, as \u003ca href=\"https://www.wired.com/2014/11/countdown-to-zero-day-stuxnet/\"\u003eStuxnet did in Iran in 2009 and 2010\u003c/a\u003e and as the malware \u003ca href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/triton-malware-targets-industrial-safety-systems-in-the-middle-east/\"\u003eTriton was designed to do in a Saudi Arabian oil refinery in 2017\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1568657#p3\"\u003eRead 12 remaining paragraphs\u003c/a\u003e | \u003ca href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1568657\u0026comments=1\"\u003eComments\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"feedflare\"\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=Rmkk79b9Jp8:htLN7ctbLSk:V_sGLiPBpWU\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=Rmkk79b9Jp8:htLN7ctbLSk:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=Rmkk79b9Jp8:htLN7ctbLSk:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=Rmkk79b9Jp8:htLN7ctbLSk:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=Rmkk79b9Jp8:htLN7ctbLSk:qj6IDK7rITs\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=Rmkk79b9Jp8:htLN7ctbLSk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","url":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1568657","published":"2019-09-14T12:15:13Z","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1568657"},{"title":"How a basement hacker transformed Donkey Kong for the Atari 2600","content":"\u003cdiv id=\"rss-wrap\"\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"intro-image intro-left\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-160956003-800x508.jpg\" alt=\"[UNVERIFIED CONTENT] Atari CX2600A from the year 1980 made in Hong Kong.\"\u003e\u003cp class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-160956003.jpg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"1692\" data-width=\"2667\"\u003eEnlarge\u003c/a\u003e \u003cspan class=\"sep\"\u003e/\u003c/span\u003e If you're unfamiliar with the name, \"Atari 2600,\" fellow kids, have a gander at this piece of hardware.

Unfortunately, I’m yet to see specs for the rumored telephoto camera — a previous leak said it’d use a 16 megapixel sensor, but I haven’t seen the a similarly detailed spec readout like we have here for the main camera, which makes me wonder if the telephoto sensor is one of the things that isn’t working on this unit yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Wf7u29\"\u003eAnother quirk: leaks of the upcoming camera app suggest that the phone will shoot in 16:9 by default so that photos can take up the entire camera screen, despite the sensor remaining 4:3. The effect is similar to what Apple is doing on \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/10/20857971/apple-iphone-11-pro-max-hands-on-features-photos-video-camera-price\"\u003ethe iPhone 11 models\u003c/a\u003e, which take advantage of the phones’ extra wide-angle lens to fill the screen.

These types of programs would more or less be doing what a human PA already does.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eThere are several very negative possibilities.\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt present, this type of AI program pretty much comes down to work best depending on what kind of material it is being fed with. For instance, if this AI program is given offensive, violent content. If the AI is given specific articles degrading individual nations or races (take some Hitler’s propaganda, for example), GPT-2 would respond similarly and produce vile and offensive content.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eThe system could be abused for automated and refined trolling.\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople would be convinced they are receiving \u003ca href=\"https://readwrite.com/2018/12/03/how-can-you-tell-if-a-productivity-tool-really-improves-your-performance/\"\u003esomeone’s real opinions\u003c/a\u003e, instead of an automated response by a machine. Also, phishing schemes would become much easier to pull off. Certainly, the cyber hacks will be all over this AI code and work. The internet \u003ca href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/04/ai-fake-text-gpt-2-concerns-false-information\"\u003ecould be overfilled\u003c/a\u003e with artificial content. Do we want this as our only future? Let’s remember the example of pornographic deepfakes \u0026#8212; a classic example of how top \u003ca href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/05/06/is-data-the-next-front-in-the-trade-wars/\"\u003etechnology was abused\u003c/a\u003e when released into the public.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat is to come out of all the new AI code?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the proponents of AI and AI code freely themselves admit \u0026#8212; only the future will show what is really in the works at present. In the meantime, OpenAI will continue to invest resources in their\u003ca href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/04/23/changing-e-commerce-landscape-global-trends-for-2019-and-beyond/\"\u003e innovative language model\u003c/a\u003e and feed it with more and more data, hoping for the best. Will we be on the receiving end of \u0026#8220;the best?\u0026#8221; The answer to that question will remain to be seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe post \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com/2019/09/14/how-ai-is-learning-to-play-with-words/\"\u003eHow AI is Learning to Play with Words\u003c/a\u003e appeared first on \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://readwrite.com\"\u003eReadWrite\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://readwrite.com/2019/09/14/how-ai-is-learning-to-play-with-words/","published":"2019-09-14T15:00:07Z","guid":"https://readwrite.com/?p=156910"}]},{"url":"https://rss.dw.com/rdf/rss-en-all","items":[{"title":"Drone attacks set Saudi Aramco oil facilities ablaze","content":"","url":"https://www.dw.com/en/drone-attacks-set-saudi-aramco-oil-facilities-ablaze/a-50430391?maca=en-rss-en-all-1573-rdf","published":"2019-09-14T07:46:00Z","guid":"https://www.dw.com/en/drone-attacks-set-saudi-aramco-oil-facilities-ablaze/a-50430391?maca=en-rss-en-all-1573-rdf"},{"title":"Cameron lambasts Johnson for 'appalling' Brexit behaviour","content":"","url":"https://www.dw.com/en/cameron-lambasts-johnson-for-appalling-brexit-behaviour/a-50430360?maca=en-rss-en-all-1573-rdf","published":"2019-09-14T07:42:00Z","guid":"https://www.dw.com/en/cameron-lambasts-johnson-for-appalling-brexit-behaviour/a-50430360?maca=en-rss-en-all-1573-rdf"},{"title":"Prison blues?

Parece que eles têm medo de perder votos conservadores”, pondera.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSe a manifestação do dia 17 não virou uma batalha campal, talvez seja graças ao nacionalista branco acusado de assassinar 22 pessoas em um acesso de fúria contra a população latina de El Paso, no início do mês.

It was 1992. A jury in Simi Valley, California, had just acquitted a group of mostly white Los Angeles police officers for the videotaped beating of a black construction worker named Rodney King. Decades of pent-up anger directed at one of the nation’s most notoriously racist police departments spilled out on city streets in a six-day convulsion that left more than 60 people dead. Amid the unrest, white supremacists in southern California saw an opportunity, believing that the riots could be used as cover to launch a race war.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe FBI’s Los Angeles office got wind of the plans, and when his supervisor floated the idea of infiltrating the groups, German, who was in his late 20s at the time, enthusiastically volunteered. For more than a year, German lived undercover, embedded in a network of neo-Nazi skinheads plotting the bombing of a popular African-American church and the assassination of prominent Jewish and black figures, including King himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGerman’s investigation led to multiple prosecutions on federal weapons and bomb-making charges and marked the beginning of a series of undercover operations inside the world of far-right American extremists that spanned more than 12 years. It was a critical time for the FBI, with the trifecta of Ruby Ridge in 1992, Waco in 1993, and Oklahoma City in 1995 having called into serious question the bureau’s domestic counterterrorism tactics and the blowback they had incurred. By the time the new century rolled around, it seemed that the FBI was on track for critical reforms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA bright, clear morning in September 2001 changed that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGerman was assigned to the FBI’s Atlanta office when the planes hit the Twin Towers. Three years later, he was a civilian, having resigned from the FBI after he blew the whistle on a terror investigation gone wrong and became the target of an internal retaliation campaign.

In his new book, “Disrupt, Discredit, and Divide: How the New FBI Damages Democracy,” German brings his insights to a wider audience, telling the story of how FBI leadership capitalized on the September 11 attacks, escaping a much-needed internal reckoning to become the most powerful and secretive domestic intelligence agency the country has ever known.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c!-- BLOCK(photo)[2](%7B%7D)(%7B%22scroll%22%3Afalse%2C%22align%22%3A%22right%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22540px%22%7D) --\u003e\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-right  width-fixed' style='width: 540px;'\u003e\u003c!-- CONTENT(photo)[2] --\u003e\n\u003cimg class=\"alignright size-article-medium wp-image-267847\" src=\"https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/09/disrupt_discredit_divide_final-1568411744-540x816.jpg\" alt=\"disrupt_discredit_divide_final-1568411744\" /\u003e\n\u003cp class='caption source' style=''\u003eImage: Courtesy of The New Press\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- END-CONTENT(photo)[2] --\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c!-- END-BLOCK(photo)[2] --\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn an interview with The Intercept, German explained that the idea for the project began taking shape years ago, as he grew increasingly concerned about the media’s coverage of the FBI. “It was very sporadic,” German told me. “An abuse here, an abuse there.” Nobody seemed to be digging into the structural problems in the FBI. If they did, German explained, they would see that these seemingly one-off events were indicative of patterns linked to the bureau’s institutional history, its self-perception and attitude following September 11, and the demographic composition of its workforce.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile his personal experiences are deployed as needed, the real story in “Disrupt, Discredit, and Divide” is German’s methodical and damning account of a powerful American institution chronically failing to live up to its mission. The book comes at a critical moment. Driven by a series of high-profile attacks and the president’s ties to white nationalism, the FBI’s relationship to German’s old beat — domestic counterterrorism investigations involving white supremacists — has returned to the media spotlight. At the same time, former FBI directors Robert Mueller and James Comey, who ran the FBI during its troubled post-9/11 years, have ascended to near god-like status in some liberal corners for their respective roles in the Russia investigation affair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We live at an interesting time where there’s such polarization over every issue but particularly over the FBI and what role it plays in our society, where liberals who previously had been skeptical of the FBI now are sort of champions of the FBI, and conservatives who were full supporters of empowering law enforcement are now skeptical,” German said. “I’m hopeful that a more nuanced view that isn’t influenced by the politics of either side, but is rather just presenting facts on how this agency actually works, and the problems that are created as a result, will be helpful to a larger effort to conduct a comprehensive examination of where we are almost 20 years after 9/11.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c!-- BLOCK(photo)[3](%7B%7D)(%7B%22scroll%22%3Afalse%2C%22align%22%3A%22bleed%22%2C%22bleed%22%3A%22large%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22auto%22%7D) --\u003e\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-bleed large-bleed width-auto' style='width: auto;'\u003e\u003c!-- CONTENT(photo)[3] --\u003e\n\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-267857\" src=\"https://prod01-cdn05.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/09/GettyImages-459437690-Ferguson_web-1568413511.jpg\" alt=\"GettyImages-459437690-Ferguson_web-1568413511\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"caption overlayed\"\u003eDemonstrators hold an upside down American flag as they stand in the street while protesting the shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, on November 22, 2014.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class='caption source pullright' style=''\u003ePhoto: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- END-CONTENT(photo)[3] --\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c!-- END-BLOCK(photo)[3] --\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eTargeting Political Dissent\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs an army brat who came of age during the Vietnam War, German writes that he “had no illusion that the government always did the right thing, or did it well.” Still, from the time he was a kid, an FBI agent was all he ever wanted to be. German was moved by President Theodore Roosevelt’s original 1909 vision of a Department of Justice investigative agency established to “secure the conviction of the wealthiest and most formidable criminals” in the country, especially those protected by “wide political and social influence.” He writes: “The idea of using the law to protect the most vulnerable in society is what drew me to the FBI.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt its heart, German’s book is about the FBI’s failure to reflect those principles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe documents how in the wake of 9/11, FBI leadership embraced a discredited theory of radicalization that had the convenient side effect of ignoring the bureau’s own shortcomings in the run-up to the attacks, while simultaneously laying the groundwork for demands for expanded powers and authorities. The FBI also turned on its own, particularly in cases when agents raised concerns about the legality of operations or failed to match up with the bureau’s \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/04/21/terry-albury-fbi-race-whistleblowing/\"\u003eoverwhelmingly white male demographics\u003c/a\u003e. In case after case, German offers examples of the FBI zeroing on agents, particularly Muslim agents and those of Asian descent, as potential threats and would-be turncoats, railroading promising careers without a whiff of evidence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGerman chronicles the FBI’s shift from a law enforcement agency concerned with criminal investigations, to an intelligence agency primarily concerned with counterterrorism. He focuses heavily on the bureau’s impact in Muslim communities, where civil society groups were targeted as supporters of terrorism, precarious immigration status became a tool to push people into becoming informants, and agents used their expanded authorities to open “assessments” on individuals in the absence of suspected crimes. It was during this same period, German observes, that the FBI began accepting and integrating the discredited theories of an “Islamophobia network” in its official training materials, sending a message to bigots across the country that anti-Muslim hatred was a government-condoned philosophy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003e\u003c!-- BLOCK(promote-related-post)[4](%7B%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22relatedPostNumber%22%3A4%7D) --\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"promote-embed\" data-related-post-number=\"4\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c!-- END-BLOCK(promote-related-post)[4] --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the September 11 attacks brought new powers, the FBI of the last two decades has also carried on its longstanding tradition of targeting leftists, anarchists, and environmental activists, German writes. So-called eco-terrorism, he points out, was for much of that time the FBI’s \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/03/23/ecoterrorism-fbi-animal-rights/\"\u003eNo. 1 domestic terrorism priority\u003c/a\u003e, despite the fact that the movement has never claimed a life. For German, that contradiction is precisely the point of the book. While the FBI has devoted enormous time, energy, and resources to filling \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/09/06/terrorism-watchlist-lawsuit-ruling/\"\u003eunconstitutional watchlists\u003c/a\u003e with Muslim names and directing its agents to focus on bogus national security threats such as “\u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/03/23/black-identity-extremist-fbi-domestic-terrorism/\"\u003eblack identity extremists\u003c/a\u003e,” important crimes that the bureau is supposed to enforce have fallen by the wayside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWar without end, the impotence of Congress, and the financial collapse have all contributed to Americans’ plummeting faith in the government, German notes, but the FBI’s post-9/11 evolution also deserves a place on that list. “I believe the FBI contributed to this breakdown of public trust in government institutions, not just by who it chose to target for disruption but, just as important, who it didn’t,” he writes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTake the torture program. German writes that experienced FBI interrogators, who understood that torture produces unreliable information in addition to being illegal, were well-positioned to take the investigative lead following 9/11. Instead, the FBI took a back seat to the CIA, even as it became clear — at times through concerns raised by its own agents in the field — that the intelligence agency was breaking the law. But it’s not just the classified programs devised behind closed doors in Washington, D.C. The FBI has a mandate to enforce civil rights violations by police officers. According to German, if data on police killings and violence disproportionately impacting people of color says anything, it’s that the FBI could keep itself quite busy investigating police abuses — if that’s what FBI leadership wanted to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[5](%7B%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22right%22%7D) --\u003e\u003cblockquote class=\"stylized pull-right\" data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"right\"\u003e\u003c!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[5] --\u003e“The new FBI saw protecting the establishment as its mission and disrupting the political mobilization of dissident and disenfranchised communities as its most potent weapon.”\u003c!-- END-CONTENT(pullquote)[5] --\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c!-- END-BLOCK(pullquote)[5] --\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, recent history has shown the FBI \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/03/19/black-lives-matter-fbi-surveillance/\"\u003etargeting Black Lives Matter\u003c/a\u003e and partnering with a \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/series/oil-and-water/\"\u003eprivate intelligence company\u003c/a\u003e that infiltrated the Standing Rock protests. In the case of Standing Rock specifically, German notes, it’s worth remembering that it’s also part of the FBI’s mandate to prosecute crimes against Native Americans on reservations — there, too, the bureau has fallen short. “Though too often ignored as crime victims,” German writes, “Native Americans draw unwarranted law enforcement attention when they protest government policies that negatively impact their communities.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom Pine Ridge to Wall Street, the FBI’s prioritization problems run deep, German argues. In 2004, he writes, FBI headquarters received repeated warnings that mortgage fraud was an “epidemic” with the potential to trigger an economic crisis. As FBI director, Mueller had transferred hundreds of white-collar crimes investigators to counterterrorism. “Congress denied the FBI’s requests for more agents,” German writes, meanwhile, “Mueller refused to reprioritize his national security assets.” Even when there was evidence that financial institutions were engaged in actual criminal activity, German writes, executives didn’t go to prison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Like J.

With scenes from Ferguson and Standing Rock still fresh in the public consciousness, German writes, “It was perplexing to watch convicted felons engaging in unpoliced violence at these white nationalist rallies and, rather than being arrested, becoming featured speakers at the next rally.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c!-- BLOCK(promote-related-post)[9](%7B%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22relatedPostNumber%22%3A1%7D) --\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"promote-embed\" data-related-post-number=\"1\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c!-- END-BLOCK(promote-related-post)[9] --\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn telling the story of the FBI’s failure to confront the threat of white supremacist violence, German argues that it’s not a lack of authorities, but an absence of institutional interest in recent years to take basic steps to understand the problem — let alone bring and close cases. “After 9/11, I noticed the FBI officially de-emphasizing white supremacist violence,” German writes, despite the fact that extremists typically described as part of the far right “kill more people in an average year than any other terrorist groups.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the Obama administration, which saw a surge in far-right group membership and activity, FBI analysts were reporting a decline in white supremacist violence even as outside researchers, like the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point, were reporting the exact opposite. For German, the resurgence of far-right violence and Trump’s rise to power cannot be divorced the security politics and failures of post-9/11 America. “The Trump campaign grasped that fifteen years of political polarization and constant terror warnings had created an appetite for a strongman candidate, which he could whet with messages of fear and anger,” he writes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c!-- BLOCK(photo)[10](%7B%7D)(%7B%22scroll%22%3Afalse%2C%22align%22%3A%22center%22%2C%22width%22%3A%221000px%22%7D) --\u003e\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-center  width-fixed' style='width: 1000px;'\u003e\u003c!-- CONTENT(photo)[10] --\u003e\n\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-article-large wp-image-267850\" src=\"https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/09/GettyImages-133927307_National-Counterterrorism-Center_web-1568412135-1000x693.jpg\" alt=\"GettyImages-133927307_National-Counterterrorism-Center_web-1568412135\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"caption\"\u003eThe operations floor at the National Counterterrorism Center in Tysons Corner, Virginia, June 8, 2011.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class='caption source' style=''\u003ePhoto: Melina Mara/The Washington Post via Getty Images\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- END-CONTENT(photo)[10] --\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c!-- END-BLOCK(photo)[10] --\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBound up in the narrative of Trump’s ascent is, of course, one of the biggest FBI stories of all time: the Russia investigation. Here, German argues, the FBI’s running list of post-9/11 failures ascended to new heights. German’s assessment of former director Comey’s actions through this period is perhaps the most withering section of his book. Not unlike Trump, Comey had a tendency to take a blowtorch to the norms and obligations he was bound by. On top of that, German writes, “The available evidence suggests Comey’s FBI did not pursue allegations that Russia was illicitly supporting the Trump campaign with the necessary urgency, at least if you believe that a hostile foreign nation’s effort to influence a U.S. presidential election presents a national security threat of the highest dimension.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn German’s view, the Russian government either successfully conspired with the Trump campaign to undermine the most important presidential election in modern American history, or it didn’t. “If it did, the FBI’s and its partner agencies’ inability to interdict the plot before a corrupted election elevated an illegitimate president to power is an intelligence failure of a magnitude rivaled only by the failure to quickly bring the conspirators to justice afterward,” he writes. “If not, the FBI and other intelligence agencies have used their covert intelligence powers to undermine a duly elected U.S. president and his administration in ways that would make J. Edgar Hoover blush. Either possibility suggests a significant part of our government has forfeited its legitimacy and is no longer serving in the public interest.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[11](%7B%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"shortcode\" data-shortcode=\"newsletter\" data-campaign=\"\" data-cta=\"\" data-headline=\"\" data-layout=\"\" data-subhead=\"\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[11] --\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for Trump himself, German sees in the president a man whose entire life and business history, not to mention his associates, reeks of potential criminal liability. And still, he seemed to generate a considerable amount of wealth and obtain the most powerful position in the world without a serious look from the FBI along the way. “The practical immunity Trump and his retinue enjoyed as they amassed wealth and power also gives lie to his supporters’ contention that Mueller, Comey, and the FBI somehow had it in for Trump and manufactured a case against him,” German writes. “The failure to prioritize the economic crimes of the politically powerful left the nation vulnerable to a hostile foreign nation’s effort to delegitimize U.S. elections. This is exactly the sort of threat a domestic intelligence agency is supposed to protect against.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGerman still believes in the FBI’s capacity to be a force for good. At the same time, he recognizes that many people in the advocacy community he’s become a part of in the last 15 years do not. “It’s easier for me to have more confidence in the ability to reform law enforcement institutions because I’m not the prime target of abusive law enforcement actions,” he acknowledged. German sees his role in building a more just future as discreet — he knows the FBI and has a deep understanding of where its problems come from. What members of civil society do with that information is up to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We can’t work on effective solutions if we don’t really understand the problem,” German said. “My goal with this book was to make sure that we’re understanding the structural and attitudinal problems that allowed the FBI to be a threat to democracy rather than protective of it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe post \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/09/14/fbi-mike-german-book/\"\u003eHow the FBI Increased Its Power After 9/11 and Helped Put

forms over warm ocean waters near the equator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose arising in the Atlantic or eastern Pacific are called hurricanes, while those in the western Pacific and Indian ocean are dubbed typhoons or cyclones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNorth of the equator they spin anticlockwise because of the rotation of the earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey turn the opposite way in the southern hemisphere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCyclones are like giant weather engines fuelled by water vapour as it evaporates from the sea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWarm, moist air rises away from the surface, creating a low pressure system that sucks in air from surrounding areas \u0026#8211; which in turn is warmed by the ocean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the vapour rises it cools and condenses into swirling bands of cumulonimbus storm clouds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe system grows and spins faster, sucking in more air and feeding off the energy in sea water that has been warmed by the sun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the centre, a calm \u0026#8220;eye\u0026#8221; of the storm is created where cooled air sinks towards the ultra-low pressure zone below, surrounded by spiralling winds of warm air rising.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe faster the wind, the lower the air pressure at the centre and the storm grows stronger and stronger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTropical cyclones usually weaken when they hit land as they are no longer fed by evaporation from the warm sea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut they often move far inland \u0026#8211; dumping huge amounts of rain and causing devastating wind damage \u0026#8211; before the \u0026#8220;fuel\u0026#8221; runs out and the storm peters out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHurricanes can also cause storm surges when the low air pressure sucks the sea level higher than normal, swamping low-lying coasts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure

counterterrorism operation, the White House announced on Saturday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"zqH6nu\"\u003eBin Laden’s death was \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/world/2019/8/1/20750119/hamza-bin-laden-killed-dead-al-qaeda-osama-9-11-terrorism\"\u003efirst reported on July 31\u003c/a\u003e. The news was met with skepticism from some corners, given terrorist leaders have been reported dead before only to resurface months later. Anonymous intelligence officials cited in the reports also would not, or could not, indicate whether the US had been involved in his death, which they said had occurred within in the last two years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"UAtfAu\"\u003eSaturday’s announcement also did not say when or how bin Laden had been killed. In a \u003ca href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-from-the-president-10/\"\u003estatement from President Donald Trump\u003c/a\u003e, the White House confirmed his death and claimed responsibility for the attack that killed him:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Vf6aKj\"\u003e“Hamza bin Ladin, the high-ranking al-Qa’ida member and son of Usama bin Ladin, was killed in a United States counterterrorism operation in the Afghanistan/Pakistan region,” the statement read, using alternate spellings for the terrorist organization and bin Laden family name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"gjNiKk\"\u003eHamza bin Laden was believed to be in his early 30s at the time of his death, and was married to the daughter of Mohammed Atta, the lead hijacker in the September 11 attacks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"2XjBQJ\"\u003eIt is not clear how much Hamza bin Laden’s death will affect al-Qaeda\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Wbxzql\"\u003eIt is not unusual for information about the deaths of reclusive terrorist leaders to be spotty, as \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/world/2019/8/1/20750119/hamza-bin-laden-killed-dead-al-qaeda-osama-9-11-terrorism\"\u003eVox’s Jennifer Williams has reported\u003c/a\u003e. Senior al-Qaeda operative Mokhtar Belmokhtar and ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi have both been reported dead — only to be later found alive and well — many times. Intelligence gathering is difficult in remote or chaotic regions, and heavily-pursued leaders are also skilled at concealing their movements. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"cUX9qE\"\u003eUS officials also often keep the details of the sorts of operations that would take out a terrorist leader under wraps, for fear of revealing classified sources or military methodology. It is likely these reasons are the cause of the delay between initial reports of bin Laden’s demise and the White House’s statement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ec5zYA\"\u003eWhile Saturday’s confirmation of Hamza bin Laden’s death is the clearest indication to date that he is, in fact, dead, it is yet unclear what kind of effect that will have on the al-Qaeda network.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"EclTY2\"\u003eHamza bin Laden is believed to be Osama bin Laden’s last remaining last remaining son affiliated with al-Qaeda; one of his brothers was killed during the 2011 Abbottabad, Pakistan Navy SEAL raid that took Osama bin Laden’s life, and another is not in the group, \u003ca href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/son-of-osama-bin-laden-believed-dead-11564612151\"\u003eaccording to the Wall Street Journal\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"1i1rLw\"\u003eSome counterterrorism experts feared the young bin Laden could use his family name to rally al-Qaeda’s forces, and that he was beginning to assume more responsibilities within the organization, which is currently run by Ayman al-Zawahiri, Osama bin Laden’s former top aide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"9wYbLO\"\u003eDuring a February briefing on the scion, \u003ca href=\"https://www.state.gov/new-tools-to-counter-al-qaida-and-its-future-leadership/\"\u003eAssistant Secretary of State for Diplomatic Security Michael Evanoff said\u003c/a\u003e Hamza was of growing concern because he “has released audio and video messages on the Internet, calling on his followers to launch attacks against the United States and its Western allies, and he has threatened attacks against the United States in revenge for the May 2011 killing of his father by US military forces.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"xxAGm8\"\u003eThese actions led the US State Department to call the young bin Laden an emerging terrorist leader earlier this year and to offer up to $1 million for information leading to his capture. UN member states froze his assets and imposed a travel ban on him, and Saudi Arabia revoked his citizenship, according to official newspaper Um al-Qura.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"eT4FT2\"\u003eNow, the White House is framing the scion’s death as a major blow for the terrorist organization. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"m74DSJ\"\u003e“The loss of Hamza bin Ladin not only deprives al-Qa’ida of important leadership skills and the symbolic connection to his father, but undermines important operational activities of the group.

Even before bin Laden’s death, the terrorist organization was struggling: In recent years, it has faced military opposition by the US and its allies, the death of Osama bin Laden, and competition for recruits and resources by ISIS that has left it a shadow of its former self. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"x4eUSn\"\u003eIt is true, however, that the younger bin Laden was seen as charismatic, millennial warrior who could use his family name to one day bring the group back to its former strength, a view that led to Hamza’s nickname, the \u003ca href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/al-qaeda/8512008/What-next-for-Brand-Bin-Laden.html\"\u003e“Crown Prince of Terror.”\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"fyfmAN\"\u003eHowever, ahead of his death, the scion had done little to really seize that mantle, beyond his digital calls to arms.

quelled.\u003c/p\u003e","url":"https://www.vox.com/2019/9/14/20865775/hamza-bin-laden-osama-son-killed-counterterrorism-operation-white-house-confirms","published":"2019-09-14T15:47:33Z","guid":"https://www.vox.com/2019/9/14/20865775/hamza-bin-laden-osama-son-killed-counterterrorism-operation-white-house-confirms"}]},{"url":"https://feeds.skynews.com/feeds/rss/world.xml","items":[{"title":"Mugabe's

Iran has reduced enrichment from 20 percent to three and a half percent, loaded the Arak heavy water reactor with concrete and actually shut it down, removed centrifuges in Fordow and changed the facility from an enrichment centre to a research centre.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn sum, Iran has fulfilled all its commitments, and international inspectors and observers have confirmed it, but the US and European powers have not only failed to fulfil their obligations, but the Trump administration withdrew from this international agreement and actually violated it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNotable among the reactions was the reaction of the European countries. Not only did they not condemn the US’ unlawful action, they also implicitly accompanied Trump in setting forth new issues and his bid to redefine the JCPOA. The Islamic Republic of Iran, after several years of strategic patience and observing its legal and ethical commitments under the deal, has taken two steps to return to the pre-deal situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIran\u0026#8217;s actions and its threat to take a third step prompted Western nations, which had violated all of the provisions of the JCPOA, to launch new efforts to persuade Iran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe will elaborate on the reasons and the contents of the new negotiations in the future, but in this brief review we will discuss why France came forward to negotiate with Iran after Britain, Oman and Japan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe key question in this regard is why France should assume the role of mediator between Iran and the United States in the new situation. Is France in the position of an independent actor in this period, or is it an actor which is following the US policies and recommendations and has entered the game on behalf of the US?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn response to the question of why France has accepted the role of mediator in the negotiations at this juncture and is trying to force Iran to renegotiate the deal, it should be noted that France is a member of the European Union which has always played the role of a US ally. France has always entered the game on behalf of the US when it comes to common interests and threats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrance used to play the role of bad cop during previous negotiations that led to the JCPOA, but in the new circumstances, it is trying to portray itself as a good cop. A number of important factors have made Paris prefer the role of a mediator rather than the bad cop and enter the game after numerous mediations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMost of the regional developments designed within the context of the Western and Arab scenarios have either come to an end or are at their final stages; scenarios such as the crisis in Syria, Iraq, etc. Of course, none of these developments resulted in the objectives that Western and Arab countries were pursuing. All of these crises ended as Iran and its regional allies wanted. It means that the costly and damaging strategies of the anti-Iran front totally failed. This failure means the collapse of a US-led regional and global front against Iran. In fact, in the war of strategies, it was Iran\u0026#8217;s strategy that showed its power to the world.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTehran has adopted a revolutionary and aggressive counter-strategy on the issue of nuclear deal after years of strategic patience in face of the failure of the US and European countries in fulfilling their JCPOA commitments. In fact, the Islamic Republic showed a balance of pressure by adopting a revolutionary approach in its diplomacy backed by its regional victories. The world saw the apex of this political authority during the meeting of Iran’s leader with the Japanese Prime Minister. The steps taken by Iran to return to the pre-JCPOA situation also completed this balance. This was an important factor in destroying the assumptions of the countries that were against Iran.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAnother important issue that prompted the US to choose France for the new negotiations was the demonstration of Iran\u0026#8217;s power in the physical confrontations that took place in the strategic waterway of Persian Gulf. The West understood that Iran is not a country like Gaddafi’s Libya or Saddam\u0026#8217;s Iraq. They realised that Iran will not easily give in to political and economic pressure and cannot be defeated by a Trojan horse. Iran\u0026#8217;s authority at sea and air forces France to play the role of a good cop. France, in fact, is a soldier working for the United States and its mission is to make up for the strategic failures.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIn scenarios designed by the US-led Western front and supported by some Arab countries, destabilisation of Iran was on the agenda. This front accepted to pay a heavy political price, especially after it was disclosed that certain media outlets had been tasked with carrying out anti-Iran media operations. That is why in the atmosphere of psychological and media operations, there was always talk of a “hot summer” in Iran, and they expected a nationwide uprising to happen, but the summer came to an end and nothing happened. Just like all the other political, security and military assumptions, this one also failed and their chain of failures completed. Therefore, they found the solution in approaching Iran, because they realised that the only way to choke Iran is to get closer to it. So, negotiation was the best way to get closer to Iran. For Westerners, it is important to bring Iran back to the negotiating table after playing with Iran for years. They think if they can get Iran back to the negotiating table, Tehran will no longer be able to manage the talks, because they (Westerners) have learned in the first round that Iran can be managed once it is dragged into the negotiating table, and in the light of some similar JCPOA commitments the West can control Iran’s movements.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe final point is that the Iranians could not benefit from the nuclear deal or even force the other party to fulfill its obligations. In the new circumstances, Iran has chosen a path that is not different from the negotiations held for the JCPOA. The West is trying to stop Iran’s return to pre-deal situation in the new round of talks. It means that by talking of returning Washington to the agreement they want to lead Iran into a new cycle of giving more concessions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe post \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ifpnews.com/frances-mission-in-new-round-of-talks-over-jcpoa\"\u003eFrance’s Mission in New Round of Talks over JCPOA\u003c/a\u003e appeared first on \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ifpnews.com\"\u003eIran Front Page\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://ifpnews.com/frances-mission-in-new-round-of-talks-over-jcpoa","published":"2019-09-14T09:52:12Z","guid":"https://ifpnews.com/?p=151436"},{"title":"Why Iran’s Leader Has Blocked Negotiation with US","content":"\u003cp\u003eHis position, in addition to showing Iran’s indomitability or resistance against President Trump’s and his favorite regional allies’ so-called “maximum pressure” policy, is aimed at unifying Iran’s foreign policy approach, as well as convincing the country’s political factions that it is futile to negotiate with the US in a time of political inequality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver the past year, the issue of possible negotiation with the US has been heavily debated by Iranian politicians. Proponents of negotiation depict the status of Iran-US relations as the “dilemma of either war or negotiation,” meaning that Iran should negotiate with the Trump administration on matters of regional significance—in return for a reduction in US economic pressure—lest the tensions between the two countries ultimately lead to a war, which would be detrimental to Iran’s national security and its interests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe main argument made by opponents of this view has been that the imminence of a possible war between Iran and the US in essence relies upon a mistaken assumption. Donald Trump, they argue, is unlikely to act against his presidential campaign promises to reduce the US military footprint overseas. Trump, according to this view, understands the potential cost of a risky and unpredictable war with Iran, and realizes that it could be detrimental to his chances of being reelected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn that framework, adopting the Leader’s position of “no war, no negotiation” achieves several aims. First, uniting Iran’s foreign policy approach can shift Iran’s domestic politics to resist Trump and those European countries that believed, at least initially, they could benefit from Trump’s hardline “maximum pressure” policy to gain further concessions from Iran on regional issues and on limiting its missile program.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecond, the “no war, no negotiation” policy shows that Iran is prepared to face a possible conflict with the US under any circumstances. Iran believes that it has the capability to defend itself against the US through both symmetric and asymmetric means, via its conventional military means and through its friendly forces in the Middle East that can, if necessary, endanger US interests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThird and most significantly, this approach minimizes political polarization within Iran when confronting US sanctions. By connecting the issue of US economic sanctions to the more significant issue of national security and the broader threat of instability and even the possible collapse of the “state,” the Leader has been able to enhance the logic of “maximum resistance” in Iranian politics. This is made easier because, from the Iranian perspective, blame for the new wave of hostility between Iran and the US lies with the Trump administration and its withdrawal from the internationally-recognized 2015 nuclear deal (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action or JCPOA) in order to act against Iran’s interests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCohesion in Iranian foreign policy sends two main messages to the remaining parties to the JCPOA—China, France, Germany, Russia, and the United Kingdom. First, it says that Iran will not reverse its strategic decision to resist Trump’s excessive demands and that it has the necessary capabilities to counter them. In this respect, Iran has incrementally reduced its nuclear commitments under the JCPOA—most recently restarting in full nuclear research \u0026amp; development activities that had been restricted until the agreement. These actions have been meant to send a message to European countries that have yet to fulfill their JCPOA commitments. In the end, it is Europe that has the most to lose from the possible collapse of the nuclear deal. Second and concurrently, Iran is making it clear that it will not compromise on its regional policies or missile activities, which have their own logic of deterrence and preemption in the context of national security threats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn other words, “security” and “economy” are the two interconnected priorities in the realm of Iran’s foreign policy conduct, aimed at strengthening the “state” of Iran and its legitimacy. Contrary to some Western views, the three above-mentioned aims are fully consistent with the viewpoints of the moderate government of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, which is frustrated and disappointed with the current Western approach, mainly for not ensuring that the Iranian people receive tangible economic benefits from the JCPOA. Now, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif regards the implementation of the Leader’s strategy to be in the benefit of the country’s national interests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor instance, and in the realm of preserving security, the entire Iranian political spectrum unanimously supported the June 20 shooting down of a US RQ-4A Global Hawk drone, based on the logic of preempting a broader ongoing security threat. In fact, Iran wanted to send the message that it would not tolerate any breach of its territorial borders and would react similarly if such actions are to be continued—and that it could trigger insecurity for any US regional allies who facilitate the Trump administration’s escalatory policies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso in the realm of economic security, the seizure of a British-flagged oil tanker by the naval forces of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) in the Persian Gulf is indicative of Iran’s resolve to take reciprocal action, as well as preempting similar hostile moves by those countries involved in the current “zero-export-oil” economic war against it. In seizing the vessel, Iranian officials made it plain that economic insecurity for Iran is equivalent to economic insecurity for those countries that participate in the “maximum pressure” policy, which from Iran’s perspective and in Zarif’s words is a type of “economic terrorism.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdopting the strategy of “no war, no negotiation” is a testament to Tehran’s existing sense of strategic distrust towards the US Iran believes that the US aims to diminish the sources of power of the “state” of Iran. For decades, indeed, the focus of US Middle East policy has been to contain Iran’s emerging regional influence. But both geography and historical-religious commonalities with its neighbors will define Iran’s regional status, not US policy. These factors necessitate that Iran actively integrate with the region’s political-security and economic trends, mainly for the sake of preserving its national security and economic prosperity. From a realistic perspective, many emerging powers such as India and Turkey are pursuing a more active regional role, commensurate with their territorial and demographic size, vast economic potentials, and most importantly based on the emerging security conditions in their spheres of influence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this respect, it would be rather simplistic to think that the firing of John Bolton, the most anti-Iran figure in the Trump administration, will pave the way for a substantive meeting between President Rouhani and President Trump in the near future. Undoubtedly there is always the possibility of a meeting. But given the current mutual sense of strategic distrust that exists between the two sides, such an encounter would not achieve any meaningful results.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIran’s aims are clear: strengthening its deterrent power, in order to preempt security threats from within the region and beyond, and diversifying and strategizing its economic structure, relying on the sources of its national power. One significant way to achieve these aims is to value the dynamic of regional integration and good neighborhood relations. The Trump administration is trying to block Iran’s path to achieving these aims by creating an anti-Iran political-security coalition in the region, as well as ratcheting up sanctions at the expense of Iran’s economic growth and development.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIndisputably, the Leader’s main goal is to diminish the possibility of a conflict with the US through strengthening the scale of Iran’s national power and depolarizing the nation in this time of crisis. Accordingly, Iran’s assertive reactions to perceived security and economic threats are aimed at preempting broader threats for the survival of the “state” of Iran. In abrogating US obligations under the JCPOA, President Trump has lost Iran’s public, who sincerely at one time wanted their government to interact with the US and resolve the existing strategic discrepancies in the US-Iran relationship. This development is the main reason behind the failure of Trump’s “maximum pressure” policy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt present, the causes of Iranian distrust toward the US, which was previously institutionalized among Iranian officials, have extended to the Iranian public as well, diminishing the possible political benefits to any negotiations with the Trump administration. As a result, Iran is gradually learning to consider the West as only one part of the current multilateral world. This sense of understanding is new and is likely to completely change the Iran-West equation in the coming decade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the light of these considerations, meaningful negotiations between Iran and the US will only occur when the two sides manage to withdraw from the current mutual sense of strategic distrust and when concurrently the idea of such negotiations is supported amid the two countries’ domestic politics—especially on Iran’s side. In my experience, only by strengthening its position and security situation will Iran be able to return eventually to the idea of talking with the US The JCPOA was negotiated under similar conditions. Therefore, President Trump’s efforts to weaken Iran first and then initiate negotiation with the country are doomed and will only perpetuate previous, failed US policy toward Iran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(Source: \u003ca href=\"https://lobelog.com/why-ayatollah-khamenei-has-blocked-negotiation-with-the-u-s/\"\u003eLeblog\u003c/a\u003e)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe
