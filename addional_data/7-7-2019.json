The researchers decided to do something about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThey surveyed Facebook users about their emotional reactions to using the social network. Those findings helped drive one of the biggest changes Facebook has made to date: Showing users \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2018/01/12/facebook-news-feed-change/\"\u003emore posts from friends and family\u003c/a\u003e rather than businesses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe point was to increase interaction between users, whether commenting or liking posts. The more that people did so, the better they felt, the research found.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe change pushed by Facebook’s little-known well-being team is just one of many issues the group has explored. Its mission is to reduce any negative effects associated with using Facebook, a nearly ubiquitous presence in modern life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“I came to Facebook because I wanted to have more applied impact with my research,” said Jennifer Guadagno, a research manager for the well-being team. “I felt that my academic research was a few steps more removed from directly impacting people than I personally desired.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe research is becoming increasingly important as Facebook along with other social media services face intense criticism for exacerbating behavior like addiction and contributing to low self-esteem and loneliness. Those critiques, among a host of others like bullying on the service, are helping fuel calls for more oversight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe team has a major challenge ahead as it aims to solve a growing conundrum within the tech industry: How to positively impact users’ lives. And over the years, various independent studies have shown that using Facebook can increase depression and make users feel less satisfied with their lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eA study earlier this year by researchers unaffiliated with Facebook found that people who deactivated their Facebook accounts were happier and more satisfied and felt less anxious and depressed. It was in sharp contrast to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who often brags about Facebook being a critical tool for connecting the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“It certainly says there’s an issue there that needs to be addressed, ”said Matthew Gentzkow, a professor at Stanford University who authored the study along with three other professors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSimilarly, a study by researchers at Yale and the University of California at San Diego published in the \u003cem\u003eAmerican Journal of Epidemiology\u003c/em\u003e in 2017 suggested that the more people used Facebook, the worse their mental health and personal satisfaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the criticism may be painful to hear, Facebook’s researchers said they understand it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“The people who are critical about well-being care very much, just as we do,” said Moira Burke, research scientist who focuses on Facebook’s social science research. “We all want the same thing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition to championing the change to Facebook\u0026#8217;s news feed algorithm last year, the team has also helped Facebook create a feature for users to honor loved ones with memorial pages and another that lets users temporarily hide specific friends’ posts so they don\u0026#8217;t have to see updates from an ex-spouse, for example.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe team is also exploring how Facebook can help people who recently moved to a new city find new friends or to explore their new community. And researchers want to find ways to help people avoid feeling worse about themselves after comparing their lives to the often idealized ones of smiling babies and exotic vacations that friends invariably post.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAny suggestion the team makes to Facebook\u0026#8217;s management is only that—a suggestion. Facebook\u0026#8217;s leaders get the ultimate say about what should be adopted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that\u0026#8217;s the problem, suggests Jennifer Grygiel, a Syracuse University assistant professor who has studied the problem of policing social media content. Hate speech, violent content, and harassment have become so widespread that Facebook can\u0026#8217;t keep up. And while users may complain, Facebook is under no requirement to make any changes to address those problems or any others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;These are corporate entities, and they\u0026#8217;re accountable to their shareholders and their profits,\u0026#8221; Grygiel said. \u0026#8220;They say that they want to help us—that they are putting processes in place to protect us—but they aren’t and don’t have the resources in place to do that.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe problem with Facebook\u0026#8217;s internal research boils down to one thing, says Grygiel: \u0026#8220;Nothing can truly be independent when Mark Zuckerberg is the majority shareholder of the company.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe well-being team hopes it can change that impression by applying academic standards to their work, like publishing papers in well-respected peer-reviewed journals. Ultimately, the researchers say they are approaching Facebook\u0026#8217;s problems the only way they know how: as scholars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe team loosely dates back to 2009, when Burke, who joined Facebook that year as a researcher, began exploring Facebook’s effects on its users\u0026#8217; well-being. Since then, the team has grown to a \u0026#8220;few dozen people,\u0026#8221; according to the company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMany of its members have lengthy academic backgrounds. For example, Guadagno has a Ph.D. in psychology from Duke, where she studied the effect of mindfulness on well-being; Burke received her Ph.D. in human-computer interaction from Carnie Mellon University.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFacebook’s researchers define the term “well-being” as “how people perceive their lives.” Within that scope, they focus on three specific areas: unhealthy amounts of time spent on Facebook, loneliness, and declines in self-worth related to users comparing themselves to others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“These issues are things that have a deep impact on people lives and have played out on Facebook,” Facebook\u0026#8217;s Guadagno said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe team uses previously published academic research to aid it in its studies and has published more than 10 of its own papers based on research conducted at Facebook. The team also relies on Facebook users to serve as subjects for its studies, in some cases for months.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOne study showed that people weren’t lonely because they used Facebook; rather they used Facebook when they were feeling lonely. In their findings, Facebook was a solution, not the problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe researchers also often team up with experts from universities, nonprofits, and other organizations. In some cases, those outsiders have embedded within Facebook to provide an independent perspective.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut the research is still incomplete considering that the long-term impact of social media is unknown. After all, Facebook has only been around for 15 years.

Jay Inslee if Miami can be \u0026#8220;saved\u0026#8221; from climate change, and asking former U.S. Rep. John Delaney if Trump should be prosecuted for crimes after leaving office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere is, however, the view that having someone attuned to one political perspective may add value.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePhilip Klein, executive editor of the conservative-friendly Washington Examiner, wrote before the debate that Maddow\u0026#8217;s participation might be a good idea if she didn\u0026#8217;t ask softball questions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHe said Tuesday that Maddow did a perfectly fine job. \u0026#8220;As somebody tapped into the thinking of ideological liberals, she was able to press candidates on a number of areas of concern to this key voting bloc,\u0026#8221; he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSimilarly, the issues that get the most attention on Fox News can give their town halls a markedly different flavor than those elsewhere. Fox\u0026#8217;s forum with Julian Castro, for example, was held on the day that Trump was in the news for an ABC News interview that discussed accepting opposition research from foreign governments in 2020.

There are worries among the Wall Streeters that if the wealth gaps keeps growing it will trigger a more radical backlash \u0026#8212; what they ominously called the pitchforks. Yet that doesn’t mean they support her proposal for a wealth tax.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd some privately predicted she will shift to the center if she becomes the nominee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eSwitching Sides\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOpenness toward Warren may signal a change from just three years ago, when powerful Democrats in the financial industry sought to block her potential rise to the White House. In mid-2016, a dozen major donors from Wall Street warned in interviews with\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2016/06/elizabeth-warren-wall-street-vice-president-224489\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003ePolitico\u0026nbsp;\u003c/a\u003ethat they wouldn’t give money to Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign if she chose Warren as her running mate. Donors feared Warren would push Clinton too far to the left and harm the economy. Clinton ended up selecting Virginia Senator Tim Kaine. They lost to Trump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWall Streeters’ views have proven adaptable over the years. Some like to think of themselves as savvy investors in politics, able to bet early on the next big thing. At least a few prominent financiers are known to trade stories about how early they backed then-Senator Obama in the 2008 presidential race. Sometimes support is a calculated move. Even donors who backed Clinton later gave to Trump’s inauguration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eYet Warren’s criticism of the industry has at times flared into direct clashes with its most prominent leaders.

have much in the way of value aside from being markers on the map these days.  It is the ihubs that count, and they were wiped out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv data-shortcode=\"caption\"

The major manufacturers have moved from creating pinball machines to slot machines for casinos, a business with a much rosier future. With even larger arcades only sporting one or two pinball machines, most likely emblazoned with licensed artwork from a popular movie or TV show, enthusiasts of the game are forced to look backward for their joy, not forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pinball has seen a steady decline since the 90s. Chicago used to have many manufacturers that cranked out thousands of games each year. In the 80s and 90s, video games became popular and pinball sales suffered,\" Karl Marsicek explained to Ars. He knows a little bit about the lost art of pinball: his basement houses a collection of machines he has bought and restored. \"There is only one manufacturer left, Stern Pinball. They put out about 4 or 5 new titles each year, just a fraction of what manufacturers were cranking out in Pinball’s glory days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a hobby, collecting and restoring pinball machines is tough. The machines are loud, large, heavy, and expensive. The problem is, if you can't play a game at your local arcade, the only place left is your own basement. \"The many machines that were produced in the '80s and '90s have reached the end of their life cycle and are disappearing from bars and pizza joints,\" Marsicek said. \"Strip mall arcades are just about extinct because of computer games and gaming consoles.

Your Pregnancy Is Political","content":"\u003cp class=\"dropcap\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe linguistic worlds of pregnancy and abortion are radically different. When someone is experiencing a wanted pregnancy, everyone from doctors to popular websites such as The Bump refer to “your baby” and discuss milestones, like hearing a heartbeat during an early ultrasound. In the political debate over abortion, language is a battlefield. Pro-abortion-rights activists are on high alert for what they describe as efforts to “humanize fetuses,” from \u003ca href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2019/05/embryos-dont-have-hearts.html\"\u003epolicing the line\u003c/a\u003e between early “cardiac activity” and “heartbeats” to \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/naral/status/696485576040714240?lang=en\"\u003ecalling out\u003c/a\u003e Doritos \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cgef8tn1sAA\"\u003eSuper Bowl ads\u003c/a\u003e, while anti-abortion groups lobby for “the right to life” from the earliest days of pregnancy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eSometimes, however, these two worlds collide. Lila Rose, who founded and leads the anti-abortion group Live Action, has been an activist on this issue since she was 15. Now, at age 30, she is pregnant for the first time. Although she is still in the early weeks of her second trimester, her pregnancy has quickly become part of her advocacy work.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e“Our first ultrasound at 7 weeks, hearing our baby’s heartbeat for the first time,” Rose\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/LilaGraceRose/status/1130221962775543808\"\u003e tweeted in mid-May\u003c/a\u003e, along with a video of a monitor screen showing her womb. “How can any abortion supporter in good conscience hear this heartbeat and imagine ending it, not by a hired hitman, but by their own hands?” The tweet was liked 14,000 times, and the replies unspooled into a full-fledged battle over the ethics of abortion; a significant portion of Rose’s 207,000 Twitter followers regularly spar with her over her views. A week later, Rose tweeted about all the disability-detection tests she was offered during her first doctor’s appointment. When Rose asked what would happen if any of the tests were positive, she said, the doctor told her they would consider “our options.” “Our medical system is on a search \u0026amp; destroy hunt for babies w/ disability,” she \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/LilaGraceRose/status/1132372203150823424\"\u003etweeted\u003c/a\u003e. “I’m finding a new doc.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eFor any family, pregnancy raises a huge number of questions about bioethics and how public or private they want the experience to be. For Rose, these questions are washed through the additional layer of her professional identity. In a recent conversation, she told me that her pregnancy is about expanding her family and bringing life into the world. But it’s also a living testament to her political values. Rose found out she was pregnant around the same time that near-total abortion bans in Alabama, Georgia, and Missouri were making national headlines this spring. Newly pregnant and watching those debates unfold was “very personally painful,” Rose told me, “to look at the outright misinformation, and the way information is twisted by abortion advocates to try to further dehumanize human beings in the womb.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/05/alabama-georgia-abortion-bills/589504/?utm_source=feed\"\u003eRead: The new abortion bills are a dare\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eRose is a controversial figure.

It had a lot of detailed information about how your diet, your stress levels, different elements of your lifestyle can impact the development of a child, and how much communication there is between your bodies.

I experienced a lot of nausea in the first trimester; most women do. But there’s no medical explanation, so far, for why women get nauseous in the first trimester in pregnancy, which I was shocked to discover.

On the one hand, you research, “When does the baby’s heart start beating?” and doctors, medical experts, and any number of motherhood websites talk about how you can hear the heartbeat at six or seven or eight weeks. And you have all this new reporting being done by abortion advocates in media who are trying to discredit heartbeat bills by saying, “It’s actually not a heartbeat, it’s an electrical flicker,” or, “The science behind the heartbeat bill is incorrect.” Well, if the science behind the heartbeat bill is incorrect, then every single ob-gyn who has been telling their patients that they can hear the heartbeat at six and seven weeks, they have also been lying to their patients for years.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eFor me, that was personally very painful, to look at the outright misinformation and the way information is twisted by abortion advocates to further dehumanize human beings in the womb.

That’s something that doctors might term as being incompatible with life—there’s no way for a baby to live after it exits the womb.

Often a baby like that can die during delivery or minutes after birth. But there is a tremendous difference morally, and I think personally, for the bond between parents and a child to intentionally destroy a human life, and to love that child in his or her last moments when they’re dying naturally.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eDoctors talk to women and patients about abortion as if it’s a humane thing to do.

They involve tearing the child limb from torso, or the lethal injection of a drug into a baby’s heart which poisons them to death over an hour’s time.

You’re dealing with the potential for life and death, both for your baby and also in the process of giving birth.

In the experiment, the mothers had to describe their body from top to bottom. One group had to say only negative things and the other group only positive things. Marisol Perez, one of the lead researchers of the study and a body-image expert, says some of the women couldn’t find anything redeeming to say about themselves.

For a yet-to-be-published study, Perez collected data on 72 female executives to document how women’s insecurities about their looks play out in professional settings and affect their self-esteem well into adulthood. Almost half of these managerial-level women reported discomfort in socializing, and in representing their company, because they were self-conscious about how other people perceived their appearance. “We have women who have already made it to the C-suite still struggling with this issue,” Perez said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eSo what’s the answer?

The internet remains fiercely divided on an age-old question: Should you tell your daughter she’s beautiful? Experts say that a constant loop of “You’re beautiful” is counterproductive. It doesn’t protect against societal messaging that conveys that girls are valued, first and foremost, for being pretty.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eMoreover, there’s an element of faux empowerment in the “everyone is beautiful” movement. While the goal of wanting to broaden our beauty standards is noble, beauty is defined in part by its rarity, and it’s not everyone’s job to be beautiful, says \u003ca href=\"https://www.psychology.northwestern.edu/people/faculty/core/profiles/renee-engeln.html\"\u003eRenee Engeln\u003c/a\u003e, a psychology professor at Northwestern who studies body image and the media. “If what you really mean when you call your daughter beautiful is that she is strong, smart, resilient, or funny, use those more specific adjectives instead,” she says.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWhat mothers do in front of their daughters likely matters even more than what they say. “I was anorexic when I was teenager, so I had some come-to-Jesus moments when I had a daughter,” says Peggy Orenstein, the author of \u003ca href=\"https://www.peggyorenstein.com/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eDon’t Call Me Princess\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. “It was scary for me. I had to learn that it was important for my daughter to see me eat ice cream and not just have a ‘bite’ of someone else’s. I wanted my daughter to be less preoccupied with weight and food, but I needed to transcend some of my own food issues.” In practice, Orenstein says, this has meant not having scales in the house; not describing food in terms of good versus bad or fattening versus not fattening; and talking more about how foods taste and whether they leave you feeling full or not full.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eAt its best, motherhood can be an opportunity to question what your own family taught you about your body and to make conscious choices about which of those values—if any—you want to pass along. At its worst, motherhood can be an Instagram rabbit hole of body shame, or an endless stream of “Looking good, Mama” comments that, however well intentioned, use a person’s looks as the measure of her intrinsic worth. The result? Perez says she’s heard a 5-year-old declare, “Mommy says to sit up straight because it makes my stomach look flat.”  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThere are many other ways in which we unwittingly invite girls to criticize their own appearance and pursue unrealistic standards of beauty. Parents who prioritize their kids’ healthy eating but talk obsessively about cutting carbs, feeling fat, and preparing for their next juice cleanse should consider what scientific data reveal. Looking at a decade of research, Engeln says the evidence is unequivocal that talk focusing on weight, even with an eye toward “health,” is not helpful. The best practice is to portray food as fuel and to value the human body not for how it’s shaped but for what it can do. Engeln also suggests that parents, in talking with teenagers in the depths of turmoil over their body image, try to help them channel their anger and angst into answering questions such as: Who benefits when girls and women feel bad about their bodies? Who makes money off of women’s insecurities?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eAs a mother living in America, I’m always surprised by how often people tell my daughter, “You’re beautiful.” I don’t think her experience is unique. These comments are just part of the cultural script of what people say to young girls. I have typically responded by saying something like: “But she’s smart, too.” This gets to be tedious for me, and to others it might sound like the lady doth protest too much.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eInstead, here are a few things I’ll be working on: I’m going to spend less time fretting in front of the mirror. In my household, we’re banning comments about the appearance of other women, particularly the ones running for president. Finally, I’m going to steal the stock response that Perez uses when someone tells her one of her daughters is beautiful: “And it’s the least interesting thing about her.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/f2tDwEvWxHc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/f2tDwEvWxHc/","published":"2019-07-07T10:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-593398"},{"title":"The Guilty Pleasures of Mansion Porn","content":"\u003cp\u003eMansion, \u003cem\u003eThe\u003c/em\u003e \u003cem\u003eWall Street Journal\u003c/em\u003e’s real-estate supplement, arrives each Friday slipped into the middle of my newsprint edition, the way pornography (so I’m told!) used to come in unmarked envelopes back before the internet placed it at everyone’s fingertips. I’m satisfied with my weekly print version, but you may prefer reading Mansion on the web, where the photographs are more numerous, detailed, lurid, and explicit.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLots of newspapers in the United States—\u003cem\u003eHa! Look at me, I wrote “lots of newspapers”\u003c/em\u003e—I mean, the few newspapers that still exist in the United States, cover the real-estate market in matter-of-fact terms, often in a weekend flyer. You get mid-range listings, mortgage tips, market forecasts, and so on. The effort is invariably respectable and modest in ambition. Mansion is up to something else altogether. Like all great storytelling, Mansion leaves us to uncover the great human truths as if on our own; it shows rather than tells. You have to bring your own mockery and horror.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe comparison to porn is apt. It’s also unoriginal and incomplete. A little more than a decade ago, when the century was young and right before their real-estate holdings drove millions of people into bankruptcy, \u003cem\u003eNew York \u003c/em\u003emagazine ran a regular feature about how fabulous it was to own real estate. And not just to own it, but to fantasize about it, drool over it, caress the photos and the sales price as though they were objects of sensual desire. The feature was called “Real Estate Porn,” in keeping with the salacious content.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMansion invokes the same feelings of naughtiness: You’re watching people do something that, in a fairer and more just world, you’d be doing yourself. I think of Vivian Dixon and John Chapple, a married couple that Mansion introduced us to not long ago, as the exemplars of the Mansion character. They are voluptuaries of real estate. They grab houses the way the rest of us scoop mints from the little bowl as we leave a restaurant. At the time of the article’s publication, in May, they owned six residences, though by the time the piece ends you suspect their trigger finger is getting itchy again.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe tale of the Dixon-Chapples is a saga of houses found, houses upgraded beyond recognition, houses scarcely lived in. Homeownership, for them as for so many Mansion people, is an additive activity. The most ordinary of their houses, from what I can tell, is a vacation house in Wisconsin. They bought the place for $800,000, then duded it up with a $1.8 million renovation. When their hometown of Seattle proved too rainy, they headed to the Big Island of Hawaii and bought a three-bedroom condo. From the new condo they caught sight of a three-bedroom house dangling just down the hill, ripe for the plucking. Pluck! $2.5 million.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBack at the Seattle house, their dog, a German shepherd called Max, felt cooped up. So the couple treats him to a new house in suburban Woodinville set on 2.17 “dog-friendly acres,” which are, happy to say, adjacent to a 60-acre “off-leash” dog park. Then Dixon heads down the California coast to visit her relatives at the beach. At a car wash she leafs through a magazine that features an ad she finds irresistible, for a house that happens to be nearby: 8,000 square feet of heaven, if heaven has ocean views. $5.9 million later, this house too is theirs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe learn from Mansion that the Dixon-Chapples show as little restraint in decorating their properties as they do in acquiring them. Chapple is a sports fan. That lake house in Wisconsin—the kitchen countertops had to be of green granite, as a tribute to his favorite professional football team, the one in Green Bay. As for college hoops: “To keep him happy,” Mansion tells us, “Ms. Dixon decorated areas of the homes in … bright orange and blue in honor of Syracuse University.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEven Syracuse’s most avid alumni have to agree that the combination of bright orange and blue doesn’t look good even on basketball jerseys, much less in bathrooms and kitchens. But the requirements of Chapple’s fandom are unyielding. When his wife swooped up the California beach house, “all the couple had to do to the house [was] paint the workout area orange and blue.” The beach house, as luck would have it, is also adjacent to a dog park, where the Dixon-Chapples let Jim Boeheim run off-leash in the summer months.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI kid. But somebody has to. Mansion’s treatment of rich people’s real-estate crochets lacks irony; it begs for snark. This is both the strength and the weakness of the Mansion approach. The article about the house-hungry Dixon-Chapples, for example, isn’t about a possibly clinical compulsion afflicting a couple with too much money but about the demands of \u003cem\u003eupkeep\u003c/em\u003e. (The damage wrought by toads in Hawaii; the cracking marble in a master-bedroom shower: “It’s exhausting,” Vivian Dixon says. “A full time job.”)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis willingness to take the wealthy on their own terms is a rarity in American business journalism. Reporters are usually more leery in their treatment of such subjects, when not nakedly hostile. Few people in the world despise the winners of the capitalist lotto more than the sorry drudges who are called to write about them. You’ll find a higher percentage of committed socialists in the newsroom of the \u003cem\u003eFinancial Times \u003c/em\u003ethan at a lakefront party at Bernie Sanders’s dacha.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOccasionally, it’s true, Mansion strikes discordant notes. One recurring feature about celebrities, titled “House Call,” not long ago gave us Moby, who in the 1990s, we are reminded, was “a pioneer of electronic dance music.” (I’m one who needed reminding: I can scarcely remember his music, perhaps because the 1990s is when I stopped dancing.) Moby’s story, as told to Mansion, is unrelievedly squalid, a Dickensian coming-of-age tale about a young fellow abandoned by his father and yanked around the country by an itinerant, drug-addled mother. Here’s a brief excerpt, so un-Mansion-like: “Being ashamed was my lot. My mother’s hippie life meant chaos, poverty, and shame.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is the stuff of real journalism, and yet, set alongside stories like that of the Dixon-Chapples, we glimpse an unmistakable spiritual lesson, feel a moralizing prod. You have a choice in life, Mansion implies: Give in to house lust as Dixon and Chapple have done, or you’ll wind up like Moby’s hippie mom. As if to drive the point home, we are told that Moby now lives in Los Angeles in a 2,500-square-foot house—a shack, by Mansion standards—with a swimming pool he has filled with dirt. Not a laff riot, is Moby.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNext to house lust, the motive power of Mansion lies in the possibilities, however implicit, for envy: green-eyed, palm-dampened, parched-mouth resentment. The editors, of course, know this, but here again they show rather than tell, leaving readers to react as they will. The most unexpected feature in the newsprint edition of Mansion is the full-color, double-page spread of advertisements for fancy residences, often selling in the mid-eight figures—what Mansion has taught me to call “high-end properties.” (That’s another benefit to reading Mansion: the endless opportunity to expand one’s vocabulary. A few weeks back I discovered the word \u003cem\u003eMando-pop\u003c/em\u003e, which thrilled me though I will never use it. Some sentences hit my eye as little more than a Mad Lib of misprints: “The powder room has a quartz Sonobath sink and burned, shou sugi ban wood walls.”)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe ads are dressed up to look functional, a straightforward means of bringing buyer and seller together. But I suspect they are merely entertainment, or a provocation, depending on readers’ dispositions. I have limited experience with the super rich as a class—this may explain why I don’t dislike them—and my only firsthand experience with real estate is as the minority owner, with Citibank, of a 90-year-old suburban bungalow roughly half the size of Moby’s. Still, my intuition tells me that a man or a woman who is in the market for a private island off Vancouver or a 1,200-acre horse farm outside Charlottesville does not hop out of bed every Friday and run down to the 7-Eleven to buy that day’s \u003cem\u003eWall Street Journal \u003c/em\u003eto see what’s new in the real-estate listings. Someone looking to buy a manor house with a working observatory and a 12-car garage has other options for finding the home of his dreams.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNo, the ads are meant for the rest of us. Whether they seem an act of taunting sadism on the part of the editors or merely an amusing diversion is, again, up to the reader. For those not naturally inclined to envy I am delighted to report that each week Mansion offers many opportunities for envy’s inverse, schadenfreude—that most Germanic of words for that most Germanic of sensations: delight in the discomfort of others.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA recurring theme in the past year has been the “softness” of the luxury market. Everyone over the age of 20 remembers the 2008 crash. Mansion people have endured many booms and busts since then. “Miami Condo King Relists His Own for 45% Less” is a typical tale of woe. This condo king—Pérez is his name—built a 3,600-square-foot penthouse with a 4,000-square-foot terrace for $4 million. He tried to flip it for $20 million. The market tanked. His new asking price is $10.95 million. Mansion featured sumptuous pictures of the condo but none of Pérez personally. Perhaps he’s hiding from the shame of selling his penthouse for half his original asking price but more than twice what he paid for it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAgreed: This is low-grade schadenfreude. But there’s much more. Stories about the tyranny of condo boards and homeowners associations—HOAs—will offer pleasure to any reader who can’t afford to join one. In Mansion, inter-residential conflicts pit the super rich against the merely rich, and the rest of us get to watch.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy favorite Mansion story involves just such a conflict. It described the fastidiously secretive manner in which Mark Zuckerberg has acquired his real-estate holdings.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eZuckerberg’s new neighbors are usually the last to know who’s moving in. He quietly bought a $7 million house in Palo Alto, California, not far from Facebook’s headquarters, then secretly bought up the adjacent houses one by one, according to Mansion, as a way to skirt zoning laws. Presumably his goal is to combine the lots for a kind of Zuckerland in the middle of the block. The city’s Architectural Review Board isn’t happy, and the neighbors who weren’t lucky enough to get a chance to sell their houses to him are \u003cem\u003efurious\u003c/em\u003e. The gears of justice continue to grind, though whether they will have the happy outcome of grinding Zuck is unclear.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFurther north, in the Noe Valley neighborhood of San Francisco, Zuckerberg bought a house for $9,999,999. (The reader can’t help but wonder: Would the extra dollar, making it a round $10 million, have been a deal breaker for Zuckerberg?) Construction noise from his remodeling irritated the neighbors. Then his security people started hogging the street parking with their SUVs. Billionaires! What are you going to do? The neighbors, who are merely rich, knew what to do. They circulated a petition of protest, ginned up bad publicity, and sicced their city supervisor on their new neighbor, the super-rich interloper. He’s apologized. Apologies, as Facebook users know, are a Zuckerberg specialty.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn stories like this, Mansion lays out the sort of conflict that readers of a certain age will recall from the ferocious Iran-Iraq War of the 1980s: Any decent person wants both sides to lose. Few people are as rich as Mark Zuckerberg, but you do get the idea that the vastness of his wealth isn’t what makes his presence so irksome to his neighbors. They would object even if his net worth were a tenth—a hundredth!—of what it is, just so long as it was more than theirs. Relativity governs the Mansion world no less than it does our own. If you own a $9 million house, a $9.999 million house next door must seem a grotesque extravagance. For most of us, the income bracket that defines a member of the class of the loathsome rich begins roughly a hundred dollars above our annual salary.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEvery week Mansion brings us this sort of home truth—clear-eyed but not censorious; shown but not told—and I have to say I find it deeply rewarding. I finish reading Mansion each Friday morning, fold the paper, and then, alas, take a good look around at my own lot. The house paint is peeling off the bungalow that Citibank and I own, the toilet in my second bathroom has sprung a leak, the cat has scratched through the screen door, the air conditioner has developed a menacing gurgle, and outside the weeds threaten to engulf the entire house. At least they will hide the peeling paint. For a moment I flatter myself that I too share the trials of the Mansion people. Homeownership—it’s exhausting, as Vivian Dixon says. A full-time job.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/-LAB7bY87ZI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e","url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/-LAB7bY87ZI/","published":"2019-07-07T10:00:00Z","guid":"tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-593389"},{"title":"Cancel Qatar","content":"\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThis World Cup was a cracker—an exhibition of excellence, a noble step in the struggle for gender equity—so let’s cancel the next one.

The story dominated the Parisian broadsheets, when French officials \u003ca href=\"https://www.apnews.com/9cc77b4aace24835b160b41168df02d3\"\u003edetained\u003c/a\u003e Michele Platini, arguably the country’s greatest male player of all time. Platini was also the top European soccer official at the time Qatar won its World Cup bid, and authorities are investigating the possibility that his vote was improperly influenced. Anti-corruption investigators are especially keen to ask Platini about a meeting he held with French president Nicolas Sarkozy and Qatari officials. It’s alleged that Sarkozy \u003ca href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d45b1e6e-91df-11e9-b7ea-60e35ef678d2\"\u003ewanted\u003c/a\u003e Platini to support the Gulf state’s bid in exchange for contracts for French companies.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThat’s only the latest accusation of Qatari bribery.

(FIFA’s entanglements with authoritarianism are nothing new and worthy of a door-stopping history.) World Cups are played in the summer, and summers in Qatar are a pizza oven--with temperatures that spike at about 122 degrees, a physical hazard both for players and for the workers needed to build the stadiums.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eTo accommodate this unsparing climate, the tournament will likely be played in November and December, right in the middle of the European football season. As a fan, I can’t stand this disruption of the calendar and rubbishing of tradition. But those are trivial quibbles, compared to workers who aren’t given the same exemption from the brual heat. To fill the labor demands, the Qataris have imported workers, largely from Asia.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eHuman-rights organizations have alleged these workers have been scammed--paying a hefty fee to agents who bring them to Qatar, and then receiving lower wages than promised when they arrive.

Where this Women’s World Cup has turned lesbian players into legends, Qatar considers \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_Qatar\"\u003ehomosexuality\u003c/a\u003e a crime worthy of seven years in prison or even punishable by death. When asked how this might affect gay fans, FIFA’s former head Sepp Blatter was characteristically unconcerned with matters of morality: “I would say they should refrain from any sexual activities.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWhile the world spends extravagantly on the festival of corruption and death, it continues its woeful treatment of women’s soccer. The United States boasts the best-financed women’s soccer team in the world, yet its players are still paid a fraction of what male players earn. They are too often forced to play on artificial turf fields that afflict players like Megan Rapinoe with pointless career-altering injuries.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eFor generations the women’s game has been subjected to brutal sexism. Brazil’s military dictatorship legally \u003ca href=\"https://www.ozy.com/the-huddle/why-womens-soccer-was-banned-in-brazil-until-1979/72241\"\u003eprohibited\u003c/a\u003e women from playing the game.

Even now, its teams face a problem familiar to all squads outside Europe: The teams barely have the finances to assemble to train or play friendly matches, so they arrive at tournaments woefully unprepared and without the camaraderie needed to play with cohesion. They never get the coaching that would allow them to compete on the level of, say, the United States. (The wildly disparate quality of goalkeeping at this tournament is the best proof of this gap.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eOr take the example of \u003ca href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/nov/30/fifa-examining-claims-sexual-physical-abuse-afghanistan-womens-team\"\u003eAfghanistan\u003c/a\u003e, where male coaches and federation officials sexually assaulted members of the national team. Of course, FIFA has promised to investigate. But FIFA is the core of soccer’s problem. Even though it just announced grand plans for growing the women’s game, it has shamefully \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/20/opinion/fifa-needs-more-women.html\"\u003efew women\u003c/a\u003e in its top ranks. So when it promised to double the prize money offered at the Women’s World Cup, it was merely offering to grow the pot to $60 million. That’s still far short of the $440 million that will be given at the next Men’s World Cup—and characteristic of how its melioristic approach is pathetically incrementalist.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003ePouring money into women’s soccer will hardly solve these historic inequities. When cash is handed over to soccer officials in the world, it is invariably siphoned by dodgy officials. Still, the Qatari tournaments represents everything rotten about global soccer.

These accusations came to a head in 2005 when a Florida woman told police a wealthy man had molested her daughter. The police began an investigation that was referred to the FBI. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"sUckhs\"\u003eThe bureau collected copious evidence, and in 2008, Epstein pleaded guilty to the solicitation of prostitution and procurement of minors for prostitution. However, because of deal made with former US attorney (and current US secretary of labor) Alexander Acosta, Epstein did not receive a long sentence. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"CpQXbt\"\u003eAs \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/12/3/18116351/jeffrey-epstein-trump-clinton-labor-secretary-acosta\"\u003eVox’s Jane Coaston and Anna North\u003c/a\u003e reported: \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"0nZtqK\"\u003eThe FBI had prepared a 53-page sex crimes indictment for Epstein in 2007 that could have sent him to prison for life, according to the Herald. Instead, he cut a deal with Alexander Acosta, then the US attorney in Miami, which allowed him to serve just 13 months — not in federal or state prison, but in a private wing of a Palm Beach county jail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"IR520M\"\u003eHe was\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003egranted work release to go to a “comfortable office” for 12 hours a day, six days a week, despite the fact that the Palm Beach Sheriff’s Department prohibited work release for sex offenders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"sJQJBY\"\u003eEpstein’s deal, called a “non-prosecution agreement,” granted immunity to “any potential co-conspirators,” meaning that if any of Epstein’s powerful friends were involved in his crimes, they would face no consequences.

While it remains sealed until Monday, it is expected to allege that Epstein paid cash to dozens of girls, some as young as 14, for massages in his homes in New York and Palm Beach, Florida. During those massages, it is alleged he would molest or assault them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"vUAMY2\"\u003eThe indictment further alleges that Epstein knew his victims were underage. Law enforcement officials have said that some of Epstein’s employees — and, later, some of the girls who have said he molested them — helped recruit new victims into the financier’s scheme. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"4L3DgS\"\u003eAttorneys for two of Epstein’s alleged victims said they hope that these latest charges will finally bring the financier to justice. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"vVrnOK\"\u003e“It’s been a long time coming — it’s been too long coming,” attorney David Boies told the Daily Beast. “It is an important step towards getting justice for the many victims of Mr. Epstein’s sex trafficking enterprise.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"8HC7cq\"\u003eWho is Jeffrey Epstein?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"4jxkzT\"\u003eFor years, Jeffrey Epstein has had a reputation for assaulting young girls.

During the massages, he often subjected the girls to sexual abuse — asking them to touch him while he masturbated, touching them himself, and sometimes having intercourse with them, Brown reports. Then, according to the Herald,\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003ehe would offer them money to find him more girls — which some of them did, finding recruits at malls and house parties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"b6H21U\"\u003eAccording to Joseph Recarey, the lead Palm Beach detective on the case, Epstein was essentially operating a “sexual pyramid scheme.” Brown identified about 80 women who say they were molested or otherwise sexually abused by Epstein, and some accounts suggest the total number may be much higher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"BBH9Pj\"\u003e“He told me he wanted them as young as I could find them,’’ Courtney Wild, who says she recruited 70 or 80 girls for Epstein, told Brown. “He wanted as many girls as I could get him.

The financier met many a powerful person as an investment banker at Bear Stearns, and later as the head of his own financial firm that exclusively caters to billionaires.

They are shielded from prosecution thanks to immunity granted to “any potential co-conspirators” under the terms of his Miami deal, meaning they have little incentive to cooperate with prosecutors or to involve themselves in the financier’s current charges on his behalf.

You knew that every new \u003cem\u003eHarry Potter\u003c/em\u003e tome would contain a new school year at Hogwarts, a new chance to win the Quidditch cup, a new competition for points among the houses, and so on. Similarly, each \u003cem\u003eHunger Games\u003c/em\u003e book featured a new iteration of the Hunger Games themselves (though this grew incredibly abstract in the third and final volume).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"QQ3y2b\"\u003eThis underlying structure rooted the more otherworldly adventures in something concrete. Harry Potter and his pals were battling evil wizards, sure, but they also started to have crushes right around when you’d expect them to, and darker topics like death started to creep in around the edges of the story as if right on schedule. J.K. Rowling’s genius was in realizing just how much of any given book could be a gloss on ideas developed in her very first book, simply because the school year itself is incredibly repetitive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"2vSWcu\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eStranger Things\u003c/em\u003e lacks this obvious central narrative device — at least right now. The first two seasons featured scenes set in school, but the show’s action is so compressed (as in each season largely takes place over a matter of weeks, if not days) that school-day tropes don’t play into the series as much as they otherwise could. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"VVh6wl\"\u003eThe second and third seasons are each united around a season of the year — fall for season two and summer for season three — and both make stabs at incorporating major holidays into their storytelling in some way (Halloween and the American Independence Day, respectively).

Now, to be fair, they’re Russian operatives who are out to kill her and her friends, and they have guns very much at the ready. Eleven killing these guys is more than justified, by both storytelling and legal precedent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"xWjk03\"\u003eBut she’s still 14 years old, and \u003cem\u003eStranger Things\u003c/em\u003e doesn’t seem at all interested in the idea that doing something like this would weigh on her. Like ... I hope it would? She seems like a basically good kid, and a basically good kid would probably have at least a moment when she would reflect on the idea that she just killed two guys, no matter how justified she was in doing so. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"jQNB39\"\u003eSo it has always been with \u003cem\u003eStranger Things\u003c/em\u003e, a series that never met an ’80s movie plot point it couldn’t lift wholesale, then refuse to examine in any way beyond the most obvious. The Big Bad in season three is a giant goop monster (and, honestly, I love the goop monster and want to see more of it). But the secondary bad guys are a bunch of evil commies, and the show has about as much interest in building them out as it did the faceless monsters of the first two seasons. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"r8P51v\"\u003eWhy are the Soviets trying to open a gate to the Upside Down? They just are. How do they feel about any of this? Shut up, they’re evil. Are they really all evil?

But at least the government scientists who drove much of the plot in the show’s first two seasons were allowed to have \u003cem\u003eone\u003c/em\u003e dimension. The Soviet villains have negative dimension. They’re vacuums where characters could be, the better to have lots of them die at the hands of Eleven and Chief Hopper (who guns down a bunch of them). \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"IGgGUB\"\u003eThe series is boxed in by its influences here. As its characters grow up, it wants them to have more thematically appropriate ’80s adventures, but its frame of reference is still high-concept, genre-heavy ’80s films — in this case, the “teens vs. Soviets” 1984 film \u003cem\u003eRed Dawn\u003c/em\u003e. It was one thing for the kids to have adventures heavily inspired by \u003cem\u003eE.T.\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eThe Goonies\u003c/em\u003e in \u003cem\u003eStranger Things\u003c/em\u003e’ first couple of seasons, because the villains of those movies were designed to be larger than life. But a film like \u003cem\u003eRed Dawn\u003c/em\u003e struggles to make the transition from big to small screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"BbUg8Q\"\u003eI suspect this has something to do with the amount of storytelling space TV offers. In a two-hour movie, you don’t really need to know anything more about the Soviets invading an American small town beyond “they’re the bad guys.” But on TV, the sheer familiarity we develop with a series’ characters will deepen them — or cause us to grow ever more frustrated when they don’t contain anything other than what’s on the surface. (That Arnie wannabe is by far the worst thing about season three, because he effectively has nowhere to go from his one-joke conception.) \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"v16eGf\"\u003eBut the larger point about what has always bedeviled \u003cem\u003eStranger Things\u003c/em\u003e stands: It wants to tell resonant coming-of-age stories in a fantastical context, but it is forever held back by the stories that inspired it, which were relatively uncritical of ’80s suburbia. As such, \u003cem\u003eStranger Things\u003c/em\u003e is relatively uncritical of ’80s suburbia, too, even if there are aspects that might be worth criticizing (like, say, reflexive dehumanization of communists). \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"pcYu29\"\u003eAnd the show’s unwillingness to notice that seemingly simplistic childhood narratives have more nuance to them than initially believed is why it can never quite push past its current self to become a more complicated, mature story of how the world works.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"R2V6yW\"\u003e3) \u003cem\u003eStranger Things\u003c/em\u003e isn’t really a YA series.

The 1994 movie, which turned 25 on July 6, 2019, was a massive box office hit and won the Oscar for Best Picture. And if you watch it 25 years after its release, it’s \u003cem\u003ereally weird\u003c/em\u003e. Tom Hanks plays a man dealing with a learning disability in the most broadly comedic fashion possible. Somehow, Forrest intersects with every major historical event of his lifetime, and it’s all scored with a wallpapering of rock ‘n’ roll from the ’50s, ’60s, and ’70s. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"doeByC\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eForrest Gump\u003c/em\u003e is actually a movie I kind of like, because it hides a savage satire of baby boomer complacency beneath a story that’s supposedly about how much boomers been through over the course of their lives. (I don’t think it’s an accident that the movie’s generational standard-bearer has a below-average IQ.) It works simultaneously to build up the boomers and tear them down, and even if it’s not wholly successful, I admire the attempt. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"8LLkwU\"\u003eThis isn’t quite what \u003cem\u003eStranger Things\u003c/em\u003e is up to. Season two (set in the fall of 1984) didn’t feature the characters arguing endlessly about Ronald Reagan and Walter Mondale (though they did a little bit), and season three doesn’t see the kids arguing about \u003ca href=\"http://www.theirishstory.com/2015/02/09/the-northern-ireland-conflict-1968-1998-an-overview/\"\u003ethe Troubles in Ireland\u003c/a\u003e or making oblique references to the about-to-be-revealed \u003ca href=\"https://www.history.com/topics/1980s/iran-contra-affair\"\u003eIran-Contra affair\u003c/a\u003e, both of which were big headlines in 1985.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"4ma5n5\"\u003eBut that’s because Gen Xers (which all of the kid characters on \u003cem\u003eStranger Things \u003c/em\u003ewould be) had a much more tenuous relationship to world events than the boomers. Beyond the endless angst prompted by the existence of the Soviet Union and its thousands of nukes, the ’80s were a pretty blissful time to grow up compared to the unrest that roiled the ’60s, which were filled with assassinations and war. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"eC5HKz\"\u003eI’m younger than the \u003cem\u003eStranger Things \u003c/em\u003echaracters would be now, but I was around in the ’80s! I remember how rarely a major news event penetrated my consciousness compared to, say, my mother’s, a woman who grew up in the ’60s and remembers just about everything from that era, even beyond the big moments like JFK’s assassination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"OdQQDv\"\u003eThe systems that underpinned society itself seemed to be radically changing for the better and\u003cem\u003e \u003c/em\u003ethe worse in the ’60s. In the ’80s, the social order was firmly established, and it was old and straight and male and white. It was a different time to exist. So when I compare \u003cem\u003eStranger Things\u003c/em\u003e to \u003cem\u003eForrest Gump\u003c/em\u003e, I mean that both works capture how it felt to live through the time period — but instead of retelling a long series of news events, \u003cem\u003eStranger Things\u003c/em\u003e builds on how it felt to be around the first time you saw \u003cem\u003eBack to the Future\u003c/em\u003e in theaters (as the characters do in season three’s penultimate episode). The show’s relationship to the movies of the ’80s is basically the same as \u003cem\u003eForrest Gump\u003c/em\u003e’s relationship to major world events (and rock music).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"hefEyo\"\u003eThe irony here is that the Duffer brothers, the duo behind \u003cem\u003eStranger Things\u003c/em\u003e, are both around my age and thus older millennials, who grew up in Gen X’s shadow, forever enthralled by its movies and TV shows.

En route to the state visit, for example, he responded to London Mayor Sadiq Khan’s criticism of his trip by tweeting Khan was “\u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/6/3/18650187/trump-sadiq-khan-london-uk\"\u003ea stone cold loser who should focus on crime in London, not me.\u003c/a\u003e”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"lDVyFT\"\u003eThe tweet came after years of the two men trading barbs, \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/6/3/18650187/trump-sadiq-khan-london-uk\"\u003eas Vox’s Alex Ward has described\u003c/a\u003e: Khan has called Trump “ill-informed” and his Muslim ban “ignorant;” Trump has accused Khan of being blasé about terrorism and crime. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"YSm2XH\"\u003eThe president also criticized Meghan Markle, the American actress who recently married into the royal family, in the lead up to his state visit.

But I want them to make their own decision.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"OuJsVG\"\u003eHe has continued his advocacy for the UK’s divorce from the European Union as president, often without adding qualifiers such as “I want them to make their own decision.” He addressed the British people in an \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/6/2/18649406/donald-trump-uk-walk-away-brexit-state-visit\"\u003einterview with the Sunday Times\u003c/a\u003e ahead of his state visit and said: “If you don’t get the deal you want, if you don’t get a fair deal, then you walk away.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"R5dQWh\"\u003eThe president is also linked to right-wing politicians in Britain, and has seemingly endorsed two of them: Boris Johnson, a Brexit supporter and Theresa May’s former foreign secretary, and Brexiteer and current leader of the Brexit Party, Nigel Farage. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"c5Hwfj\"\u003eIn a 2018 interview with British tabloid The Sun, Trump heavily criticized May’s handling of Brexit, and said Johnson \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/6/2/18647676/trump-uk-state-visit-queen-may-d-day\"\u003ewould make “a great prime minister.”\u003c/a\u003e The comments came as May was busy defending the decision to invite the president for a state visit. In recent weeks, Johnson has taken the lead in the race to replace May; while Trump has not officially endorsed  Johnson’s candidacy, the British politician said \u003ca href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/british-politician-boris-johnson-hung-donald-trumps-call-because-he-thought-it-was-prank-1443002\"\u003eTrump called him\u003c/a\u003e during the UK visit and “wished me well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"xFPVfp\"\u003eTrump has advocated for putting Farage in charge of future Brexit negotiations, telling the Sunday Times, “I like Nigel a lot. He has a lot to offer, he is a very smart person. They won’t bring him in but think how well they would do if they did. They just haven’t figured that out yet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"iA9MXO\"\u003eThe president has also publicly lobbied for Farage to be given another job: Ambassador Darroch’s.

The hard-boiled detective genre made famous by American writers like Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler in the 20th century has been taken up by a British professor of literature and given a tech culture twist. And it\u0026#8217;s really good!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrick McGuinness\u0026#8217;s book \u003ca href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/1116925/throw-me-to-the-wolves/9781787331464\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eThrow Me to the Wolves\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, published by Penguin in April, is a perfect summer beach read that also gets satisfyingly deep. This reporter read it in one long sitting, frittering away a whole weekend day between its pages so entertaining was the tale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe story is ostensibly about two British police officers trying to solve a murder. A young woman has been killed, and her neighbor, a retired private school teacher named Michael Wolphram, is the cops\u0026#8217; main suspect. Wolphram is a weirdo insofar as he lives alone and has refined tastes in art, books, clothing, cars, and music. He doesn\u0026#8217;t have a criminal past, and there are no previous allegations of wrongdoing against him. But he is different, unusually solitary and sophisticated, and so he doesn\u0026#8217;t quite seem innocent, though there is no physical evidence to indicate that he is guilty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe book, which is a riveting and speedy read, despite being deep and literary, is as much about our times as it is about solving crime. The police are under pressure to charge someone, anyone. The 24-hour news cycle makes it impossible for them to be thoughtful about their interrogations or investigation. People are ravenous for news and they don\u0026#8217;t much care about the truth, which makes it difficult for the detectives to convince their boss not to charge Wolphram without more evidence. Social media ends up dictating what the police chief will do, and fake news has a strong chance of winning the day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe beauty of McGuinness\u0026#8217;s book is in the execution, however, more than the plot. The writing really delights. McGuinness is a \u003ca href=\"https://www.mod-langs.ox.ac.uk/people/patrick-mcguinness\"\u003eprofessor of literature and poetry\u003c/a\u003e at Oxford University, specializing in 19th- and 20th-century French works. However, his style isn\u0026#8217;t academic and his preoccupations in this novel are very 21st century. With humor and damning insight, McGuinness captures the spirit of this moment, our cultural obsession with information, communication, and outrage. He manages to indict even the novel\u0026#8217;s readers with his account of crime solving in the Instagram era and the unleashed stalker in all of us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;You\u0026#8217;re not dead until your phone contract says so,\u0026#8221; writes McGuinness as his detectives sift through the online detritus of the dead woman\u0026#8217;s life. She is still getting messages on her dating app, and friend requests to the deceased only increase on various social media platforms as her death becomes the day\u0026#8217;s top story. McGuinness\u0026#8217;s officers are caught in a changing world, nostalgic for a time before the device takeover. \u0026#8220;The world never had an OFF button, no, but you could at least turn it down sometimes,\u0026#8221; muses the protagonist, though he isn\u0026#8217;t old enough to claim as much with confidence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe characters McGuinness creates are rich and thoughtful. The writer employs cliches and subverts them easily. He turns the typical good cop/bad cop routine into an opportunity to explore class, bias, ignorance, and intellectual depth. By the end, no one is spared from the realization that they have underestimated the people around them and minimized the lives of others based on preconceptions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe may not all be criminals, but McGuinness shows that by participating in the project of postmodernity, tweeting our trials and tribulations and taking in everyone else\u0026#8217;s information, we\u0026#8217;re also not innocent. We are this world\u0026#8217;s wolves, and any of us might easily become the pack\u0026#8217;s prey.\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://qz.com/quartzy/1660040/patrick-mcguinnesss-throw-me-to-the-wolves-casts-guilt-on-all/","published":"2019-07-07T15:53:46Z","guid":"https://qz.com/1660040//"},{"title":"“Inept”: Leaked diplomatic cables reveal what Brits really think of Trump","content":"\u003cimg width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/turmp.uk_.jpeg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;w=1024\" class=\"attachment-medium_10 size-medium_10 wp-post-image\" alt=\"Can the US-UK special relationship withstand the pain of frank communication?\" srcset=\"https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/turmp.uk_.jpeg 1311w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/turmp.uk_.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/turmp.uk_.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/turmp.uk_.jpeg?resize=160,90 160w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/turmp.uk_.jpeg?resize=320,180 320w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/turmp.uk_.jpeg?resize=640,360 640w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/turmp.uk_.jpeg?resize=940,529 940w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe US and the UK have long enjoyed a \u0026#8220;special relationship,\u0026#8221; as evidenced by a recent visit by US president Donald Trump and his family to meet with the queen of England. But that bond may have just hit a bump in the road now that secret diplomatic cables from Britain\u0026#8217;s top ambassador to the US were leaked, revealing a not-so-diplomatic or flattering assessment of the American president and his administration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Mail on Sunday \u003ca href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7221361/Nigel-Farage-demands-Britains-man-Washington-sacked-amid-leaked-memos-row.html\"\u003ereported on July 7\u003c/a\u003e that Nigel Kim Darroch\u0026#8217;s private cables, memos, and briefing notes paint a devastating picture of the White House under Trump. \u0026#8220;We don\u0026#8217;t really believe this Administration is going to become substantially more normal; less dysfunctional; less unpredictable; less faction riven; less diplomatically clumsy and inept,\u0026#8221; the diplomat wrote. He referred to battles among members of the Trump administration as \u0026#8220;knife fights\u0026#8221; and predicted that the Trump presidency could end in \u0026#8220;disgrace.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet the diplomat admitted that Trump, despite being otherwise \u0026#8220;inept,\u0026#8221; appears especially resilient. His downfall should not be counted on. Although he has been \u0026#8220;mired in scandal\u0026#8221; throughout his life, Darroch writes of Trump, he says that the president may nonetheless \u0026#8220;emerge from the flames, battered but intact, like [Arnold] Schwarzenegger in the final scenes of The Terminator.\u0026#8221; The documents note that Trump has some hope for reelection, remarking however that attendees of his campaign rallies are \u0026#8220;almost exclusively white.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe leaked documents date from 2017 to the present. Darroch explained to officials in London hoping to communicate with the president that \u0026#8220;you need to make your points simple, even blunt.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is not the first time that Darroch\u0026#8217;s writing about Trump has gone public. The British ambassador, appointed to his post in the US in 2015 while Barack Obama was in office, took over the role in 2016. That year, after Trump was elected, a memo from Darroch to British prime minister Theresa May predicted that Trump could be influenced by Britain. The US president suggested a different ambassador for the British role, guidance which the Brits ultimately rejected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, Darroch may find himself even more unwelcome by the American president. The ambassador\u0026#8217;s private writings cast doubt on Trump\u0026#8217;s abilities to manage his administration and even to deal with reality. Darroch questions Trump\u0026#8217;s claims of fake news, saying most of what the president dismisses is actually true, and suggests that the president\u0026#8217;s own telling of events and decisions can\u0026#8217;t be trusted. For example, Darroch doubted the claim that Trump recently aborted a planned missile attack on Iran because he worried about casualties. In the ambassador\u0026#8217;s view, Trump was never sold on the strike to begin with and was probably more concerned about its potential effects on his reelection than with Iranian lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA spokesman for Britain\u0026#8217;s foreign office responded to the revelations by saying of British diplomats, \u0026#8220;Their views are not necessarily the views of Ministers or indeed the Government. But we pay them to be candid, just as the US Ambassador here will send back his reading of Westminster politics and personalities.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor his part, Trump has not yet responded to news of the leaks, focusing his \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump\"\u003etweets so far today\u003c/a\u003e on political rival and Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, as well as on lowering prescription drug prices.

They set up in the crater of Tanzania’s Mount Kilimanjaro. Their game, more than a mile higher than the world’s highest stadium, set the Guinness World Record for \u003ca href=\"https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/483599-highest-altitude-game-of-football-soccer-overall\"\u003ehighest-altitude soccer match\u003c/a\u003e ever played.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe match was intended to show the world what female athletes can do, one bold act to defy the slowness of global change. And that was just the beginning—over the next two years, their mission would become a global one; this year, many of the same athletes participated in world’s \u003cem\u003elargest\u003c/em\u003e soccer game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePole-pole\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was surprised I hadn’t heard of the match on Mount Kilimanjaro until I went there myself. In May, I sat with my dad and three of my siblings eating soup in our red tent, toes frozen in my hiking boots. We were partway through a challenge we had dreamed about completing for years: summiting Kilimanjaro.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the fifth day of our nine-day trek, \u003cem\u003epole-pole \u003c/em\u003e(po-lay po-lay), the Swahili mantra for “slowly,” had become our own refrain. Starting at 18,000 ft, bodies need extra time to acclimate to the altitude; if hikers ignore this, altitude sickness becomes a serious, and sometimes life-threatening, risk. James Upanga, our head guide and \u003cem\u003epole-pole \u003c/em\u003eenforcer, told us to avoid all unnecessary physical activity—even card-playing, he added.

In the United Kingdom, women received just 0.4% of all sports sponsorship between 2011 and 2013, and comprise just 7% of all sports media coverage, according to the nonprofit \u003ca href=\"https://www.womeninsport.org/about-us/sponsorship-media/\"\u003eWomen in Sports\u003c/a\u003e (in the US, they receive just \u003ca href=\"https://www.cehd.umn.edu/tuckercenter/projects/mediacoverage.html\"\u003e4% \u003c/a\u003eof media coverage). One day, Youngson realized that there were more sports media stories about horses (not horse \u003cem\u003eracing, \u003c/em\u003ejust horses) than there were about women. When Youngson mentioned it to a journalist, he responded: “Yeah, but people \u003cem\u003elike\u003c/em\u003e horses.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot long after, Youngson was working for the local organizing committee in Azerbaijan for the European Games and found herself having to advocate for her corporate women’s team to be funded. The men’s had been funded automatically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter all these experiences, an idea popped into Youngson’s head: Let’s do something really dramatic, and have it be all women. Her friend Erin Blankenship, a former three-sport elite athlete who now works in international conflict management, recalls getting a message filled with exclamation points from Youngson in the middle of the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYoungson, who had grown up reading the Guinness Book of World Records, drew inspiration from the organization’s motto, “Dedication is what you need.” She knew Kilimanjaro had a crater on the top that was higher than Everest base camp and big enough for a full-sized soccer pitch. That’s when she contacted the travel company Nature Discovery, which began to assemble a team of guides and porters to undertake one of its most ambitious trips to date.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce Youngson had the \u003cem\u003ewhere \u003c/em\u003eand the \u003cem\u003ehow\u003c/em\u003e figured out, it was time to recruit the players. She started with her existing network, which was extensive since she had lived and played in multiple countries. Most athletes Youngson first approached declined. The first major yeses were players from the Afghanistan National Team, who had wanted to play on behalf of all the girls in their country who cannot due to discrimination (the players ultimately couldn’t go because of issues with their visas).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat started out as a quirky challenge for Youngson was turning into something much bigger. “This could be an opportunity to campaign for some of the rights that women around the world are looking to get within this sport,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"attachment_1659909\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"\u003e\u003cimg aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1659909\" class=\"size-hero-m wp-image-1659909\" src=\"https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Laura-Youngson-playing-in-Crater-Camp-__-Equal-Playing-Field.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;w=640\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" srcset=\"https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Laura-Youngson-playing-in-Crater-Camp-__-Equal-Playing-Field.jpg 4235w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Laura-Youngson-playing-in-Crater-Camp-__-Equal-Playing-Field.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Laura-Youngson-playing-in-Crater-Camp-__-Equal-Playing-Field.jpg?resize=50,33 50w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Laura-Youngson-playing-in-Crater-Camp-__-Equal-Playing-Field.jpg?resize=160,107 160w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Laura-Youngson-playing-in-Crater-Camp-__-Equal-Playing-Field.jpg?resize=320,213 320w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Laura-Youngson-playing-in-Crater-Camp-__-Equal-Playing-Field.jpg?resize=640,427 640w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Laura-Youngson-playing-in-Crater-Camp-__-Equal-Playing-Field.jpg?resize=940,627 940w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Laura-Youngson-playing-in-Crater-Camp-__-Equal-Playing-Field.jpg?resize=1600,1067 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /\u003e\u003cp id=\"caption-attachment-1659909\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"\u003eLaura Youngson played in the match on Kilimanjaro\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter calling on friends of friends, Youngson and Blankenship eventually created a roster that included American two-time Olympic gold medallist Lori Lindsey; former German star Petra Landers; former Mexico captain Monica Gonzalez; and dozens of other players from Argentina, France, Indonesia, Jordan, Sweden, the UK, US, Saudi Arabia, Tanzania, Thailand, and the United Arab Emirates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough players ranged in age from 15 to 55, most were in their 30s. Maggie Murphy, an anti-corruption policy advocate and the spokesperson for Youngson and Blankenship\u0026#8217;s organization, told me she didn’t see it as coincidence. By the time they reach their third decade, many of these players have reached their peak, and in the process become frustrated that the system didn’t support them as it would if they were male, Murphy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe organization Youngson and Blankenship co-founded as part of this mission, which they dubbed Equal Playing Field (EPF), comes about at a pivotal moment in women’s professional sports. This March, after years of being underpaid and under-appreciated, the players on the US Women’s team \u003ca href=\"https://qz.com/1568831/the-us-womens-soccer-team-is-suing-for-equal-pay/\"\u003esued their employer, the US Soccer Federation\u003c/a\u003e, for gender discrimination. The players argued that, in spite of demonstrated success, they systematically receive pay, benefits, travel conditions, training, coaching, and medical treatment that is inferior to their male counterparts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis issue isn’t isolated to the US; for most female players around the world, Murphy notes, equal pay is still a dream. “We just want to not be put on the worst pitch that’s waterlogged and a 20-minute walk from the changing rooms,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOpportunity, equality, respect—this is what EPF believes most female athletes are striving for. To achieve that in the long term, the group is trying to raise awareness of the challenges female soccer players face.

She didn’t see a way she could continue to play professionally there, so she quit. But in 2016, Khateeb got a new opportunity to work within the sport she loved—that was the year the first FIFA Women’s World Cup (under 17) took place in the Middle East. Khateeb served on the organizing committee in Amman, Jordan. The camaraderie Khateeb saw across cultures and linguistic lines made her want to support others who wanted nothing more than to play soccer. So she started volunteering to introduce soccer to Syrian refugee camps in Jordan. While there, she was struck by the ways in which the sport transformed players’ personal lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSports have well-documented psychological, emotional, and medical benefits for all players, but women in particular feel them acutely; a 2007 United Nations \u003ca href=\"https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/public/Women%20and%20Sport.pdf\"\u003ereport\u003c/a\u003e ties women’s participation in athletics to higher academic achievement, reduced levels of teenage pregnancy, and increased respect for female community members.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn February 2017, Khateeb heard about the Kilimanjaro match.

With the support of experienced guides and capable porters, climbers need only focus on preparation and precaution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(In 2006, Kilimanjaro National Park reported a summit success rate of 45%; current estimates indicate that’s probably now closer to 65%, as more climbers opt for longer routes to let their bodies acclimatize to the altitude.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn June 18, 2017, 28 players, five referees, and more than 20 support crew set out on a nine-day trek from the city of Arusha, Tanzania. They walked with 30 guides, split across five groups, and were assisted by over 300 porters. It was, as Upanga put it, “a big operation.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe players had to prepare for months for that game. Four days into the hike, at 13,780 ft (4,200 m), the teams played a practice game on a smaller pitch to acclimatize. The guides watched that game closely; it gave them confidence that the group would be able to play at the top, in three days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpanga has been leading trips on Kilimanjaro for more than 10 years.

Beforehand, a crew had set up goals and cleared the pitch of big stones. They drew the field’s lines with flour, a natural material chosen because it wouldn’t damage the environment. The balls were inflated at the top to account for the change in air pressure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the players arrived, they had to start their game right away to minimize their time in the low-oxygen environment. The match, per FIFA regulation, involved 11 players on each team and lasted 90 minutes. Oxygen tanks stood at the ready. Some players ran too fast, felt sick, and had to be helped by the doctor and nurses who had hiked up to the crater. In spite of the harsh conditions, the level of play—especially on the part of the goalies—exceeded the organizers’ expectations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Even though it was a nil-nil draw, we celebrated at the final whistle as though we’d just won the World Cup ourselves,” Murphy said. “It was this feeling of elation, that we’d done this slightly crazy but very ambitious, exceptional thing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"attachment_1659881\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"\u003e\u003cimg aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1659881\" class=\"size-hero-m wp-image-1659881\" src=\"https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Post-match-celebration-_-Equal-Playing-Field.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;w=640\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" srcset=\"https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Post-match-celebration-_-Equal-Playing-Field.jpg 5760w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Post-match-celebration-_-Equal-Playing-Field.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Post-match-celebration-_-Equal-Playing-Field.jpg?resize=50,33 50w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Post-match-celebration-_-Equal-Playing-Field.jpg?resize=160,107 160w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Post-match-celebration-_-Equal-Playing-Field.jpg?resize=320,213 320w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Post-match-celebration-_-Equal-Playing-Field.jpg?resize=640,427 640w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Post-match-celebration-_-Equal-Playing-Field.jpg?resize=940,627 940w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Post-match-celebration-_-Equal-Playing-Field.jpg?resize=1600,1067 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /\u003e\u003cp id=\"caption-attachment-1659881\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"\u003eThe players celebrated after the record-setting match\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe match itself was an accomplishment.

When the players were halfway up with no cell phone signal, CNN ran a story about their mission on its homepage.  The women first heard about it when another group of trekkers recognized them. Other climbers began to look for them on the mountain. After they descended, the players were inundated with media requests. People wanted to learn more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Khateeb and Shabsough returned home to Jordan, they found a crowd waiting for them at the airport. “People just started realizing that we did something really undoable for other people,” Khateeb said. The trip solidified their commitment to dedicate their lives to gender equality in sport at home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the match, many players returned to train girls and women in their home countries. Khateeb is no exception. She has been working in public schools all across Jordan to improve students’ life skills through sports.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe students have more opportunity, too. When she was growing up, Khateeb said, there weren’t many ways for girls to play soccer. Now, thanks to support from the Jordanian royal family, the country has had a women’s national team since 2005, plus nine club teams. Khateeb has also found the Women’s World Cup to be more popular than ever, among both men and women in Jordan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"attachment_1659882\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"\u003e\u003cimg aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1659882\" class=\"size-hero-m wp-image-1659882\" src=\"https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Soccer-clinic-in-Jordan-_-Equal-Playing-Field2.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;w=640\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" srcset=\"https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Soccer-clinic-in-Jordan-_-Equal-Playing-Field2.jpg 960w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Soccer-clinic-in-Jordan-_-Equal-Playing-Field2.jpg?resize=768,511 768w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Soccer-clinic-in-Jordan-_-Equal-Playing-Field2.jpg?resize=50,33 50w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Soccer-clinic-in-Jordan-_-Equal-Playing-Field2.jpg?resize=160,107 160w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Soccer-clinic-in-Jordan-_-Equal-Playing-Field2.jpg?resize=320,213 320w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Soccer-clinic-in-Jordan-_-Equal-Playing-Field2.jpg?resize=640,426 640w, https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Soccer-clinic-in-Jordan-_-Equal-Playing-Field2.jpg?resize=940,626 940w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /\u003e\u003cp id=\"caption-attachment-1659882\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"\u003eOne of EPF\u0026#8217;s soccer clinics, held in Jordan\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot long after they returned, Shabsough joked that the same group should come set the Guinness World Record for \u003cem\u003elowest\u003c/em\u003e altitude match in Jordan, at 1,069 ft (326 m) below sea level. \u003ca href=\"https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/111307-deepest-football-match\"\u003eThat match happened\u003c/a\u003e in 2018.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlongside the match, Khateeb and Shabsough led an effort to provide free professional soccer training for 700 girls and to build a soccer field in the Dead Sea area for the match, which locals continue to use.

They get suspicious about grownups whispering. They catch fragments of conversations and news reports and are curious. Sheltering them forever isn\u0026#8217;t really an option. Nor is blasting them with all the harsh facts of reality. So what\u0026#8217;s an adult to do when difficult topics, like for example the US-Mexico border wall, dominate the news, kids are confused, and maintaining total blissful innocence is no longer possible?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA new book offers answers. \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43973339-the-wall\"\u003eThe Wall: A Timeless Tale\u003c/a\u003e,\u003c/em\u003e by Giancarlo Macri and Carolina Zotti, with illustrations by Mauro Sacco and Elisa Vallarino, was originally published in Italy in 2018 and will be released on July 9 in the US by Happy Fox Publishing. It\u0026#8217;s a bright, humorous, and lively book with a sweet and very simple style designed to facilitate conversation about complex issues, educate, and entertain without causing kids or grownups too much pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Wall\u003c/em\u003e tells the story of a king who has not left his castle for a long time. When he finally emerges and surveys his land, he finds it\u0026#8217;s full of all different kinds of people, and he urges an aid to build a wall to keep out anyone who looks unlike him (he is blue and others are a slew of different colors). The aid (who is also blue), is skeptical of this plan, and asks, \u0026#8220;Sir, are you sure?\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the monarch says he is, so his assistant follows instructions, driving out everyone who doesn\u0026#8217;t look like them and constructing a barrier. The king\u0026#8217;s wall manifests in the book as a thick cardboard pop-up barrier emerging from the text\u0026#8217;s spine. It\u0026#8217;s tactile, tough, and can withstand the grabby hands of even the most engaged child readers while clearly demonstrating the effects of separation. Page by page, the kingdom grows less colorful and rich, the space on the pages surrounding the king more blank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe monarch is pleased with his wall, ever so briefly. But soon he demands that a beautiful garden be placed alongside the barrier so he can enjoy walks in his blue kingdom. \u0026#8220;Sir, the gardeners have already left,\u0026#8221; his aid explains. The king demands they be brought back. He also wants fountains, a road, and sculptures alongside the wall, but all the engineers, artists, and fountain builders are gone and must be returned to do the work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen all the king\u0026#8217;s wishes have been fulfilled, he is still unsatisfied. The kingdom is crowded and colorful again and the book\u0026#8217;s pages are filled with different faces, but the wall now appears to the leader an unnecessary barrier because all the people inside and outside seem so talented and attractive. So he calls for its destruction, blaming his assistant for ever building it. When the wall is down again, he happily tells his aid, \u0026#8220;This is much better.

Last week, the company announced that it would \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/07/05/boeing-victim-fund-pr-fail/\"\u003epay out $100 million\u003c/a\u003e to a fund for families of victims of the crashes, separate from any lawsuits over the matter. The fund would to support \u0026#8221;education, hardship and living expenses for impacted families, community programs, and economic development in impacted communities,\u0026#8221; according to a statement by Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenberg. He apologized to the victims\u0026#8217; families, saying, \u0026#8220;We at Boeing are sorry for the tragic loss of lives in both of these accidents and these lives lost will continue to weigh heavily on our hearts and on our minds for years to come.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn June, \u003ca href=\"https://qz.com/1645499/737-max-crashes-boeing-ceo-admits-mistakes-were-made/\"\u003eahead of the Paris Air Show\u003c/a\u003e, Muilenberg admitted for the first time that his company mishandled concerns over its 737 Max aircraft and that mistakes were made in how it communicated about the planes, especially after the accidents. He said that Boeing is focused on rebuilding trust after the crashes, which he called a “defining moment” that will result in a “better and stronger” organization. He noted, too, that he didn’t expect to see many orders for 737s at the air show but expected global aviation regulators to allow the plane, grounded since March, to fly again before the end of the year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn June 18, things seemed to be looking up for Boeing.

It wasn\u0026#8217;t a firm deal but was widely seen by industry insiders as a vote of confidence and a sign that the company would soon recover from its recent woes. \u0026#8220;We have every confidence in Boeing and expect that the aircraft will make a successful return to service in the coming months having received approval from the regulators,\u0026#8221; wrote IAG CFO Enrique Dupuy de Lôme in the letter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it seems that this confidence isn\u0026#8217;t shared by all, as evidenced by the Flyadeal cancellation.

That might be about to change \u0026#8212; and it may have implications for the Trump administration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe new indictment reportedly will be unsealed Monday in a federal court in Manhattan, where Epstein will be charged with one count of sex trafficking of minors and one count of conspiracy to engage in sex trafficking of minors, for which the 66-year-old could face a maximum of 45 years in prison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the Miami Herald reported \u003ca href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/article220097825.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003ein a massive exposé\u003c/a\u003e last year, Epstein recruited girls age 13-16, offering to pay them for massages, but he would instead sexually abuse them. He would only offer to let them keep the money without having sex if they went out and recruited other girls. He would also shuttle the girls on his private jet between his homes in Palm Beach, New York City, New Mexico, and the Virgin Islands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Epstein first faced charges for these crimes a decade ago, his lawyers engineered a \u0026#8220;non-prosecution agreement\u0026#8221; that not only spared him federal prison, but also concealed the extent of his crimes and offered immunity to \u0026#8220;any potential co-conspirators.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe plea deal also notably included an arrangement not to inform the victims about it — in violation of federal law. This denied them the opportunity of objecting to the deal and pursuing justice for themselves. Epstein served only 13 months in a county jail on two minor state charges of solicitation of prostitution and procurement of minors for prostitution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe prosecutor who agreed to such generous and illegal terms was Alex Acosta, who now serves as President Donald Trump\u0026#8217;s secretary of labor. Among the lawyers who defended Epstein was stalwart Trump defender Alan Dershowitz, who has \u003ca href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/epstein-accuser-sues-alan-dershowitz-over-alleged-sex-ring\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003ealso been accused\u003c/a\u003e of having sex with one of the underage girls in Epstein\u0026#8217;s ring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack in February, a federal judge ruled that the agreement Acosta had brokered had violated the Crime Victims\u0026#8217; Rights Act. A group of Democratic lawmakers responded to the ruling by \u003ca href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/democrats-call-on-labor-secretary-to-resign-over-sweetheart-deal-for-child-sex-abuser-0e4ba42a0db4/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003ecalling for Acosta to resign\u003c/a\u003e, though he has not. Epstein\u0026#8217;s victims began a new effort to seek justice in the wake of that ruling, but just two weeks ago, the Justice Department rejected efforts to toss out the illegal plea deal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe new charges in New York, however, could be an opportunity to properly prosecute Epstein for his crimes. Additionally, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled last week that the court records from Epstein\u0026#8217;s previous indictment could all be unsealed, meaning ample light might finally shine not only on Epstein, but on the network of staffers who assisted him in organizing his alleged sex trafficking ring, as well as possibly others who made use of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmong Epstein\u0026#8217;s friends was Trump himself.

That rationale, according to the Supreme Court\u0026#8217;s opinion in \u003ca href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/18-966_bq7c.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eDepartment of Commerce v.

The ACLU brief filed on Friday lists twelve separate occasions where Trump administration lawyers claimed that \u0026#8220;the census forms must be finalized for printing by the end of June 2019.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause of this claim by Trump\u0026#8217;s Justice Department, courts processed this case on an unusually expedited basis. Among other things, the Supreme Court invoked a rarely used procedure that bypassed review by a federal appeals court and allowed the nation\u0026#8217;s highest court to review a trial court\u0026#8217;s decision directly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot long after the Trump administration lost in the Supreme Court, however, it started singing a different tune. Though Justice Department lawyers initially signaled that they were giving up the fight to defend the citizenship question, they were later contradicted by President Trump himself. On July 3, they told a federal judge that they\u0026#8217;ve been \u0026#8220;instructed to examine whether there is a path forward, consistent with the Supreme Court\u0026#8217;s decision, that would allow us to include the citizenship question on the census.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe problem with this instruction should be obvious, however. July 3 is \u003cem\u003eafter the June deadline announced by the Trump administration itself\u003c/em\u003e. That means one of three things. Either the Justice Department lied when it claimed that there was a June deadline, or it is lying now, or it didn\u0026#8217;t bother to do its due diligence to determine whether its own statements about a June deadline were false.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe primary thrust of the ACLU\u0026#8217;s brief is that it invokes a doctrine known as \u0026#8220;judicial estoppel\u0026#8221; to argue that the Trump administration should be held to its previous claims about a June deadline. \u0026#8220;Estoppel\u0026#8221; doctrines prevent parties from making one claim, then contradicting themselves when that claim proves disadvantageous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet the brief also makes several references to a forthcoming motion for sanctions. \u0026#8220;It is now apparent that Defendants, for tactical advantage, pressed an expedited schedule while engaging in dilatory and obstructionist discovery tactics to conceal damning evidence that the purpose of adding the citizenship question was not to promote voting rights, but to harm Latino communities,\u0026#8221; the brief states in its fullest preview of the forthcoming motion. At another point, it notes that if an \u0026#8220;ordinary litigant\u0026#8221; engaged in the conduct DOJ engaged in here, \u0026#8220;sanctions would be the minimum relief provided.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;Defendants are no ordinary litigants,\u0026#8221; the brief continues. \u0026#8220;They are agencies of the United States Government represented by the United States Department of Justice. The public interest demands that they act with the utmost integrity and be held to the highest of standards.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUltimately, the fate of any sanctions against these lawyers \u0026#8212; and of the citizenship question itself \u0026#8212; is likely to be decided by Chief Justice John Roberts. Though the conservative Chief rejected one particular Trump administration lie, much of his \u003cem\u003eNew York\u003c/em\u003e opinion appeared sympathetic to the idea of a citizenship question. There is no guarantee that he will continue to police the Trump administration\u0026#8217;s deceit, no matter how grave their falsehoods may be.\t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"promo amp-wp-article-promo\"\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"post__figure post__figure--format-full\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"post__thumbnail\"\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003ca href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/membership/?c=cr042018-7-00-wp\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cimg width=\"2917\" height=\"2038\" src=\"https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/membership-graphic_2.03-1.png?w=2917\u0026amp;h=2038\u0026amp;crop=1\" class=\"attachment-full size-full\" alt=\"\" data-attachment-id=\"1142474\" data-permalink=\"https://thinkprogress.org/membership-graphic_2-03-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/membership-graphic_2.03-1.png?w=2917\u0026amp;h=2038\u0026amp;crop=1\" data-orig-size=\"2917,2038\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{\u0026quot;aperture\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;credit\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;camera\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;created_timestamp\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;copyright\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;focal_length\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;iso\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;shutter_speed\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;title\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;orientation\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;}\" data-image-title=\"membership graphic_2.03\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/membership-graphic_2.03-1.png?w=2917\u0026amp;h=2038\u0026amp;crop=1\" data-large-file=\"https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/membership-graphic_2.03-1.png?w=2917\u0026amp;h=2038\u0026amp;crop=1\" draggable=\"false\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1920px) 1920px,(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1920px) 1920px,(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1024px) 1024px,(min-width: 512px) and (max-width: 1024px) 1024px,(min-width: 512px) and (max-width: 768px) 768px,(max-width: 512px) 512px,(max-width: 768px) 768px,2917px\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/membership-graphic_2.03-1.png?w=1920\u0026#038;crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C1341px\u0026#038;ssl=1 1920w,https://i1.wp.com/thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/membership-graphic_2.03-1.png?w=1024\u0026#038;crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C715px\u0026#038;ssl=1 1024w,https://i1.wp.com/thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/membership-graphic_2.03-1.png?w=768\u0026#038;crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C537px\u0026#038;ssl=1 768w,https://i1.wp.com/thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/membership-graphic_2.03-1.png?w=512\u0026#038;crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C358px\u0026#038;ssl=1 512w,https://i1.wp.com/thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/membership-graphic_2.03-1.png?w=2917\u0026#038;crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C2038px\u0026#038;ssl=1 2917w\" /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/a\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n","url":"https://thinkprogress.org/trumps-justice-department-lawyers-may-soon-pay-a-high-price-for-lying-to-the-courts-3410348a2ab7/","published":"2019-07-07T14:06:51Z","guid":"https://thinkprogress.org/?p=1148362"},{"title":"The tragedy of the Women’s World Cup","content":"\u003cp\u003eThis year\u0026#8217;s Women\u0026#8217;s World Cup has \u003ca href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/womens-2019-soccer-world-cup-smashes-global-ratings-records-1221957\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003ebroken television records\u003c/a\u003e all around the world.

Today, FIFA still offers the men\u0026#8217;s World Cup $410 million more in prize money than it awards the Women\u0026#8217;s World Cup \u0026#8212; a gap that actually \u003ca href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/fifa-sexism-womens-soccer-world-cup-pay-gap-15f87f13d2b0/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003ewidened\u003c/a\u003e just last year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd, according to Dan Wetzel of \u003ca href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/wheres-fifa-failing-to-promote-a-fun-highquality-womens-world-cup-thats-where-162128913.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eYahoo Sports\u003c/a\u003e, FIFA clearly didn\u0026#8217;t invest in much marketing this year in France \u0026#8212; nor did it require France to spend its own money to market the event it was hosting. In Paris, away from the stadium, there was reportedly little advertising showing that the Women\u0026#8217;s World Cup was happening, even before the marquee France vs. United States quarterfinal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;There are few billboards, signs, banners or pretty much anything else touting the event.

While the human-interest angles are always worth highlighting, that\u0026#8217;s often the only media that these women receive \u0026#8212; and they\u0026#8217;re told to be grateful for whatever they get.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#8217;s a tragedy that so many of the women who leave the World Cup stage don\u0026#8217;t have thriving professional leagues to return home to. The National Women\u0026#8217;s Soccer League (NWSL) is the most successful women\u0026#8217;s pro soccer league in the history of the United States, but it is only in its seventh season, and there, the minimum player salary is $16,538, and the maximum salary is $46,200.

In China, only recently have teams in the Chinese Super League been required to have a women\u0026#8217;s team in operation by 2020. It was \u003ca href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/real-madrid/story/3885327/real-madrid-approve-womens-team-for-2020\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003ejust about a week ago\u003c/a\u003e that Real Madrid, the most decorated men\u0026#8217;s club in Europe, confirmed that it will have a women\u0026#8217;s team in competition next season.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#8217;s a tragedy that women have to play at the World Cup with so much pressure on their shoulders. When men\u0026#8217;s teams don\u0026#8217;t qualify for the World Cup, or when they fail to play their best on the biggest stage of the sport, it\u0026#8217;s heartbreaking for them, but it\u0026#8217;s rarely a threat to the very future of their sport. They don\u0026#8217;t have to earn respect and investment from their federations or sponsors or FIFA itself every time they step on the field; they don\u0026#8217;t have the pressure of proving, with every kick and every save, whether their sport is deserving of attention. For the women, every bad game is an indictment on their gender, every controversy a potential excuse for investors to back away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026#8217;s legitimate hope to be had that this Women\u0026#8217;s World Cup could be a turning point \u0026#8212; the sport feels so much farther ahead than it was even just four years ago. But so many turning points for women\u0026#8217;s soccer \u0026#8212; and women\u0026#8217;s sports as a whole \u0026#8212; have actually just been U-turns in disguise. In the meantime, the tragedy is the generations of girls whose talent went without being nurtured; the toxic patriarchal structures that have been allowed to persist, untouched; and the money and power and fame that has been denied to women from all over the world, just because men wanted to hoard it all for themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis Women\u0026#8217;s World Cup was a giant step forward, and it was only made possible because of the women who carried themselves through wastelands of empty promises and sexist comments and abusive actors and dismissive fools to this place of prestige. But, as we celebrate these steps and the women who got the sport to this point, never forget: By now, the sport should be flying.\t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"promo amp-wp-article-promo\"\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"post__figure post__figure--format-full\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"post__thumbnail\"\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003ca href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/membership/?c=cr042018-7-00-wp\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cimg width=\"2917\" height=\"2038\" src=\"https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/membership-graphic_2.03-1.png?w=2917\u0026amp;h=2038\u0026amp;crop=1\" class=\"attachment-full size-full\" alt=\"\" data-attachment-id=\"1142474\" data-permalink=\"https://thinkprogress.org/membership-graphic_2-03-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/membership-graphic_2.03-1.png?w=2917\u0026amp;h=2038\u0026amp;crop=1\" data-orig-size=\"2917,2038\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{\u0026quot;aperture\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;credit\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;camera\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;created_timestamp\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;copyright\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;focal_length\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;iso\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;shutter_speed\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;title\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;orientation\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;}\" data-image-title=\"membership graphic_2.03\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/membership-graphic_2.03-1.png?w=2917\u0026amp;h=2038\u0026amp;crop=1\" data-large-file=\"https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/membership-graphic_2.03-1.png?w=2917\u0026amp;h=2038\u0026amp;crop=1\" draggable=\"false\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1920px) 1920px,(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1920px) 1920px,(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1024px) 1024px,(min-width: 512px) and (max-width: 1024px) 1024px,(min-width: 512px) and (max-width: 768px) 768px,(max-width: 512px) 512px,(max-width: 768px) 768px,2917px\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/membership-graphic_2.03-1.png?w=1920\u0026#038;crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C1341px\u0026#038;ssl=1 1920w,https://i1.wp.com/thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/membership-graphic_2.03-1.png?w=1024\u0026#038;crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C715px\u0026#038;ssl=1 1024w,https://i1.wp.com/thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/membership-graphic_2.03-1.png?w=768\u0026#038;crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C537px\u0026#038;ssl=1 768w,https://i1.wp.com/thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/membership-graphic_2.03-1.png?w=512\u0026#038;crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C358px\u0026#038;ssl=1 512w,https://i1.wp.com/thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/membership-graphic_2.03-1.png?w=2917\u0026#038;crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C2038px\u0026#038;ssl=1 2917w\" /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/a\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n","url":"https://thinkprogress.org/the-tragedy-of-the-womens-world-cup/","published":"2019-07-07T12:00:52Z","guid":"https://thinkprogress.org/?p=1147880"},{"title":"Elizabeth Warren goes on the attack against Neil Gorsuch’s first major decision","content":"\u003cp\u003eNeil Gorsuch\u0026#8217;s first major opinion, after he gained control of a Supreme Court seat that Senate Republicans held open for a year until President Trump could fill it, was a decision allowing employers to force their workers to sign away their right to sue their employer.

or forests that are then preserved. But there's a large cache of carbon in a form that's not especially permanent: the wood we use in our buildings and other structures. Some of that lumber has been in place for hundreds of years, while other bits of wood are used temporarily and then burnt or left to decay, which rapidly releases their sequestered carbon back into the atmosphere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo it shouldn't surprise you that figuring out how much carbon ends up sequestered through our use of wood products is not a simple task. Undaunted, Craig Johnston and Volker Radeloff of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, \u003ca href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1904231116\"\u003ehave decided to tackle it\u003c/a\u003e. By viewing that carbon as a pool that's being drained and filled at the same time, they find that the total sequestered carbon is tiny—and subject to rapid changes based on political and economic factors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eInto the woods\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe secret to tracking this pile of carbon is to recognize that we're never going to have a full inventory of lumber that was put in place a century or more ago. But that lumber is going to be an ever-shrinking portion of the material that was put in place more recently. Thus, if we can track the production of lumber (and other wood products) over the decades for which we have good data (1960 and beyond), then we have a decent sense of the total inputs to this sequestered carbon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1531773#p3\"\u003eRead 7 remaining paragraphs\u003c/a\u003e | \u003ca href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1531773\u0026comments=1\"\u003eComments\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"feedflare\"\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=lgM_hdiz34g:JbvVU8iz1TY:V_sGLiPBpWU\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=lgM_hdiz34g:JbvVU8iz1TY:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=lgM_hdiz34g:JbvVU8iz1TY:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=lgM_hdiz34g:JbvVU8iz1TY:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=lgM_hdiz34g:JbvVU8iz1TY:qj6IDK7rITs\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=lgM_hdiz34g:JbvVU8iz1TY:yIl2AUoC8zA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","url":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1531773","published":"2019-07-07T14:00:20Z","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1531773"},{"title":"Fixing the past: The art of collecting pinball machines","content":"\u003cdiv id=\"rss-wrap\"\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ca name=\"page-1\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n      \u003cul class=\"gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide\"\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n        \u003cdiv class=\"gallery-item-content\"\u003e  \n        \u003cdiv class=\"gallery-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/IMG_1784-980x653.jpg\" alt=\"\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n        \u003cp\u003e\n          Inside this concrete slab hides the biggest collection of the rarest pinball and electromechanical games ever made.

The major manufacturers have moved from creating pinball machines to slot machines for casinos, a business with a much rosier future. With even larger arcades only sporting one or two pinball machines, most likely emblazoned with licensed artwork from a popular movie or TV show, enthusiasts of the game are forced to look backward for their joy, not forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pinball has seen a steady decline since the 90s. Chicago used to have many manufacturers that cranked out thousands of games each year. In the 80s and 90s, video games became popular and pinball sales suffered,\" Karl Marsicek explained to Ars. He knows a little bit about the lost art of pinball: his basement houses a collection of machines he has bought and restored. \"There is only one manufacturer left, Stern Pinball. They put out about 4 or 5 new titles each year, just a fraction of what manufacturers were cranking out in Pinball’s glory days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a hobby, collecting and restoring pinball machines is tough. The machines are loud, large, heavy, and expensive. The problem is, if you can't play a game at your local arcade, the only place left is your own basement. \"The many machines that were produced in the '80s and '90s have reached the end of their life cycle and are disappearing from bars and pizza joints,\" Marsicek said. \"Strip mall arcades are just about extinct because of computer games and gaming consoles. So pinball machines are getting hard to find.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2009/07/fixing-the-past-the-art-of-collecting-pinball-machines/#p3\"\u003eRead 22 remaining paragraphs\u003c/a\u003e | \u003ca href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2009/07/fixing-the-past-the-art-of-collecting-pinball-machines/\u0026comments=1\"\u003eComments\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"feedflare\"\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=BsRQPq0pDUA:PsJmR7M5AgI:V_sGLiPBpWU\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=BsRQPq0pDUA:PsJmR7M5AgI:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=BsRQPq0pDUA:PsJmR7M5AgI:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=BsRQPq0pDUA:PsJmR7M5AgI:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=BsRQPq0pDUA:PsJmR7M5AgI:qj6IDK7rITs\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=BsRQPq0pDUA:PsJmR7M5AgI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","url":"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2009/07/fixing-the-past-the-art-of-collecting-pinball-machines/","published":"2019-07-07T13:05:18Z","guid":"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2009/07/fixing-the-past-the-art-of-collecting-pinball-machines/"},{"title":"Guidemaster: Fitness trackers to consider before buying a smartwatch","content":"\u003cdiv id=\"rss-wrap\"\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"intro-image intro-left\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/fitbitinspireHR10-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"Fitbit's Inspire HR fitness tracker on a wrist.\"\u003e\u003cp class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/fitbitinspireHR10.jpg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"1080\" data-width=\"1620\"\u003eEnlarge\u003c/a\u003e \u003cspan class=\"sep\"\u003e/\u003c/span\u003e A different band can change the entire look of the Inspire HR.

Something that belittles, dehumanizes, and/or argues against the freedom and agency of a whole category of people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou add your voice to the furious chorus in response. How can you not? These people may never understand how wrong they are, they\u0026#8217;re too ignorant and wedded to their idiocy for that, but they need to know that they are opposed, and their opponents are legion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe all know what you mean when you say \u0026#8216;these people.\u0026#8217; The ones who voted for those awful faces on every news site and TV channel, the ones whose names alone cause you to clench with fury.

More than you could have imagined in your worst nightmares five years ago, but still, only some. Others may be prisoners of their upbringing, or their ignorance, or victims of their own hardships, lashing out wildly. But what they all seem to have in common is an incapacity for compassion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#8217;s easy to distance yourself from Them. It\u0026#8217;s hard not to. The overwhelming majority of the people with whom you actually interact are Us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou know you should try to feel compassion for Them, as you should for everyone. Not sympathy. Sympathy is very different. But your religion, or your spirituality, or your morality, or simply your belief, teaches you compassion for all.

That there are no longer people with whom one can reasonably disagree. That there are now only Us, and Them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou realize when you think about it that this makes it easier to give people who are notionally Us a pass when they too behave with a flagrant lack of compassion, or judge people\u0026#8217;s whole lives by their worst moments, or prioritize the purity of the process they have decreed over any actual results accomplished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou realize that the growing abyss between Us and Them makes both sides close ranks, makes it harder for people who are Them and yet who have uneasy, even horrified feelings about what\u0026#8217;s happening at the border in their name, to at least speak against it. They should anyway. Of course they should. But people are weak. The easier something becomes, the more that people do it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou understand, on some level, that the online divide is different from the awful things actually happening offline. That the latter matters, deeply, and the former \u0026#8230; not so much. That the former distracts both sides from great systemic injustices which have learned to lie hidden in bland terminology, coolly steering clear of the outrage of Us versus Them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut you slept poorly, you\u0026#8217;re exhausted, and you already have so much to do, so many duties to attend to at your frustrating job, so many worries to keep at bay, once you get out of this bed. Maybe all that is because of those systemic injustices, but those are a rot, those are cancer, those are bone-deep, and the evils at the border are an open wound about which something must done immediately. They are responsible for those evils. They must be fought and stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo you add your voice to the furious chorus. And you give more money to those fighting the real fight at the border, because you know that\u0026#8217;s what\u0026#8217;s actually important.

The first time, when he’d talked to McAllister’s boss — NASA’s administrator, the head honcho — it took ninety minutes to get through. When he gave the same talk to NASA’s advisory groups, then the mission directorates and the staff offices, he’d gotten down to a tight twenty. Then one day they’d put him in front of a 3-D camera and told him he would be speaking directly to the president of the United States. That time he’d been given five minutes. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"PQd4KJ\"\u003eNow he was giving the talk one last time. They promised. He was still a ball of nerves as he headed to classroom six at JPL and loaded all his files into the screen on the podium. Whom could they possibly be bringing in this time? The secretary-general of the UN? The classroom could hold 120 people. Today only four came in and sat down in the big stadium-style chairs. Two of them sat down in the middle rows, a couple of seats apart from each other. A Southeast Asian woman in a cardigan and some military guy with tons of medals on the front of his uniform. He took his hat off and carefully sat it on the seat next to him. Sunny caught the woman’s eye and smiled. She gave him back a very fast, tight little smile, then leaned forward and hugged her knees, as if she was very nervous. Maybe she had some idea of what he was going to say. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"KWM7JJ\"\u003eTwo more people came in and sat down in the front row. Roy McAllister and a middle-aged woman wearing a pair of cheap AR sunglasses. It took Sunny a minute to realize whom he was looking at. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"TkEIe2\"\u003e“Wait,” he said. “ Wait — she’ s — you’ re —” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"FSFQQN\"\u003e“Clearly you recognize Ms. Jansen,” McAllister said. “So let me introduce you. Everyone, this is Sunny Stevens. He’s an astrophysicist working in our Planetary Science Directorate. He may look young, but don’t let that fool you. He’s well on his way to his first Nobel. Most likely for the discovery he’s going to tell you about today.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"xBXmT9\"\u003eSunny nodded, barely listening. It was her. Sally Jansen, looking right at him. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"drq9mV\"\u003eThe woman who’d killed Blaine Wilson. The woman who’d lost the race for Mars. What the hell was she doing here? This was top-secret stuff, not meant for every washed-up astronaut NASA could drag in off the street — \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"WJeJ5D\"\u003e“We’re a bit tight on time, Dr. Stevens,” McAllister said. “Perhaps we could . . . ?” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ZnbGUK\"\u003eSunny nodded and exhaled deeply. He was a little thrown, but he could do this. He knew it all by heart. He just wished — he wished Jansen would take those sunglasses off. Who still wore AR sunglasses? Everybody in his generation just used an earring or a nose ring as their device. The sunglasses made it impossible to see her eyes. To know what she was thinking. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"dUjJQj\"\u003eStill, she was just one more person he needed to convince. Sunny knew what was at stake with these presentations. He tapped the screen on the podium and got started. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Qxwy7f\"\u003eLight bloomed above them as an AR image formed, pixels coalescing out of the air. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"1LYoxc\"\u003e“This,” he said, gesturing at the air above their heads, “is an object called 1I/2017 U1. Also known as ‘Oumuamua, which is a Hawaiian word meaning ‘first messenger.’ ” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"nzmdNF\"\u003eIn augmented reality the object turned lazily on its short axis. It didn’t look like much, honestly. It was a cigar-shaped lump of rock, a dull red in color. The image was heavily pixelated. “We never got a really good look at it. It came into the solar system way back, in 2017, long before I was born, and, uh . . .” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"TdRDz0\"\u003eIt occurred to him that some of the people listening to him were old enough to remember 2017. They sat there looking like lumps of rock themselves. He brushed off the thought and went on. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"JrxraA\"\u003e“It was just another rock, right, a piece of space debris, not even big enough to worry about.” Scale bars appeared around the image, showing that ‘Oumuamua was thirty-five meters across and 230 long. “They couldn’t even figure out what it was, back then. Whether it was an asteroid or a comet. There was one thing about it, though, that got a lot of attention. It didn’t come from our solar system.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"DKdM57\"\u003eThe image zoomed out to show the track ‘Oumuamua had taken around the sun. It dove out of deep space almost perpendicular to the plane of the ecliptic — the plane around the sun’s equator where all the planets orbited. Moving very, very fast it swung around the sun, looping around to shoot off at a new angle that sent it past the inner planets and then, eventually, back out into deep space. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"WmnVys\"\u003e“We still don’t know where it came from. Maybe somewhere around the star Vega. But yeah — it came from out there. Out there in the galaxy.” As he warmed up, Sunny had to fight the urge to bounce up and down on the stage. This is where it got very interesting. “It passed through interstellar space — it might have been out there for a hundred thousand years or more. Then it very briefly passed through our solar system before heading back out into the dark. Our telescopes weren’t great back then, and we barely got a look at it. But it changed — well, a whole lot of things in astronomy. It made us really think, for the first time, about what else was out there.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"9jYqSs\"\u003eHe tapped the screen, and ‘Oumuamua’s path traced a white curve around the sun. He tapped the screen again, and a second curve appeared. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"d0Zl64\"\u003e“In astronomy, if you see one specimen of a new type of object, you know you’ll find more of them if you look. The universe is so big there are very few unique things in it. We had to assume it wasn’t the only interstellar rock out there. Back in ’17, KSpace was still working on launching their first rocket, but already they had a strong interest in astronomy. They set up a radio telescope survey to look for more I objects. About three years ago I took over that project. Specifically, I created a new search pattern that focused on the part of the sky where ‘Oumuamua originated. I figured if one rock came from that direction, maybe more of them would come from the same place. It turns out I was right.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"24q76T\"\u003eThe second white curve traced almost exactly the same arc as the first. “This is 2I/2054 D1.” He couldn’t help but beam out at his sparse audience. “My baby.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"hmOMDG\"\u003eHe turned and watched the white curves, entranced as always by the cosmic duet. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ITtyrS\"\u003e“If ‘Oumuamua was weird, so was 2I, and in all the same ways. It has the same deep-red color. It’s the same basic cigar shape, about eight times as long as it is wide. That was enough to pique my interest. But then I used a light curve analysis to get a better idea of its size.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"1E5xv6\"\u003eA graphic representation of ‘Oumuamua appeared as a small spindly shape floating in front of the screen. A tiny blur of low-resolution pixels. 2I appeared above it — and dwarfed it. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"AHmSyZ\"\u003e“2I is about three hundred and fifty times bigger than ‘Oumuamua. Identical in almost every single way, except on a massively larger scale. I’ve estimated it’s about ten kilometers across and eighty kilometers long. And it’s currently headed toward us, eating up twenty-six kilometers every second.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"c6IHWy\"\u003eSally Jansen coughed for his attention. “That sounds fast,” she said. “Too fast.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"A32wiN\"\u003eSunny gave her a tentative smile. At least she was paying attention. “Oh yeah,” he said. “And that’s why 2I is super interesting. Both of them, ‘Oumuamua and 2I, they came at us about the same speed. Interstellar speed, call it. Most comets, even the really fast ones, top out at about five kilometers per second. The fastest spacecraft ever built — \u003cem\u003eVoyager 2 \u003c/em\u003e— is moving about fifteen kilometers a second. There’s one difference, though. Comets and planets and everything natural will keep the same speed pretty much forever, right? We know the laws of physics, and how they apply to big, dumb objects moving through space. ‘Oumuamua followed all those rules. It came in super fast. Then it sped up as it swung around the sun, which makes sense; it used the sun’s gravity to get the slingshot effect, to speed itself up. Originally,” he said, pointing at the white curves above his head, “we thought 2I would do the same thing. Swing around the sun, build up a good head of steam, and head back out for the stars, so fast we would barely get a look at it. That’s what I was expecting — what everybody was expecting.

The last time I checked, it was down to about twenty-one kilometers per second, and it’s still slowing. It shouldn’t be doing that. I mean, there are reasons why an astronomical body might decelerate, sure. Drag or a collision with another object or . . . whatever, but none of them fit. 2I wasn’t acting like a normal space rock, but what did that mean? Then it went and answered the question for us. It changed course.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"vuhT7H\"\u003eOn the screen the white curve bent inward on itself, moving away from the sun. “With no physical explanation, it started moving in a direction we didn’t expect.” The white curve made a delicate, graceful arc toward the plane of the ecliptic — and the orbits of the planets. One planet in particular. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"mK4la6\"\u003e“It’s headed towards Earth,” Stevens said. “If it continues on its present course and deceleration, in about six months it’ll pass inside the orbit of the moon.

In other words, less than Earth’s escape velocity. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"c3O13l\"\u003e“To me,” Sunny said, “this looks like a classic Hohmann transfer orbit.” He waved at the screen, and the trajectory continued as a dashed line. The view zoomed in so they could see the curve bending around the surface of Earth. “This is just speculation, but I’m thinking it’s going to eventually execute another course correction, one using very little delta-v. A minimum expenditure of thrust. With just a little nudge, it could enter a polar orbit of the Earth.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"gf6SvJ\"\u003eJansen leaned forward in her seat.

We used the most powerful radio transmitters in the world to send the signals, repeating the message hundreds of times a day. There was no response, not even an acknowledgment that the aliens had got our call. We needed to know — as soon as physically possible — what its intentions were. It wasn’t an academic question. It was possible that 2I intended to take up orbit around Earth. It was also possible it was sent to crash right into us. An object that large, moving at that velocity, would wipe out all life on the planet. I took Dr. Stevens’s presentation to every government scientific and political body that would listen.

That very particular vibe has become a franchise hallmark, and nowhere is it more apparent than in the recent \u003cem\u003eDevil May Cry 5\u003c/em\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/6/18252281/devil-may-cry-5-review-ps4-xbox-pc\"\u003ewhich exudes wonderfully ridiculous action\u003c/a\u003e.

It recently launched on the Nintendo Switch, and I’ve been slowly making my way through its blood-drenched castle. (The game’s brief missions, which usually last around 20 minutes each, make it a great fit for portable play.) There’s a lot that’s still immediately recognizable as \u003cem\u003eDMC\u003c/em\u003e: the slick swordplay, enemies like giant spiders and flying skulls, and yes, those leather jackets. But what’s stood out to me the most is how \u003cem\u003edifferent\u003c/em\u003e the game feels from its successors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"c-float-right\"\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"OPItSI\"\u003e\u003cdiv data-anthem-component=\"aside:8647200\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"xmz6Qo\"\u003eFirst, it’s important to know a little bit of history. \u003cem\u003eDevil May Cry\u003c/em\u003e didn’t actually start life as a slick new action game from Capcom. It was initially the next \u003cem\u003eResident Evil\u003c/em\u003e, before the team decided to switch directions and turn it into something new. This context makes it especially fun to play now; you can see the tension between what the game started as and what it really wants to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"dvAwqP\"\u003eAs always, you play as Dante, a demon hunter who runs a demon hunting business called Devil May Cry. This leads him to a mysterious island that’s home to a giant castle infested with all manner of horrors. And really, the castle feels like something from a \u003cem\u003eResident Evil\u003c/em\u003e game. It’s incredibly complex, with all kinds of rooms and doors locked behind cryptic puzzles. One minute you’re in a library, the next you’re plummeting down to a terrifying basement. There are ornate sculptures everywhere. And the whole experience has a very cinematic feel, thanks to the \u003cem\u003eResident Evil\u003c/em\u003e-style fixed camera angles, which lend everything a sense of gravitas.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cfigure class=\"e-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg alt=\"Devil May Cry\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/54cPzWhuNZJhFQCKonWpxelYPKw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18278815/Devil_May_Cry_Switch_Screens03.jpg\"\u003e\n  \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"m5c4p3\"\u003eOf course, that sense of familiarity starts to change as soon as you start playing. In its early days, the\u003cem\u003e Resident Evil\u003c/em\u003e series was somewhat infamous for its stiff, slow controls. Moving around Raccoon City as Jill Valentine was a laborious process that led to the term “tank controls.” Dante, in contrast, moves with speed and grace. He can fire guns in the air and then land with a satisfying crash of his sword. As you fight, the game will even rate you; spam the same attack repeatedly and you’ll be called “dull.” But chain together a series of moves and you’ll be known as “stylish.” The combat is constantly changing as you unlock new weapons and powers, adding more options to your repertoire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"LYwjRc\"\u003eIt’s in the combat that you can really see the game trying to push beyond its roots. While Dante is incredibly mobile, he’s often stuck fighting in cramped hallways or tiny rooms. Sometimes those perfectly chosen fixed camera angles will obscure an enemy, or shift jarringly if you accidentally move into a new area. The action is still incredible even today, but it often feels constrained.

Larry Hopkins, the Patriots’ leader, was arrested and charged in the U.S. District Court of New Mexico with being a felon in possession of firearms. News reports suggested a cause-and-effect relationship between the immigrant roundup and the arrest. “This militia group detained migrants at the border,” a \u003ca href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/22/us/united-constitutional-patriots-what-we-know/index.html\"\u003eCNN headline read\u003c/a\u003e. “Then their leader got arrested.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut while outrage generated by the video may have driven the government to arrest Hopkins, the charge against him has nothing to do with kidnapping terrified people and their children at gunpoint. In fact, the charge against Hopkins relates to an incident that occurred more than 18 months earlier, when FBI agents found the militia leader with a cache of weapons and suspected him of plotting to kill Democratic Party leaders and funders. At the time, federal officials chose not to charge Hopkins. The FBI and the Justice Department declined to comment about the investigation or the timing of Hopkins’s prosecution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHopkins’s case is emblematic of how the FBI and federal prosecutors often treat right-wing extremists, ignoring offenses or bringing lesser charges for crimes that would almost certainly result in aggressive federal prosecutions if they were committed by other types of extremists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTake the case of Christopher Daniels, an African-American gun rights advocate, who came to the FBI’s attention around the same time Hopkins did. The FBI raided both men’s homes within months of each other and, in both cases, found weapons they had reason to believe should not have been there. But in Hopkins’s case, the FBI decided merely to confiscate the guns and wait 18 months before doing anything else, whereas in Daniels’s, the FBI quickly arrested him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Hopkins remained free to terrorize immigrants, Daniels was jailed for five months, losing his home and his job.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe primary difference between them wasn’t just race, but ideology. Federal agents appeared to make a clear decision to view Hopkins, a right-wing militia leader, as less dangerous than Daniels, a supposed “black identity extremist.” The term was coined by the FBI Counterterrorism Division to describe a supposed ideology based on the theory that police brutality against African-Americans justifies retaliatory violence. Critics have questioned whether \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/03/23/black-identity-extremist-fbi-domestic-terrorism/\"\u003e“black identity extremism” exists at all\u003c/a\u003e, describing it as “fiction” and “fantasy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis double standard is common in federal prosecutions.

Since the 9/11 attacks, just 34 right-wing extremists have been charged under anti-terrorism laws, compared to more than 500 alleged international terrorists, according to The Intercept’s analysis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, if not for the video of the United Constitutional Patriots and the anger it sparked, Hopkins might never have been charged at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-bleed full-bleed width-auto' style='width: auto;'\u003e\n\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-257301\" src=\"https://prod01-cdn05.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/07/GettyImages-1132938325-1562103687.jpg\" alt=\"A member of United Constitutional Patriots New Mexico Border Ops militia team monitors the US-Mexico border in Anapra, New Mexico on March 20, 2019. - The militia members say they will patrol the US-Mexico border near Mt.

Daniels was not secretive about his interest in guns. He had co-founded two gun ownership organizations: one that promoted weapons training and community service, and another that advocated for citizens to carry firearms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut since Daniels had been convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence in Tennessee, agents believed that his possession of a gun would be illegal under federal law. While investigating Daniels after the Infowars video was posted, FBI agents learned that he was traveling to Detroit to attend a firearms training. Daniels was not hiding anything; in fact, agents discovered his plans because he’d posted flyers for the training on his Facebook page. The FBI then confirmed that Daniels had checked in a firearm for his flight to Detroit and his return flight to Dallas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Daniels returned from Detroit, the FBI raided his apartment and seized a .38 special handgun and an assault rifle with a fully loaded magazine, as well as ammunition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFBI agents normally wouldn’t concern themselves with someone like Daniels, but at his detention hearing, prosecutors leaned on “black identity extremism” as way of claiming that Daniels was dangerous. They submitted as exhibits inflammatory posts that Daniels — who goes by the name Rakem Balogun — \u003ca href=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.txnd.297615/gov.uscourts.txnd.297615.18.0_1.pdf\"\u003ehad written on Facebook\u003c/a\u003e.

The federal law prohibits defendants who have been convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence offenses — defined in the federal statute as the attempted use of physical force or threatened use of a deadly weapon — from possessing firearms.

Iran has the technical ability to build and operate advanced centrifuges that work faster but is barred from doing so under the deal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;For the enrichment we are using the same machines with some more pressure and some special technical work,\u0026#8221; he said. \u0026#8220;So we don\u0026#8217;t have an increase in the number of centrifuges for this purpose.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Kamalvandi stressed that Iran is able to continue enrichment \u0026#8220;at any speed, any amount and any level.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnriched uranium at the 3.67% level is enough for peaceful pursuits but is far below weapons-grade levels of 90%.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe decision to ramp up uranium enrichment came less than a week after Iran acknowledged breaking the deal\u0026#8217;s 300-kilogram (661-pound) limit on its low-enriched uranium stockpile. Experts warn higher enrichment and a growing stockpile narrow the one-year window Iran would need to have enough material for an atomic bomb, something Iran denies it wants but the deal prevented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe steps taken so far by Iran show it is more interested in applying political pressure than moving toward a nuclear weapon, said Daryl G. Kimball, the executive director of the Washington-based Arms Control Association. He said Iran would need at least 1,050 kilograms (2,315 pounds) of low-enriched uranium to make the core of a single nuclear bomb, then would have to enrich it to 90%.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;Iran is not racing toward the bomb as some allege but these are calibrated moves,\u0026#8221; Kimball told The Associated Press. However, \u0026#8220;if Iran and the United States remain on the current course, the agreement is indeed in jeopardy.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNetanyahu urged the international community to punish Iran for its decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;It is a very, very dangerous step,\u0026#8221; he said. \u0026#8220;I\u0026#8217;m asking you, not to provoke but out of joint knowledge of history and what happens when aggressive totalitarian regimes can cross the threshold toward things that are very dangerous to us all. Take the steps that you promised. Enact the sanctions.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, Kimball cautioned against that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;Iran is clearly not going to enter negotiations for a new deal if these sanctions are in place,\u0026#8221; he said. \u0026#8220;This a self-made, Trump administration crisis because it has been taking drastic measures to dismantle the (deal) without a

ambassador to the United States called President Donald Trump “uniquely dysfunctional” and expressed grave concerns about American economic and foreign policy in a series of cables that were leaked to

entirety of the Trump presidency, even touching on an official state visit to the UK less than a month ago, when the Trump and his family attended a banquet at Buckingham Palace and afternoon tea with

But these leaks may challenge whatever goodwill emerged from the US president’s visit. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"Eu1drL\"\u003eIn the documents, Darroch describes “vicious infighting and chaos” within the Trump administration, and said that collusion between Trump and “dodgy Russians” was possible. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"93Ne1V\"\u003eHe also warned that an “America First”-style foreign policy could undermine international trade agreements, and warned negotiations over Brexit could introduce further conflict into the two countries’ diplomatic relations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"K6gAJd\"\u003eTrump has endorsed Brexit in the past, and recommended the UK \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/6/2/18649406/donald-trump-uk-walk-away-brexit-state-visit\"\u003e“walk away”\u003c/a\u003e from the EU without a deal ahead of his state visit. After it leaves the European Union, the UK will need to renegotiate a number of its trade agreements, and could look to strengthen its trade ties with the US.

He also cautioned his government to be wary of believing Trump’s rationale for canceling the strike (the president said he decided against the attack after learning there would be civilian casualties). \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"BdKzVb\"\u003e“His claim, however, that he changed his mind because of 150 predicted casualties doesn’t stand up; he would certainly have heard this figure in his initial briefing,” Darroch wrote. “It’s more likely that he was never fully on board and that he was worried about how this apparent reversal of his 2016 campaign promises would look [during the 2020 election].”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"SslMdU\"\u003eDarroch also warned that the US president could still choose to strike Iran: “Just one more Iranian attack somewhere in the region could trigger yet another Trump U-turn.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"wkuWSW\"\u003eThis is something Trump has made clear himself; during an \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/6/23/18693546/iran-donald-trump-meet-press-drone-strike-nuclear-deal-no-preconditions\"\u003einterview with \u003cem\u003eMeet the Press\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e in late June, the president said, “If they do something else, it’ll be double.” During the same interview, Trump also said, “I’m not looking for war and if there is, it’ll be obliteration like you’ve never seen before.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"mjquNq\"\u003eOverall, Darroch described the president as “clumsy and inept,” and wrote, “I don’t think this Administration will ever look competent.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"6tqtYW\"\u003eIn spite of the concerns Darroch raised, he also assessed Trump as someone whom the UK can expect to complete his first term in full, writing that despite controversies, Trump will always “emerge from the flames, battered but intact, like [Arnold] Schwarzenegger in the final scenes of The Terminator.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"aakrcA\"\u003eIt is unclear who leaked the memos, and the White House has not yet commented on them, \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/07/world/europe/uk-ambassador-trump-leaks.html\"\u003eaccording to the New York Times\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"1y4fA6\"\u003eThis is not the first time that a communication from Darroch regarding the president has leaked.

In order for the plan to become law, it should be approved by the US House of Representatives and signed by the president. House Republican lawmakers Greg Pence and Ruben Gallego have recently presented a similar proposal to the House of Representatives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe legal reasons behind these revisions could be flawed though we have no access to the information contained in the legal case. However, those reasons could include the following:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eProvisions contained in the Supporting Victims of Iranian Terrorism Act 2019 to reform the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act 2012 could be seen as a factor to remove faults which have dismissed the Americans’ lawsuit against the Central Bank of Iran at the Luxembourg court. Granting personal jurisdiction to United States District Court for the Southern District of New York known as Mother Court can be aimed at removing one of these faults.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSince based on the Issue Preclusion rule it is forbidden to bring a closed case to the court again, victims of the 9/11 attacks (plaintiffs who have called for closed cases to be brought to court again) cannot file a lawsuit with the Luxembourg court simply by referring to the recent revisions of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act 2012. Therefore, the law has been reformed in favour of families of victims of the 1983 bombing at the US Marines base in Beirut as new plaintiffs. Not many US legislators as well as the Luxembourg court attribute the 9/11 attacks to Iran, which might have played a role in changing the plaintiffs in the case.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003col start=\"3\"\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eConclusion of the Iran- Luxembourg Investment Agreement to Defend New US Lawsuit\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Law on Mutual Encouragement and Support for Investment by the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Grand Duke of Luxembourg which had been presented to Iranian parliament as a bill on May 24, 2017 was approved on May 14, 2019 and was added to mutual agreements for encouragement and support of Iran’s investment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe preamble to the agreement states that the objective of the contract is to maintain the general balance of rights and obligations between investors and the government.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhether or not the Supporting Victims of Iranian Terrorism Act 2019 is approved or not, it needs an in-depth analysis to examine how this agreement will affect the way the new US lawsuit would be dealt with at the Luxembourg court. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the purchase of bonds by the Central Bank of Iran through the Clearstream Banking S.A. Company was in accordance with the terms of the Iran-Luxembourg contract.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConclusion\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy revising the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act 2012, those who presented the Supporting Victims of Iranian Terrorism Act 2019 seem to be aiming to set aside the Iranian Central Bank’s bonds of US origin with the prefix “US” for victims of the 9/11 attacks, and the bank’s bonds of European origins with the prefix “XS” for victims of the 1983 bombing of the US Marines base in Beirut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe US court has declared its jurisdiction over bonds of American origin with the prefix “US” belonging to the Central Bank of Iran and order their seizure. Iran’s objection to the court verdict is being reviewed at the International Court of Justice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegarding bonds of European origin with the prefix “XS,” the cause and subject of the lawsuit may extricate the Americans from the consequences of the Issue Preclusion rule as their previous lawsuits had been rejected at the Luxembourg court. However, the provisions of the Iran- Luxembourg investment agreement should be taken into account from now on in the possible court session in Luxembourg where the Americans’ lawsuit against bonds of European origin of the Central Bank of Iran would be reviewed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe post \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\"
